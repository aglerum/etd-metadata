         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this dissertation, we investigate the possibility to use scanning microscopy such as scanning capacitance microscopy (SCM) and scanning spreading resistance microscopy (SSRM) for the "atomistic" dopant profiling of semiconductor materials. For this purpose, we first analyze the discrete effects of random dopant fluctuations (RDF) on SCM and SSRM measurements with nanoscale probes and show that RDF significantly affects the differential capacitance and spreading resistance of the SCM and SSRM measurements if the dimension of the probe is below 50 nm. Then, we develop a mathematical algorithm to compute the spatial coordinates of the ionized impurities in the depletion region using a set of scanning microscopy measurements. The proposed numerical algorithm is then applied to extract the (x, y, z) coordinates of ionized impurities in the depletion region in the case of a few semiconductor materials with different doping configuration. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The numerical algorithm developed to solve the above inverse problem is based on the evaluation of doping sensitivity functions of the differential capacitance, which show how sensitive the differential capacitance is to doping variations at different locations. To develop the numerical algorithm we first express the doping sensitivity functions in terms of the Gâteaux derivative of the differential capacitance, use Riesz representation theorem, and then apply a gradient optimization approach to compute the locations of the dopants. The algorithm is verified numerically using 2-D simulations, in which the C-V curves are measured at 3 different locations on the surface of the semiconductor. Although the cases studied in this dissertation are much idealized and, in reality, the C-V measurements are subject to noise and other experimental errors, it is shown that if the differential capacitance is measured precisely, SCM measurements can be potentially used for the “atomistic” profiling of ionized impurities in doped semiconductors.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>It is a common knowledge that student achievement is a product of multiple individual and environmental factors. The literature developed various models to organize and explain the relationship between some of these variables and student learning which translates into student achievement. Yet, no comprehensive model is able to capture all possible variables. Student’s achievement is often related to student, classroom, and school factors. Teachers are an important factor in student achievement because they facilitate, manage and encourage student learning. Teacher professional development (PD) maintains an important role in developing teacher knowledge, skills and attitudes and consequently improve student performance.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Guided by Guskey’s Model for Teacher Change (1986), and Desimone’s proposed core framework for studying effects of professional development on teachers and students (2009), this research study examined overall professional development, and its association to grade 8 student math scores in the Kingdom of Bahrain. The research also examined six types of professional development, content, curriculum, pedagogy, critical thinking, pedagogy and assessment. The teacher professional development variables were examined through Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) using the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2003-2007-2011 eight-grade dataset for the Kingdom of Bahrain. The outcome variable was the TIMSS math score in these years.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The Ministry of Education also adapted a new professional development policy to encourage teachers in Bahrain to participate in PD. The research also examine the policy’s relationship to change in student achievement and to the change in PF programs in Bahrain.  Bahrain invests a fair amount of the educational budget in PD for teachers with the belief that PD is associated with student achievement. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Overall, the results of this study suggest that the overall professional development is positively associated to student achievement. Math content and math curriculum PD programs are associated to student achievement. Professional development in assessment, IT, pedagogy and critical thinking are not significant variables. Introducing the 2008 new professional development policy in the country to encourage more teachers to be involved in PD programs was not significant to student achievement. That suggests that investment in teacher professional development activities is a good investment, yet needs to be closely monitored and periodically evaluated.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The available information about strange excited mesons is limited and most of the observed states have been reported but not confirmed. While the low mass region (1.0 - 1.5 GeV) has been extensively studied in the past and states such as the K1(1270), K1(1400), and K*(1410) have been confirmed by a handful of experiments, little is known about the spin-parity structure of resonances in the higher K+ π+ π- mass region (1.5-2.0 GeV). Past experiments have used hadron beams to gain access to the K+ π+ π- system, and have provided extensive information about strange states that made mapping their spectrum possible. Except for the K*(892), none of the excited strange states has been photoproduced before. We perform a partial wave analysis on a photoproduced K+ π+ π-  system produced off a Λ baryon using the CLAS detector at Jefferson Lab. Using a photon beam incident of a liquid hydrogen target, we are able to reconstruct 16K events of the γ p -&gt; Λ K+ π+ π- topology. Results from initial data selection confirmed the dominance of two decay modes for a K+ π+ π- resonance: the K*(892)π+ and the ρ(770)K+. A PWA was carried out in the helicity formalism using the reflectivity basis in the isobar model to parametrize the decay amplitudes of the resonances. Resonating structures are found in the 1+S wave primarily coupling to K*(892)π+ with a mass of 1.35 GeV/c2 and to ρ(770)K with a lower mass structure around 1.33 GeV/c2 and a higher mass resonance around 1.73 GeV/c2. The 1-P also exhibited a significant resonating behavior with a mass of 1.43 GeV/c2 coupling primarily to the K*(892)π+ decay mode. Also observed, an enhancement around 1.49 GeV/c2 in the 2+D wave strongly coupling to K*2 (1430)π+, and an enhancement in the 2-S wave around 1.76 GeV/c2 coupling primarily to K*2 (1430)π+.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This thesis explores the experiences of a South Florida klezmer ensemble known as the Holocaust Survivor Band. The group was co-founded by Saul Dreier, then an 89-year-old resident of Coconut Creek, Florida, and Reuwen “Ruby” Sosnowicz, 85 years old at the time, a Delray Beach, Florida, resident, in April 2014. Dreier was inspired to form a musical ensemble of Holocaust survivors after reading about the death of pianist and fellow Holocaust survivor Alice Herz-Sommer. Ruby’s daughter Chana Sosnowicz joined the band as lead singer, and Holocaust survivor descendant Jeff Black joined as a guitar player. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In sum, I tell the story of the Holocaust Survivor Band, a contemporary musical ensemble representative of a historically significant era. I emphasize the group’s ability to represent the Holocaust era to present-day audiences. To demonstrate this, the ensemble’s experiences are portrayed through statements and information from the band members themselves, through descriptions in various articles and media, through my observations of their performances and rehearsals, and through my interpretations of all these source materials. Based on this content, I present some generalizations about the band’s significance. One of my more obvious conclusions is that the band serves as musical witnesses to the Holocaust by using their performances to remind people of the period and to share their life stories. As a result, the group contributes to the historical and collective memory of the Holocaust. This in turn can evoke nostalgic feelings within the band and audience, thus further establishing connections to the past. In addition, the band seeks to prevent genocide from happening again by promoting a message of peace in their music, particularly through their song “Peace for the World.” Most importantly, Dreier and Sosnowicz are finding joy in music again after not playing or performing for a long time. All of this exemplifies how the ensemble has impacted both its members and those around them.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has steadily increased in prevalence in recent years, with a current estimate of 1 in every 68 children eligible for such a diagnosis. Prevalence within the general population is reflected in the growing number of college and university students with ASD, with more students both registering for services than ever before – this does not include those who do not have a formal diagnosis or attempt to forge the academic journey without targeted support. College attrition rates are higher for college students with ASD than for neurotypical college students due to lack of previously available supports, along with characteristics of this population including challenges during periods of transition and difficulty adapting to social and behavioral norms. Academic library usage correlates to college retention for college students as a whole; however, no studies have yet been done to explore how college students with ASD use their academic libraries and, in turn, how this might play a role in their ultimate college success. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study is to explore the experiences of college students with ASD in academic libraries.  It seeks to understand their questions and concerns, as well as their experiences in utilizing the library and library resources. We know that individuals with ASD use the library, but there is little firsthand evidence to describe their experiences and barriers they face in accessing library services.  By addressing these concerns, campus libraries and librarians can ultimately help to support ASD student retention. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This exploratory study used a qualitative content analysis design to collect discussion board posts to the online forum Wrong Planet (wrongplanet.net). Wrong Planet, a robust forum with more than 80,000 members, was designed by individuals with ASD for individuals with ASD. Collecting these discussion posts allowed for an unobtrusive research design in which accounts from college students with ASD could be gathered and presented in their true, unedited language as they conversed with their peers in an unmediated online environment. Collecting data from this online forum was particularly important; there is evidence to support the hypothesis that individuals with ASD thrive in communicating online, as it removes some of the social barriers of face-to-face communication. Using the social model of disability studies, this study allowed for voices of students with ASD to be presented in their own words, not as mediated by parents, caregivers, or the perceptions of faculty and staff of their lived experiences. The social model also provides the framework in that librarians and libraries should be the ones to adapt services – not students with ASD adapting to suit neurotypical-centric services. Coding and analysis was both inductive and deductive and based on the research questions, emerging themes, and concepts from the Theory of Information Worlds. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Findings demonstrate that when students with ASD go to the library it is often for the same purposes as neurotypical students – to study. However, students with ASD especially describe using the library as an escape from sensory overload. This study’s findings reveal many contradictions that call for further research in this area. Students with ASD use the library as an auditory escape, yet many still find the library to be too loud or chaotic to suit their needs. They use the library for solitary pursuits, and yet many Wrong Planet members describe a longing for interaction. Wrong Planet members even provide one another with advice about initiating relationships with other library users, both platonically and romantically.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This work fills a gap within the literature, allowing college students with ASD the opportunity to describe their experiences in the academic library as never before. While there is a growing body of knowledge about children with ASD and the library, this is potentially the first glimpse into the experiences of college students in their academic libraries. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study has particularly important implications for the role of academic libraries in ASD college student retention. We know that there is a high rate of attrition for college students with ASD, and that academic library use correlates with college student retention. The findings from this study demonstrate that college students with ASD use the library for a variety of reasons, including for solitary study, as an escape from overwhelming sensory environments, and for pursuit of interests. Academic libraries can address these needs and uses, and adapt services and supports to better serve the needs of this growing student population, thus contributing to their ultimate college retention and success.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The focus on the quality of health care, both clinical and experiential, is becoming increasingly important to academics and managers alike as its impact on hospital performance is established. Accordingly, research on the topic is increasing at a rapid pace. The perspective taken in much of this research focuses predominantly on how both experiential quality (EQ) and clinical quality (CQ) impact hospital performance. The vast majority of studies, however, have treated EQ and CQ as orthogonal concepts. Recently, researchers have conceptualized overall quality as a combination of EQ and CQ. However, no studies have conceptualized quality as the balance between EQ and CQ. As a result, one area that is in need of further investigation is how hospitals’ EQ and CQ, in terms of their combined magnitude (EQ * CQ) and relative balance (|EQ - CQ|) impact hospital readmission rates and productivity. Although there is broad agreement that both EQ and CQ relate to performance, there is a lack of conceptual clarity about the extent to which hospitals’ performance is dependent on matching the magnitude of EQ and CQ  (|EQ - CQ|), or on the combined magnitude of the two (EQ * CQ). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	This research attempts to address this lack of clarity about the impact of EQ and CQ on hospital performance through the investigation of healthcare quality as two distinct but related dimensions. One relates to their combined magnitude, which is referred to in the literature as the “combined dimension of quality” (CD), while the other pertains to the balance between CQ and EQ, which is referred to in this dissertation as the “balance dimension of quality” (BD). By clearly differentiating between these two dimensions, the purpose of this research is to provide a more precise way to conceptualize and operationalize hospital quality, and establish a basis for investigating theoretically and practically important relationships and contingencies. Drawing a conceptual, operational, and empirical distinction between CD and BD, and examining their interaction, enables this research to provide greater insight into hospital quality. Hypotheses were developed to explore the effects of CD and BD on readmission rate and productivity as well as to test which type of quality, experiential or clinical, has the greatest impact on the outcome variables. This dissertation empirically analyzes how hospitals’ CQ and EQ, in terms of the combined magnitude (CQ * EQ) and relative balance (|CQ - EQ|), impact hospital performance through the use of secondary data on approximately 1900 U.S. acute care hospitals. Through the empirical unpacking of the quality construct into distinct dimensions, their main effects and interaction helps to explain previously unaccounted-for variance in hospital performance.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	In addition to EQ’s and CQ’s impact on performance, which is largely due to factors internal to each hospital, organization theory predicts the fate of organizations is contingent on the outcome of interactions between organizations and their environments. While organizations are at the same time embedded in and influencing their environments, it is likely that some environmental conditions pose greater challenges to the survival of the organization than do others. In this study, the organizational environment comprises three dimensions: complexity, munificence, and dynamism. To delve deeper into the uniqueness of CD and BD, as well as to evaluate the theoretical and practical usefulness of drawing a distinction between them, we posit that the relationships among quality (i.e., EQ and CQ) and performance (Readmission Rate and Productivity) are contingent on these three key environmental factors.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	This research provides strong empirical evidence that the relative balance of EQ and CQ (|EQ – CQ|) should be considered along with the combined magnitude (CQ * EQ). First, strong empirical support is provided for the benefit of minimizing the gap between experiential quality (EQ) and clinical quality (CQ). Specifically, allocating the appropriate amount of resources to balance the provision of EQ and CQ is essential in reducing a hospital’s readmission rate. Second, the results demonstrate that achieving high overall quality is necessary to both reduce readmissions and increase productivity, and illustrates the importance of achieving both high levels of, and a balance of, EQ and CQ, instead of overcommitting resources to one at the expense of the other. To further demonstrate the value of the aforementioned findings to practice, hospitals were split into two groups: those with EQ ranked higher than CQ (i.e., EQ-dominant), and vice versa (i.e., CQ-dominant). Interestingly, the results suggest that while EQ-dominant hospitals enjoy fewer readmissions, it comes at the cost of lower productivity. On the other hand, CQ-dominant hospitals appear to be more productive, at the cost of higher readmissions. The results suggest that hospitals should focus on increasing both EQ and CQ, while maintaining a close balance between the two.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The role of charge density in polyelectrolyte multilayer coatings used in 2-D cell culture was investigated in this dissertation. First it is important to comprehend that cells do not attach directly to surfaces, they attach to proteins adhered to surfaces. Surface charge density in polyelectrolyte films affects not only protein coverage, but also interferes with protein exchange (Vroman effect), highly charge surfaces favor irreversible absorption of non-adhesive proteins like albumin,  which directly affects cell behavior on these ultrathin films.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this investigation was to understand how teachers’ perceptions of how they changed during the initial years of teaching. Three middle and three high school teachers viewed thirty minutes of their internship video and answered seven open-ended teacher related questions during a telephone interview. All participants had at least three years of teaching experience, and represented North, Central, and South Florida. After the telephone interviews, the researcher transcribed the conversations which served as the principal data used in this study. Findings indicated that participants changed the most in dealing with classroom management, diagnosing and fixing classroom pedagogical tasks, and confidence in their teaching ability. Additionally, the directors had changed by performing administrative tasks more efficiently. Directors also suggested that preservice teachers could develop into effective teachers by participating in real-life teaching activities before and during the student internship.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Kaposi’s Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus (KSHV) is an oncogenic virus that has adapted unique mechanisms to modulate the cellular microenvironment of its human host. The pathogenesis of KSHV is intimately linked to its manipulation of cellular signaling pathways, including the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. We have previously shown that KSHV ORF45 contributes to the sustained activation of both ERK and p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK, a major functional mediator of ERK/MAPK signaling) during KSHV lytic replication. ORF45-activated RSK is required for optimal KSHV lytic gene expression and progeny virion production, though the underlying mechanisms downstream of this activation are still unclear. We hypothesized that the activation of RSK by ORF45 causes differential phosphorylation of cellular and viral substrates, affecting biological processes essential for efficient KSHV lytic replication. Accordingly, we observed widespread and significant differences in protein phosphorylation upon induction of lytic replication. Mass-spectrometry-based phosphoproteomic screening identified putative substrates of ORF45-activated RSK in KSHV-infected cells. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that nuclear proteins, including several transcriptional regulators, were overrepresented among these candidates. We validated the ORF45/RSK-dependent phosphorylation of several putative substrates by employing KSHV BAC mutagenesis, kinase inhibitor treatments, and/or CRISPR-mediated knockout of RSK in KSHV-infected cells.  Furthermore, we assessed the consequences of knocking out these substrates on KSHV progeny virion production. Importantly, we investigated the regulation of gene expression by ORF45-actvated RSK by performing RNA-seq of KSHV-infected cells. We show data to support that ORF45 regulates the translational efficiency of a subset of viral/cellular genes with complex secondary structure in their 5’ UTR.  One of the few viral substrates of ORF45-activated identified by our mass spectrometry analysis was ORF36. KSHV ORF36 encodes a serine/threonine viral protein kinase, which is conserved throughout all herpesviruses. Although several studies have identified the viral and cellular substrates of conserved herpesvirus protein kinases (CHPKs), the precise functions of KSHV ORF36 during lytic replication remain elusive. We report that ORF36 interacts with another lytic protein, ORF45, in a manner dependent on ORF36 kinase activity. We mapped the regions of ORF36 and ORF45 involved in their binding. Their association appears to be mediated by electrostatic interactions, since deletion of either the highly basic N-terminus of ORF36 or an acidic patch of ORF45 abolished the binding. Additionally, dephosphorylation of ORF45 protein dramatically reduced its association with ORF36. Importantly, ORF45 enhances both the stability and kinase activity of ORF36. Consistent with previous studies of CHPK homologs, we detected ORF36 protein in extracellular virions. To investigate the roles of ORF36 in the context of KSHV lytic replication, we employed BAC mutagenesis to engineer both ORF36-null and kinase-dead (KD) mutants. We found that ORF36-null/mutant virions are moderately defective in viral particle production and are further deficient in primary infection. In summary, our results uncover a functionally important interaction between ORF36 and ORF45, and indicate a significant role of ORF36 in the production of infectious progeny virions. Altogether, these data shed light on the mechanisms by which KSHV ORF45 manipulates viral and cellular kinase signaling to optimize lytic replication. The findings reported here have important implications for the pathobiology of KSHV and other diseases in which RSK activity is missregulated.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study is to understand public library users’ health information seeking behaviors and what factors may influence the intention of an individual to use the public library as their health information resource.  This study used the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) as the theoretical framework, which provided essential motivation and behavior factors, including Attitude toward seeking health information at the public library (ATT), Subjective Norm (SN), and Perceived Behavior Control (PBC). This study expanded on TPB to add the perceptions of the quality of health information and an individual’s health literacy level. These factors may indicate an individual’s intention to use the public library as a primary health information source. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this study, five hypotheses were measured and analyzed. Attitude (H1), Subjective Norm (H2), Perceived Behavior Control (H3), Perception of health information quality (H4), and Health literacy (H5) will independently influence the behavior intention to use the public library for health information.    </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>After IRB approval, a pilot study was conducted to determine the reliability and validity of the survey questions. The survey consisted of three parts: (1) questions about public library users’ behavior; (2) measurement of health information seeking behavior, questions related to the TPB variables and questions about the perception of the quality of health information, and health literacy; and (3) demographic information.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A purposive sampling method was used to select participants at public libraries. Based upon a population and racial balance, residents of five counties in Florida were selected to participate in a print survey that was administered at public libraries. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A total of 247 public library users participated in this study. There were 83 males (34%) and 164 females (66%). Participants’ ages ranged from 18 to 82 years old with an average age of 42. The majority of participants were non-Hispanic White (n=117, 44%) and non-Hispanic Black (n=94, 35%). That reflects the racial composition of the five counties. Hispanic (n=13, 5%) and Asian (n=15, 6%) were followed.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Structural Equation Modeling with Mplus (version 5) was used to analyze the five hypotheses.  The construct and validation of the SEM model showed the adequacy of the model. Goodness-Fix-Index, such as Comparative Fit Index (CFI), and Normed Fit Index (NFI) showed higher than .90. These GFI close to 1 indicated a good fit to the data. Badness-Fit-Index (BFI), such as Root Mean Square Error Approximation (RMSEA =.07), and Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR= .04) indicate this instrument is a good fit. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Overall two hypotheses were accepted. Subjective Norm (R2 = .39, p&lt;.01) (H2) and Perceived Behavior Control (R2 = .43, p&lt;.01 (H3) were supported. The Subjective Norm and Perceived Behavior Control influence the intention to use public library as individual’s health information sources. This means an individual’s family, friend, or co-worker may influence their intention and wiliness to use public library for their health information needs. Public library users also recognize that searching for health information is easy to do and they are confident about using health-related information services at the public library. Therefore, the public library may to promote their health information sources to the community more actively to introduce such resources. This outreach may increase the social aspect of health information at the public library. If more people believe the public library is a good place to seek health information, public library usage will grow.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Studies of rp-process nucleosynthesis in stellar explosions show that establishing the lowest l = 0 and l = 1 resonances is the most important step to determine reaction rates in the astrophysical rp– process path. In an experiment performed at the resolut radioactive beam facility of Florida State University, we studied the 25Al(d,n)26Si reaction in inverse kinematics to establish the spectrum of the lowest l = 0 and l = 1 resonances.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We observed 4 resonances in 26 Si at 5923 keV, 6357 keV, 6737 keV, and 7458 keV. We establish the lowest l = 0 resonance at 5.923 keV, 0.409 MeV above proton separation. The result is consistent with the previous experiment performed at FSU by Peplowski et al. however now with significantly larger statistics and detection of the heavy ion decay in coincidence with the proton. We determine upper and lower limits on Γ p and calculate the astrophysical reaction rate. We establish the proton density and temperature conditions in which galactic through the 25Al(d,n)26Sireaction path.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Clifford analysis is seen as the higher dimensional analogue of complex analysis. This includes a rich study of Clifford algebras and, in particular, monogenic functions, or Clifford-valued functions that lie in the kernel of the Cauchy-Riemann operator.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this dissertation, we explore the relationships between the harmonic components of monogenic functions and expand upon the notion of conjugate harmonic functions. We show that properties of the even part of a Clifford-valued function determine properties of the odd part and vice versa.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We also explore the theory of functions lying in the kernel of a generalized Laplace operator, the $\lambda-$Laplacian. We explore the properties of these so-called $\lambda-$harmonic functions and give the solution to the Dirichlet problem for the $\lambda-$harmonic functions on annular domains in $\Rn$.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Nearly 30 states have adopted or are transitioning to performance-based funding programs for community colleges that allocate funding based on institutional performance according to defined metrics. While embraced by state lawmakers and promoted by outside advocacy groups as a method to improve student outcomes, enhance accountability and ensure return on investment of public resources in higher education, limited research exists confirming the effectiveness of performance-based funding in meeting intended policy goals. The policy analysis examined performance-based funding programs administered in Florida as the status quo and Ohio as the policy alternative. Prompted by their Governors, both states recently developed new approaches to performance-based funding that move funding away from enrollment and tie substantial amounts to student outcomes. To provide a context for the policy analysis, the study chronicled the history of performance-based funding and accountability programs for higher education enacted by states and reviewed policymaking processes and influences. The study applied a multi-goal approach to compare the policy alternatives applied in each state. Although it is still too early to assess the effectiveness of the performance-based funding programs in both states, the review of both system and institutional level performance data and interviews with stakeholders in Ohio revealed little to no connection between the intended program goals and behaviors exhibited by colleges. Based on the study findings, policy recommendations were proposed to enhance the effectiveness of the performance-based funding program for the Florida College System.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Equatorial waves have been studied extensively due to their importance to the tropical climate and weather systems. Historically, their activity is diagnosed mainly in the wavenumber-frequency domain. Recently, many studies have projected observational data onto parabolic cylinder functions (PCFs), which represent the meridional structure of individual wave modes, to attain time-dependent spatial wave structures. The non-orthogonality of wave modes has yet posed a problem when attempting to separate data into wave fields where the waves project onto the same structure functions.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We propose the development and application of a new methodology for equatorial wave expansion of instantaneous flows using the full equatorial wave spectrum. By creating a mapping from the meridional structure function amplitudes to the equatorial wave class amplitudes, we are able to diagnose instantaneous wave fields and determine their evolution. Because all meridional modes are shared by some subset of the wave classes, we require constraints on the wave class amplitudes to yield a closed system with a unique solution for all waves’ spatial structures, including IG waves. A synthetic field is analyzed using this method to determine its accuracy for data of a single vertical mode. The wave class spectra diagnosed using this method successfully match the correct dispersion curves even if the incorrect depth is chosen for the spatial decomposition. In the case of more than one depth scale, waves with varying equivalent depth may be similarly identified using the dispersion curves.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The primary vertical mode is the 200 m equivalent depth mode, which is that of the peak projection response. A distinct spectral power peak along the Kelvin wave dispersion curve for this value validates our choice of equivalent depth, although the possibility of depth varying with time and height is explored. The wave class spectra diagnosed assuming this depth scale mostly match their expected dispersion curves, showing that this method successfully partitions the wave spectra by calculating wave amplitudes in physical space. This is particularly striking because the time evolution, and therefore the frequency characteristics, is determined simply by a timeseries of independently-diagnosed instantaneous horizontal fields. We use the wave fields diagnosed by this method to study wave evolution in the context of the stratospheric QBO of zonal wind, confirming the continuous evolution of the selection mechanism for equatorial waves in the middle atmosphere. The amplitude cycle synchronized with the background zonal wind as predicted by QBO theory is present in the wave class fields even though the dynamics are not forced by the method itself. We have additionally identified a time-evolution of the zonal wavenumber spectrum responsible for the amplitude variability in physical space. Similar to the temporal characteristics, the vertical structures are also the result of a simple height cross-section through multiple independently-diagnosed levels.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this Dissertation, I report parallel processing in the avian vocal premotor nucleus HVC.  First, I review historical ideas and recent evidence about the function of HVC.  HVC has historically been viewed as a distributed network, and it has been modeled as an associative chain.  Recent evidence shows that HVC intraconnectivity is biased along the rostral-caudal axis and that transecting HVC along the rostral-caudal axis does not disrupt singing.  This evidence casts doubt on the historical views of HVC organization.  Next, I explore the cytoarchitecture of HVC in order to determine whether distinct subregions within HVC exist.  I then ablate these subregions to determine their functional significance.  I find that the lateral portions of HVC encode the repertoire of song syllables, while the medial portions of HVC encode the sequence in which the syllables are sung.  Finally, I utilize reversible inactivation of these subregions to confirm their functions.  These results are the first evidence for parallel processing within the avian song control network and correspond with recent evidence for parallel processing in the neural control of human speech.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This dissertation asserts that members of Ile Asho Funfun, the Lucumí spiritual house at the center of the research, is comprised of members who have undergone the process of converting to the spiritual practice of Lucumí and, as such, have experienced tremendous personal transformation.  The author argues that the religious practice of Lucumí was introduced to African Americans through music and dance traditions in the 1940s by performing artists and that since that time music has been one of the foremost tools of conversion.  Among the theories asserted herein, the author develops the theory of reversion to describe the process of conversion from Christianity to Lucumí.  Borrowed from Islamic traditions that use the term to refer to a return to the natural state of awareness of the one true God, reversion here is viewed as a return to the religion of practitioners’ ancestors and to a set of practices that are innately a part of human understanding of the cosmos and Creator as well their place within the cosmos and with the Creator.  Furthermore, the author contends that process of reversion is ongoing, informed by Afrocentricity, and impacted by the constant expansion and contraction of the religion. These occur as individuals and the community adjust to life events while negotiating their identity as both African and American. This dissertation establishes the theories of expansion and contraction as the processes by which African practitioners of Yoruba-derived religions have always adapted their practices to the situation and environment. The author introduces these concepts as a more precise description of processes of adaptation than the more commonly cited concept of syncretism. The author both observed and practiced the religion for ten years prior to undertaking the research and did field work and ethnographic research for six years while studying for and writing this dissertation using a reflexive approach.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Andy Teirstein (b. 1957 in New York, NY) is a composer, performer, and producer who is passionate about the characteristics of folk music found at the root of different cultures around the world. Intrigued by the compositional style and folk song collection of Béla Bartók, Teirstein followed the same formula used by Béla Bartók to achieve many successful compositions. Teirstein traveled to Maramureş County in Romania and collected many traditional Eastern European tunes. During a trip around the United States, Teirstein composed a string quartet on American folk tunes. The use of these traditional folk tunes in these two compositions, Maramures  and Restless Nation, are analyzed in this treatise. Maramures, a concerto for viola and orchestra was written in 1997 (rev 2008), and the string quartet Restless Nation was composed in 2010. This treatise will present Teirstein’s approach to folk music from different parts of the world. It is important to study these pieces, bringing Teirstein’s music to wider audiences of performers and listeners, and keeping folk music alive and accessible to the world. The methodology and procedures for analyzing Teirstein’s pieces are performances of the works; formal analysis of rhythmic, melodic, and modal features, as well as an interview with the composer.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>ABSTRACT</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Since the early twentieth century, manufacturers and distributors of toxic products have sought to discredit research linking their products with disease. At the same time they conducted research designed to demonstrate minimal risks associated with their products. Much of this activity came about by or through corporate retained attorneys, whose endeavors are the subject of this dissertation. Such attorney involvement has allowed for shielding undesired results through the court-sanctioned attorney right to secrecy. In many cases, this legal participation and even management of medical research has changed the topography of the medical literature, distorting it toward the null hypothesis for disease potential of the subject materials. This is because attorneys, whether they are defense or plaintiff, only sought credible evidence for their position at trial or in regulatory practice, not the advancement of science. Furthermore, the distortion is primarily one-sided, toward the defense of toxic substances. This results from the virtually unlimited financial backing defense lawyers have from large corporations, while plaintiff counsel are almost uniformly reluctant to spend their own money.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	To date, only limited historical accounts about this attorney effort have been published, largely because of the veil of secrecy created by attorney privileges. This dissertation seeks to look behind the veil to examine the full range of legal activities in case studies of five substances—silica, tobacco, asbestos, chromium, and benzene. These activities include lawyers identifying, hiring, and controlling experts, preparing contracts for research that limited public disclosure, managing research, editing final research papers, harassing opposing experts, and manipulating regulations and workers’ compensation laws. This lifting of the veil is possible primarily through disclosures found in bankruptcies and legal proceedings, assets not normally considered by historians of science.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The activities of lawyers in manufacturing science had varying degrees of success as they evolved over the course of a century. During the early decades of the twentieth century, attorneys were largely successful in limiting victims’ recovery for silicosis and keeping it out of the public eye. Similarly, at first, cigarette and asbestos product manufacturers were successful in limiting litigation’s effect on the bottom line. However, a growing number of public health advocates and plaintiff attorneys brought these controversies increasingly into the public legal arena, resulting in massive settlements by the tobacco companies and bankruptcies of many asbestos product manufacturers. The settlements and bankruptcies also provided a treasure trove of documents, many of which detailed extensive involvement of lawyers in the manipulation of medical research. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	To date, chromium and benzene manufacturers, as well as certain asbestos product manufacturers, have been more successful in limiting damage through lawsuits and regulations. In part this is because of the newest evolution in research tactics. During the last two decades of the twentieth century, “Litigation Support Firms” began undertaking an increasing amount of the attorney-managed research. These companies worked hand in hand with attorneys, as they transformed the peer reviewed medical literature on toxic substances by publishing carefully structured industry friendly research (and reviews of past research) in peer-reviewed, but often industry controlled, journals. Even when researchers have been free to publish their findings, the approval was often subject to final approval of a report exclusively provided to the client. Thus, the public articles rarely disclosed any hazard. On occasion the researchers published the same data in slightly altered forms in two to four publications, thus slanting the entire balance of the peer review literature. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Attorney involvement in medical research is a fundamental problem in the production of medical knowledge. The ability to hide and manipulate science has delayed recognition of hazards such as silica, tobacco, asbestos, chromium, and benzene by decades. Today, it continues to skew the understanding of toxic substance diseases.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This thesis examines staged performances of traditional music in Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia. It includes the history of traditional performing groups in Ethiopia and their purposes, the continuities and changes in performance practices from the early twentieth century to the present day, and audience perceptions of these performances. Particular attention is given to the relationships between traditional musics and Ethiopian nationalism. In response to the rise of ethno-nationalism in the latter part of the twentieth century, the new government regime that came to power in 1994 employed ethnicity as an organizing principle of the state. The new constitution divided the nation into ethnically-based regions, and the current government promulgates a distinct brand of national rhetoric that attempts to appeal to Ethiopia’s diverse people groups and promote peaceful interethnic relations. Traditional music groups have played a role in this project. This thesis will examine how these groups reflect and shape ideas of the ideal Ethiopia and interact with state discourse. This research is based on fieldwork that I undertook from May 22 to July 1, 2015, during which I attended traditional music performances and interviewed musicians, administrators, and audience members. The opinions and sentiments of my interlocutors provide insights into some current perceptions of the government and ethnic allegiances as well as how traditional musics play a role in cultivating national pride and conceptualizing the Ethiopian nation.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This collection of poetry explores the intersections between devotion and loss, anger and guilt, grief and hope. While some poems are buttressed by straightforward narratives, others are more impressionistic. The poems strive for precision in language, simple musicality, and emotional resonance.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This collection also attempts a wide lens, a focus which looks outside of the speakers’ individual experience and interior emotionality, and toward the chaotic world in which a work like this is created. In developing my poetic stance, I’ve wrestled with Shelly’s claim that “poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world.” On the other hand, Auden admonishes that “poetry makes nothing happen.” There appears to be some middle ground between these sentiments, and I find my poetry exploring that mid-space. Studding the outskirts of the manuscript are poems about war and religion; environmental degradation and disaster; and the commonplace violence that is an ever increasing aspect of our country and world. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The title poem in the collection, which serves as a centerpiece for the work, is a meditation on memory as it pertains to the dementia suffered by the speaker’s father at the end of his life. This relationship reoccurs throughout the collection, and is the subject behind the emotional core of the thesis. More broadly, the notions of loss and endings permeate the other poems presented in the collection. The dissolution of relationships, and the guilt, regret, and anger that go along with these moments between people inform many of the manuscript’s poems. Images and ideas that point to disruption and instability are centrally figured.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Since everything is a text, if only we can learn how to read it, the prose poems in the dissertation manuscript Speak Universe are about interpretations, or rather, reinterpretations, or better still, productive misinterpretations of the texts of life. As such, these poems take up an isolated but empathic lyrical stance that often interchanges the watcher for the watched, to explore a metaphysics of alternative logic and holistic perception, and observe an ethics of modern life that deals with appetites, waste, and privilege. The goal of this work is to use the imaginary to improve the real, and the yearning arises from the repeated theme of the uneasily socializing self within an undefined spiritual world. Hence the title of this manuscript, Speak Universe.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Although response scholarship has continually called for a greater emphasis on context when analyzing instructors’ written commentary on student writing, textual analysis of written comments remains a primary direction for response research. Additionally, when context is accounted for, it is oftentimes done so in a rather reductive fashion, with a single contextual factor examined in relation to response or context approached in a solely theoretical fashion. As a result, discussions of the influence of context in response scholarship remain limited in scope and/or mostly theoretical. However, an increased attentiveness to context is not as easy as it appears. Since context is a rather opaque concept, and setting parameters for context is a difficult endeavor, this dissertation sought to provide a model for examining the context that surrounds response that focused on three primarily textual contextual factors—what I call (con)texts. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Chapter 1 examines the dilemma of context in response scholarship and reviews the literature on the influence of context on written commentary. Afterwards, a new model for contextual response scholarship is proposed, one that accounts for multiple contextual factors that share unifying characteristics. For this study, the three contextual factors under examination—assignment description/texts, student/teacher interactions, and grading materials—were primarily textual in nature, creating the (con)texts for the study. This study sought to examine the manner in which students articulated their interpretations and uses of their instructors’ written commentary in relation to the three (con)textual factors under examination.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	After introducing the new model for response scholarship, Chapter 2 delves into the details of the study and the methodology employed. The study focused on two composition classrooms, with three students participating from each classroom. The details of the participating instructors, participating students, and the classroom contexts—as well as the (con)texts within each classroom—are depicted. Furthermore, the methodological approaches, which primarily consisted of student interviews and discourse analysis, are discussed. In particular, the second half of the chapter focuses on the structure of the student interviews and the coding schemes employed to analyze the student interviews. The student interviews consisted of both unprompted—not directly addressing the (con)texts—questions and prompted—directly addressing the (con)texts—questions and were coded in two distinct fashions.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The empirical results of the study are presented in Chapter 3 with each of the student interview results being presented separately to begin the chapter. Following the results of each individual student’s interview, the results of the students in Jill’s (Instructor #1) class are compared along with the results of the students in Jack’s (Instructor #2) class. Finally, the results for all students in the study are presented.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Chapter 4 discusses the results of the study in a more nuanced, intricate fashion. This discussion is arranged by seven key findings that emerged from the study: 1) Each of the students in the study drew upon the (con)texts in order to help them interpret and use their instructor’s written feedback in a unique fashion; 2) Students’ answers to the unprompted questions demonstrated that they were less inclined to put the (con)texts directly in conversation with the teachers’ written responses until prompted to later in the interview; 3) During the unprompted portion of the interviews, the instructors’ written commentary frequently promoted student engagement with particular (con)texts; 4) Students used the assignment description/texts to understand how well they understood and executed the teachers’ expectations of the assignments as well as to gain a firmer understanding of what the expectations for the assignments were; 5) Student/teacher interactions—primarily face-to-face in conferences—played a pivotal role in how students articulated their interpretations and uses of instructors’ written feedback; 6) While the rubric or grading criteria had a more subtle influence, the actual paper grade had a substantial impact on students’ interpretations and uses of their instructors’ written commentary; and 7) The (con)texts frequently worked together as students articulated their interpretations and uses of their instructors’ written commentary.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	This dissertation concludes in Chapter 5 by revisiting the exigence for the study while also discussing delimitations and limitations for the study. Afterwards, implications for the study—both pedagogical and scholarly—are discussed in-depth and the necessity for greater attention to context in response scholarship is emphasized.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This document describes experimental research conducted with the objective of better understanding adults’ self-regulatory decision-making (e.g., study choice) process in reading for comprehension. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the extent to which individuals’ self-regulatory process may be influenced by ease-of-processing. On an exploratory basis, this study also investigated the extent to which metacognitive self-assessments of learning and self-efficacy beliefs in reading may potentially interact with ease-of-processing as a predictor of study choice. In the context of reading comprehension, ease-of-processing refers to the relative ease or difficulty of processing information. Metacognitive self-assessments of learning in this context refer to personal judgments of self-perceived learning (e.g., judgments of learning) in a reading task. Self-efficacy beliefs in reading refer to personal beliefs about one’s own self-perceived competence or skill as a reader. This research builds on a pilot study which found evidence to support the possibility that when reading an essay designed to be difficult to read, participants’ pre-existing self-efficacy beliefs in reading may influence participants’ subsequent study choices. The current research sought to extend these findings by more thoroughly examining the role of ease-of-processing in participants’ self-regulatory decision-making process while engaged in reading for comprehension. On an exploratory basis, judgments of learning and self-efficacy beliefs in reading were also examined regarding the extent to which these variables may moderate the relationship, if any, between ease-of-processing and self-regulation choice (i.e., study choice). As it happens, neither judgments of learning nor self-efficacy beliefs in reading served as significant moderators of this relationship.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The realm of education is steadily changing from the influence of ideas, theories, research, and technology. Revisiting theory and practices and reinvigorating them with the knowledge gained in research and the advances in technology continue to improve the opportunities of the students. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>With increasing expectations for teachers to incorporate and understand audio technology and its use in the classroom, educators must familiarize themselves and feel comfortable in using digital audio, recording and audio production techniques. Digital audio technology is now used ubiquitously for the delivery and distribution of musical compositions. As educators, the understanding of digital audio technology is paramount. This technology can be deployed to enhance both the opportunities and instructional resources available to students as well as an observational tool for teachers. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The impetus for this dissertation was to create a comprehensive instructional design for both pre-service and in-service music educators as well as for applied instructors. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The method of this instructional design utilizes experiential learning to introduce the theoretical ideas of digital audio theory and techniques. Through this project based, results-driven instruction, the understanding of core concepts is bundled into practical instructions that are of immediate use to an instructor’s classroom and students.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this dissertation, we explore the optimal design of group contests, with a primary application to organizational economics. A group contest is a strategic situation in which individuals belonging to a team expend costly effort with the hopes of increasing their team's chance of receiving a valuable prize, such as a bonus or award. Managers often employ such contests with the goal of incentivizing high effort from workers. All chapters of this dissertation are concerned with addressing the following questions: When workers differ in their ability, how should a manager sort workers into competing groups with the objective of maximizing firm productivity? Should the manager promote competitive balance, i.e., form teams that are evenly matched or balanced? Or, alternatively, form teams by grouping workers who are similar in abilities, thereby creating a situation where some teams have an inherent advantage over others, i.e., form teams that are unbalanced?</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the second chapter, we attempt to address these questions by developing a theoretical model which allows for an arbitrary degree of complementarity in the team production process and an arbitrary convex cost of effort. We find that the optimal sorting is not universal, and depends crucially on the degree of complementarity between team members efforts as well as the shape of the individual cost of effort function. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the third and fourth chapters, we conduct a series of laboratory experiments designed to test the comparative static predictions regarding the optimal sorting of workers under two special cases of our model. Namely, assuming a moderately steep individual cost of effort, (i) when there is no degree of complementarity in team production, a balanced sorting of workers produces higher output than an unbalanced sorting, and (ii) when the degree of complementarity between team members is extreme, an unbalanced sorting is optimal. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The results of our experiment agree with the theoretical predictions, but with various degrees of success. We find strong support of the theory for case (i), as average total output under the balanced sorting was 24.7% higher than the unbalanced sorting, a result close to the theoretically predicted difference of 27.6%. As for case (ii), we find that average total output is higher under the unbalanced sorting than the balanced sorting as predicted; however, the difference is not statistically significant and only half as large as theory predicted. Thus, we only find weak support of the theory for case (ii). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Because we felt that communication plays an important role in the team production process, we ran an additional set of experiments in the same environment as case (ii), with the exception that participants now had a chance to chat with their team member prior to making their effort decisions. Interestingly, we find that average total output under the balanced sorting is 33% higher than under the unbalanced sorting, a large reversal of the theoretical prediction! </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In light of our experimental findings, we conclude that a manager who wishes to maximizes firm productivity should use a balanced sorting. This is in line with the "common wisdom" that promoting competitive balance can bolster competition between competing teams, thereby leading to a high level of overall contest output.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This project examines prominent nineteenth century scientists who operated from—and alongside—the Smithsonian Institution. By examining archival correspondence, reports, and financial records, as well as contemporary news sources and secondary books and journals, I found that these individuals operated beyond the scientific community as public intellectuals. It is my assertion that these individuals functioned as “representatives of science” to the American public, while harnessing their status to establish America’s place on the international scientific scene. Of specific interest is the process by which famed ichthyologist and curator Spencer Fullerton Baird, and his successor George Brown Goode, utilized their dual positions at the Smithsonian and as heads of the U.S. Fish Commission to establish themselves as scientific emissaries to the domestic and international publics. Ichthyology projects and collections at the Smithsonian became internationally coveted under their supervision, and the exhibits these men constructed at various International Exhibitions—which won numerous awards— were direct vectors for global public outreach. This study also reveals the crucial importance of Solomon G. Brown, the first black employee at the Smithsonian and assistant to three Secretaries, as well as a public intellectual himself. Beyond his duties at the Institution, Brown was extremely active in the black community of D.C., giving scientific talks and playing an active role in his local D.C. community.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Finite element methods are a common tool to solve problems in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). This thesis explores the finite element package deal.ii and specific applications to incompressible CFD. Some notation and results from finite element theory are summarised, and a brief overview of some of the features of deal.ii is given. Following this, several CFD applications are presented, including the Stokes equations, the Navier-Stokes equations and the equations for Darcy flow in porous media. Comparison with benchmark problems are provided for the Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations and a case study looking at foam deformation is provided for Darcy flow. Code is provided where applicable.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>     Accountability pressures have impacted pedagogy in many K-12 schools in the United States.  Low achievement on standardized assessments may be attributed to many factors, including instructional strategies. Differentiated instruction has been identified as an instructional method that meets the diverse needs, interests, and strengths.  The purpose of this quantitative comparative study analyzes the effectiveness of arts integration on reading achievement of fourth and fifth grade students who participate in an arts integration program in a Title I school as compared to fourth and fifth grade students attending a Title I school without an arts integration program. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para/>
            <DISS_para>     A framework of constructivism guided the study.  The study was designed to answer the research question of  “To what extent, if any, does arts integration in a Title 1 school improve students reading achievement?”  Using student and school level data from the 2013 – 2014 academic year, this study used regression analyses to estimate the difference in reading achievement between the two schools, controlling for a number of factors that include school, student, and teacher characteristics.  This study indicated some effect on reading achievement of fourth and fifth grade students in two elementary schools, more studies need to be conducted to add to the field of arts integration.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The work is a treatment of the dual nature of musical intervals, and the semantic values attributed to them. By “dual nature,” I am referring to the distance between two notes (e.g. [C] and [E]) being measured as either a major third or a minor sixth, depending on which of the two pitches you are travelling from and the direction in which you are travelling. The work’s opening eight measures find the violinist between two outlooks represented by inverted forms of a single interval, with orchestra serving as chorus to add emotional heaviness to the melodic utterance. In the proceeding music, the orchestra continues to respond, first literally (with the exact notes of), then contrapuntally (in reaction to), the gestures of the violin soloist as it vacillates between these two antithetical affective states. Synthesis occurs in the form of a cadenza: the violinist, free of the projected reality provided by the orchestra quietly enacts counterpoint that rectifies the troubled binary between the two intervallic motives.  The transgressing motive is called one last time as the violinist slowly descends to a cadence in an effort to finalize this Hegelian dialectic.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Three ylidenemalononitrile enamines were designed as fast and selective primary amine sensors. These sensors were used as both colorimetric and fluorometric sensors for primary amines in solution. Two of the enamines were coated onto various media and were used to detect primary amine vapors. The enamine derived from acenaphthalene was used as a colorimetric sensor when coated on media. The enamine derived from 2-phenylacetophenone showed a stronger fluorescent turn-on when coated on media and was used as a fluorescent sensor when coated on media. Each enamine worked to detect primary amines in complex mixtures without sample preparation. Each sensor was generated in short reaction sequences that ranged from three to four steps that utilized mild reaction conditions. In addition, each enamine sensor was synthesized from inexpensive and commercially available starting material.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Pyridazine N-oxides were used as photochemical intermediates for the synthesis of 3,5-disubstituted pyrazoles. These photochemical precursors were synthesized regioselectively following the oxidation of the commercially available dichloropyridazine. In order to obtain the regioselectivity a Suzuki coupling reaction followed by a nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) was completed on the molecule using various boronic acids and pyrrolidine. Followed by photochemical ring opening the disubstituted pyridazine N-oxide generated a diazo carbonyl intermediate that could then have cyclized into either a furan or pyrazole. By partitioning between the two mechanisms we were able to selectively synthesize the pyrazole with little to no furan by product.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study examines the impact of comparability on the extent to which financial statement users detect accruals manipulations and managers manipulate earnings. I predict that comparability enables users to better understand and predict economic events and how these events translate into accruals. This improved understanding of accruals decreases information asymmetry between managers and shareholders, improves the ability of users to detect and undo accruals manipulations, and thereby acts as a constraint on accruals earnings management. I find that when prior-period comparability is higher, current period discretionary accruals are less positively correlated with contemporaneous returns and less negatively correlated with future returns, suggesting that greater comparability increases the pricing efficiency of discretionary accruals. I also find that higher prior-period comparability is associated with less current period accruals earnings management. Finally, I document that greater prior-period comparability increases the extent to which managers substitute real activities manipulation for accruals manipulation, consistent with comparability increasing the relative cost of accruals earnings management. Overall, my results support the notion that comparability increases the pricing efficiency of opportunistic accruals and constrains opportunistic accounting.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>As the only high temperature superconductor with round wire (RW) geometry, Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x (Bi-2212) superconducting wire has the advantages of being multi-filamentary, macroscopically isotropic and twistable. With overpressure (OP) processing techniques recently developed by our group at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL), the engineering current density (Je) of Bi-2212 RW can be dramatically increased. For example, Je of more than 600 A/mm2 (4.2 K and 20 T) is achieved after 100 bar OP processing. With these intrinsically beneficial properties and recent processing progress, Bi-2212 RW has become very attractive for high field magnet applications, especially for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) magnets and accelerator magnets etc. This thesis summarizes my graduate study on Bi-2212 solenoids for high field and high homogeneity NMR magnet applications, which mainly includes performance study of Bi-2212 RW insulations, 1 bar and OP processing study of Bi-2212 solenoids, and development of superconducting joints between Bi-2212 RW conductors. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Electrical insulation is one of the key components of Bi-2212 coils to provide sufficient electrical standoff within coil winding pack. A TiO2/polymer insulation offered by nGimat LLC was systematically investigated by differential thermal analysis (DTA), thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), dielectric property measurements, and transport critical current (Ic) property measurements. About 29% of the insulation by weight is polymer. When the Bi-2212 wire is fully heat treated, this decomposes with slow heating to 400 °C in flowing O2. After the full reaction, we found that the TiO2 did not degrade the critical current properties, adhered well to the conductor, and provided a breakdown voltage of more than 100 V. A Bi-2212 RW wound solenoid coil was built using this insulation being offered by nGimat LLC. The coil resistance was constant through coil winding, polymer burn-off and full coil reaction. The coil was successfully tested at the NHMFL generating 33.8 T combined magnetic field in a 31.2 T background field. Multiple quenches occurred safely, which also illustrates that the insulation provided sufficient dielectric standoff. For Bi-2212 RW with a typical as-drawn diameter of 1.0-1.5 mm, this 15 µm thick insulation allows a very high coil packing factor of ~0.74, whereas earlier alumino-silicate braid insulation only allows packing factors of 0.38-0.48. In addition to the commercial TiO2/polymer insulation, we have also investigated sol-gel based ceramic coatings through collaboration with Harran University and another TiO2 based insulation coating at the NHMFL.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Since Bi-2212 superconducting coils employ the Wind-and-React (W&amp;R) technology, there are some potential issues in processing Bi-2212 coils, in particular for coils with a large thermal mass and dense oxide insulation coating. For this study, several Bi-2212 test solenoids with an outer diameter (OD) of about 90 mm were built and heat treated in 1 bar flowing oxygen with deadweights applied so as to simulate large coil packs. After the heat treatment (HT), coils were epoxy impregnated and cut. Winding pack was checked using SEM in terms of conductor geometry and insulation. Some samples were extracted to measure transport critical current Ic and critical temperature Tc. The results are very promising: test coils presented low creep behavior after standard partial melt HT under mechanical load, and no Ic degradation was found due to the application of mechanical load, and no inadequate oxygenation issue was seen for thick coils with ceramic coating on the wire. However, coils were partially electrically shorted after 1 bar HT under mechanical load, and we believe that increasing insulation coating thickness is necessary. In addition, several small solenoids were manufactured to study OP processing of Bi-2212 coils. The preliminary results indicate that there are some gaps between turns due to densification of wires (~4% wire diameter reduction) during 50-100 bar OP processing, and the diameter shrinking of conductors will potentially lead to coil sagging. So far, we have developed some methods to solve the issue of coil sagging, such as using flexible coil flange to allow smooth sagging of winding pack during OP processing.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We have also investigated electrical joints between Bi-2212 RW conductors, which include resistive joints and superconducting joints. For resistive Bi-2212 joints, we evaluated conventional diffusion bonding method and soldering method. In general, the joints (with 42 mm joint length) resistances are below 200 nΩ at 4.2 K and magnetic fields up to 13.5 T, and the effect of magnetoresistance is clearly present. In addition to resistive joints, we successfully developed a superconducting joint between Bi-2212 RW conductors for persistent current mode (PCM) operations. The joint fabrication procedure is effective and practical, enabling Bi-2212 superconducting joints to be achieved during the standard Bi-2212 HT processing. First, the melting temperatures of Bi-2212 precursor mixtures with different amounts of Ag additions were investigated by DTA. Then, test joints were fabricated and heat treated in 1 bar flowing oxygen using the standard Bi-2212 HT schedule. The voltage-current (V-I) properties were measured using the conventional four-point method at 4.2 K in magnetic fields up to 14 T. A maximum supercurrent of ~850 A was achieved at 4.2 K and self-field. With the increase of external field, the supercurrent gradually decreased as expected, but a supercurrent of ~450 A was still presented at 4.2 K and 14 T. Compared with open-ended short samples with identical 1 bar Bi-2212 reaction, we found that the Ic properties of joints did not degrade. Meanwhile, microstructures of joints were examined by SEM, which clearly presented the formation of a Bi-2212 superconducting interface between two independent Bi-2212 RW conductors. Furthermore, a Bi-2212 RW closed-loop solenoid with a superconducting joint was fabricated and fully heat treated in 1 bar flowing oxygen. Using the field decay method, the joint resistance was estimated to be below 5×10-12 Ω at 4.2 K and self-field.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>ABSTRACT</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>For pianists considering teaching as a career, progress has been made in the preparation of piano teachers in American colleges and universities beginning in the early twentieth century.  These developments impacted the education of the piano teacher in colleges/universities as well as the added focus of piano-related journals and publications, professional organizations, and the piano teaching profession.  According to the newest edition of Directory of Music Faculties in Colleges and Universities, U.S. and Canada (2015-2016), there are 62 American institutions offering master’s degrees in piano pedagogy or master’s degrees with an emphasis in piano pedagogy, and 1091 faculty reported an interest in teaching piano pedagogy courses. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to increase the understanding of how current and future piano teachers perceive the design and function of master’s piano pedagogy degree programs in the United States.  This descriptive research, bridging collegiate master’s students and early-career piano teachers’ perceptions, explores the perceived benefits, value, or shortcomings of graduate-level piano teacher education/pedagogy programs.  The researcher principally utilized the following techniques for this study: (1) review of related literature and documents; (2) online survey questionnaire design; (3) interviews with novice piano teachers and piano pedagogy faculty members; and (4) analysis of quantitative and qualitative data.  The information obtained through online surveys and real-time interviews comprise the foundation for the findings of this study.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Most of the collegiate and early-career piano teachers in this study indicated positive attitudes toward the “hands-on” internship experience and learning experience with piano pedagogy instructors.  The most valuable aspects of the master’s piano pedagogy programs noted by participants were faculty members directly sharing their professional knowledge and years of experience to students in class.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Asthma and wheezing are common illnesses among children today. The effects on the respiratory system, and other health factors such as having sickle cell disease, can further contribute to an exacerbated health issue resulting in respiratory distress and/or acute chest syndrome. The causes and effects these issues have on the growth and development, education, and psychosocial aspects of a child’s life are numerous. The main purpose of this study was to investigate whether a specific music therapy intervention, targeting lung function, could increase oxygen saturation (SPO2), decrease respiration rate (RR), and lower heart rate (HR). Hospital inpatients (N=40) between the ages of 4 to12 years participated in a three-day randomized control study with control and experimental groups. Those in the experimental group received 3 days of music therapy treatment in addition to standard respiratory treatment, a fifteen- to twenty-five-minute intervention (N=20). The control group (N=20) received no additional intervention. A pre- and post-test consisted of the researcher documenting HR, SPO2, and RR before and after each interaction. Self-reports of breathing difficulty were also given by the subjects, pre and post intervention. For the experimental group, an exit survey was given to parents/guardians who were present at the conclusion of the final day. Results indicated that while music therapy did have a positive short-term effect on HR, SPO2, and RR, three days was not a sufficient amount of time to establish long-term side effects. A multivariate test indicated that between the groups and the collective physiological factors there was a significant difference (p=0.046). Comparisons between days and groups showed more significant difference in the experimental groups HR levels (p=.000 to .001) than the other areas.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>As the global supply of easily accessible, light crude oil diminishes, production of heavy crude oils and offshore drilling for light crude oils will continue to increase. However, one problem that is often encountered during the production of these heavy and subsea crude oils is the formation of stable water-in-oil (W/O) or oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions. Although emulsions may be intentionally formed during the recovery of heavy crude oils, emulsions must be broken before the crude oil is refined. If left untreated, these emulsions may contribute to severe corrosion issues (due to entrained salt) and equipment failure. In the case of subsea crude oils, stable W/O emulsions may be encountered if the crude oil enters the environment (e.g. Deepwater Horizon oil spill). The emulsions encountered here reduce the effectiveness of remediation efforts (e.g. skim boats used to remove crude oil from the environment) and slow recovery efforts. Therefore, a key objective in petroleum production is to understand what types of species contribute to stable emulsions in order to determine how to best treat such undesirable emulsions.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Emulsion stability is controlled by the surface-active characteristics of a small fraction of compounds that exist or are added to the crude oil matrix. Collectively, these species generate a molecular layer at the oil/water interface which stabilizes the emulsion by resisting drainage and hence coalescence between dispersed droplets. Characterization of these compounds has been hindered by carryover issues from the whole crude oil. However, a novel method for the isolation of these surface-active compounds which minimizes carryover issues was recently introduced. Here, this “wet silica” method is used to isolate interfacially active material from petroleum crude oils. The method is modified (e.g. vary water loading, vary water pH) in order to understand what types of species partition to the oil/water interface under each condition through characterization by Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS). The method is also used to isolate IM from a variety of different crude oil samples (e.g. fractionated crude oil, weathered crude oils, etc.) to determine which fractions and types of compounds contribute most to stable emulsions. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Chapter one presents background information on petroleum crude oils, petroleum emulsions, and the “wet silica” method necessary for understanding the data presented in chapters three through nine. Information on the techniques (electrospray ionization (ESI), FT-ICR MS) used to characterize isolated IM are later described in chapter two. Modifications to the “wet silica” method are described in chapters three and four: chapter three examines the role of water content adsorbed to silica gel for the selective isolation of interfacially active material from Athabasca bitumen while chapter four explores how varying water pH affects the composition of isolated IM from Athabasca bitumen.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para> Chapters five and six examine how different IM fractions contribute to the overall Athabasca bitumen emulsion stability. Chapter five explores how isolated IM water-soluble organics differ in composition and stability characteristics compared to the oil-soluble IM fraction. Here, IM water-soluble organics are observed to generate stable emulsions. However, asphaltenes alone are generally believed to play the most significant role in emulsion stability. Therefore, in order to understand the contributions of asphaltenes to isolated IM, chapter six systematically explores the contributions of the asphaltene and maltene fractions of Athabasca bitumen to the IM isolated from the whole crude oil. Yet, previous studies have suggested that rearrangement occurs at the interface over time. Therefore, chapter seven characterizes the species that move to the oil/water interface once the most surface active Athabasca bitumen compounds are depleted. While differences are observed in the IM isolated from the different Athabasca bitumen fractions presented in chapters seven and eight, it is possible that low-molecular weight acids in the IM samples preferentially ionize and hinder the detection of high-molecular weight acids and asphaltene species in the IM fraction of these samples. In order to determine if low-molecular weight acids are preferentially ionized, chapter eight examines how the compositional space coverage of species isolated in 9 different IM acid fractions (separated by hydrophobicity) from the whole Athabasca bitumen compare.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In contrast to the work performed on heavy crude oils in chapters three through eight, Chapter 9 characterizes IM isolated from a light crude oil. Here, IM is isolated from a variety of different Deepwater Horizon crude oils samples (i.e. whole crude, photochemically weathered, environmentally weathered) in order to gain insight into the degradation pathways (abiotic, biotic) of IM compounds in the environment. Finally, chapter ten details future work that will be performed to gain further insight into the structure and type of species which contribute most to emulsion stability under a range of conditions.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This thesis investigates nonlinear systems that are dispersive and conservative in nature and well-approximated by the nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The NLS equation is the prototypical equation for describing such phenomena and it has been utilized in a large number of physical systems.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This work considers novel applications and exotic parameter regimes that fall inside the class of solutions well described by nonlinear Schr\"odinger-type systems.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A brief historical, physical, and mathematical introduction to deriving the NLS equation and its variants is presented.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The topics considered in detail cover optical systems in various media and are naturally divided into two parts: non-paraxiality through the inclusion of higher-order dispersion/diffraction and beam propagation in the presence of complex lattices.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The higher-order dispersion/diffraction effects on soliton solutions are considered in detail. The propagation of a short soliton pulse as it travels down a fiber optic in the presence of a linear time-periodic potential is considered. Due to the short duration of the pulse fourth-order dispersive effects are relevant. The band gap structure is determined using Floquet-Bloch theory and the shape of its dispersion curves as a function of the fourth-order dispersion coupling constant $\beta$ is discussed. Several features not observed in the absence of high-order dispersion ($\beta=0$) are highlighted, such as a nonzero threshold value of potential strength below which there is no band gap and the formation of novel localized modes at large  potential amplitudes. A higher order two band tight binding model is introduced that captures and intuitively explains most of the  numerical results related to the spectral bands. Lattice solitons corresponding to spectral eigenvalues lying in the semi-infinite and first band gaps are constructed. Stability of various localized lattice modes is studied via linear stability analysis and direct numerical simulation. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Next the spectral transverse instabilities of one-dimensional solitary wave solutions to the two-dimensional NLS equation  with biharmoinc diffraction and subject to higher-dimensional perturbations are studied. Physically, the inclusion of the biharmonic term corresponds to spatial beams with a narrow width in comparison to their wavelength. A linear boundary value problem governing the evolution of the transverse perturbations is derived. The eigenvalues of the perturbations are numerically computed and a finite band of unstable transverse modes is found to exist. In the long wavelength limit an asymptotic formula for the perturbation growth rate that agrees well with the numerical findings. Using a variational formulation based on Lagrangian model reduction, an approximate expression for the perturbation eigenvalues is obtained and its validity is compared with both the asymptotic and numerical results. The dynamics of a one-dimensional soliton stripe in the presence of a transverse perturbation is studied using direct numerical simulations. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The second half of the dissertation is concerned with beam propagation in the presence of complex lattices, in particular lattices that possess parity-time ($PT$) symmetries. A new family of non-hermitian optical potentials given in terms of double exponential periodic functions is introduced. The center of $PT$-symmetry is not around zero and the potential satisfies a shifted $PT$-symmetry relation at two distinct locations. These novel refractive index modulations are examined from the perspective of optical lattices that are homogeneous along the propagation direction. The diffraction dynamics, abrupt phase transitions in the eigenvalue spectrum and exceptional points in the band structure are studied in detail. In addition, the nonlinear properties of coherent structures in Kerr media is probed. The spatial symmetries of such lattice solitons follow the shifted $PT$-symmetric relations. Furthermore, such lattice solitons have a power threshold and their linear and nonlinear stability is critically dependent on their spatial symmetry point.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the final chapter a class of exact multi-component constant energy solutions to a Manakov system in the presence of an external $PT$-symmetric complex potential is constructed. This type of uniform wave pattern displays a non-trivial phase whose spatial dependence is induced from the lattice structure. In this regard, light can propagate without scattering while retaining its original form despite the presence of inhomogenous gain and loss. The constant-intensity continuous waves are then used to perform a modulational instability analysis in the presence of both non-hermitian media and cubic nonlinearity. A linear stability eigenvalue problem is formulated that governs the dynamical evolution of the periodic perturbation and its spectrum is numerically determined using Fourier-Floquet-Bloch theory. The stability of the self-focusing and defocusing cases is considered and compared to the zero-potential results. Our linear stability results are supplemented with direct (nonlinear) numerical simulations.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Museums, and museum professionals, engage in a significant role within society. This dissertation is a qualitative exploratory study of the ways in which museum professionals promote or hinder the social inclusivity of museums through curatorial voice. Through a series of exhibit evaluations and intensive interviews, the researcher investigates the mechanisms used to craft curatorial voice within museums that handle contested subject material. This research seeks to broaden the understanding of curatorial voice, as viewed through the theoretical lenses of gatekeeper theory and co-creation of identity, with the explicit purpose of aiding in the development of professional guidance to help make museums more socially inclusive.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This thesis analyzes both the material phenomena channeled by antebellum Spiritualists, and the attendant séance form. Sitter accounts, emphasizing the desire for emotional and material points of connection with spirits, challenge previous interpretations of material phenomena as novel sensationalism. Through practice, material mediums demonstrated an ideal model of selfhood as social, bodily, and free from spatial confines. Rail technology’s disruption of the traditional social and spatial implications of distance opened up the possibility for a radical reimagining of space as primarily social, and erasable through physical and emotional harmony. Though previously neglected, practices around material manifestations demonstrate a strategic model of bodily selfhood complementary to the larger Spiritualist project of pursuing an imminent universal harmony.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation examines the use of urban space in Cuban cultural production after 1990; the year Fidel Castro announced the beginning of the crisis known as “Special Period in Times of Peace”. It was a period that brought the most dramatic changes in Cuban society after the sixties, provoking a decentralization of power in many sectors. I argue in this thesis that there is also a decentralization in the use of urban space, which reflects the collective disenchantment in the revolutionary project.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the literary and cinematographic works studied, raging from 1991 to 2014, the characters live in Havana city and inscribe meanings through their spatial practices. These spaces also influence the state of mind and actions of the characters, reinforcing the interconnection between the spatial, the temporal and the social dimensions. Using a spatial theoretical framework, within the field of cultural studies, the research is supported by the conceptualization of social space developed by Henri Lefebvre, of heterotopia by Michel Foucault, and the analysis of the use of urban space developed by Michel de Certeau.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Many of the fictional works of the period show characters that do not have a feeling of belonging to a nation, who interact with the city from marginal spaces, such as rooftops and the limits with the sea. My objective is to examine the use, function and effect that these spaces of alterity have on their users, and their significance for the analysis of the Cuban society. The dissertation has been divided as follows: introduction, three chapters—each dedicated to spaces of alterity that share certain characteristics—, and conclusion. The first chapter explores the overwhelming presence of rooftops in the fictional works of post-Soviet Cuba; these are spaces that rise over the city and allow a feeling of freedom, and the possibility to lighten the weight of daily life. The second chapter proposes to see two of these spaces as heterotopias of accumulation of time, emphasizing an alternative order that reveals the contradictions of the spaces outside. In these heterotopias, the characters reconstruct anOther history, anOther national identity. In chapter three I analyze the space where the city meets the sea, particularly the area of Havana’s famous seafront, el Malecón. Despite being a public and heterogeneous space, this frontier is also used by the characters to distance themselves from the official center, and to find a space of escape, refuge and rebirth.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>At first, these spaces of alterity are used as a means to escape; however, they also instill a liberating feeling, thus becoming spaces where the characters can look into themselves and recover their lost hopes. The possibility for a re-imagination of the self and the nation only happens in these spaces, suggesting that the official center is in a standstill. Therefore, this research shows the need to include spatial analysis in the study of Cuban society, and reveals the decentralization of space in post-Soviet Havana, which is interconnected with the ideological disenchantment of the nineties. Additionally, some of the works propose a redefinition of the concept of national identity that is not necessarily tied to the revolutionary project.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Self-sustaining oscillators regulate diverse aspects of physiology in mammals such as insulin secretion, cell cycle regulation, and circadian rhythmicity. The circadian clock is based upon several interacting feedback loops, which affect most daily oscillations in physiology, such as wake/sleep rhythms. Unlike other oscillators, the circadian oscillator maintains an extremely consistent period and phase, thereby producing remarkably stable cellular and organismal circadian rhythms over a wide range of biological conditions. Previously reported in vitro synthetic oscillators that utilize biochemical feedback circuits have provided important insight into design principles for natural biological oscillators, but their similarity to true physiological pathways is limited. Here, we report a novel artificial mammalian circadian clock in vivo that is capable of generating robust and tunable circadian rhythms. Deletion of Per1 and Per2 in mice significantly disrupted circadian wake/sleep patterns, but the insertion of an inducible Per2 transgene artificially generated PER2-mediated rhythms and restored circadian sleep/wake cycles. Our artificial clock is tunable: the period and phase of the rhythms were able to be modulated predictably, at will, and surpassed previous reports of biological circadian limitations. Our work demonstrates that many of the endogenous genetic circuits in the current clock model are dispensable, and further study of our artificial clock model may help to distinguish critical mechanisms of clock regulation. Furthermore, the design principles used in our approach may be applied to engineer novel artificial oscillators for the study of various physiological processes. Building on these design principles, we demonstrate that unique and robust degradation of the key clock component PER is the basis of the high fidelity. PER degradation is regulated by balanced ubiquitination and deubiquitination, and disruption in these kinetics causes instability in the circadian oscillator. We have identified multiple E3 ubiquitin ligases and a novel deubiquitinase that contribute to PER’s stability. Additionally, recent studies have demonstrated that proteins can be degraded by both the ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy. We provide novel evidence that the molecular clock and autophagy are interlinked, and that proper autophagic balance within the circadian network is necessary for robust rhythm generation. Taken together, our work suggests that transgenic expression of Per alone is sufficient to drive the clock, and the rate-limiting components PER1 and PER2 must be properly balanced by ubiquitination, deubiquitination, and autophagy in order for robust, high-fidelity rhythms to be generated in mammals. We believe these mechanisms may underlie circadian sleep disorders characterized by irregular wake and sleep onset in humans. These features, along with other design principles from our work, may enhance the study and treatment of mammalian circadian dysfunction and contribute to broader aspects of physiology involving biological oscillators.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This thesis is an ethnomusicological study of child musicking at a community center in Tallahassee, Florida. In recent years, ethnomusicological research into music and childhood has expanded, reflecting an acknowledgment of children as innovators, performers, culture bearers, and agents of their own musicultural lives and identities. Studies of children's musical cultures have thus become more collaborative and interactive, engaging children as participants in field research and data collection. In this thesis, I draw from and expand upon such approaches, demonstrating how ethnographer-facilitated music programs can reveal how children engage with music and negotiate its boundaries throughout their lives. The discussion describes my own experience creating and facilitating an after-school music program at a community center in Tallahassee, Florida, as a means of examining children's musical agency. Through discussion of this experience and analytical consideration of children’s musical creations, responses, and performances, as well as discussion of talent and play, I argue that projects centered in collaborative program building between ethnomusicologists and the children who participate in their research have the potential to yield rich ethnographic data concerning children's musical lives, values, practices, and modes of creativity. Such an approach both generates greater inclusion of children's voices in ethnomusicological discourse and provides spaces for them to express their music and identities in their dependent, independent, and interdependent forms.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Lightning inhibits normal operating conditions at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and other locations, leading to inconvenience and detrimental economic impacts. Lightning cessation guidance must safely protect lives and infrastructure.  This research focuses on “nonisolated” lightning cases which we defined as one cell whose flashes had ceased while embedded in weak composite reflectivity (Z ≥ 15 dBZ) with another cell still producing flashes.  The dataset consisted of 50 warm season (May-September) nonisolated storms near KSC during 2013.  The research utilized the National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN), the second generation Lightning Detection and Ranging (LDAR-II), and dual polarimetric radar data.  These data were merged and analyzed using the Warning Decision Support System-Integrated Information (WDSS-II) at 1 min intervals.  The parameters, such as horizontal reflectivity (ZH), that decreased greatest during the cessation period were ZH &gt; 40 dBZ at -5°C, ZH &gt; 35 dBZ at -10°C, graupel presence at -10°C, and graupel presence at -15°C.  We tested 60 cessation schemes utilizing a wait time approach.  Our safest scheme required that the distance from our decaying storm’s 30 dBZ core to the closest signature of graupel associated with the active storm (30G) be greater than 10 nm (~19 km) and the horizontal reflectivity be less than 40 dBZ at -5°C for 10 min.  In the independent (dependent dataset), this scheme produced one (zero) false alarm.  More research is needed to analyze nonisolated cessation, since no algorithm produced perfect skill when applied to the independent dataset.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The extraction and transportation of bitumen from northeastern Alberta’s oil deposits, known as the tar sands, is a contentious topic in Canada and around the world. Frequently portrayed in Canadian news media, the project is both lauded as a major contributor to the Canadian economy and derided for its degradation of the environment and infringement on First Nations territory and way of life. Understanding that places are ever-changing configurations shaped by multi-scalar processes and opposing visions, this thesis examines how the discourse of the tar sands in the news contributes to national place-making in Canada. Using content analysis, I consulted fifty randomly selected articles from one of Canada’s top daily newspapers, The Globe and Mail, to understand how the project is discussed nationally. I use relational place theory to parameterize the competing frames used to define Canada as a place. Postcolonial theory is used to further unpack the epistemological legacies and discursive practices through which place is constituted. I found that more nationalist framings of Canada promoted by the government and industry—Canada as democratic/responsible and Canada as modern—featured most prominently in the sample; however, counter-frames that question Canada’s inherent benevolent and responsible nature offer a small, yet strong opposition to these hegemonic national myths. Therefore, the tar sands represent more than a debate over resource development, but a debate over the nature of the country itself.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Since the start of the 21st century—and mostly in the past five years—Sigur Rós, Dan Deacon, Sō Percussion, and Nick Zammuto actively investigated their homes and found them to be inspiring, if sometimes difficult to confront or articulate. They wrote music resulting from their individual investigations. Certain albums, like Sō Percussion’s Where (we) Live (2012) and Dan Deacon’s America (2012), candidly explored place, while Nick Zammuto’s Anchor (2014) obliquely referenced his family’s homestead. In the case of Sigur Rós, Iceland undoubtedly has been an influence, although the band finds place-based descriptions of its music to be problematic. By identifying the musicians’ senses of place—their psychological and emotional attachments to specific places—I contextualize the role that place plays in their lives and explore strategies of listening for locality within their music. Using these four groups as case studies, this dissertation explores the relationship of music and place. It also draws parallels between the groups’ music and a recent ascendancy of place and public concern for the environment. I argue that the musicians in this study are producing work that coincides with an invigorated attention to location—examples of which include digitization of place, the migration of younger generations away from suburban living, and anxieties regarding anthropogenic climate change. Sigur Rós, Dan Deacon, Sō Percussion, and Nick Zammuto are thus part of both a cohort of place-conscious citizens and a bevy of contemporary musicians and composers who are exploring place.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This dissertation describes the propagation of near atmospheric nitrogen gas that rushes into a liquid helium cooled vacuum tube after the tube suddenly loses vacuum. The loss-of-vacuum scenario resembles accidental venting of atmospheric air to the beam-line of a superconducting radio frequency particle accelerator and is investigated to understand how in the presence of condensation, the in-flowing air will propagate in such geometry. In a series of controlled experiments, room temperature nitrogen gas (a substitute for air) at a variety of mass flow rates was vented to a high vacuum tube immersed in a bath of liquid helium. Pressure probes and thermometers installed on the tube along its length measured respectively the tube pressure and tube wall temperature rise due to gas flooding and condensation. At high mass in-flow rates a gas front propagated down the vacuum tube but with a continuously decreasing speed. Regression analysis of the measured front arrival times indicates that the speed decreases nearly exponentially with the travel length. At low enough mass in-flow rates, no front propagated in the vacuum tube. Instead, the in-flowing gas steadily condensed over a short section of the tube near its entrance and the front appeared to `freeze-out'. An analytical expression is derived for gas front propagation speed in a vacuum tube in the presence of condensation. The analytical model qualitatively explains the front deceleration and flow freeze-out. The model is then simplified and supplemented with condensation heat/mass transfer data to again find the front to decelerate exponentially while going away from the tube entrance. Within the experimental and procedural uncertainty, the exponential decay length-scales obtained from the front arrival time regression and from the simplified model agree.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Traditional descriptors such as the mean and the covariance matrix give useful global summaries of data and probability measures.  Nevertheless, when distributions with more complex topological and geometrical behaviors arise, these methods fall short in accurately describing them.  This dissertation explores and develops new methods that provide more informative summaries of complex probability measures using multiscale analogs of the Fréchet function and the covariance tensor which encode variation of data with respect to any point in the domain.  These multiscale methods are developed using kernel functions and diffusion distances and are helpful in obtaining more information on local-to-regional-to-global behavior of probability measures, unlike the traditional take which only gives global summaries.  We applied the methods to the analysis of climatic data of the Fabaceae plant family (legumes) and to microbiome data related to the Clostridium difficile infection in the human gut.  Our studies reveal patterns of climatological adaptation of various legume taxa and changes in the interactions of microbial communities in the presence of infection which are helpful in monitoring the resolution of the disease.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>As a relatively young instrument, the euphonium’s solo repertoire lacks the depth available for instruments such as the violin or piano. Even other instruments in the brass family have repertoire composed by historically important musicians like Haydn and Mozart. Though the euphonium began to enjoy recognition as a virtuosic solo instrument with bands in the early 20th century, a number of these solos were borrowed from other instruments and none were concertos. Significant music written by prominent British composers specifically for euphonium began to surface in the early 1970s, leading with Euphonium Concerto (1972) by Joseph Horovitz and Fantasia (1973) by Gordon Jacob. John Golland followed soon after, writing his Euphonium Concerto No. 1 in 1982.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The euphonium’s strength as a solo instrument grew because of its role in music written numerous British composers through the mid-20th century, both in concert band and brass band settings. Even in non-solo lines, composers often depended on the euphonium to supply a virtuosic tenor voice in their writing. Some of these same composers eventually supplied some of the first large-scale solo works for euphonium. Joseph Horovitz was among the first to write for the euphonium as a solo instrument with the brass band. John Golland followed these traditions in his own brass band compositions, and wrote two prominent euphonium concertos with brass band accompaniment. He wrote each of his concertos in collusion with two of Britain’s most prominent euphonium stars of the 1980s, the first with Robert Childs and the second with Robert’s brother, Nicholas. The first Concerto strongly represented Golland’s own life, and includes some of the most virtuosic solo writing in existence for euphonium. The perceived limits of possibility challenged by Golland in this composition started a trend of increasingly difficult requirements in subsequent euphonium works, eventually changing the assumed lyrical and technical limits for euphonium performers over time. Though the demands of range and difficulty in later compositions expanded beyond Horovitz’s original writing, composers still include direct references to his Euphonium Concerto in terms of style, structure, and closely-related quotes of his music. A few of the more highly regarded new concertos from the past twenty years were composed by the next generation of brass band composers who were taught by Horovitz, extending his influence even deeper into the euphonium repertoire. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	This treatise focuses on two early euphonium concertos and the lives of the composers who created them. Joseph Horovitz and his Euphonium Concerto (1972), which is recognized as the first concerto written specifically for the euphonium, will constitute the first chapter. The second chapter centers on John Golland and his Euphonium Concerto No. 1 (1982). Each composer’s personal history will be the first portion of each chapter, but their compositional idiom will also be examined using other selections from their respective bodies of music. Finally, each chapter will briefly assess the role of these pieces and their composers in the overall development of the euphonium concerto, especially in relation to British brass band music. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The body of this treatise came from books, periodicals, radio interviews, notes by the composers and publishers, and personal accounts from friends and colleagues close to the composers. Recordings and scores of the two concertos were analyzed alongside recordings and scores of other works by these composers to draw conclusions regarding the each composer’s general style of writing. In the case of Horovitz, his students and their work were also examined in order to gauge that aspect of his continuing influence on the brass band world. The end result gathered from these sources formed a biography of each composer which also addresses their music and influence on the early development of the euphonium repertoire.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This dissertation studies return seasonalities in the cross section and highlights the link between investor psychology and cross-sectional seasonalities. We document four main categories of return seasonalities in the stock market where predictable return persistence or reversal occurs across different calendar months, weekdays, holidays and firms’ earnings announcement days. First, relative performance across stocks during months with high (low) market returns tends to persist during months when aggregate returns are predicted to be high (low), but reverse during months when aggregate returns are predicted to be low (high). Second, relative performance across stocks on weekdays with high (low) market returns tends to persist on weekdays when aggregate returns are predicted to be high (low), but reverse on weekdays when aggregate returns are predicted to be low (high). These two types of seasonalities are robust to placebo tests and don’t diminish when controlling for risk and characteristics. Using such months or weekdays, we construct a mood beta with strong predictive power for monthly or daily returns. Third, we document a strong pre-holiday seasonality where stocks with above-average return during the two to three days immediately preceding or on a holiday tend to earn above-average return during the same pre-holiday window for at least 10 years. This pre-holiday seasonality is long-lasting, cannot be explained by a host of firm attributes, is present in foreign equity markets and only among firms with a retail clientele, and tends to reverse in the immediate, post-holiday period. A long-short strategy based on pre-holiday seasonality earns abnormal returns with high Sharpe ratios. Last, we document a strong seasonality during firms’ earnings announcement days. We show that a firm’s cumulative abnormal return (CAR) in a given fiscal quarter in a given fiscal year exhibits strong persistent patterns at fiscal annual intervals, while SUE doesn’t. Such persistence exists regardless of the content of SUE. We also show a strong persistence of firm’s earnings response (ER) at fiscal annual intervals. Collectively, we document a broad set of strong and puzzling return seasonalities in the cross section that cannot be explained by risk or characteristics. A model is provided to support our hypothesis that investors’ mood, attention and expectation swings are important sources of such seasonalities in the cross section.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This project studied the relationships between preschoolers’ school readiness skills and the parental involvement they experience. Children’s own characteristics, their family characteristics, and the parental involvement they experience, including parental home practice and informal education, are studied using the 2007 National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) School Readiness Survey. The participants were a national total sample of 2620 parents of children aged three to five years old. The results suggest that child age, speaking English at home, previous experience with preschool programs, SES, single parent status, and parental involvement all influence child’s school readiness level, while age, speaking English at home, previous experience with preschool programs, SES and single parent status also influence parental involvement behaviors.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Atmosphere-biosphere exchange plays a key role in the global cycles of water and carbon. Air pollution can alter these processes and induce climate perturbations and feedbacks. Surface ozone (O3) is an air pollutant and greenhouse gas that is toxic to plants, reducing their growth and ability to regulate water loss. Past controlled experiments have shown that O3 degrades a plant’s water-use efficiency (WUE), which is the ratio of carbon uptake in photosynthesis to water loss in transpiration. This has potentially significant implications for terrestrial water cycle and precipitation, but no studies have evaluated the O3 effect on WUE in complete ecosystems. We aim to quantify the impact of O3 on WUE across a wide array of ecosystems.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>          Meteorological and biological data was obtained from 23 FLUXNET flux tower sites, which use the eddy covariance method to derive hourly fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), water vapor (H2O), and O3 between the atmosphere and ecosystem. Across a broad range of sites, we find a significant negative relationship between daily anomalies of stomatal O3 flux (FS, O3) and WUE that explains 1-3% of WUE variability. The largest impacts occur in locations and species with high stomatal conductance, such as broadleaf forests, humid climates, or irrigated crops, rather than where surface O3 concentrations are highest. Past long-term studies have also found similar O3 impacts (1-3%) on WUE, indicating a consistent response across a pool species and ecosystems.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This thesis examines the outbreak of violence between Muslims and Jews in the city of Constantine in August 1934. What has been termed a riot or a pogrom was, for the reformist ulama arguing for association with the French colonial state, a tragic rupture in the colonial civic order. By examining the Arabic and French language rhetoric of the ulama in the aftermath of the violence, one can elucidate not only the sociopolitical context of the riots, but also the political agenda of the reformist ulama. Their attempts to rationalize the violence and avert culpability from the Muslim population of Constantine should not be understood as evidence of their inchoate Arab nationalism and latent anti-Semitism. Rather, their rhetoric revealed the historical and political underpinnings of their reformist platform, which was rooted in a conception of Algerian history galvanized by wider narratives of Islamic reform. Thus the reformers believed that for Algerian Muslims, the French themselves and their Jewish neighbors were not their enemies but rather their allies. Their enemies were ignorance itself and the alleged propagators of such ignorance, those who practiced and promulgated sufi Islam, which the reformers saw as antithetical to modernity and progress. But in August 1934, Constantine’s Muslims perpetrated attacks against these ostensible allies, and the reformist ulama were left to rationalize this transgression in the wake of the riots. An analysis of this rhetoric reconstructs the politics of belonging at play in the interwar period, deepening our historical understanding of the evolution of the platform of the reformist ulama, many of whom in 1934 still imagined a positive future for French Algeria.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Trailing vortices are both a fundamental and practical problem of fluid mechanics. Fundamentally, they provide a canonical vortex flow that is pervasive in finite aspect ratio lifting bodies, practically producing many adverse effects across aeronautical and maritime applications. These adverse effects coupled with the broad range of applicability make their active control desirable; however, they remain robust to control efforts. Experimental baseline results provided an explanation of vortex wandering, the side-to-side motion often attributed to wind-tunnel unsteadiness or a vortex instability. We extracted the wandering motion and found striking similarities with the eigenmodes, growth rates, and frequencies from a stability analysis of the Batchelor vortex. After concluding that wandering is a result of a vortex instability, we applied control to the trailing vortex flow field through blowing from a slot at the wingtip. We experimentally obtained modest reductions in the metrics, but found the parameter space for optimization unwieldy. With the ultimate goal of designing control, we performed a physics-based stability analysis in the wake of a NACA0012 wing with an aspect ratio of 1.25 positioned at a geometric angle of attack of 5 degrees. Numerically computing the base flow at a chord Reynolds number of 1000, we perform a parallel temporal and spatial stability analysis three chords downstream of the trailing edge finding seven instabilities: three temporal, four spatial. The three temporal contain a wake instability, a vortex instability, and a mixed instability, which is a higher-order wake instability. The primary instability localized to the wake results from the two-dimensional wake, while the secondary instability is the mixed instability, containing higher-order spanwise structures in the wake. These instabilities imply that although it may be intuitive to place control at the wingtip, these results show that control may be more effective at the trailing edge, which would excite these instabilities that result with the eventual break up of the vortex. Further, by performing a wave-packet analysis, we found the wave packets contained directivity, coming inward toward the vortex above and below the wing, and traveling outward in the spanwise directions. We conjecture that this directivity can be translated to receptivity, with free-stream disturbances above and below the wing being more receptive than spanwise disturbances. With this, we provide two methods for instability excitation: utilizing control devices on the wing to excite near-field instabilities directly and utilizing free-stream disturbances to such as a speaker to excite near-field instabilities through receptivity.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The multiphase model has given keen insights into many aspects of biology, from crawling cells to bio-gel morphology and tumor angiogenesis [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Phases are averaged fractions of a control volume, treated as viscoelastic fluid-like or visco-elastic solids. Derived by</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>conservation laws, the governing equations of the multiphase model are nonlinear partial dierential</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>equations (PDEs).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Nonlinear PDEs are often difficult to</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>solve. For this reason, asymptotic and numerical methods have been the</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>predominant tool to analyze these problems, but this is not the only</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>approach to yield results. Reduction transformations can take a system</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>of nonlinear PDEs and reduce it to a system of ordinary differential</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>equations (ODEs), which are typically less difficult to solve. Finding</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>and using such reductions was the focus of this thesis. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this work, we provide a framework</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>for producing analytic solutions to the multiphase model by way of</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>transformations. We begin by deriving exact solutions to a free boundary</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>problem with a sharp interface, a sharp interface being the</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>discontinuity occurring in gel dynamics where a boundary layer</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>separates a mixture of phases from a region of pure solvent. The main</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>focus of study is to track the dynamic interface</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>between the gel and the pure solvent as the gels swell and</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>deswell. These questions arise in designing drug delivery methods, for</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>example [11].</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the event of no mass</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>production, we are able to use this analytic solution to replicate</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>the numerical results provided by others with a closed form</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>solution. Further, this solution yields additional information not</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>recovered by other methods. In addition to being able to track the</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>front velocity, we recover the time dependency lost by asymptotic</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>methods. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Next, we explore the</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>multiphase system with sources and sinks. Once</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>more, the reduction transformation</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>we develop provides closed form solutions for the multiphase</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>problem. Assessing the characteristic curves for a smooth boundary, we</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>find shocks and rarefactions arise with logistic growth. Shocks</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>occur when multi-valued solutions are present for certain boundary</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>conditions, and rarefactions occur when solutions vanish on the boundary. In</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>gel dynamics, this "disturbance'' occurs when there is a disruption</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>from phases are attempting to occupy the same space. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Finally, we develop</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>a general reduction transformation for an arbitrary number of phases</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>and dimensions. We show the effectiveness of this transformation by</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>reducing two known biological examples. The first model has spatially one </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>My dissertation focuses on how the brain encodes a learned motor sequence.  I look at the encoding of birdsong in the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) to understand the mechanisms that underlie motor encoding.  Juvenile zebra finches learn their songs by imitating the song of an adult tutor.  The motor memory for song is encoded within HVC (acronym is name), a premotor nucleus within the avian cortical pathway that generates vocal-motor output.  When I began my research, the synaptic architecture of HVC was thought to be uniform and non-topographic.  In turn, the encoding of song was thought to be evenly distributed across this non-topographic synaptic architecture.  However, the evidence for these views was incomplete, particularly with respect to the intrinsic connectivity of HVC, which had never been tested. I began my research with a tract-tracing experiment to test for a non-topographic pattern of intrinsic connectivity among HVC neurons. I found a highly topographic pattern of intrinsic connectivity – HVC neurons connect preferentially along the rostral-caudal axis, forming numerous parallel “swaths” of neurons aligned to the rostral-caudal axis of HVC. This organization suggested a potential parallel organization within the rest of the cortical pathway, which I subsequently confirmed: connectivity within the entire cortical pathway is massively parallel in terms of afferent (input) connectivity, intrinsic connectivity, and efferent (output) connectivity. If this parallel connectivity encodes the different spectral and/or temporal aspects of song in parallel, I hypothesized that parallel connectivity may emerge as a function of song learning.  To test this hypothesis, I developed a surgical manipulation to attenuate juvenile learning (disconnection of the avian basal ganglia). I found that attenuated song learning results in a loss of parallel input connectivity within the rostral-caudal axis of HVC. Overall, my results provide an anatomical basis for the parallel encoding of song, and further suggest that this parallel organization develops as a function of song learning.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The shortage of family medicine physicians is a predominant issue in the medical field. This dissertation investigates whether medical malpractice liability reforms impact defensive medicine among general practice physicians. The first chapter, “Medical Malpractice Liability Reform and Family Medicine Physician Supply,” explores the decision made by physicians to decline to provide care that has medical value in order to reduce the risk of malpractice liability. This analysis focuses on behaviors that affect family medicine physician supply by assessing the differential impact of states that adopt medical malpractice reforms compared to those without reforms from 1992- 2007. The reforms of bordering states are used in instrumental variables estimation to account for the endogeneity of reforms. These instruments are strong and valid. Results indicate that noneconomic damage caps, punitive damage caps, and collateral source reform increase the supply of family medicine physicians per state while joint and several liability decreases physician supply. Furthermore, this analysis distinguishes between temporary and permanent reforms and finds that only permanent punitive damage caps have a statistically significant impact on family medicine physician supply.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The second chapter, “Movement and Reorganization: Negative Defensive Medicine among Family Medicine Physicians,” measures the effect of liability reforms on practice choices of family medicine physicians including location, mode, and service offerings. Existing literature considers the effect of tort reforms on physician supply. However, physicians may employ defensive behaviors that may not be observed when testing for response at the aggregate level. For example, physicians may move from solo practice to group practice to share the liability burden. Physicians can also move their practice to a more defendant friendly legal environment by moving to a different state. They may also decline to provide certain types of care that are associated with a higher risk of medical malpractice suits, like obstetrical care. Using a random sample of family medicine physicians in the United States, this paper models these three choices using multinomial logit and fixed effects logit. Results indicate that family medicine physicians alter their choice of location and practice mode with the implementation of reforms in substantial ways.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Lastly, the third chapter, “Short-term and Long-term Effects of Liability Reform on Preventable Disease,” models the short-term and long-term effects of liability reform on two patient outcomes, obesity and type II diabetes. Reforms impact these patient outcomes indirectly through changes to both positive and defensive medicine strategies. Reforms that reduce malpractice pressure on physicians will also reduce the practice of negative defensive medicine. This increases access to care and will likely lead to an increase in prevalence rates, initially. However, over time as physicians counsel these previously untreated patients, changes will be made to diet, exercise, and lifestyle. If these changes are effective, patients may lose weight which will decrease the prevalence of obesity and the prevalence of type II diabetes. Models use differences-in-differences and state and time fixed effects to assess this hypothesis. Results indicate that reforms impact defensive medicine, especially avoidance behaviors, with no changes to patient health in the long-run.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this dissertation, I attempt to answer the question, what are the important factors that predict whether or not people will learn political facts?  I make the case that two mechanisms of motivated reasoning theory—confirmation bias and disconfirmation bias—have different implications for our understanding of the rationality of the general public. I argue that factual information is far more difficult to refute than the sort of opinion information that has often been studied in political and social psychology.  Consequently, differences in knowledge on these questions should be better explained by differences in information exposure (confirmation bias) rather than differences in the conscious or subconscious acceptance of encountered information.  Using laboratory and cross-sectional data, I test the components and implications of this theory.  Across three studies, I show that people are willing to update their beliefs about counter-attitudinal facts when they encounter them, and that differences in the media content of one’s information environment are far more predictive of knowledge than is partisanship.   I also show that people’s default factual beliefs in the absence of information are quite ephemeral and are readily changed when more certain information is provided.  In  totality, this dissertation adds to our understanding of the way that the mechanisms of motivated reasoning theory apply on questions of fact and offers a somewhat hopeful message for proponents of public rationality.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this research I explore the use of electric plucked chordophones in South Indian classical (Carnatic) music through a case study of the renowned Carnatic electric guitarist Prasanna Ramaswamy. Electric instruments are commonly discussed as a means to produce sounds otherwise impossible on their acoustic counterparts, and as instruments that encourage movement away from traditional to more popular genres. However, within Carnatic music, electrification has facilitated the adoption of two Western instruments, the guitar and mandolin, into the tradition: whereas the acoustic guitar and acoustic mandolin lacked the capacity to function as Carnatic melodic instruments, their electric counterparts have proven to have that capacity. Both are now accepted in the tradition and recognized as instruments capable of facilitating the performance of nuanced Carnatic music, equal in these regards to the ancestral South Indian plucked chordophone, the veena.  The major question addressed in this thesis, therefore, is how and why this has come to be the case.  That question is addressed through both source-based research and musical ethnography. Regarding the latter, the primary data for the study was gathered during a five-week period of intensive private guitar study and participant-observation with Prasanna. Through this research, I learned how Carnatic music is applied to the guitar and vice-versa, as well as Prasanna’s specific musical philosophy, which I refer to throughout as “musical practicality”: the idea that everything related to understanding music should always refer to the simple pleasure of enjoying musical sound. Beyond addressing how and why the electric guitar and mandolin are embraced in the Carnatic music world, I extend the discussion to examine how guitar technologies other than the magnetic pickup have contributed to the development of both the electric veena and mandolin.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Panamá arc activity has been divided into three episodes, the Late Cretaceous to Eocene episode, the Miocene episode, and the Pliocene to recent adakite suite. Rocks from the oldest episode are dominantly hornblende bearing, contain a large negative Nb-Ta anomaly, and exhibit enrichment of large-ion lithophile elements (LILEs). These characteristics are all indicators that the Late Cretaceous-Eocene episode rocks formed from a hydrous mantle wedge derived subduction zone magma. Miocene episode rocks are commonly calc-alkaline throughout Panamá. In contrast, Miocene episode rocks from the Panamá Canal (PC) are strongly tholeiitic, lack hydrous minerals, have a decreased Nb-Ta subduction zone signal, and exhibit LILE depletion relative to older PC volcanism as well as the older Panamá arc episodes.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>New major element, trace element, and radiogenic isotope data has been analyzed for rocks from the Western Canal Basin (WCB) between El Valle volcano and the PC. The rocks contain both calc-alkaline and tholeiitic signatures, and range from basalt to dacite in composition.  In terms of trace elements, the rocks exhibit enriched heavy rare earth element concentrations that are among the highest in all of Panamá.  The Ba/Yb values for WCB samples are between the depleted PC samples and fluid rich El Valle samples.  The WCB Ta/Yb values are similar to PC samples, with both exhibiting a lesser subduction zone signal than the Cretaceous-Eocene arc. On a V versus Ti tectonic discrimination diagram both PC and WCB samples plot in the MORB/BAB/CFB field. Pb and Sr isotope ratios for the Panamá Canal Basin rocks are similar to the Cordilleran arc, whereas Hf and Nd isotope ratios are the highest measured in all of Panamá and are consistent with the contribution of young asthenospheric mantle.  Overall, trace element, isotopic and geophysical data indicate that the western Canal basin volcanic rocks formed due to the influx of young juvenile mantle in an extensional tectonic system.  One explanation is the existence of an underlying tear in the subducted slab due to the ongoing collision of Panamá and South America.  This is consistent with the fracturing of the Isthmus as proposed by Farris et al. (2011), and a tear in the underlying slab would allow for the influx of young mantle material.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To place constraints on the crustal structure of the Canal basin, a series of gravity measurements were conducted.  Bouguer gravity models exhibit a series of westward deepening half-grabens filled with low-density volcano-sedimentary material.  Such horst and graben systems are interpreted to have formed due to extension in both east-west and north-south directions.  Sub-orthogonal normal fault systems reflect the extensional nature of the Panamá Canal Basin.  The models also indicate that 3 to 5 km thick volcano-sedimentary basins dominate the shallow subsurface, indicating that observed lavas are likely low in volume.  Finally, the gravity models show the existence of a continuous sedimentary basin across the isthmus, which allows for the existence of a narrow strait connecting the Caribbean and Pacific during this time as proposed by Collins et al. (1996).</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The aim of these studies is to determine spatial climatological effects on hurricane intensification rates. Previous studies have noted that the skill in predict a hurricane’s track has improved at a much greater rate than the skill to predict its intensity. There is even less research concerning hurricane intensification rates, let alone research done spatially and climatologically. Therefore, the research herein aims to understand what drives hurricane intensification rates. This is done by using spatial climatological analyses to determine the effects that intensity, sea surface temperatures (SSTs), ocean heat content (OHC), El Ni\~no--Southern Oscillation (ENSO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Madden--Julian Oscillation (MJO), and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) have on hurricane intensification rates.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Using both equal-area hexagons and raster techniques, hurricane track data is plotted spatially. SST, ocean salinity, and OHC values are also represented on a spatial grid. Finally, climate variables are represented temporally as mean yearly values. A generalized linear model from a gamma family and a logarithmic link function, as well as a full probability model are used to determine the effects that the variables of interest have on hurricane intensification rates.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>It is found that intensity has a positive effect on hurricane intensification rates with an average increase of 0.024~$\pm$~0.0032~m~s$^{-1}$ in intensification for a 1~m~s$^{-1}$ increase in intensity. SST is also found to have a positive effect on intensification rates with an average increase in hurricane intensification of 16\% for a 1$^{\circ}$~C increase in mean SST. It is also found that decreased salinity may have a positive effect on hurricane intensification rates by inhibiting vertical mixing. In the North Atlantic basin, it is found that the NAO has a negative effect on intensification rates of $-$0.18~m~s$^{-1}$~h$^{-1}$ per 1~SD, while ENSO and MJO do not have a statistically significant effect. In the Eastern North Pacific basin, it is found that both the NAO and ENSO have a positive effect on hurricane intensification rates, while the MJO and PDO do not have a statistically significant effect. Finally, in comparing the largest intensification rates during the most extreme NAO events in the North Atlantic basin, as well as the most extreme ENSO events in the Eastern North Pacific basin, it appears that rapid intensification (RI) may simply be normal intensification occurs over a longer time period.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>These studies confirm the previously held idea that warmer SSTs will lead to higher intensification rates. Along with this is the finding that the NAO has a negative effect on hurricane intensification rates in the North Atlantic basin. This was not something that was previously mentioned in the research. Finally, the idea that RI may not be due to small thermodynamic processes but instead normal intensification over a longer amount of time is an intriguing notion that deserves further analysis.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to explore and better capture the concept of choking under pressure by operationally redefining it. Choking was examined using a Bayesian approach to internal psychological crisis and the evaluation of the four psychologically meaningful time phases (beginning/ end 1st half and beginning/end 2nd half) of a basketball game. Fifty-three participants were randomly assigned into 2 groups (game half) to further evaluate performance decline and choking as a function of time, score gap, and game half. Within each group participants viewed 8 scenarios, which featured a different player making an error or experiencing some level of performance decline, and rated the extent of performance decline, the instance of choking, and the salience of various performance attributions to the error. The presence of choking was most salient in the 2nd half of the game, as hypothesized but participants identified an error as choking more frequently in the beginning of the 2nd half. This trend was also shown for participant perception of performance decline. Participant ratings of performance attributions however revealed that in the end of the 2nd half participants rated attributions, particularly time pressure and lack of concentration, the highest. These results provided solid evidence in opposition to the leading definition of choking and provided further evidence for better understanding of the complex phenomenon. The additional implications for this study and future research are discussed in detail.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This paper demonstrates a throughout study of Florida State University main campus distribution system, particularly for Stadium power distribution system. With the advanced power system analysis software, a refined distribution protection scheme is developed, which is very important for distribution planer and operators. Combined with data analysis method, all meter’s electrical data are collected for campus smart grid analysis. 3D data visualization also used in this research in order to provide the energy consumption model for university facility planners. Geographic data are also integrated to energy consumption model, which display clearly on the map. This project also constructed a part of campus distribution model, which provided a platform for the future’s campus smart grid research.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The dissertation manuscript Gog chronicles my experiences as a Jehovah’s Witness from a working-class family, investigating larger issues of poverty, religious persecution, and generational cycles of violence while also exploring the fraught relationship between art-making and religious belief in rural America. One of the main characters, Gog, as biblical harbinger of the apocalypse and symbol of religious fervor, antagonizes the speaker in dreams and visions.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>With the advancement in technology and the constant need for optimization, a lot of resources are directed towards analyzing information collected. This information is in the form of large amounts of data that is gathered at every instant. The analysis of this data is often expressed in the form of linear system equations, where the size of the equations increases proportionally to the size of the data. Many methods have been developed to solve these systems. The main challenge in solving such large systems is to get an accurate solution along with computational eciency. The goal of this thesis is to develop a method which addresses both accuracy and computational eciency in solving large-scale linear systems. Our method will improve existing iterative techniques particularly for a linear equation system i.e Ax = b where A is a positive denite and sparse full rank matrix. Linear systems of such kinds are commonly found in applications of Spatial regression. Hence, we will be using spatial data available publicly to test our method and present results of our method in this thesis.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>ABSTRACT</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Worldwide variations in homicide have been subject to debate, specifically in why these variations may occur.  This cross-national study makes use of data for 60 developed and developing nations from the World Values Survey data in attempt to account for worldwide homicide variations for the years 2009-2014.  Doing so provides a unique test of Messner and Rosenfeld’s Institutional Anomie Theory.  First, this study examines whether belief in the “American Dream,” or monetary success, in combination with weak commitment to legitimate means of achievement, significantly increases world-wide homicide rates.  Empirical results show that strong belief in monetary success is related to rates of homicide, but this relationship is not conditioned by weak commitment to legitimate means to achieve it.    </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Additionally, in examining belief in monetary success and weak commitment to legitimate means to achieve it, partial support is found for the idea that the criminal justice system can help to attenuate the positive relationship between belief in monetary success in conjunction with weak commitment to legitimate means to achieve it and homicide, with the outcome of decreased homicide rates.  This finding can be attributed to the fact that the criminal justice system serves “keep order” functions such as imprisonment and high police presence.  In a related vein, partial support is found for the notion that the military can help weaken the positive relationship between belief in monetary success in conjunction with weak commitment to legitimate achievement means and homicide.  Like the criminal justice system, the military plays a pivotal role in keeping order of its citizens by instilling self-control and discipline, which may vary by nations worldwide.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>“…we live in an age in which celebrity is often confused with greatness, in which a genius like Anders Eliasson – who lives as an ‘artistic monk’ – can fall completely through the cracks of public awareness. In a sane world, Anders Eliasson would be a household word.”</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	 — John-Edward Kelly </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Over the past 35 years, a large body of solo literature was inspired by the internationally renowned saxophone soloist, John-Edward Kelly (1958-2015), and yet a vast majority of these works remain unknown to the classical saxophone community. Among these works, Anders Eliasson’s music is some of the most significant. Relatively little has been written on the composer, but there is even less on his saxophone music. This treatise embodies an important first step in discussing the legacy of John-Edward Kelly by examining some of the most exciting music dedicated to him. It is the author’s intention that the works herein be adopted as standard repertoire. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Eliasson’s three works for saxophone are a superlative collection, deserving more performance and research than has been afforded thus far. It is hoped that this document will generate meaningful conversation, moving performances, the circulation of recordings, and further study of one of Sweden’s finest composers and his contributions to the instrument. These are works that every saxophonist should know and recognize as companions to the masterworks of other instrumental traditions.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Combining primary sources, historical information, and various analyses, this treatise will display the merits of Anders Eliasson’s saxophone music, providing a base-study for future performers and researchers. Without this effort, the greatness of such a composer and his critical contributions to the instrument might very well “fall through the cracks.”</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>As the United States becomes a more diverse nation, mental health professionals are seeing increasingly more clients from different cultures in their clinical practices.  Due to the ability of music to reach people in most cultural groups, music therapy is an ideal therapeutic modality for helping many of these multicultural clients.  The limited amount of music therapy-specific research literature regarding culturally sensitive counseling, in addition to the fact that the vast majority of music therapists are White females, has revealed a need for music therapists to explore multicultural issues and actively seek ways to become culturally competent in counseling.  This manual provides music therapists with a basic knowledge of select diverse cultural groups and, based on this information, suggests music therapy techniques that may promote the best responses from clients of these cultures.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Classroom instructional styles are a frequently discussed issue in education. Calls by professional organizations have encouraged teachers to take a more learner-centered approach to classroom structure. Research has shown that there are many benefits of a learner-centered environment. Historically, music ensembles have had a dominantly teacher-centered approach. The scope of the study was to determine what effects learner-centered instruction may have on a wind band performance, student attitudes, and student perceptions.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	A high school band was divided into two similar bands. The divided bands were assigned the same piece of music to rehearse for ten-minutes three times a week for six weeks. One band director was assigned a teacher-centered instructional style (control) and another band director was assigned a learner-centered instructional style (treatment). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Following the six week rehearsal period, high school band directors (N = 47) evaluated pre and post-test performances based on performance characteristics (note accuracy, rhythm accuracy, tone quality, intonation, expressiveness, and overall performance). The researcher conducted t-tests for statistical differences between the two bands. The study’s results indicated that there was a significant difference showing greater improvement toward the teacher-centered ensemble on all of the performance characteristics except rhythm accuracy where no difference between ensembles was reported. The results appear to be contrary to previous research. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Students rated their attitudes toward their band experiences using a pre-test and post-test questionnaire. The students in the teacher-centered ensemble indicated decreased class enjoyment and decreased anticipation to band class but the students did report increased musical enjoyment and at home practice. The students in the learner-centered ensemble indicated increased at home practice but decreased class enjoyment and anticipation to band. A report of decreased class enjoyment in the learner-centered ensemble does seem to be contrary to previous research. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Student perceptions of musical growth were compared between the teacher-centered group and learner-centered group. Students rated their musical growth as a result of their band rehearsals. The results were compared and no significance was indicated between groups. Suggestions on possible reasons why the present study appears to contrast previous research are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This collection of personal essays and short fiction investigates a post-9/11 America locked in forever war. Centered upon the American veteran and the veteran family experience, Anchor &amp; Knife showcases wide-ranging narratives that challenge conventional models of war literature by combining fiction and creative nonfiction genres into a single work as well as expanding the aperture of battle-scene focus to a much larger, holistic investigation of individuals searching for peace while wrestling with their culpability in violence. As important, this collection explores the close proximity of trauma, not only through the lens of war, but also in family, religion, sex, and popular American culture.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The link between socioeconomic status (SES) and health and mortality has been well-established, but evidence continues to suggest that this relationship begins in early life with parental SES.  There is evidence that allostatic load (AL) mediates the relationship between SES and mortality, and SES is inversely associated with AL across the life course (Seeman et al. 2004; Seeman et al. 2008; Hawkley et al. 2011; Evans &amp; Kim, 2012).  Existing longitudinal studies using biologically objective health outcomes are limited, and this study incorporates measures of both perceived stress and the body’s physiological response to stress, observed over time, in older adults.  Using the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP), this dissertation aims to fill gaps in the literature by exploring the associations between socioeconomic status across the life course, allostatic load, and mortality.  I examine 1) how SES in childhood affects SES, perceived stress, and allostatic load in older adults; 2) how childhood SES affects change in allostatic load over 5 years; and 3) if childhood SES indirectly impacts mortality risk through SES and stress in late adulthood.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Results add to existing findings by showing significant relationships between SES and mortality in late adulthood, with allostatic load and perceived stress partially explaining this relationship.  Results also contribute to the field showing an indirect relationship between childhood SES and allostatic load in late life.  Individuals who grew up in low SES households show significantly higher allostatic load scores in late adulthood.  This association is mediated mostly by educational attainment, but wealth also plays a role.  This study also provides two examples for studying allostatic load across two time points, and results show that childhood SES affects allostatic load change in a similar manner to a singular measure.  The findings highlight the importance of the association between childhood SES and adult educational attainment, as the effects carry over into many adult outcomes.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The demands of a global Cold War led the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and its successor organization, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), to forge unprecedented relationships with Catholics, Buddhists, and Muslims around the world in the fight against Communism. These religious groups offered valuable networks of information about and throughout geopolitical hot spots including Vietnam, Italy, and North Africa. In its strategic approach toward religious tolerance, the intelligence community drew on existing understandings of “foreign” religions in American culture even as it revised these understandings to be more useful to national security goals. From World War II through the early Cold War, American intelligence officers honed this approach in the context of two burgeoning discourses in American culture: a renewed attention to religious pluralism as well as a newfound national interest in “world religions.” The CIA’s use of these discourses reshaped the way in which religion was a central component of American identity and national security, at home and abroad.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of a literacy-based intervention on the conventional pretend play skills of preschool children who are visually impaired. The intervention involved experience books, real objects, story-reading, and role-play, which are common strategies used to teach children with visual impairments. A multiple-probe single case design across story sets was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention. Two participants completed the study, one with low vision and one with no functional vision. Free play sessions were conducted during each visit to measure the effect of the intervention on the dependent variables, which required the participant to generalize behaviors from the intervention sessions. Data were analyzed within and across participants. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para> Visual analysis showed an experimental effect with two of the three stories for the participant with low vision and no effect of the intervention with the second participant. A clear functional relationship was not demonstrated. Analysis of intervention sessions showed increases in the conventional pretend play of both participants, particularly the second participant, who showed no consistent change during free play sessions. Generalization to other material sets was not demonstrated.  Maintenance data for both participants were limited, but promising in that both participants showed at least one instance of increased conventional pretend play after the end of the intervention.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The findings from this study contribute to the knowledge of play skills of young children who are visually impaired. Additional research is necessary to further investigate the influence of each component of the intervention, the involvement of peers as play partners, and investigating other ways to experimentally measure pretend play.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This dissertation presents structure-specific descriptions of the optical properties and electronic relaxation dynamics of atomically monodisperse monolayer-protected gold clusters (MPCs).  The relaxation dynamics of electronically excited [Au25(SR)18]q, where q = 0 or -1 and SR = S(CH2)2Ph, were studied using femtosecond time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy. Nanoclusters excited by 400-nm light were probed using temporally delayed broad-bandwidth continuum probe pulses in both the visible and near infrared spectral regions, providing access to a wide range of transient spectral features. The use of NIR probe pulses allowed the relaxation dynamics of the excited states located near the HOMO-LUMO energy gap to be monitored in the probe step via the sp←LUMO and sp←LUMO+1 transitions. For the neutral nanocluster, the time-domain data contained three components: (1) a few-picosecond decay reflecting energy relaxation to semiring states, (2) a slower decay taking a few hundred picoseconds reflecting intersystem crossing and (3) a non-decaying plateau function arising from slow radiative recombination. The LUMO+1 state of the anion exhibited relaxation dynamics that were similar to those observed for the neutral cluster. By comparison, the time-domain data observed for the LUMO state contained only two components: (1) a 3.3 ± 0.2-ps decay and (2) a 5±1-ns decay.  The amplitude coefficients of each component were also analyzed. Taken together, the amplitude coefficients and lifetimes were indicative of an ~1.95-eV activation barrier to intersystem crossing for [Au25(SR)18]0. These data suggested that NIR ESA measurements will be instrumental in describing the relaxation processes of quantum-confined nanoclusters.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Temperature-dependent photoluminescence of structurally-precise Au25(SC8H9)18 and Au38(SC12H25)24 MPCs were studied using energy-resolved and intensity-integrated spectroscopy. Measurements were carried out at sample temperatures ranging from 4.5 K to 200 K following electronic excitation using 3.1-eV pulsed lasers. For both MPC samples, the global PL emission was composed of several components. Quantitative analysis of PL emission energies and peak widths indicated MPC relaxation dynamics are mediated by coupling to low-frequency vibrations associated with the ligand shell. Contributions from two different vibration modes were identified: Au-S stretching (200 cm-1) and Au-Au stretching (90 cm-1). Analysis of each PL component revealed that the magnitude of electronic-vibration coupling was state specific. The total integrated PL intensity of the Au25(SC8H9)18 MPC was correlated to the relative branching ratios of the emission components, which confirmed decreased emission resulted for recombination channels associated with strong electron-phonon coupling. These findings suggest that nanoscale structure and composition can be modified to tailor the optical properties and electronic relaxation dynamics of MPC nanostructures.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Magnetic field-dependent photoluminescence of structurally-precise Au25(PET)180 MPCs were studied using energy-resolved, and time-resolved spectroscopy.  Measurements were carried out at sample temperatures spanning the range of 4.5 K to 20 K following excitation with 3.1 eV laser pulses.  A polarization film was used to detect polarization-resolved PL, and the energy-resolved PL collected at positive and negative field polarities were used to construct magnetic circular polarized luminescence (MCPL) spectra. An analysis of the MCPL magnetization data yielded a Lande g-factor of g=1.05±0.04 for the 1.98 eV peak and g=1.7±0.1for the 1.78 eV peak.  The g-factor of the 1.78 eV peak suggests emission from a high-spin state.  The time-resolved MPL data were fit to a biexpenoential decay with a stretch parameter. An Arrhenius analysis of the 4.5 K field-dependent rate data identified a small energy barrier of 0.66±0.04 meV, which was interpreted as an energy gap between dark and bright states.  The temperature dependence of this energy barrier was attributed to thermal population of the upper state, reducing the effect of field-induced mixing.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Finally, magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy was used to study four MPCs spanning the size range of 2.4 nm to 0.9 nm, namely Au459(pMBA)170, Au144(PET)60, Au102(pMBA)44, and Au25(PET)18.  These MPCs were selected to span the size range over which the metallic-to-non-metallic transition occurs.  The MCD and absorbance spectra of Au144(PET)60 and smaller MPCs contained multiple peaks assigned as single-electron transitions involving superatom and ligand states.  The MCD spectra of Au459(pMBA)170 contained a single feature assigned to the localized surface plasmon resonance.  The Au25(PET)18 MPC was identified as the best candidate in this series of MPCs to investigate the nature of the superatom states.  For this MPC, the peaks at energies greater than approximately 2.2 eV were assigned as charge transfer while those at energies less than 2.2 eV were assigned as D←P transitions of superatomic core states.  Magnetization data from the peak at 1.90 eV yielded a g-factor of g=1.40±0.08 that was consistent with the theoretical value, g=1.33, predicted from superatom theory.  This to our knowledge represents the first experimental evidence that the HOMO state of Au25(PET)18 is accurately described as a superatom p-orbital.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Murine adenosine deaminase (ADA), a 40 kDa enzyme, catalyzes the hydrolytic deamination of adenosine to form inosine, enhancing the rate of the spontaneous reaction by more than than 1011 times the rate of the non-catalyzed reaction. This value is directly related to the enzyme’s affinity for the altered substrate in the transition state, Ktx, which is approximately equal to 49 aM. ADA was chosen as a model system to analyze transition state affinity and thermodynamics of activation because of its well-known mechanism and structure. Using spectrophotometric assays, the turnover rate, kcat, and catalytic efficiency, kcat/KM, of ADA were determined between temperatures 15-35 oC. By plotting the thermal dependence of the measured rates and applying the resulting kinetic values to the Arrhenius and Eyring-Polanyi equations, thermodynamic activation parameters for ADA catalysis were established. ADA reduces the free energy barrier for adenosine deamination by 16.2 kcal/mol. (ΔG‡ = 14.6 kcal/mol) greater than half the value of the non catalyzed reaction’s (ΔG‡ = 30.8 kcal/mol). The free energy barrier between the ground and transition states of ADA’s catalysis is comprised of a large enthalpic component (ΔH‡ = 11.4 kcal/mol) and a smaller entropic component (TΔS‡ = -3.2 kcal/mol). The free energy barrier between the unliganded and transition states, related to kcat/KM, was also measured, and was found to be equal to 9 kcal/mol This free energy barrier is made up of a 1.8 kcal/mol change in enthalpy and a -6.9 kcal/mol change in entropy. The results of this study highlight the high affinity of ADA for the transition state and its utilization of favorable changes in enthalpy and entropy to reduce the free energy barrier of activation.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Enzyme-substrate interactions between ADA and adenosine play a role in reducing the free energy barrier by providing interactions that can be used by the enzyme to discriminate the transition state from the ground state. The thermal dependence of catalytic rate constants were determined on a truncated substrate and a variant form of ADA to disrupt interactions that are postulated to play a role in transition state discrimination. One hydrogen bond between ADA and adenosine, specifically Asp-19 and adenosine’s 5’-hydroxyl moiety, is disrupted using a truncated variant of adenosine, 5’deoxyadenosine. When this interaction is disrupted, kcat decreases almost 2000-fold, and KM increases over 50-fold. These changes are reflected in a diminished affinity for the transition state, from 49 aM to 17 pM. Upon removal of the 5’ hydroxyl group, the activation barrier for deamination increases by 4 kcal/mol compared to the intact substrate.This large change in free energy is caused by a 4.2 kcal/mol increase in enthalpy, consistent with the loss of a hydrogen bond between Asp-19 and adenosine’s 5’hydroxyl moiety. When the Asp-19 residue is mutated to alanine, its interactions with adenosine’s 5’ and 3’ hydroxyl moieties are disrupted. The enzyme’s affinity for the transition state is decreased, although not as much as the elimination of adenosine’s 5’ hydroxyl group, to 480 fM. The free energy of activation of D19A catalysis of adenosine deamination appears to be closer to that of the native interaction (ΔΔG‡ = 2 kcal/mol). However, this minor change is comprised of a large unfavorable change in entropy, 9 kcal/mol, and a smaller favorable 6.8 kcal/mol change in enthalpy compared to the native reaction. This study highlights the favorable thermodynamic contributions that distant enzyme-substrate interactions make to discriminate for the transition state in enzyme catalysis.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The United States’ financial, diplomatic, and friendly relations with the Turkish government significantly contributed to the survival of Turkish Neutrality when faced with the Axis and Allies threat during the Second World War. The economic crisis in Turkey and the Axis and Allied Powers' pressure to join World War II put the survival of Turkish neutrality at stake.  While the United States' support was invaluable to the Turkish neutrality, the Allies as well as the Jews benefitted geographically, militarily, and strategically from Turkish non-belligerency. The United States recognized that the Turkish neutrality and its military mobilization in wartime served the Allies’ cause, especially during the dark days when Turkey stood between the Germans and the strategically vital oil resources and communication of routes of the Middle East. These mutual contributions have been largely overlooked in the historiography of the Second World War, as well as the scholarly works on Turkish-U.S. relations.  Most often, historians associate Turkish-American relations with the Cold War, but they have overlooked active American-Turkish relations in WWII.  Such relations are evident in the archival and printed primary sources.  Tracing the contributions of the United States through Lend-Lease Act and international conferences, it became evident that the United States contribution was very important to the Turks to maintain their non-belligerency. However, it is also evident that the Turkish government greatly contributed to the Final Victory by containing the German aggression. Furthermore, it was the very essence of this neutral policy that enabled the Turks to rescue thousands of Jews from the Nazi Germany.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This treatise primarily examines factors influencing why composers have elected to write for the harp in tenor arias and how composers have done so.  In doing so, this treatise traces the evolution of the harp from the simple lyre into the large and intricate instrument that it is today, in order to demonstrate how these mechanical advances influenced how composers incorporated it into tenor arias.  Musical examples have been selected based on the harp’s importance in the aria and the work’s place in standard repertoire.  The arias are arranged according to the harp’s thematic significance, not in chronological order.  Each aria example is accompanied by an explanation of the harp’s musical and theatrical relevance in the passage.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Perhaps most importantly, this treatise aspires to provide a resource to harpists as a primer for collaboration with accompanying vocalists.  For this reason, historically-informed performance practice tempos and dynamics as well as suggestions for fingerings, pedaling, and potential emendations have been added.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Views of the harp have been consistent for thousands of years, as evidenced by the surviving art of ancient Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Greek, and Chinese cultures, documenting their use of the harp.  In Western culture, the harp was an important transmitter of oral history and was a cultural symbol in Ireland and Wales.  In more recent history, harps and harpists have been perceived as being closely connected to both spiritually transcendent and earthly romantic love.  Perhaps drawing upon their own subconscious knowledge of the instrument through Greek mythology and the Bible, early music theorists seeking instrumental classification quickly assigned the qualities of nobility, beauty, and divine inspiration to harp music.  Over time, the persona of the traveling minstrel was imbued into the harp’s repertoire, and the harp came to symbolize the earnestness and romance of wistful troubadours.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>From opera’s very inception, harp music was an important component in tenor arias as an instrument with powerful mythological, religious, and class associations.  Most often, heroic roles in opera are given to the lead tenor.  Naturally, then, opera composers employed the harp to signify transcendent moments in a tenor’s character.  It was the harp’s historically-rooted and widely-recognized traditional symbol as an instrument of minstrels and bards, as a symbol of heaven, and as a motivic signifier of unshakable love, that composers drew upon. This near-universal recognition, when coupled with the basic pedal mechanism and other mechanical innovations to the harp, allowed composers to further utilize the superb, distinctive balance between the harp and the tenor voice. With some attention, composers might re-familiarize themselves with the harp, and utilize the same poignant and distinctive capacities of the harp, which have supported the extreme emotions of passionate love or utter despair in tenor arias for many years.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>A review of sport media on any given day seemingly includes news about an athlete involved in some type of questionable behavior, or what is likely referred to as a “scandal.” For example, consider the numerous stories published about Lance Armstrong’s denial then subsequent admission of using performance-enhancing drugs, or the stories about Tiger Wood’s marital infidelity. Despite what seems to be daily reports in the media about scandals involving athletes, empirical assessment of the impact of knowing about such scandals on sport consumers’ remains limited (Prior, O’Reilly, Mazanov, &amp; Huybers, 2013). With the viability and prosperity of commercially-oriented sport teams dependent on consumption by sport fans and spectators, it is important to ascertain the impact scandals involving athletes have on consumer behavior. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>There is anecdotal evidence that sport scandals have a negative impact on sport consumer behavior. There remains limited empirical research, however, examining the direct impact of sports scandals on sport team-related consumption patterns of consumers. This project was an attempt to investigate the impact of reported sports scandals on team identification and sport consumers’ sport team-related behavior intentions. Two objectives guided the research. First, ascertain whether on-field and off-field sports scandals have an impact on sport consumers’ team identification and sport team-related behavioral intentions. Second, assess whether a sport consumers’ level of team identification moderates the impact of on-field and off-field sports scandals on subsequent sport team-related behavioral intentions. A pretest-posttest quasi-experimental research design was used to collect quantitative measures of team identification and sport team-related behavioral intentions prior (pretest) and subsequent (posttest) to on-field or off-field sport scandal condition exposure. The results of the investigation are contradictory to anecdotal evidence. It was concluded from the results that irrespective of the type of sports scandal, sport consumers’ team identification levels and sport team-related behavioral intentions remained static subsequent to learning of a scandal. There was no negative spillover effect on the associated sport team.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Scaffolding is a type of instructional support that helps students to complete a learning task that exceeds their current ability. Scaffolding plays an important role in augmenting other instructional approaches, such as problem-based learning, and facilitates gradual shifts of responsibility from the more advanced others to the learner (Belland, et al., 2015). The process through which the scaffolding support shifts and eventually is removed is called fading. How to properly fade the scaffolds in order to better prepare students for a real world application task has not been extensively examined, especially with regard to computer-based instruction (CBI), when there is minimal or no instructor assistance. This study examined the effects of different fading approaches in CBI on students’ post-test performance, cognitive load, and test anxiety. The study population was pre-service teachers who practiced constructing concept maps based on real instructional scenarios.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Two different fading approaches were compared: gradual fading of scaffolds and sudden fading of scaffolds before an application task. The gradual fading condition presented the students with the fully scaffolded instruction during the first class session, less scaffolded instruction during the second class session, and no scaffold in their instruction during the third class session. Students took a post-test with no scaffold during their fourth class session. The sudden fading condition presented the students with fully scaffolded instruction for class sessions one to three, and removed the scaffolds entirely during their post-test class session four. It was hypothesized that students who received gradual fading would receive higher post-test scores, and report lower cognitive load and test anxiety levels during the post-test compared to students who received sudden fading.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>One hundred and four students enrolled in six sections of an undergraduate technology course agreed to participate in this study. Class sections were randomly assigned to either the gradual fading or the sudden fading condition. Data from 58 participants, who attended all four class sessions and experienced the entire fading progress, were used in the statistical analysis. Students of both conditions received the same direct instruction and pre-survey before the intervention, and repeated cognitive load surveys and test anxiety surveys during the four class sessions. Students’ post-test scores were recorded to reflect their performance.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>No significant differences were found between the gradual and the sudden fading conditions in students’ post-test performance, cognitive load levels, and test anxiety levels in each of the four different class sessions. Additional analyses yielded three findings. First, students in both conditions reported relatively high cognitive load and test anxiety from their learning experiences. Second, students who received sudden fading reported a significantly lower cognitive load in class session two compared to that in class session one. Third, students who received sudden fading reported significantly lower test anxiety during the post-test compared to their previous practice session.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The results of the study suggest that students who received gradual fading did not outperform students who received sudden fading. Fixed scaffolds, in general, do not support individualized learning and ill-structured problem-solving in CBI. In practice, if fixed scaffolds must be used, sudden fading may be superior to gradual fading condition in supporting students’ access of learning support in complex problem-solving, and in alleviating their test anxiety through fully scaffolded practices. These results contribute to the understanding and improvement of scaffolding design in CBI.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Mercury (Hg) in the environment has deleterious ecological and health affects for humans and wildlife and is primarily transferred to humans through the consumption of marine biota (USEPA, 2001).  These ecological and health concerns are exacerbated by the production of methylmercury (CH3Hg+; MMHg) in aquatic ecosystems. Sulfur isotopes (δ34S) are an indicator of the strength of sulfate reduction associated with MMHg production.  In chapter 1, we assessed the relationship between MMHg concentrations and reduced-sulfur stable isotope δ34S signals in four coastal consumer organisms (length = 26–75 mm) from Florida’s Big Bend seagrass meadows: pinfish (Lagodon rhomboides); pigfish (Orthopristis chrysopter); black sea bass (Centropristis striata melana); and shrimp (Tozeuma carolinense and T. serratum). We found a significant correlation between depleted δ34S signatures in fauna tissue (R2 = 0.27; p &lt; 0.001; total  n = 179) with higher MMHg concentrations. A correlation was observed in lower δ34S isotopic signatures and higher MMHg concentrations of consumers from the southern region of the study area indicating a “hotspot” of net mercury methylation in the sediments near Tampa Bay, Florida. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To better understand the sources of Hg to coastal pinfish and to assess the contribution of pinfish annual egress to offshore food webs, chapter 2 applies isotopic tracing (C, N, S) combined with mercury (Hg) concentrations and isotope ratios in sediments, juvenile pinfish, juvenile gag grouper (Mycteropera microlepis), and adult gag grouper and pinfish to assess exposure pathways of MMHg in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico. We found that pinfish from the northern and southern Big Bend regions had distinct Hg sources. Southern pinfish had enriched δ202Hg and, when combined with lower pinfish δ34S values and lower sediment δ202Hg values, suggested elevated microbial methylation/demethylation in the southern region. The southern, coastal pinfish exhibited similar Δ199Hg as offshore gag grouper suggesting pinfish from this region represent an important Hg source to offshore reef fish species and/or these two cohorts are exposed to the same Hg source. Results suggested that estuaries can be an important source of MMHg to adjacent, offshore commercially important reef species and confirmed the utility of Hg isotope analysis to identify multiple marine Hg sources and inform our understanding of the pathways of MMHg bioaccumulation in estuarine food webs.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the northern Gulf of Mexico (nGOM), the Hg cycle is further complicated by the influence of the Mississippi River (MR) and potentially confounded, since April 2010, by the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill. Approximately 3.0-4.9% of oil-derived carbon released during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill was deposited on the seafloor (Chanton et al., 2014; Valentine et al., 2014) causing local, but persistent, oxygen depletion (Kessler et al., 2011). In these low-oxygen environments, the formation of monomethylmercury (MMHg) is promoted and may have led to higher MMHg concentrations in commercially important reef fish species.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Expanding our research to include the entire nGOM shelf, slope, and the far-reaches of the deep Gulf canyons, chapter 3 explores Hg cycling using benthic and pelagic fishes as indicator-samples. Fish in the western study region appeared to rely more on benthic feeding, as indicated by enriched δ13C values and depleted δ34S values. Fish species closer to the MR plume had enriched δ15N and depleted δ202Hg and Δ199Hg values suggesting the MR influenced the nutrient and Hg cycle in the northeastern GOM. Cutthroat eels (~1,000 m) had higher MIF signatures than slope snake eels (~250 M) and, when combined with decreasing δ13C values with depth, suggested the presence of near-surface derived Hg in the deep DeSoto Canyon. Our results highlighted the importance of the deposition of Hg associated upper water column OM such as the marine snow pelagic carbon. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter 4 investigates whether more reducing conditions cause by DWH led to higher levels of mercury in commercially important reef associated organisms. We compared pre-spill (collected 2007-09) and post-spill (collected 2012) fish species of similar length from hard-bottom reefs on the West Florida Shelf. Light stable isotope analyses of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur was employed to assess feeding ecologies of those species exhibiting higher MMHg concentrations following the oil spill. Some species, like porgy, showed significant increase in Hg concentration. This increase may have been associated with a shift to a more pelagic, higher trophic feeding regime. The significance of this study is that it shows that the oil spill had an effect on the mercury cycling but that the effect is not uniform for each fish species.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study examines the connection between architecture and economy in Mycenaean Greece; it is a deep investigation of economic theory and models of the Mycenaean economy, existing methods for the study of prehistoric architecture, and particular Mycenaean structures. Over the course of the study, I present current thinking on the Mycenaean economy and fundamentally rethink the concept of economic embeddedness and human agency. With a novel theoretical grounding, I present a methodology based in human action to study the intersection of architecture and the Mycenaean economy, and in three detailed case studies, I apply the methodology to the Treasury of Atreus at Mycenae, the harbor town of Kalamianos in the Corinthia, and the Northeast Extension of Mycenae’s fortification wall.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	I argue that to advance the study of Mycenaean economy and theory, the concept of economic embeddedness, which posits that economic actions and decisions are bounded by larger social concerns, must be rethought. In its place, I offer a theory of complex embeddedness that envisions human action as fluid and cross-cutting traditionally circumscribed categories of economy, society, and polity. This foundation in human action with it links to agency theory helps to move the study of architecture away from the static sociopolitical meaning of the final built form and towards the human processes of construction. Under the guidance of this theory, I envision construction as a form of production in which individuals interact with one another and the material world to build a structure. I ultimately use the term architectural production to label this novel viewpoint.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	To study architectural production at a range where human actions and agency matter, I advance a methodology that draws together architectural energetics, chaîne opératoire, and tools from the construction management industry. I argue that architectural energetics offers a starting point for studying architectural production, but that existing applications of architectural energetics have placed too much weight on summed labor-costs and macroscale typologies. By reformulating architectural energetics with a focus on the chaîne opératoire, or operational sequence, and by using construction management tools to investigate the dynamic nature of the chaîne opératoire, I propose a method that builds on architectural energetics’ basis in labor-costs to explore the temporal and spatial configuration of architectural production. With the method, I reconstruct and detail processes of architectural production, model the ordering of human-centric production tasks and patterns of labor organization, explore timeframes for the completion of structures under different conditions, and isolate how active human agents move through space and time during architectural production.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	I apply the method to the Treasury of Atreus at Mycenae, the town of Kalamianos in the Corinthia, and the Northeast Extension of Mycenae’s fortification wall. For each, I collate published data and field observations to recreate the structures in 3-D CAD models, profoundly contemplate the entire process of production from the planning stages to the finishing touches, investigate the spatiotemporal configuration of labor during production, and stress the plethora of human choices and actions that occurred in the production of these structures. Finally, I fold my study of each structure into larger topics that engage models of the Mycenaean economy, including decision making and group interactions during architectural production, the creation of architectural monumentality and power, and the administration and compensation of builders. I argue for a networked view of the Mycenaean economy that builds on close range analyses of human acts of production; the acts of architectural production that I stress in this study were a complex and integral part of this networked Mycenaean economy.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Four supplementary PDF files are included with this study. They form part of the application of my methodology to the Treasury of Atreus at Mycenae, the harbor town of Kalamianos in the Corinthia, and the Northeast Extension of Mycenae’s fortification wall. The supplementary files (Supplements 1–4) are referenced in Chapter 7.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Understanding and predicting the inner-core structure and intensity change of tropical cyclones (TCs) remains one of the biggest challenges in tropical meteorology.  This study addresses this challenge by investigating the formation, structure, and intensity changes resulting from localized strong updrafts in TCs known as convective bursts (CBs).  The evolution of CBs are analyzed in high-resolution simulations of two hurricanes (Dean 2007 and Bill 2009) using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model.  The simulations are able to capture the observed track and peak intensity of the TCs.  With Dean, there is a slight lag between the simulated intensification and actual intensification, and the extreme rate of RI is not fully captured.  However, the cycle of intensification, weakening, and re-intensification observed in both TCs is captured in the simulations, and appears to be due to a combination of internal dynamics and the surrounding environmental conditions.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>CBs are identified based on the 99th percentile of eyewall vertical velocity (over the layer from z = 6-12 km) in each simulation (8.4 m s-1 for Dean, 5.4 m s-1 for Bill).  The highest density of CBs is found in the downshear-left quadrant, consistent with prior studies.  The structure of the CBs is analyzed by comparing r-z composites of azimuths with CBs and azimuths without CBs, using composite figures and statistical comparisons.  The CB composites show stronger radial inflow in the lowest 0-2 km, and stronger radial outflow from the eye to the eyewall in the 2-4 km layer. The CB composites also have stronger low-level vorticity than the non-CBs, potentially due to eyewall mesovortices. The analysis of individual CBs also confirms the importance of the eye-eyewall exchange in CB development, potentially by providing buoyancy, as parcel trajectories show that many parcels are flung outward from the eye and rapidly ascend in the CBs, with as much as 500 J/kg of CAPE along the parcel path.  In addition, the location of radial convergence seems to play a key role in governing the radial location of CBs.  Inner-core CBs seem to be associated with local convergence maxima in the eyewall, while CBs outside the radius of maximum winds (RMW) are associated with convergence maxima due to bands and/or secondary eyewalls.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Analysis of intensity change in the simulations shows that there are more inner-core CBs during times when the TCs are intensifying, while weakening/steady times appear to be associated with more CBs outside the radius of maximum wind (RMW), consistent with observational studies and theoretical work.  However, times when the TC has already been intensifying and continues to do so have more CBs than times when the TC has been weakening but then intensifies.  This suggests that CB development may not always be predictive, but rather may sometimes occur as a result of ongoing intensification.  On the other hand, rapid intensification (RI) in the simulations is found to be associated with an even higher density of CBs inside the RMW than slower intensification.  Lag correlations between CBs and intensity are calculated to investigate the time of the intensity response to CB development.  These calculations reveal a broad peak in correlation, with the CBs tending to lead pressure falls by 0-3 hours.  These results confirm the notion that convective heating inside the RMW is favorable for intensification.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The findings from this analysis show that eyewall CBs are driven by asymmetric dynamical processes in the inner-core region of TCs, both in and above the TC boundary layer.  In addition, the relationship between CB development and intensity change is indeed positive, sometimes in a predictive sense, and at other times while intensity change is ongoing.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Revising earlier historical interpretations of the Ghost Dance, this dissertation traces the religion’s emergence as an American Indian prophet movement and describes its intersections with evangelical protestantism and Mormonism in the Far West from the mid-nineteenth century to the late-twentieth century. This project problematizes earlier studies by taking a longer view of Ghost Dance religion and incorporating its engagement with and resistance to protestantism and Mormonism into the narrative. It also seeks to correct interpretations that focus solely on the Ghost Dance’s 1890 manifestation and the violence of federal suppression at Wounded Knee, thereby eliding the movement’s broader cultural context before and after the massacre. By examining the confluence of historical encounters, political forces, and the perceptions they engendered, this study distinguishes Ghost Dance religion from other American Indian prophet movements and demonstrates how its 1890 and 1973 manifestations marked crisis points in American history through which national authority was exerted and thereby consolidated. By reconceptualizing American history through Native American history, this dissertation also discloses the union of religion and politics at work in the Ghost Dance and the prophetic traditions of its major competitors as they sought to enshrine their own versions of American nationalism in the West. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The first chapter of this project aims to situate its contribution by discussing how reactions to the violence at Wounded Knee in 1890 shaped the historiography of the Ghost Dance movement and constrained interpretations of the movement in significant ways. Chapter two traces the emergence of Ghost Dance religion to the activity of the Bannock Prophet and his efforts to forge an alliance between American Indians and Mormons in opposition to U.S. rule at the start of the Utah War in 1857. Chapter three details the general war against whites in the West that results from the collapse of Bannock and Mormon efforts to unite as a single people through their perceived prophetic affinities. Through the examination of this conflict, the study reveals how religious identities are performed through violence – a process that results in the emergence of highly politicized and racialized national identities. Chapter four connects manifestations of the Ghost Dance in the late 1860s and early 1870s to this tradition of spirited resistance to U.S. authority, demonstrating how Ghost Dance adherents ordered their opposition to white rule through a powerful fusion of religious and social realities that galvanized collective identity and motivated action to create a new world. Chapter five adds to this discussion by narrating Ghost Dance manifestations of the late 1880s and early 1890s within this context to reveal the revolutionary potential inherent in Wovoka’s prophetic ministry. This focus works to erode lines between militancy and quietism as well as politics and religion drawn in earlier studies, revealing how prophetic religion functions to create and to sustain national identity. The final chapter investigates the persistence of Ghost Dance religion into the twentieth century, tracing its history through the Saskatchewan Dakota’s New Tidings community and the American Indian Movement’s 1973 takeover of Wounded Knee. In examining how both groups express their connection to the radical millennialism of the nineteenth-century Lakota Ghost Dance, this study reveals how prophetic religion works to mediate political engagement in complex ways and further confirms the union of religion and politics within the Ghost Dance movement.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Oceanic core complexes (OCCs) are the uplifted and rotated footwalls of detachment faults formed at areas of slow spreading on mid-ocean ridges. Detachment faults initiate close to the spreading axis, and because it is easier to continue slip along the existing fault rather than break a new fault, a cross section of lower crust and upper mantle material is eventually exhumed and rotated (Blackman et al. 1998; Tucholke et al. 1998; Schouten et al. 2010). Classic corrugated massifs, noncorrugated massifs, rafted blocks, and newly identified finely corrugated detachment surfaces at 16.5º N on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge have been observed using near-bottom bathymetry data, underwater Sentry surveys, and photographs from the WHOI Towcam (Smith et al. 2014).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Active detachment faulting currently only occurs on the western flank of the ridge in the study area, which extends from 16°18'N to 16°55'N and encompasses two spreading segments. Since detachment faulting occurs on ridge segments where tectonic extension is greater than magmatic accretion, it is useful to examine the composition of melts from the underlying mantle to investigate potential mechanisms controlling the shift to a ridge being dominated by tectonic extension and detachment faulting rather than by magmatic accretion. Here, I discuss the results of major element, trace element, and isotopic analyses for MORB, and show that prolonged slip along detachment faults is the consequence of melting an extremely depleted, variably enriched mantle source which supplies little melt to the ridge.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This study followed eight Black teachers and highlighted their battles with interpersonal and institutional racism in China.  Individual interviews were held with eight co-researchers and five high level administrators.  Data was also gathered in two focus groups.  The data was then analyzed using phenomenological reduction.  Once methods were identified we asked our co-researchers their opinion on the methods, specifically if they found it effective or not.  The study found that Black teachers utilized four methods for dealing with racism in China; 1.  Retaliate, 2.  Ignore, 3. Educate, 4. Assimilate.  The most successful strategy for dealing with racism and discrimination was ignoring it because all of the co-researchers shared the same goal of either trying to gain employment or keeping their job.  The least successful was retaliation because it added to the co-researchers sense of helplessness.  Furthermore, the study proposed five steps that Black teachers and all foreigners can follow to better prepare themselves for the workplace in China: 1) Brace yourself for discrimination and understand the system that you will be living and working in. 2) Appearance matters in China.  3) Have a Chinese advocate.  4) Network with foreigners already in China.  5) Have the proper credentials.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Dog Training Programs have recently become a popular rehabilitative program within correctional facilities. They are present in all 50 states as well as many other countries. However, the empirical literature on the effectiveness of these popular programs is sparse. Using a cohort of inmates released from Florida prisons between the years of 2004-2011 (n=181,547) this study examines the effectiveness of dog training programs on prison misconduct, post-release employment and recidivism. Findings indicate that participation in a dog training program can lead to reductions prison misconduct and reductions in the likelihood and timing of re-arrest. Among those who participated in dog training programs, longer duration, recency of participation, continuity of treatment and being in the program at release emerge as predictors of reductions in prison misconduct and re-arrest and increasing obtaining employment upon release. Due to promising findings, policy implications are discussed as well as potential avenues for future research.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Of the Out of Style takes its title from Jimi Hendrix’s afrofuturist proto-prog rock masterpiece “1983…(A Merman I Should Turn to Be).” As a collection the poems, as Hendrix puts it in song, “take a last look / at the killing noise / of the out of style.” That killing noise in both Hendrix’s lyrics and hopefully these poems can be understood as white domestic, political, and poetic space. And as such, the poems attempt to address their own role in the demarking of that space. And so again like Hendrix the motifs of science fiction are employed to refuse, alter, or abandon those spaces all together. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Informed greatly by Susan Sontag’s writing on science fiction film, at times even quoting her directly, the poems adopt and co-opt the many tropes of the genre outlined in her essay “The Imagination of Disaster.” However, throughout the collection science fiction is positioned as both a form of resistance literature and a proponent of white capitalist patriarchy. Subversive works by Mina Loy, Douglas Kearney, and Andrew Joron are cited just as canonical stories by HG Wells, HP Lovecraft, and Jules Verne are critiqued. This juxtaposition is key to the project of the manuscript as a whole, as it reflects the complex relationship between the white male speaker’s love of an inherited canon, in both literary and popular culture, and the desire to resist it. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This agitation is borne out in process, as most of the poems appropriate language from these various and often oppositional sources. Poets including the aforementioned as well as Sir Thomas Wyatt, Wallace Stevens, John Ashbery, Adrienne Su, Catherine Wagner, Wanda Coleman, Sonia Sanchez, Amiri Baraka, and Fred Moten appear alongside dialogue from Jack Kirby’s first volumes of The Silver Surfer and The Eternals. Excerpts from the screenplays for Planet of the Apes (‘68), AKIRA, The Shinning, and Interstellar are also included as well as lyrics from The Eagles, Kanye West, Sam Cooke, Busta Rhymes, and the astroblack jazz of Sun Ra. This act of sampling is at once in conversation with the methods of production in both the literary avant-garde and the traditions of hip-hop, while also attempting to interrogate the role of appropriation, or theft, as well as the erasure of the other in the creation of white art.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The title poem opens with a line from Ashbery’s “The One Thing That Can Save America.” Often cited as the poet commenting on the seemingly impenetrable and private nature of his more abstracted poems, the line “I know that I braid too much on my own / Snapped-off perceptions of things as they come to me” is used here instead to comment on the white perspective often privileged in contemporary poetry, indicting both Ashbery and the speaker of these poems. However I also view this act as one of salvage, as the poem goes on to steal from another great personal inspiration, the Californian punk band Bad Religion, who also failed to address issues of race or gender in their thirty year career as white male activist musicians. And so the poem both equates them with Hendrix’s “killing noise / of the out of style,” while appropriating their language to address it. In this way, through many of these poems, I attempt to reclaim genuinely admired yet undeniably problematic white art and put it in the service of dismantling the privileges from which it benefits.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This range of sampled material helps to give the poems’ form a texture reflective of the various tensions in the source texts by creating in their accumulation an array of polyvocal speakers struggling to reconcile their personal cultural interests, aesthetics, and politics with the paradoxically invisible yet ubiquitous and central position of their identity.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation is a collection of short stories that take place in Vietnam and the United States. The stories are small in scope: narrated in either the first-person or close-third person, they are centered on the family and romantic relationships of the Vietnamese female characters who are, for different reasons, social outcasts yearning for connection with others and for a place in the world.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The stories follow different literary traditions and are eclectic in forms: while “Mr. Sa’s Buddhas” is written in the traditional narrative style of realistic fiction and “Chi Hai and Other Maids” reads like a personal essay, with articles of journalism and commentaries on social issues, the remaining three stories deal with a different kind of realism. The form and theme  of “In the Province of Rã Na” are similar to those of the supernatural Chinese tales of ghosts and evil animals turned humans; “Haunted,” in which the supernatural element in the form of a ghost is accepted by the main character as part of reality, blends the magical and the realism perfectly, in the tradition of magical realism fiction; and “Full Mount” reveals a grotesque situation stemming from the character’s mental instability as a result of her alienation, a story with many of the gothic elements of the southern gothic genre, but without the southern setting.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation studies empowered consumer (EC) driven changes to B2C sales interactions. ECs are characterized as having high levels of information, awareness, and power for specific purchase interactions (Labrecque et al. 2013). Despite popular acceptance that salespeople must develop new sales approaches to be effective with ECs, limited conceptual (e.g., Jones, Sundaram, and Chin 2005; Rapp et al. 2014) and empirical (e.g., Leigh et al. 2014; Verbeke, Dietz, Verwaal 2011) research explores this area. Therefore, despite the importance of this topic, the marketing literature does not yet offer much insight for either management practice or theory development. To address this need for research, Essay 1 “starts at the beginning” and empirically tests the effectiveness of traditional sales influence tactics with ECs. Then, Essay 2 empirically tests how knowledge brokers effectively communicate attribute-specific information and scarce knowledge to ECs.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Essay 1 introduces the construct of “informedness” to measure a consumer’s empowerment as he or she enters a sales interaction. Informedness is defined by the essay as “the consumer’s perceived information level for a specific purchase decision prior to the given purchase event.” The results of Essay 1 indicate two overarching findings salient to the interaction of ECs and salespeople. First, the EC (high informedness) enters a sales interaction willing to buy (β = .57, p &lt; .001, R2 =.33), yet the relationship with purchase is non-significant (i.e., no purchase). Essay 1 employs the theory of dual routes of persuasion (Petty 198) to classify salesperson influence tactics and hypothesize how ECs will respond based on their elaborative nature. The results provide the second, and arguably most interesting, finding of Essay 1. Elaboration inducing influence tactics, expected to improve a salesperson’s likelihood of “closing a sale” with an EC, are not supported (i.e., the salesperson’s attempts to increase purchase are not effective), while elaboration inhibiting influence tactics are supported (i.e., salespeople can have a negative effect on purchase). In short, the findings suggest that for ECs, who initially intend to purchase, salesperson use of traditional influence tactics is not effective, or worse is detrimental. However, post-hoc analysis does reveal that the influence tactics perform as expected for non-ECs (low informedness), which indicate that this approach still holds merit for less informed consumers. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Essay 2 pursues an answer to the “if traditional sales influence tactics don’t work, what does work with ECs?” question suggested by the results of Essay 1. Thus, the concept of the salesperson as knowledge broker is examined. Knowledge brokers are salespeople who take a holistic view of the consumer’s situation, assess it, and add scarce (missing) knowledge to recommend an optimal solution (Rapp et al. 2014). Specifically, Essay 2 focuses on new ways, unique to ECs, for salespeople to exchange information and to make recommendations to ECs, which is required of a knowledge broker. The results provide support for all but one of Essay 2’s hypotheses and make three important empirical contributions to the empowered consumer and knowledge broker literatures. The first theoretical contribution is to apply regulatory focus theory to ECs. Hypothesis 1 finds that EC perceived informedness levels have a positive and significant relationship with a prevention regulatory focus. The second contribution is that salespeople can be effective as knowledge brokers through use of the underlying mechanisms of regulatory focus theory. Hypothesis 2 adds empirical support for the mechanism of item-specific, or EC attribute-specific, information as an effective means of value creation with ECs. The third contribution is explicating the conceptual idea of scarce knowledge with results that indicate the interaction of attribute-specific information and “challenge” scarce knowledge lead ECs to greater acceptance of salesperson recommendations than other approaches. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para> In addition to scholarly contributions, sales managers should be very interested in the findings of this research. The findings of Essay 1 indicate that for ECS, traditional application of influence tactics is not effective. Essay 2 offers managers a starting point to realize why their salespeople are failing with ECs who are prevention focused. The findings of Essay 2 suggest that, to be effective with ECs, salespeople should change their traditional needs analysis approach to a “determinant attributes” analysis approach with a focus on exchanging attribute-specific information. Finally, Essay 2 offers evidence that challenging ECs to “fix” information and application errors will lead to greater acceptance of salesperson recommendations. Overall, managers should find the results of this research useful as they strive to understand what a knowledge broker is and how their salespeople can act in this new sales role with ECs.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>As the Arctic warms, the ~277 Pg of carbon stored in permafrost peatlands faces an uncertain fate. Arctic and Subarctic peatlands are likely to release more methane (CH4) as permafrost thaw releases formerly-frozen carbon, thaw-induced land subsidence and inundation lead to anaerobic conditions, and higher temperatures allow more rapid decomposition. In addition to these effects, CH4 and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions may also change due to shifts in plant inputs and consequent changes in organic matter quality, but the exact relationships between organic matter and CH4 production are not well understood. In this study, we examined microbial CH4 and CO2 production and their relationship to organic matter chemistry in Stordalen Mire, a thawing Subarctic peatland in northern Sweden. We also used stable carbon isotopes (δ13C) of CH4 and CO2, and their apparent fractionation factor (αC), to examine the effect of thaw on the proportion of methanogenesis by hydrogenotrophic or acetoclastic pathways. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>At Stordalen, permafrost thaw causes dry, aerobic permafrost plateaus (palsas) to collapse and become inundated. These wet depressions are then colonized first by Sphagnum mosses and then by sedges as permafrost thaw and plant succession progress. In our study, we examined a chronosequence of sites with varying permafrost status and plant community composition. These sites included dry, intact palsas; recently-thawed collapsed palsa sinkholes; partially-thawed Sphagnum-dominated bogs; mostly-thawed poor fens with a combination of Sphagnum and tall sedges; and fully-thawed rich fens with mature stands of tall sedges and no Sphagnum.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The changes in potential CH4 and CO2 production along the thaw progression were examined with anaerobic peat incubations, which were all performed with identical temperature and water saturation. These incubations showed increases in potential decomposition rates and CH4/CO2 production ratios along the thaw progression. Methanogenesis pathways also shifted from predominately hydrogenotrophic to acetoclastic, as revealed by lower αC in fens. These shifts are consistent with increasing organic matter bioavailability along the thaw progression, which was confirmed by analyses of peat and dissolved organic matter (DOM) chemistry. These analyses showed that compared to collapsed palsas and bogs, rich fens had lower peat C/N ratios, higher peat humification rates (as determined by Fourier-transform infrared [FTIR] spectroscopy), and more labile DOM compounds (as determined by Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry [FT-ICR MS]).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The validity of these incubations for revealing trends in in situ CH4 and CO2 production was determined by comparison with dissolved CH4 and CO2 in field-collected pore water. The incubation CH4/CO2 ratios were compared to both the raw pore water CH4/CO2 concentration ratios, and to the pore water CH4/CO2 production ratios estimated with an isotope mass balance model. In both cases, CH4/CO2 ratios were higher in the incubations than in the pore water; however, the same increases in CH4/CO2 with thaw were observed in both cases. Incubation and field pore water αC were also compared. Incubation αC values were slightly higher than field αC, but αC decreased with thaw in both the incubations and the field. We thus conclude that incubations can reliably estimate relative CH4/CO2 ratios and αC between different sites, though their ability to estimate absolute CH4/CO2 and αC is limited.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The changes in DOM chemistry along the thaw progression were examined more closely with a combination of elemental composition (via FT-ICR MS) and optical properties (via UV/Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies). These techniques revealed that the presence of dense Sphagnum moss, which is abundant in collapsed palsa, bog, and poor fen sites, is the main driver of DOM elemental composition and optical properties at Stordalen. Compared to rich fens, DOM from sites with Sphagnum had greater aromaticity, higher average molecular weights, and greater O/C ratios. These properties suggest a higher abundance of phenolic compounds, which are released by Sphagnum and may inhibit decomposition at these sites. In contrast, rich fen DOM had greater saturation, lower O/C ratios, greater N/C and S/C ratios, and optical properties suggesting a higher proportion of microbially-derived DOM.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Overall, our results suggest that the changes in plant community due to permafrost thaw at Stordalen lead to greater organic matter lability and higher CH4 production. In inundated sites, these changes are primarily driven by the disappearance of Sphagnum as partially-thawed sites transition to fully-thawed rich fens. Similar plant successions have been observed in other peatlands with thawing permafrost, highlighting the potential importance of these shifts in driving future northern peatland greenhouse gas balances. Future models of climate feedbacks in permafrost peatlands should thus take into account any changes in plant community composition, especially changes in Sphagnum cover, as permafrost thaws.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of the study was to examine the emotional reactions of music therapy students to simulated auditory hallucinations and music.  Eighteen music therapy students (13 female, 5 male) participated in the study.  After signing a consent form, participants were randomly assigned to either the control (auditory hallucination simulation) or experimental (auditory hallucination simulation with music) group.  Participants completed a demographic survey, PANAS (Watson &amp; Clark, 1988) pretest, listened to eight minutes of respective audio, and then completed a PANAS (Watson &amp; Clark, 1988) post-test.  Results were analyzed using two independent t-tests to test for significance, one for positive affect post scores and one for negative affect post scores.  No statistically significant results were found.  However, there was a noticeable difference in the mean scores for negative affect post scores.  The results suggest that music may have assisted in preventing a larger increase in negative affect in the experiment group.  Future research should include a larger sample to test for possible significance.  Likewise, future researchers should implement similar studies with populations actually experiencing auditory hallucinations to explore the potential for development of emotion regulation interventions using music therapy.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation explores and describes the in-character and out-of-character information worlds and digital literacy practices of role-players, those that create and enact their characters’ or avatars’ stories, both within and outside of WildStar, a Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) (Carbine Studios, 2015).  Utilizing Jaeger and Burnett’s (2010) theory of information worlds alongside the Partnership for 21st Century Learning’s (2011a) framework for information, media, and information communication technology literacy skills as lenses for qualitative content analysis, the researcher describes the social context(s) of the digital literacy practices used by role-players.  These skills are crucial for success in the 21st century, in general, as well as in the virtual worlds of MMORPGs due to the amount of information and research needed to advance through the game (Martin, 2011, 2012; Martin et. al, 2012; Partnership for 21st Century Learning, 2011a). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para/>
            <DISS_para>This study employs a hybrid ethnographic approach, which is multi-sited and adaptive to allow for a closer following of the research phenomenon and the opportunity to explore emergent behaviors, is accelerated and data intensive, and includes overt engagement in role-playing activities alongside informants in addition to traditional observation.  Qualitative data was collected from in-game chatlogs, screenshots, audiovisual recordings, and a sampling of community artifacts, such as forums and other community-mediated websites. Additionally, 17 sets of semi-structured interviews were conducted both in- and out-of-character to better understand the intersections between the informants’ real and virtual lives.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The findings both confirm and expand upon previous work on the social aspects of digital literacy practices of MMORPG players.  Role-playing, as a social and creative activity, is highly dependent on the effective exchange of information.  This exchange of information is impacted by the social norms, information values, and boundaries within and across the community.  For instance, out-of-character information or disputes should never find their way into an in-character dialogue unless it has been previously discussed during role-playing events or storylines, or unless consent has been granted by both parties involved beforehand.  Intuitively, the digital literacy practices of role-players consist of a symbiotic interaction and combination of the normative information behaviors and information value systems of the community.  This reinforces the contextual nature of digital literacy and may suggest that issues with the transference of digital literacy skills for use across different settings, such as academic, work, personal, etc., are due to conflicting information value systems despite potentially similar types of information or information behaviors being used.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>As the first study to apply the theory of information worlds to an ethnographic study of role-players in a MMORPG, the researcher evaluates and potentially expands upon the theory in order to determine its usefulness given the research context and methodology.  Additionally, the methodological complications caused by the competing aspects of a study dually tasked with creating a detailed description and protecting the informants of a small and open online community are discussed.  Finally, the researcher also discusses how role-playing might be used in the library or classroom for digital literacy skills instruction.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>While a very few death penalty studies find that the death penalty has the deterrent effect on homicides, the majority of the studies do not find. These contrasting and inconclusive findings raise an important question as to why the death penalty has little or no deterrent effect on homicides. As Phillips and Hensley (1984) pointed out, failure to find solid evidence of the deterrent effect may occur for one of two reasons: (1) either a deterrent effect can theoretically exist, but it does not actually exist, or (2) the methods used to find the deterrent effect are not sophisticated enough to reveal it. Theoretically, the deterrent effect of the death penalty could be achieved quickly and last only for a very short period of time (Andenaes, 1952; Phillips and Hensley, 1984). It is plausible that the deterrent effects of executions become strongest when the number of newspaper and television coverage of execution reaches its peak one day before and after an execution. However, as several researchers have repeatedly suggested that most of the past studies have employed annual and monthly homicide data (Donohue and Wolfers, 2005; Hjalmarsson, 2009; Katz, Levitt, and Shustorovich, 2003). In short, the main methodological limitation of the previous studies is that use of annually aggregated crime data may miss any deterrent effect in studies of the death penalty on homicides that are short-lived, that the number of killings deterred is too small to be detected excessively long temporal units such as years or months.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The primary goals of this research were (1) to test whether an execution reduce murders on given day in the given state, (2) to assess whether an publicized execution has a deterrent effect on homicides on the given day in the given state, and (3) to determine whether the results of the analyses 1 and 2 remain consistent with temporal, regional, demographic and non-capital punishment variations. Data are collected from the Mortality Detail Files including the exact dates of homicides from January 1, 1979 through December 31, 2006. This study reveals a statistically significant deterrent effect of executions on homicides on the day of an execution. Some remote significant deterrent effects of execution on the days 5 and 6 afterward could not be interpreted as genuine deterrent effects because this pattern of the deterrent effects has nothing to do with the patterns of newspaper and television coverage of executions. However, this study find no evidence indicative of the deterrent effects of publicized execution on homicides. In addition, this study finds no evidence of a brutalization effect of executions on homicides. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>        In summary, the evidence suggests that executions do cause the homicide rates to drop, but only to a very small degree. It appears that, in the aggregate, the small number of executions carried out in a typical year in the United States has very little impact on the recent declines in the number of homicides. The robustness tests confirm the earlier findings, leading to the overall conclusion that executions do affect the behavior of prospective killers, but only for a very brief period of time in a modest way.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation re-contextualizes the types, uses, and meanings of reliquaries in the Middle Byzantine period (843–1204). Relics are the remains of—or the materials associated with—Christ, the Mother of God, apostles, martyrs, and saints. For the faithful, they were the physical presence of the divine, imbued with miraculous power and grace. Reliquaries are the containers that enshrined, protected, and displayed this sacred matter. They are/were made of lavish materials—gold, silver, gems, and pearls—which conferred honor upon, and testified to the spiritual value of, the contents.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Numerous Middle Byzantine reliquaries survive or are known through textual descriptions, but there has not been a study that examines these objects as a group. This dissertation fills this gap, charting out a paradigm for understanding the forms and functions of these objects. I take as my focus those reliquaries inscribed with metrical inscriptions, or epigrams. These texts provide a great deal of information about reliquaries, and they served a variety of functions—as ex-voto prayers, as expressions of identity, as performative texts, and as descriptions of the objects that they accompany. I demonstrate that epigrams are also visual, functioning as but one part of the reliquaries’ complex visual programs in which word, image, and sacred matter converge, complement, and interact with each other. I examine the mechanisms of these interactions, revealing the messages they conveyed on behalf of the patrons and the ways in which reliquaries and epigrams functioned in the artistic and literary culture of Byzantium.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter 1, “Introduction,” defines the critical terms of this dissertation, presents an overview of the scholarship, and outlines my methodological contributions. Chapters 2 and 3 introduce the reader to the forms and functions of reliquaries in the Middle Byzantine period, and are thus the foundation for the dissertation. Chapter 2 outlines the different types of reliquaries that were inscribed with epigrams. It presents aspects of their design and form, including imagery and the placement of the epigrams. Chapter 3 provides a brief historical survey of the various contexts in which reliquaries were used, from personal possessions to public veneration practices. Chapters 4–6 focus on epigrams. Chapter 4 examines the ways in which epigrams—both in content and placement—function to make relics visually and haptically accessible to the faithful. Chapter 5 explores the relationship between reliquary and metaphor. What are the ways in which the ekphrastic character of epigrams describes, interprets, and presents reliquaries for and to their owners? Chapter 6 situates reliquaries in the context of religious gift-giving by addressing the various ways in which a patron articulates his/her identity, connection with a holy figure, and what he/she hopes to receive in return. Chapter 7 presents my conclusions concerning the forms of reliquaries, relic accessibility, viewer interpretations, and patron motivations. The Appendices catalogue the 74 Middle Byzantine reliquaries inscribed with epigrams.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The case studies I present in these chapters demonstrate that Middle Byzantine reliquaries with epigrams are/were a complex system of texts, images, relics, and materials that interact with each other. I demonstrate that epigrams—in addition to being textual—have visual and spatial dimensions, wrapping the exterior, interior, front, back, and sides of reliquaries. They are dynamic texts that pulled the viewers in and taught them how to see, interpret, and handle the reliquaries, and how to access relics.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The trickster is a well-known and thoroughly studied mythological figure. Therefore, this thesis will not seek to further define the trickster figure, but rather take the trickster figure of Norse mythology, Loki, and uncover his unique qualities which can then be translated into abstract features used in what I call, the “Loki model.” The Loki model provides a means of interpretation through which one can analyze a text or other work. In the case of this thesis, I will analyze three German texts and one American film to demonstrate the Loki model. The abstractions of the Loki model include: chaos, abstemiousness, cunning, and destruction. These qualities are ways of abolishing an order or breaking the status quo to undermine systems and create new worlds. The structures that are reshaped through chaos and language destruction are those of human nature and society.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study explored whether guided reflection using predetermined prompts can enhance preservice teachers’ development of technology integration self-efficacy (TISE) beliefs. A quantitative approach and a quasi-experimental, pre- and posttest design with two experimental groups and a control group were used. Two types of guided reflection prompts were designed for the experimental groups: future time reflection (FTR) prompts and near time reflection (NTR) prompts. These two different types of reflection prompts focus on different temporal perspectives.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Ninety-three participants were recruited from an undergraduate educational technology course, containing six sections, at a large southeast public university. Intact class sections were randomly assigned to one of three conditions. Participants in the control condition responded to prompts that did not ask for reflection, while participants in the FTR and NTR conditions responded to prompts that directed them to reflect on their experiences and write about technology implementation from two different temporal perspectives (i.e., future professional practices versus recent learning) in order to facilitate self-assessment and greater awareness of their strengths and weaknesses in regard to technology integration.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The results of the study revealed no significant effect of reflection on TISE, and depth of reflection did not have a significant impact on the development of TISE. In addition, different temporal types of guided reflection prompts did not yield different degrees of TISE. While the quantitative results did not show the treatment effect on TISE, the analyses of open-ended questions revealed that the process of reflection can be helpful in analyzing and synthesizing information learned in the classroom. Thus, reflection may foster TISE if one understands the concept and its value. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Based on these findings, several possible reasons why the results did not match the expectations and suggestions for future research are offered. This study attempts an initial exploration of a potential relationship between use of reflection and TISE as well as the application of future-time reflection, both of which are issues that received only limited attention in empirical studies. It is the researcher’s hope that this work will encourage a greater research effort toward these complex issues.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>College prices have risen at a dramatic pace, with tuition increasing over 200% since 1989. Federal and state aid programs have long provided support to students' efforts to cover the costs of college; however, some argue that aid programs inadvertently contribute to pricing increases, suggesting that institutions leverage financial aid programs by raising prices to capitalize on the guaranteed revenue from aid programs. The purpose of this study is to determine what effect state-sponsored, merit-based scholarships have on higher education pricing. The study examines the implementation of and subsequent changes to Florida's Bright Futures Scholarship Program at public and private four-year institutions. Grounded in Revenue Theory of Costs and Neo-institutionalism, this study approaches Bright Futures with the assumption that institutions constantly seek new revenue to spend all their revenue on educationally-purposeful activities that increase institutional prestige.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Using data from IPEDS, the Census Bureau, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and other sources, this study uses difference-in-differences to estimate the effects of Bright Futures implementation and adjustment on tuition and fees, room and board, and institutional grant aid. The study's main finding is that net of institutional and state covariates, public institutions in Florida respond to the implementation of Bright Futures by increasing tuition and fees as well as room and board. Public institutions also increase grant aid spending in response to the program. This study also provides evidence that private institutions reduce tuition and fees in response to Bright Futures implementation. Finally, this study examines the effects of the 2010 shift in the Bright Futures award structure away from a guaranteed percentage of tuition and fees, finding that the award shift has no discernible effect on the pricing measures.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The study of melt miscibility and structure-property relations of different types of polyolefins provide an important pathway to material design for different applications. In this work we study melt and crystalline properties of blends of iPP and isotactic propylene-1-hexene (PH) random copolymers with 11 and 21 mol% 1-hexene, (PH11, PH21). Three types of blends are studied, namely PH11/PH21, iPP/PH11 and iPP/PH21. The study of melt miscibility using thermodynamic estimations coupled with experimental data from DSC, DMA, and AFM techniques indicate that blends of iPP/PH11 and PH11/PH21 are miscible in the melt while blends iPP/PH21 are immiscible. Depending on crystallization conditions, iPP and PH11 may crystallize in monoclinic (α) or mesophase, and PH21 crystallizes in the trigonal phase exclusively. The effect of isotactic sequence length distribution (ISLD) on polymorphism and crystallization kinetics was quantitatively studied in miscible PH11/PH21 blends. An enhanced rate of formation of trigonal phase with increasing PH11 was attributed to the increasing composition of 1-hexene in the melt during evolution of the monoclinic phase in the first stage of isothermal crystallization of the blends. The rate of crystallization of iPP in miscible blends of iPP/PH11 decreases with increasing content of PH11, but it is independent of blend composition for immiscible iPP/PH21 blends, as expected.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The addition of only 25 wt.% of an elastomer such as PH11 or PH21 to iPP decreases slightly the level of crystallinity, from ~70% in neat iPP to ~60% in the blend; however, blending leads to a dramatic effect on the tensile properties of iPP, i.e. makes the brittle iPP to be ductile at room temperature. The crystallization of iPP from homogeneous melts leads to an interconnected crystal network and elongations of ~ 600% in blends with 25% PH11, while lack of connectivity in melt immiscible iPP/PH21 blends lowers strain to ~ 450%. In-situ WAXS-tensile experiments indicate that the significant ductility and strain hardening behavior observed in iPP/PH copolymers are accompanied by a significant polymorphic transformation of monoclinic to mesophase under deformation of miscible iPP/PH11 blends, and by additional trigonal orientation in blends of iPP/PH21.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>While the immune system is extraordinarily complex and powerful, and medical advancements are more spectacular than ever, in recent history we have seen the unfortunate failure of both processes (immune system and drugs) in the increasing levels of persistent infections. This work is an example of a collaborative effort to study multiple forms of persistent infections using mathematical tools and analyses. We will discuss the biological backgrounds for the immune system’s components and functions, the bacterial and viral resistance mechanisms for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and the human immunodeficiency virus, respectively, and some of the current methods for treating these diseases. Then, using ordinary and partial differential equations we present the results of models that were created to study specific infections—namely, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus osteomyelitis, Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage, and human immunodeficiency virus prophylactic gel. These models are shown to be in good agreement with the biology by looking at, when possible, their analytical solutions and numerical results when compared to experimental evidence. We further explore these models using several different computational analyses that can be classified as at least one of the following methods: uncertainty quantification, sensitivity analysis, and data assimilation. We give an overview of each of these topics and delve into the technicalities and caveats of each of the analyses we apply. We show that all of the methods presented, individually and in concert, are valuable tools for not only revealing details about the model structure and verifying model robustness, but they can also bring to light elements of the biological phenomena that the model represents. While considering all these details, throughout the manuscript we consider the philosophical perspective of biological modeling and modeling in general.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Advances in nonlinear optical spectroscopy have been employed to investigate interactions between nanostructures and electromagnetic energy. These efforts are directed toward the larger goal of optimizing the structure of photonic nanoparticle assemblies for the use and control of energy at the nanoscale. Statistical localization methods are combined with nonlinear optical microscopy to form the basis of Nonlinear Optical Localization using Electromagnetic Signals (NOLES) imaging, which has been used to locate nonlinear signal hot spots within a plasmonic network with nanometer spatial accuracy. Initial studies aimed to utilize plasmon amplification in gold nanoparticle dimers to understand how different experimental parameters affect the achievable localization accuracy. It was found that energy matching between the laser excitation source and the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) in conjunction with incidence polarization angle of the source was critical for achieving the high localization accuracy.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Phase-dependent NOLES imaging is an extension of NOLES imaging in which different polarization states of light are used as the excitation source. In this way, it is possible to study chiro-optical properties of structures using circular dichroism measurements. Asymmetric gold nanobowtie structures were first examined with this method. It was found that these chiral structures generated a circular dichroism response. Further experiments employed continuous polarization variation measurements to determine the relative magnetic dipolar and electric dipolar contributions to the observed nonlinear optical (NLO) signal. The results demonstrated that both chiral image contrast, which resulted from left and right circularly polarized excitation, and the corresponding localization precision were dependent upon the relative magnetic dipole/electric dipole ratio (G/F). For example, left-to-right image enhancements of over 400% were obtained for bowties with the highest G/F ratio.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>These different polarization states of light were created using a pulse replica generator (PRG). This optical device, composed of wedges of birefringent materials, generates phase-locked, orthogonally polarized pulse replicas with a computer-controlled inter-pulse time delay. Sub-cycle temporal delays were introduced to reliably and easily create left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized light for second harmonic generation (SHG)-detected circular dichroism measurements. Using the PRG, the chiro-optical properties of deterministically constructed nanolens assemblies—homodimers, heterodimers, and heterotrimers (three nanoparticles arranged with cas- cading size)—were investigated. Experiments on these different structures revealed a systematic increase in the observed circular dichroism response going from homodimer to heterodimer to heterotrimer. Additionally, the nonlinear hot spot in the heterotrimer was determined, with NOLES imaging, to have a polarization-dependent location, which indicates that the large nanosphere in the assembly acts as an antenna to efficiently collect and direct energy toward the smaller nanoparticle constituents.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In addition to studying SHG from these nanoassemblies, two-photon photoluminescence (TPPL) was examined in order to determine the origins of the circular dichroism response in the materials. Through a combination of dark-field spectroscopy and linearly polarized TPPL measure- ments, it was determined that the photoluminescence was mediated by the plasmon. TPPL-detected circular dichroism measurements were performed, and the results agreed well with the circular dichroism response observed with SHG-detection. These results, in combination with one-photon photoluminescence measurements, suggest that interference between higher-order, quadrupolar plasmon modes in the large nanoparticle constituents and dipolar plasmon modes in the smaller nanoparticle constituents gave rise to the circular dichroism response.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Not only can the pulse replica generator be used to perform phase-dependent NOLES imaging, but it can also be used to perform time-resolved microscopy. It has been used to investigate plasmon dephasing in a series of gold nanorods with different aspect ratios. Dephasing times for resonant plasmon modes were extracted from analysis of interferometric TPPL and SHG data. These results showed that the dephasing time increased from 22 ± 4 fs to 31 ± 9 fs as the LSPR resonance energy decreased from 1.76 eV to 1.53 eV, as a result of less efficient plasmon damping due to the interband scattering for lower energy resonances.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Femtosecond two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) was used to determine superatom state-resolved dynamics of the Au25(SC8H9)18- monolayer-protected cluster. By examining time-dependent cross-peak amplitudes for specific excitation and detection photon energy combinations, electronic relaxation dynamics, mediated by specific superatom states, were distinguished. Using 2DES, hot electron relaxation (200 ± 15 fs) within the superatom D manifold of lowest-unoccupied molecular orbitals was differentiated from hot hole relaxation (290 ± 20 fs) in the superatom P states.

            <DISS_para>Nitrate (NO3-) and uranium (U) are priority co-contaminants at U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) managed nuclear legacy waste sites, where nitric acid was extensively used to process uranium waste. This combination of a low pH and mixed metal contamination in a subsurface environment is also representative of legacy nuclear waste sites worldwide. The subsurface at DOE's Oak Ridge Integrated Field Scale Research Challenge (OR-IFRC) site is heavily contaminated with NO3-, radionuclides, heavy metals, and halogenated organics. NO3- concentrations in the near source zone (adjacent to the former S-3 ponds) reaches extraordinarily high concentrations (in the range of 10-1000 mM). Extensive research and field scale experiments have focused on ways of removing nitrate and recognize microbially-mediated denitrification as the most significant process in bioremediation and natural attenuation strategies. However, high levels of contamination decreases diversity of cultivable and non-cultivable bacterial populations in OR-IFRC groundwater, and low pH can inhibit denitrification activity. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Denitrification is a microbially mediated dissimilatory reduction of nitrate to produce gaseous end products (N2O, N2). Denitrification is mediated by a group of facultative anaerobes including bacteria, fungi and archaea which display a wide range in phylogenetic affiliation and metabolic capabilities. Though nitrate respiring microorganisms have been studied extensively in soils and aquatic environments, the mechanisms controlling in situ metabolism of NO3- reduction remain poorly understood in terrestrial aquifers. The relationships between environmental factors (e.g. geochemistry, contaminant, pH), denitrifying community composition, and denitrification rates are intertwined and complex. Hence, the main objective of this dissertation was characterization of the microbial community mediating denitrification and understand their mechanisms and controls in a radionuclide contaminated terrestrial subsurface. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The objectives of Chapter 1 were to extensively characterize microbial diversity and composition in acidic to circumneutral subsurface groundwater samples (pH 3.1-7.1) using a polyphasic approach. Multivariate analyses with geochemical and contaminant variables, and microbial community indices, showed the groundwater pH had the strongest effect of any variable on these communities.  Our pyrosequencing survey of microbial diversity across the watershed has provided an initial insight into the large-scale distribution patterns of microbes in this unique environment, with greater variability in physical and geochemical attributes. The community was strongly dominated (&gt;80%) by Proteobacteria, most of which fell into the Gamma-, Beta- and Alpha-Proteobacteria, and community composition was driven primarily by differences in diversity of the proteobacteria. This study also confirms that Gammaproteobacteria as the most dominant taxa with correlation to low pH, with Rhodanobacter sp. as the predominant genus. Furthermore, the data indicates that: (1) the diversity of microbial communities, more specifically that of Gammaproteobacteria is affected by the measured geochemical variables more notably pH, NO3-, N2 and TOC; (2) the diversity of Alphaproteobacteria and Deltaproteobacteria were higher in low contaminant wells; (3) pH appeared to be a strong predictor of relative lineage abundance with samples with low pH levels (pH &lt;4.5) clustering separately from those with moderate pH values and (4) bacterial assemblages identified included genera related to known nitrate, U(VI), sulfate and Fe(III) reducers and fermenters. Bacterial SSU rRNA gene copy numbers did not change significantly between circumneutral pH groundwater samples and low pH samples. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In Chapter 2, we report for the first time fungal communities characterized in a uranium and nitrate contaminated subsurface environment and also the potential contribution of fungi to contaminant transformation (nitrate attenuation). The abundance, distribution, and diversity of fungi in subsurface groundwater samples were determined using quantitative and semi quantitative molecular techniques, including quantitative PCR of eukaryotic small-subunit rRNA genes and pyrosequencing of fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions. Potential bacterial and fungal denitrification was assessed in sediment-groundwater slurries amended with antimicrobial compounds and in fungal pure cultures isolated from the subsurface. Our results demonstrate that subsurface fungal communities are dominated by members of the phylum Ascomycota, and a pronounced shift in fungal community composition occurs across the groundwater pH gradient at the field site, with lower diversity observed under acidic (pH&lt;4.5) conditions. Fungal isolates recovered from subsurface sediments, including cultures of the genus Coniochaeta, which were detected in abundance in pyrosequence libraries of site groundwater samples, were shown to reduce nitrate to nitrous oxide. Denitrifying fungal isolates recovered from the site were classified and found to be distributed broadly within the phylum Ascomycota and within a single genus of the Basidiomycota. Potential denitrification rate assays with sediment-groundwater slurries showed the potential for subsurface fungi to reduce nitrate to nitrous oxide under in situ acidic pH conditions.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A concerted field-scale effort was undertaken to test the hypothesis that the microbial denitrification is stimulated by pH adjustment due to the alleviation of low pH stress and/or metal toxicity at the OR-IFRC site (Chapter 3). Sediment and groundwater samples were collected over a year, and microbial enumeration by DAPI counts and MPNs, SSU rRNA gene amplicon pyrosequencing, potential metabolic rate measurements for denitrification and oxygen consumption and geochemical analysis were used to evaluate the shifts in community composition as a function of pH manipulation. The potential denitrification rates measured for contaminated sediments prior to pH manipulation ranged from 0.39 nmol gdry wt-1 day-1 to 8.70 nmol N2O-N gdry wt-1 day-1; and denitrification optima was observed at pH 5.5 with maximum potential rates of 156.9 nmol N2O-N gwet wt-1 day-1. Addition of base resulted in an increase of groundwater pH from 3.5 to 5.5 in the injection well (FW128). However, little or no change in pH was observed in down-gradient wells. Similar trends were observed in total bacterial and denitrifier counts such that total bacterial numbers decreased with change in pH and over time. Potential rates were variable but generally decreased with time in those wells where the pH substantially increased after base addition. Shifts in community composition were observed, and addition of base resulted in a strong selection of a limited number of microbial groups, predominantly of phylum Proteobacteria. The results from this study demonstrate that the denitrifying community is sensitive to perturbation and responds slowly to pH elevation. A relatively rapid pH increase may act as a stressor that inhibits microbial activity over the short term of this study.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this study, I reconsider the term, “Mycenaean,” and its social significance. As a starting point, I utilize the essential qualities of the term’s definition: a group of individuals living in mainland Greece during the Late Helladic period. Because the use of this term implicitly distinguishes the organization of such individuals from the previous and subsequent epochs, I also seek a social group that was organized uniquely relative to the periods that bookend it. With this stated goal, I consider identity during a broad chronological period, Early Helladic III to Protogeometric, in mainland Greece and compare the reconstructed social networks diachronically.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In order to identify past social groups, I develop a new methodology that employs a behavioral approach to the analysis of domestic architecture. The integration of social groups is maintained by the performance and recognition of shared practices in the context and environment of interaction among the members. Thus, a high degree of correspondence of behaviors related to the daily lived-in environment, i.e. domestic architecture, can reveal networks of individuals constituting a daily social group. With this, I examine 458 domestic structures excavated in mainland Greece each for evidence of 180 individual aspects of architectural construction and spatial organization. I then consider the overall correspondence of such direct behaviors and behavior-guiding attributes, together named Behavioral Aspects, and the mean values for individual construction techniques. With these data, I reconstruct social networks during each phase of the study period and comment on social organization and architectural change during the study period.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the end, I identify a Late Helladic social group that is uniquely organized relative to the preceding and subsequent epochs. In Late Helladic II to Late Helladic IIIC, individuals in mainland Greece become integrated into a single social group. Prior to this period, the behavioral correspondence analysis indicates the existence of two separate social groups that cohabitated many settlements. These groups were most distinct in Early Helladic III, but became increasingly integrated over time. Following the Late Helladic IIIC period there is a demonstrable fragmentation of the social network and a different spatial organization of the domestic architecture. This suggests a social crisis of some sort and the incorporation of new behaviors and perceptions of built space during the Protogeometric period. Such a sudden process of change appears to be the result of multiple causes, including isolation, population movement, and the introduction of outside groups. With all of this considered, the unified social network and conservatism of building traditions in LH II to LH IIIC attest to a unique social organization and stable social relations within mainland Greece, qualities of the defined “Mycenaean” social group.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to examine the coaching experience in charitable cause-based endurance training programs, in which participants receive coaching to complete a marathon or similar endurance athletic event in return for raising funds for a charitable cause. In particular, the purpose of this study was to investigate the nature and extent of coach burnout in this setting, and their correlated factors. Male and female coaches (n = 150) from six different endurance sports participated in this study. Their average reported age was 50.94 years (SD = 10.01) and their average years of coaching in the charitable setting was 6.76 (SD = 4.77). They completed four questionnaires: a demographic questionnaire, the Areas of Worklife Survey (Leiter &amp; Maslach, 1999), the Basic Psychological Need Satisfaction scale (Deci &amp; Ryan, 2000; Deci, Ryan, Gagné, Leone, Usunov, &amp; Kornazheva, 2001), and the Maslach Burnout Inventory (Maslach, Jackson, &amp; Leiter, 1996). Items in these last three questionnaires were modified, with permission, to more specifically reflect the charitable coaching setting.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Path analyses indicated that basic needs played a relatively minor mediating role between worklife satisfaction and burnout, compared with the direct effects of both the AWS and BPN dimensions. In particular, BPN emerged as an important direct predictor of burnout rather than a mediator.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study was, to my knowledge, the first to examine the coaching experience in the charitable setting. It was also the first to present a model of the coaching experience that combined two separate lines of research: worklife satisfaction in relation to burnout, and the satisfaction of basic psychological needs as presented in self-determination theory. It is hoped that this model will have applications to coaching in other settings, as well as to other areas in sport and exercise psychology. In addition, this is one of the few studies to examine any aspect of the charitable cause-based endurance training phenomenon, despite the fact that this phenomenon has now been in existence for over 30 years, and has successfully induced millions of beginner athletes around the world to complete long-distance endurance events such as marathons. Therefore, this study helps to address a research gap regarding the success of these programs in motivating individuals to pursue large-scale fitness goals.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this dissertation I explorer the role of inactivity in the social science laboratory, looking at how it affects subjects and their behavior, and I look into some alternatives. In chapter 3, I look at how experimenter imposed activity affects subject behavior in three simple economic environments: a Dictator Game, a Voluntary Contributions Public Good, and a Gamble Selection task. I find very little to no change in behavior in any of the environments as a result of the inactivity. In chapter 4, I look at the same three economic environments, but manipulate the source of the inactivity so that it is now partially the result of other subjects’ actions. In this situation, I find some evidence that inactivity affects subject behavior in the Dictator Game, and strong evidence that it affects behavior in the Public Goods environment, but no evidence that it effects risk preferences. In Chapter 5, I use a novel setup to take a direct measure of the value subjects have for inactivity. I find that subjects are willing to forgo positive wages to avoid inactivity. In Chapter 6, I look at possible alternatives to inactivity and elicit subjects’ valuations of each activity across different lengths of time. I identify two activities whose value I cannot show to be significantly different from zero, and whose value does not change significantly across different lengths of time.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The prevalence of social media in the past few years has changed the way people consume entertainment media and generated many new types of hybrid media entertainment experiences. This dissertation focuses on one of its multiple manifestations: social TV. Although several qualitative studies have suggested that live posting enhances viewers’ media entertainment reception, few studies actually tested the proposition based on a rigorous research design. In addition, previous experimental research on live posting often assumed that live posting is a rather popular media behavior among young TV viewers. However, the actual popularity of and the motivation behind the behavior remain largely unknown. Against this background, the overarching goals of the dissertation project were 1) to explore the motivation and popularity of live posting among college student; 2) to test the effect of live posting on entertainment TV viewing experience through an innovative experimental method; 3) to identify the key variables that are underlying the mechanism of entertainment effects of live posting; and, 4) to examine a proposed live posting and entertainment model. To that end, five studies were conducted. Result of Study 1 and 2 confirmed that live posting is a popular media behavior (85.7%) among a college sample and helped to establish a 19-item measure of motivations for live posting, encompassing five constructs labeled interaction, community, catharsis, engagement, and extending enjoyment. Built upon these results, two experimental studies were conducted. Study 3 demonstrated that live posting matters, as it affects viewers’ media entertainment reception. Implications for the results are discussed in detail. Study 4 focused on the effect of “treatment strength” utilizing a randomized control trial with live-tweeting frequency vary at three levels. Results indicated that live-tweeting frequency had a significant impact on viewers’ program enjoyment; however, such effects were not linear. Study 4 also served as a preliminary study investigating the associations between the content of live tweets and program enjoyment. As a final step to the dissertation, Study 5 was conducted with a primary focus on the content of live tweets and other sub-components of live-tweeting behaviors. Findings suggested that both live-tweeting content and other features of live-tweeting are associated with program enjoyment.  To conclude, the last chapter reconsidered some of the theoretical issues embedded in the live-tweeting phenomenon and offered a set of well-tuned propositions regarding the entertainment effects of live posting.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>More and more educational institutions have been moving towards delivering courses and programs at a distance. Although asynchronous online courses overcome the constraints of time, students feel isolated due to the lack of real-time communications. One possible solution to overcome this isolation been suggested that learner’s online behavior and peer-interaction will be more regulated and stimulated by assigning roles to learners in discussion activities. Additionally, roles encourage learners to take more responsibility for their own learning by responding to discussion questions, replying to peers, constructing knowledge, disputing and negotiating with peers within amount of time during the learning process. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The study explored the use of the Starter-Wrapper with Roles technique in a fully online class in order to address the overarching question: How does the Starter-Wrapper with Roles technique support sense of community in an online class? Three supporting research questions were addressed: (1) How do students fulfill their assigned roles when using the Starter-Wrapper with Roles technique? (2) How does each of the four roles contribute to student experience in terms of sense of connectedness, sense of learning from others, sense of learning through articulation, sense of learning from course materials, and sense of responsibility? (3) How does the interdependence of roles and role rotation support sense of community? </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>There were 81 students initially signed up the study, however, the number was down to 63 by the end of week 8. I then adjusted discussion groups in order to have a sufficient number of participants in each discussion group. Among 63 students, there were 37 students actually participated in the discussion and 26 student never participated. There were 33 students completed the survey and 18 students participated in the interview at the end of the semester.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The results indicated that (1) students generally followed the duties assigned to them. However, not everyone completed their tasks on time, and depending on their assigned role the effect could be problematic. Almost all starters initiated discussion questions and completed their task on time. Even though most wrappers performed their tasks as expected and on time, some wrappers did not summarize at all. Moderators interacted with participants in the midst of discussion primarily by restating details in previous posts and providing feedback on others’ ideas. They posted messages on time but did not posting enough messages. Participants were more willing to respond to discussion questions than reply to their classmates’ responses. (2) Students reported different levels of sense of connectedness, sense of learning, and sense of responsibility depending on the role they fulfilled. Participants reported a significantly higher sense of connectedness and perceived learning from articulating ideas in their posts than starters. Compared to the wrapper, moderator, and participant roles, starters reported lower perceived learning from others. Furthermore, the starters’ learning was most dependent on the course materials, and the wrappers’ learning was the least dependent. Finally, Starters experienced a significantly higher sense of responsibility in that role than as a wrapper, moderator, or participant. (3) Students reported a higher sense of community when their classmates mentioned each other by name, answered their questions, or commented on each other’s posts rather than make individual posts. (4) Interdependent roles and roles rotation provide students diverse learning experience and experience interdependence in different ways (e.g., to depend on others, to have others depending on them). Students depend on their classmates to participate when using the Starter-Wrapper with Roles technique. Participants need the starter to begin the discussion by posting a discussion question, moderators need the participants to respond to discussion questions so they can contribute their replies, and the wrapper needs to read everyone’s messages in order to wrap up the discussion.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This study examines the military’s process of selecting trumpet excerpts used for audition screening along with performance preparation advice for the top ten most commonly requested excerpts within the premier military bands in the United States of America: The Pershing’s Own Marine Band, The President’s Own Army Band, The U.S. Navy Band, The U.S. Air Force Band, and The U.S. Coast Guard Band. The first step in this process is to collect as many audition lists for trumpet as possible and compile them into a single chart. This chart will display every excerpt that is being requested by each of the five premier bands and will also display which trumpet excerpts are requested by multiple bands. From this chart, the top ten trumpet excerpts will be confirmed and sent to members of the premier military bands along with a short four-question survey designed to help understand why these ten excerpts are being requested over others. Using the information gathered from the survey, a learning approach will be provided, suggesting how best to prepare the excerpts for auditions.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Over the past four decades, the rate of incarcerated for US women has increased more than 700%. Although the rate of incarceration for US men has also increased dramatically, incarcerated women differ from their male counterparts in several key ways. Incarcerated women are more likely than incarcerated men to have less than a high school diploma (or equivalent), to be under- or unemployed, to have experienced homelessness, to be living in poverty at the time of their arrest, to have custody of minor children, and to come to prison with untreated physical and mental health issues (Bloom et al., 2004; DeHart, 2008). The largest disparities are reported on measures of drug use and drug crimes and experiences of interpersonal victimization (Belknap, 2007). The Gendered Pathways Perspective (GPP) identifies victimization as an important pathway to criminal behavior for women and girls, as approximately half of incarcerated women report being first arrested as juveniles, many of whom were running away to escape abuse. Incarcerated women and girls also indicate that they use drugs and alcohol, in some measure, to cope with their experience of violence (DeHart, 2009; Fuentes, 2014; Messina &amp; Grella, 2006). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Incarcerated women report much higher rates of victimization than women in the community, with estimates suggesting that more than two-thirds of incarcerated women have experienced either physical or sexual abuse in childhood (e.g., Kennedy, Tripodi, et al., 2015). However, there is evidence that experiences of victimization are rarely mutually exclusive, but rather that victimization tends to cluster for some individuals and in some environments (Finkelhor et al., 2007b). Although robust relationships between childhood polyvictimization (defined as multiple, cumulative forms of direct and indirect interpersonal violence) and a variety of criminal offending, re-victimization, mental health, and substance misuse outcomes are reported using samples of youth (e.g., Cyr et al., 2012; Ford et al., 2010), our understanding of how polyvictimization relates to these outcomes for incarcerated adult women is less clear.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The current project examined polyvictimization and five interpersonal and behavioral health outcomes among a probability sample of 39 incarcerated women held in a state prison in Florida. The outcomes of interest were intimate partner violence victimization (IPVV), current incidence of dissociation, psychosis, and posttraumatic stress, and substance misuse in the year prior to incarceration. These outcomes were chosen because they are associated with women’s crime, increase the risk for suicide attempts and interpersonal conflict during custody, and have been linked to recidivism after release (DeHart, 2008, 2009; Dowden &amp; Brown, 2002; Lord, 2008; Salisbury &amp; Van Voorhis, 2009; Wright et al., 2007; Zust, 2009). A cross-sectional survey design was used and all data was gathered via self-report during face-to-face interviews.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>For women in the sample, an increase in the number of cumulative victimization domains experienced in childhood was statistically significantly associated with increased dissociation and meeting criteria for a substance use disorder in the year prior to incarceration. Further, sexual assault statistically significantly moderated the relationship between polyvictimization and both dissociation and substance misuse for women in the sample. A positive effect was noted when looking at IPVV, psychosis, and posttraumatic stress, although the relationships in the current sample were statistically non-significant. Although the data did not permit precise estimates of the effect, the confidence intervals suggested moderate to strong effects that indicated concern about the relationship between polyvictimization and subsequent challenges. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Understanding experiences of polyvictimization for incarcerated women, and how polyvictimization relates to subsequent IPVV, dissociation, psychosis, posttraumatic stress, and substance misuse, is of particular importance to the social work profession, as social workers provide the majority of behavioral health services in the US (Proctor, 2004). Social work is well positioned to lead community-based prevention efforts which address how experiences of violence and victimization can influence a woman’s sense of herself in relationships and can serve to alienate her from family, school, and employment. If drugs and alcohol are used to cope with experiences of violence, social work prevention and intervention can highlight how substance misuse perpetuates experiences of victimization for at-risk women and girls, increasing risk for arrest and incarceration. Further, over the past decade, comprehensive mental health services have become increasingly available in women’s prisons across the country (e.g., Daroowalla et al., 2005; Teplin et al., 1997; Wright et al., 2007). Social work professionals are well equipped to take a leadership role in therapeutic service delivery. More research is needed to examine polyvictimization among incarcerated adult women and evaluate the predictive utility of polyvictimization on negative outcomes among this population.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Given its geographical position as a bridge between Europe and Asia, the North Caucasus plays an important role in buffering Russia from outside threats.  In exchange for unwavering loyalty and the stabilization of the region, Russian President Vladimir Putin has entrusted Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov with nearly unfettered control over Chechnya.  On the surface, it appears that he has achieved a state of stability.  Unemployment has significantly dropped from that of the war period, the Chechen capital of Grozny has dramatically transformed from a pile of rubble to a bustling city and, most significantly, the number of politically motivated attacks have dramatically decreased.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This “transformation,” however, comes at a very high cost, making it both superficial and unstable.  In order to snuff out extremism since his rise to power, Kadyrov has committed and continues to commit a plethora of human rights abuses, ranging from kidnapping to murder.  From an economic perspective, the cost of Kadyrov’s loyalty is staggering, and both the private and public sectors are plagued by corruption.  Radical Islam also poses a significant threat as groups such as the Caucasus Emirate and the Islamic State vie for influence in the region.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This research aims to answer whether Kadyrov’s abusive policies, as well as related outside factors, pose a threat of renewed political violence in Chechnya by analyzing policies regarding Chechnya’s security apparatus, economy, and Islam.  This analysis asserts that while Kadyrov’s methods of leadership have provided short term benefits in stabilizing Chechnya, these successes have come at a very high cost and factors which contribute to the likelihood of political violence persist.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to investigate the existence of stigma related to mental health illnesses among music therapy students at a large southeastern public university.  A survey of nineteen stigma-related questions was designed and distributed to seventy-six music therapy students.  Forty-four surveys were collected (57.9%) and analyzed.  The survey consisted of four demographic questions and fifteen stigma related statements.  Statements were related to one of three components of stigma: prejudice, stereotype, and discrimination.  Respondents answered each statement based on the extent to which they agreed or disagreed to each item on a five-point, Likert-type scale.   Results indicated that music therapy students tended to disagree with stigma-related statements.  These results may suggest a lower perceived stigma towards mental health illnesses among music therapy students.  Understanding the prevalence of stigma on mental health among music therapy students provides implications for future music therapists and current music therapists working in mental or behavioral health settings to provide more adequate experiences for individuals with mental illness.  Music therapists can help challenge the stigma related to mental health, a major barrier for those wishing to seek treatment with mental illness.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Tom Beauchamp and James Childress describe a method for analyzing ethically troubling medical situations in their standard work Principles of Biomedical Ethics.  Beauchamp and Childress's method is intended to allow those who are not professional philosophers, or who do not share allegiance to the same ethical systems, to have productive debates about what should be done in any specific medical case. "Principlism", as this method is called, is perhaps the most well known method of bioethical case analysis. Shortly after principlism emerged, Albert Jonsen and Stephen Toulmin argued in their book The Abuse of Casuistry that reviving the casuist method of analyzing cases would serve the purposes of bioethical analysis better than principlism. They explain that their revival of casuistry was motivated by their experiences on the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research in 1974. Jonsen and Toulmin point out that the methods with which they were able to reach a consensus seemed to be much closer methods associated with casuistry than those used in the debates centered on principles described by Beauchamp and Childress. It seemed to them that intractable disagreements arose between members of the commission about abstract principles, but that members of the commission were able to easily come to agreement about what should happen in specific cases. The authors argue that because of this, case based ethics is uniquely suited to reaching a consensus in biomedical ethics in a way that improves on using principlism, which still deals with abstract principles. Jonsen and Toulmin argue this is due to casuistry’s superior ability to avoid coming to a “deadlock” of principles, its ability to deal better with concrete cases, and its ability to represent the context of cases more accurately. Jonsen and Toulmin worry that discussions of ethics which are not rooted in cases will not give specific enough advice, may give impractical advice that is obviously unhelpful in the context of real cases, and most importantly may become so caught up with things like exact definitions of terms or principles that they will never be able to give ethical guidance at all. Since then, casuistry and principlism have been characterized as rival accounts of how to conceptualize bioethical debates in the most productive way. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In order to clarify what is at stake in selecting one of these two methods to analyze bioethical cases, I will try to pinpoint exactly where the practical differences between the two theories lie. An ideal method for analyzing specific issues that arise in medical contexts would be both theoretically sound (insofar as it succeeds in meeting the theoretical requirements it is inspired by, generally to treat like cases equally) and practical (in order to ensure that it is useable by the medical professionals who will be confronted with these situations and that it can reliably result in consensus solutions). This means that analyzing the theories and practical applications of principlism and casuistry is necessary for comparing the two.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The first important aspect of evaluating methods of bioethical analysis is to clarify the theoretical justification for the specific methods suggested. Standardizing the justifications for the two theories will help compare them, as they make use of different intellectual canons and so use terms in ways which are not compatible. The substantive differences between the justifications for the two theories can be made explicit in this way.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The next aspect of analyzing the two theories is to look at what proponents of the theories claim are the differences between the methods. This should also include analysis of arguments as to why rival theories are inferior for leaving things out or including unnecessary requirements. This will mainly consist of looking at criticisms of principlism by casuists and vice versa, and determining if the criticisms are apt. If the criticisms are apt, then this will highlight differences between the ways in which principlists and casuists approach cases.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Finally, the practicality of the two methods of analyzing bioethical cases can be compared by comparing the actual way each method treats moral problems. This can be done both by comparing the actual explicit instructions that principlists and casuists give to those examining medical situations, and by running a model case through each method.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The dissertation manuscript Count Four is a collection of poems that attempts to address the often-conflicting identities of their speakers. Thematically, these poems cover a broad array of personal topics such as family, suicide, fame, fear, violence, and intimate relationships. All of these often-disparate subjects connect with each other, often in the same poem, in order to create an origin story for a speaker whose life is in constant contradiction with itself. The speaker in these poems has spent his life maneuvering the space on the fringes of society, and the consequences of this lifestyle have left the speaker to deal with the emotional trauma. Stylistically, these poems are in direct conversation with the free-verse tradition of American contemporary and confessional poetry. However, the formal and stylistic choices in this manuscript have the genealogy of a literary mongrel because they draw not only from a wide range of poetic styles, but also from a large pool of cultural and musical influences that allow the poems to translate personal experience through the lens of cultural identity.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) on traits are present if variation in the social environment provided by others is at least partially due to genetic variation among those individuals. IGEs can result from a variety of interactions between conspecifics and may contribute to the high phenotypic variation in and rapid evolution of behavior. “GxG” epistasis”, also known as direct-by-indirect genetic interaction, is a potentially widespread type of IGE that occurs when the expression of behavior in a social context depends on the genotypic combination of the individuals(s) creating the social contexts for a behavior and the individual expressing that behavior. Despite the potential widespread importance of IGEs, few studies have evaluated IGEs on natural genetic variation in behavior occurring in its natural context. The Eastern mosquitofish, Gambusia holbrooki, is a tractable system in which to study IGEs on behavior. Male Eastern mosquitofish exhibit a discrete natural color polymorphism: a majority of males are silver (S), while a minority is mottled black-and-white (M). This color polymorphism is associated with variation in behavior, responses from conspecifics, survival rate, and selective advantages in the presence of predators. These findings suggest that variation in the social environment provided by others may affect the behavioral differences between M and S male morphs. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	To determine whether variation in the social environment (IGEs) is a critical influence on differences in male morph behavior, we conducted three studies. In the first study, we compared association with social partners of M and S males in both laboratory and artificially constructed social groups. We found that M and S males associated nonrandomly with different partners, suggesting that these male morphs experience different immediate social environments that could result in IGEs on behavior. We evaluated the role of IGEs on differences in M and S behavior in the second study, in which we compared differences in behavior of male morphs placed in social contexts that varied in the genotypic composition of social partners. We found that social context affected some behavioral differences between M and S males, but that the genotype of the focal individual also influenced focal male behavior. In the third study, we evaluated how M and S juvenile behavior changed during ontogeny in response to different social environments, and whether IGEs seen in adult mosquitofish have their developmental origin in social experiences during development. Results showed that IGEs strongly affected juvenile behavior and maturation: juveniles were more interactive with social partners, fed more, and reached maturity faster when reared with S male adults compared to those reared with M males. There was additional evidence that M and S juveniles behaved differently depended on their rearing context. In a fourth study, we also evaluated M and S male responses to predator and conspecific odor cues; male morphs may respond to odor cues in a way that promotes differences in their relative survival and informs association with social partners. While we found some evidence that males respond differently to odor cues, this evidence was limited to one replicate of the study. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	In two studies, we also compared association and interactions with social partners in both freely interacting wild social groups and constructed laboratory environments to evaluate whether IGEs influenced differences in male morph behavior similarly in natural and artificial conditions. As described above, we examined patterns of association with social partners between M and S male morphs; we found similar nonrandom association trends between both laboratory and wild social groups, though these trends were nonsignificant for field data. We also compared the behavior of freely interacting individuals in two wild populations using underwater video to behavior of male morphs in a gradient of laboratory social environments. Results showed that both the genotype of the focal individual, and the genotype of their social partner, affected behavior in both wild and laboratory settings. These results implicate that both IGEs and GxG epistasis are important influences on behavior across both settings. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	In conclusion, this work is some of the first to describe the role of IGEs on differences in behavior associated with a natural polymorphism in its natural context. We establish that males differing in a genetically determined color pattern associate nonrandomly with social partners, and that the behavior of these males depends on both their own genotype and their genotypes of their social partners. We draw comparisons between behavior in laboratory and natural social environments, suggesting that the Eastern mosquitofish is a tractable system in which to continue to explore the role of the social environment on behavior.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Screening for effects of small molecules on cells grown in culture is a well-established method for drug discovery and testing, and faster throughput at lower cost is needed especially for lipophilic materials. Small-molecule arrays present a promising approach. However, it has been a challenge to use them to obtain quantitative surface based dose-response curves in vitro, especially for lipophilic compounds. This thesis first introduces a simple novel method of surface-mediated delivery of drugs to cells from a microarray of phospholipid multilayers (layers thicker than a bilayer) encapsulating small molecules. The capability of controlling the dosage of the lipophilic molecules delivered to cells using the lipid multilayer microarray assay is further demonstrated using the nanointaglio printing method. This control enabled the variation of the volumes of surface supported lipid micro- and nanostructure arrays fabricated with nanointaglio. The volumes of the lipophilic drug-containing nanostructures were determined using a fluorescence microscope calibrated by atomic-force microscopy. The surface supported lipid volume information was used to obtain EC-50 values for the response of HeLa cells to treatment with three FDA-approved lipophilic anticancer drugs, docetaxel, imiquimod and triethylenemelamine, which were found to be significantly different from neat lipid controls. Features with sub-cellular lateral dimensions were found to be necessary to obtain normal cell adhesion with HeLa cells. Comparison of the microarray data to dose-response curves for the same drugs delivered liposomally from solution revealed quantitative differences in the efficacy values, which may be explained in terms of cell-adhesion playing a more important role in the surface-based assay. Finally, solution encapsulation was done for a library of hydrophilic silicon nanocrystals in order to set a solution standard for comparison with future surface supported delivery of the library. The work presented here opens the door for the possible benchtop high throughput and high content screening of hydrophobic materials that were previously difficult or impossible to readily screen.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The $\mathrm{^{17}F(p,\gamma)^{18}Ne}$ reaction plays an important role in various astrophysical processes. However, direct measurements of $\mathrm{(p,\gamma)}$ reactions involving radioactive nuclei will remain difficult even at cutting-edge facilities in the near future.  As a result, there is a need to develop reliable alternative methods to obtain the relevant information for understanding these reactions.  The (d,n) proton transfer reaction is well-suited for studying the $\mathrm{(p,\gamma)}$ reaction due to the low Q-value at the proton threshold and the less complicated transfer mechanism when compared to similar transfer reactions. Because neutrons are neutral particles and thereby difficult to detect, very few attempts have been made to study the (d,n) reaction using radioactive ion beams.  Here, I describe the development of a compact neutron detector array, RESONEUT, that is specialized for detecting the low energy neutrons from the (d,n) reaction in inverse kinematics. The efficiency properties of the detectors are characterized in a stable-beam test experiment by detecting the low energy neutrons from the $\mathrm{^{12}C(d,n)^{13}N}$ reaction in inverse kinematics.  The detectors are then used in a radioactive beam experiment studying the $\mathrm{^{17}F(d,n)^{18}Ne}$ reaction at the RESOLUT facility. Our results confirm that the 3+ state at $E_R = 599.8$ keV is the lowest lying l=0 proton resonance and no additional states were observed.  We have also succeeded in measuring the transfer spectroscopic factors of the $2_{2}+$ bound state by detecting neutrons from the transfer reaction. The results are consistent with the spectroscopic factors measured from the mirror reaction, $\mathrm{^{17}O(d,p)^{18}O}$, but inconsistent with the spectroscopic factors measured in the $\mathrm{^{17}O(p,\gamma)^{18}F}$ reaction by Rolfs[Nucl. Phys. A217, 29 (1973)].  As a result, the direct capture contribution to the reaction rate, previously calculated by Garcia et al[Phys. Rev. C43, 2012 (1991)] using spectroscopic factors from Rolfs, will need to be revised.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This dissertation investigates the effects of federal grant-in-aid programs on metropolitan area economic growth and recovery in “green” energy and environmental sectors of the economy, focusing on the role of self-organizing intergovernmental policy networks. Federal grant-in-aid programs are popular policy tools to bridge the gaps between fragmented local government capacities in pursuing desired policy outcomes, to facilitate collaboration and to stimulate the economy. The fragmentation of authority and responsibility for economic and environmental programs at a regional level produces institutional collective action (ICA) dilemmas. Applying a network analytic approach I examine how changes in local and regional network relationships to overcome ICA dilemmas impact policy performance. This research contributes to the literature by extending the ICA framework to examine how network structure responds to changes in the underlying problem or ICA dilemma that alter risks, and how these changes in network structure then influence policy performance.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation employs an integrative model to investigate the impacts of exogenous stimuli on structural changes in networks and consequent policy performance. This empirical analysis focuses on the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant (EECBG) under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) as an exogenous stimulus for metropolitan green economic governance in Florida. The first analysis applies Stochastic Actor-Based Model (SABM) to test the impacts of the EECBG program on the structural changes in green economic networks among 19 metropolitan areas in Florida from 2000 to 2011. The second analysis extracts network factors from the first analysis and estimates Time-Series-Cross-Section (TSCS) models to test the hypothesized explanation for how exogenously driven changes in networks influence policy performance through green job creation in metropolitan areas.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Reports and surveys by the U.S. government and international organizations have repeatedly acknowledged the achievement problem in math in K-12 regardless of various efforts (e.g., by the U.S. Department of Education) to diminish it. To address the problem in math achievement in K-12, teachers, scholars, and the U.S. government have developed various materials and intervention tools. As a potential platform to address the problem in math achievement, video games generate a large variety of perspectives on their value. Along with the debate on the game’s inherent good or bad features, there is also a debate on the effectiveness of video games  as a learning tool. Regarding these debates and the ambiguous results on video games as learning tools, Greitemeyer and Mügge (2014) postulated that games can provide both positive and negative impacts according to their content (i.e., violent and pro-social games). However, recent literature investigating the use of video games in varied learning contexts shows that the learning effectiveness of games is still inconclusive. A potential reason is that video games mostly facilitate implicit qualitative understanding. Video games consist of rich interactive experiences that help to foster understanding of qualitative relationships in gameplay  more than quantitative proficiency that is required in the formal school system (Clark et al. 2011; Squire, Barnett, Grant, &amp; Higginbotham, 2004). Another reason is that educational game designers have paid little attention to designing and developing learning supports in educational games. Therefore, the current study aims to address a comprehensive question -- How does an educational game, through the use of learning supports, promote the application of acquired qualitative understanding to math problem solving in formal educational contexts?</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	A promising method to address the aforementioned problem is to externalize cognitive and metacognitive processes (Lajoie, 2009). Externalizing Problem Representation (EPR) refers to a cognitive behavior in which a learner constructs her own representations overtly (Cox, 1999). The processes of EPR are to re-order information in problem solving, to clarify ambiguous parts of the problem, and to modify and enact mental representations including mental animations and images. EPR helps to make missing and implicit information or representations explicit. There are several synonyms of Externalizing Problem Representation (EPR), such as external representation (Zhang, 1997), externalized cognition (Cox &amp; Brna, 1995), and re-representation (Ainsworth &amp; Th Loizou, 2003). From the semiotics perspective, EPR can be categorized into two forms by its sign: Iconic and symbolic.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Although the potential benefits of externalizing problem representation was claimed in prior research, little attention was paid to investigating the design of EPR in video games. Compared to the studies of mental problem representation, few empirical studies on external representation have been conducted. Hence, it is warranted to examine the efficacy of learning support that promotes externalizing problem representation in two formats (i.e., iconic and symbolic) in the video-game-based learning setting. In light of this, the purpose of this study is to investigate whether EPR-promoting scaffolds (in iconic vs. symbolic formats) enhance qualitative understanding and quantitative proficiency in ratios and proportional relationships in a learning game context. Specifically, the learning game will request players to respond to either iconic or symbolic learning probes that help to externalize the mental representations of the math problems in the game. In this study, quantitative proficiency refers to the problem solving proficiency in both game and formal education context. The current study involves two levels of task complexity (i.e., low complexity vs. high complexity) as a moderating variable.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The study addresses the following research questions:</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>1.	Will iconic learning probes promoting EPR enhance qualitative understanding and quantitative proficiency in ratios and proportional reasoning, with the task complexity controlled in the educational game?</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>2.	Will symbolic learning probes promoting EPR enhance qualitative understanding and quantitative proficiency in ratios and proportional reasoning, with task complexity controlled in the educational game?</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>3.	Will iconic learning probes promoting EPR, in comparison to symbolic learning probes promoting EPR, be more effective in enhancing qualitative understanding and quantitative proficiency in ratio and proportional reasoning, with task complexity controlled in the educational game?</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To accomplish the purpose of this study, learning probes that prompt learners to externalize their internal problem representation were developed in two different formats, iconic and symbolic, based on Mayer’s math problem representation model. In the experiment, forty-five participants in this study processed either iconic or symbolic learning probes during their gameplay. Finally, qualitative understanding and quantitative proficiency were measured three times: before this study, after playing the shipping container episode with a low complexity task, and after playing the shipping container episode with a high complexity task. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Regarding Research Question 1, the result of repeated-measures ANOVA indicates that, for participants in the Iconic Learning Probe (ILP) group, the difference in qualitative understanding between the pretest, posttest, and posttest 2 was not statistically significant whereas the difference in quantitative proficiency between the pretest, posttest 1, and posttest 2 was statistically significant.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Regarding Research Question 2, the result of repeated-measures ANOVA indicates that, for participants in the Symbolic Learning Probe (SLP) group, the difference in qualitative understanding between the pretest, posttest 1, and posttest 2 was statistically significant whereas the difference in quantitative understanding between the pretest, posttest 1, and posttest 2 was not statistically significant.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Regarding Research Question 3, since there was a significant interaction between the times of measurement and the types of EPR in regard to both qualitative understanding and quantitative proficiency, pairwise comparisons using the Bonferroni method were drawn. There were significant differences in participants’ qualitative understanding between ILP and SLP groups in posttest 1 and posttest 2 whereas there was no significant difference in participants’ qualitative understanding between ILP and SLP groups in the pretest. Regarding the quantitative proficiency, there were significant differences in participants’ quantitative proficiency between ILP and SLP groups in posttest 1 whereas there was no significant difference in participants’ quantitative proficiency between ILP and SLP groups in the pretest and posttest 2.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the final chapter, I discussed major research findings of this study based on the theoretical research reviewed in Chapter 2. Then I described the implications of this study and suggestions for future study.</DISS_para>

This dissertation explores characteristics and activities of mentoring relationships and examines information types exchanged in the relationships using a mixed method design that combines qualitative interview and quantitative survey methods. The study draws upon a socialization content framework developed in organizational settings. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Interviews with ten library and information science (LIS) doctoral students from nine universities in the United States (U.S.) were conducted. Based on data from these interviews, ideal mentoring was defined as a supportive relationship that combines professional and interpersonal characteristics. The author also identified sixteen types of information exchanged in doctoral mentoring: Language, History, Coursework, Research, Skills, Teaching, Networking, Structure, Politics, Goals, Strategies, Values, Norms/Tradition, Rules/Policies, Benefits, and Personal life. In addition to the identification of content dimensions, the author observed four meaningful levels to which the content types can be applied: Work, School/Department, University, and Discipline.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para/>
            <DISS_para>The author tested and generalized interview findings through surveying 132 LIS doctoral student participants in the U.S. The survey findings supported the importance of both professional and interpersonal characteristics of mentors, although the participants placed more value on professional than interpersonal characteristics. When comparing participants’ perceptions of their current mentors/advisors and ideal mentors, current mentors were quite similar to ideal mentors, although there were statistically significant differences on many characteristics between current advisors and ideal mentors. Moreover, the survey confirmed that information exchange occurs in all of the sixteen types, although frequencies varied. In particular, information exchange was more frequent in the group of participants who considered their advisors to be mentors than it was among those who did not. It was also found that there is a changing pattern in the overall frequency of information exchange across the stages of doctoral work.  </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This dissertation presented faculty mentor characteristics comprehensively and concretely, which will enable faculty advisors to reflect on and improve their mentoring practices. It also suggested doctoral students’ experiences from the perspective of information, which contributes to increasing our understanding of its role in the doctoral training process. Through investigation of the types of information exchanged, the author attempted to make the immeasurable and invisible dimension of mentoring measurable and visible in order to illustrate the important role of information and information exchange. Finally, the author proposed a modified definition of mentoring/mentors, adding the dimension of information to existing definitions.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para/>
            <DISS_para>Theoretically, the current study addressed the dearth in content framework research in academic settings, especially academic mentoring, and it established a foundation for the examination of interpersonal information behavior in mentoring. Practically, the list of mentor characteristics identified from the study could be referenced to evaluate advisors/mentors, allowing them to address shortcomings. In addition, the study findings may help characterize and understand the doctoral study process from the perspective of information science, which can be used for improving current doctoral advising/mentoring practices, contributing to decreasing students’ attrition rates and promote their professional and personal success. Last but not least, the information types can be used to develop a measurement system that evaluates the effectiveness of knowledge transfer and mentoring.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation mainly focuses on the investigation of the magnetic phase diagram of quasi two di- mensional triangular lattice antiferromagnets (TLAFs) Ba3MNb2O9 (M = Co2+ (S = 1/2), Mn2+ (S = 5/2)), and their multiferroic properties. Both compounds show a two-step magnetic phase transition at TN1 and TN2 upon cooling from paramagnetic to up-up-down(uud) phase due to the easy-axis anisotropy, and 120 degree ordered phase at zero field. This feature is dissimilar to that of sister a compound Ba3NiNb2O9 (Ni2+, (S = 1)), in which a single magnetic phase transition occurs due to the easy-plane anisotropy at zero field. Moreover, at low temperature below TN1, successive magnetic phase transitions were observed in both compounds. However, in case of Co compounds, the range of magnetic field where the uud phase stabilizes becomes wider at lower temperature whereas becomes narrower in case of Mn compounds. This different behavior is originated from the nature of the fluctuations that stabilize the uud phase, that is, quantum and/or classical fluctua- tions. We also found that the spin magnitude and spin structure play a crucial role in stabilizing the multiferroic ground state. Multiferroicity appears in all magnetically ordered phase in the small-spin-system Co compound but only in 120 degree ordered state in the large-spin-system Mn compound. The systematic studies on these compounds provide a highly valuable playground in the investigate of the effect of spin varied from 1/2 to 5/2 in frustrated magnets and multiferroics, attract many interests and in the field.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This research investigated South Korean citizens’ political information behaviors on Twitter during the 2014 Seoul Mayoral election.  By using the mixed methods design of network analysis, tweet content analysis, and interviews, this research examined how citizens collaboratively engaged in the political communication and deliberation via Twitter during an election campaign.  Intensive interviews with 13 citizen opinion leaders on Twitter provided the insights into understanding how their perceived societal types, norms, and perception of information value led to certain information sharing behaviors.  Also explored was the dynamics of interactions within the virtual public sphere of Twitter as reflected in the conflicts and synergies of multiple information worlds.  The Theory of Information Worlds (Jaeger &amp; Burnett, 2010) was used to better understand the current phenomenon of citizens’ virtual political communication and deliberation via social media.  This research was the first to apply the Theory of Information Worlds into an empirical study examining social worlds of Twitter. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	This mixed methods research reported both quantitative and qualitative findings identified through the lens of Theory of Information Worlds.  Findings from the perspective of network and tweet content analysis demonstrated what information citizens discussed and shared and how they engaged in the collaborative information sharing behaviors (e.g., selective information exposure and/or avoidance) driven by perceived social types, norms, and the perception of information values—opposing political orientations.  The separated information worlds were clearly observed through the boundaries between two groups of citizens sharing respective political orientation. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The qualitative findings from semi-structured interviews particularly featured how individuals considered as the same social type (e.g., media representatives) interpreted the shared social and/or occupational norms and differently applied them into particular information behaviors.  The alteration in interpreting social and/or occupational norms resulted in the creation of conflicts as well as synergies within, between, and across the information worlds. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	In particular, use of a variety of interview modes in this research (i.e., emails, voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) programs, and face-to-face interviews) offered practical strategies, implications, benefits, and drawbacks of interviewing social media users.  This research demonstrated the increasing importance of conducting qualitative interviews with social media users in the era of Internet research as well as it suggested a number of practical strategies for how to design, conduct, and analyze intensive interviews.  The strategies included the process of identifying purposive set of subjects, recruiting participants, interview scheduling, participant retention, recording, transcribing, translation of the responses, and presentation of the results. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Overall, this research attempted to achieve three goals: 1) to provide a holistic and comprehensive view of South Korean citizens’ collaborative political information behaviors via Twitter during the election campaign; 2) to investigate the possibility of application of the theory of Information Worlds; and 3) to highlight the importance of using mixed methods design for researching individuals’ political information behaviors via social media platforms.  Given the lack of research from non-Western politically less stable countries, this case study from South Korean election provided richer empirical findings to the growing body of knowledge.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The motives of volunteers provide an important key to understanding an individual’s decision to become involved in volunteering (Kim, Zhang, &amp; Connaughton, 2010). One challenge sporting event managers face is that community sport organizations in particular have suffered from a lack of volunteers (Cuskelly, 2004). To date, scholars have focused their research efforts to study the motivation and retention of volunteers for mega-sporting events. Previous researchers, however, suggested that individuals volunteering with mega sporting events may demonstrate different motivations and behaviors compared to those volunteering in other settings such as community sport. Therefore, attention should be given to assess whether the motives of those volunteering to work at community sporting events differ from motives to volunteer at mega sporting events. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In spite of the observed differences between community and mega sporting events, there has been little effort to compare volunteer motivations for the different types of sporting events. Kim et al. (2010) started their research based on the perspective that different motives may drive volunteers to work in different sport settings, an approach that is similar to the proposed research. Even though Kim et al. (2010) studied volunteers working with community sport events, (e.g., youth community sports), a majority of participants in their study were parents who had children participating in sport programs. While youth sports are considered a facet of community sports, the proposed research focused on volunteers at community sporting events that were primarily adult oriented other than youth sports oriented. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to: (a) identify the motives that are most and least important to those who volunteer with community sporting events, and (b) assess whether the particular motives influence intention to continue volunteering in the future. The results from this study provide community sport organizers with information as to why people volunteer to work with community sporting events, and how to retain them. The results from this study may be used by administrators in community sport organizations to develop policies to aid recruitment and retention of volunteers.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To achieve the goals of proposed study, participants who were currently involved in volunteering activities, or had volunteer experiences with community sporting events (e.g., community tennis tournaments, road races, and soccer leagues, etc.) were recruited. I collected data via both e-mail and face-to-face. To analyze the data, Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) using Mplus was used to assess the hypothesized relationships between volunteer motivation and intention to continue volunteering.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>I concluded from the results that Value was the most important motive for volunteering. The remaining factors, in order of importance for volunteering were Social, Career, Enhancement, and Protective. In terms of intention to continue volunteering in general, Protective and Career had significant and negative relationships, while Social and Enhancement had significant and positive influences on overall intention to continue volunteering. Protective had a significant and negative relationship on intention to continue volunteering relative to the influence by family or friends. Enhancement had a significant and positive influence on intention to continue volunteering relative to the influence by family or friends. Social and Career did not have a significant influence on intention to continue volunteering relative to the influence by family or friends.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Farmers markets surged in popularity in the United States over the past two decades. The negative consequences of large-scale, industrialized agriculture and changing consumer interests together stimulated this drive towards alternative farming practices and local, direct-from-producer foods. As a result, farmers markets created the opportunity for new, small-scale producers to enter the marketplace and make a living off the land. The need persists to explore the social aspects of this food phenomenon from the perspective of the farmer. Using in-depth interviews with farmers and fieldwork at several farmers markets, I examine how producers became and remained vendors at farmers markets. In the first empirical analysis (Chapter 4), I use farmers’ retrospective accounts to outline the ways farming was discovered and the indirect and lengthy process of becoming a farmers market vendor. Along with market opportunity, I find that this process was dependent on a combination of social support, personal determination and unforeseeable life circumstances. In my second analysis (Chapter 5), I use a combination of interviews, fieldwork, and personal experience as a farmer and vendor to explore the spoken and unspoken requirement for farmers to create an “authentic” farmers market. Farmers’ success at the market depended on their ability to create this authentic experience. I find that farmers used strictly enforced market rules and carefully crafted product displays, personal presentations, and social interactions to meet customers’ expectations of legitimate farmers and an authentic farmers market. Additionally, I show how these expectations and presentations directly contrasted with the realities of life on the farm. Overall, my research shows how socialized perceptions of farming determined farmers’ willingness to adopt the occupation. Once in, farmers sustained their place at the market by meeting customers’ expectations and standards of authenticity. Often times this meant farmers had to cover and hide the ugly aspects of their work. These findings show that expectations, meanings, and the social interactions that create and maintain them are import factors to consider in research connecting food production and consumption.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This research focuses on the characterization of three isoforms of the human cardiac Troponin C protein previously designed and created by Myriam Badr. These isoforms differ both in the fluorophores bound to the N and C termini and the size of the linker sequences between the fluorophores and TnC protein. Troponin C is notable for its function in Ca2+ binding, which, in functioning muscle, induces a conformational change. This reveals the hidden myosin head binding site and allows contraction to proceed. Using fluorometer analysis to measure changes in FRET, the structural changes each undergoes in the presence of calcium, magnesium, and calcium in the presence of magnesium were analyzed to better understand the functioning of each of these proteins under physiological conditions. Since deficits in cardiac troponin C function have been implicated in some cases of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, it is important to better understand how function changes with the size and shape of the cardiac troponin C protein. With this in mind, we hope to gain a more complete understanding of human cardiac troponin C function.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>I examine whether financial reporting transparency (“transparency”) differs between firms whose parent entity is strategically incorporated in a tax haven for purposes of tax avoidance (i.e., tax haven firms) and non-tax haven multinational corporations (MNCs). Knowledge of the non-tax effects of tax haven incorporation is important given attention to tax havens from policy makers, activists, and the media and also due to the paucity of empirical evidence on the non-tax costs of tax haven incorporation. A predominant perception exists within the public sector and also in accounting research that tax haven involvement is unanimously associated with lower transparency due to secrecy laws, reduced informational exchange with regulators and tax authorities of other countries, and potentially lower shareholder protections in tax havens. However, prior economics and legal research also suggests that tax havens have characteristics associated with higher country-level transparency (i.e. government stability, low corruption, high media coverage).  Thus, there are arguments for both higher and lower transparency for tax haven firms compared to other MNCs. Using a sample of firms based in 16 countries, I test whether tax haven firms and non-tax haven MNCs differ in three facets of firms’ financial information which prior literature has associated with higher transparency (accruals quality, earnings informativeness, and analyst forecast accuracy). Results indicate that the effect of tax havens on transparency depends on the information environment of the country in which the firm is based (i.e. non-tax haven country of headquarters or significant operations).  Tax haven firms based in countries with weak information environments exhibit lower transparency relative to non-tax haven firms. In contrast, tax haven firms based in countries with stronger information environments exhibit higher transparency relative to non-tax haven firms.  Thus, the predominant perception of an unambiguous negative relation between tax haven involvement and transparency does not apply in all settings.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The collection of poems, These Mouths, is an exploration of feminine identities and feminine experience. Many of the poems in this manuscript reference Catholic figures, myths, the speaker's struggles with their own faith and religious guilt. The poems often mix these religious themes with pop culture references. The Twilight Zone is the most referenced work of popular culture within this manuscript. The Twilight Zone poems provide voices to the women characters that lacked agency within the original television series, while also connecting the women's struggles to the ones women face in today's society. While many of the poems within this manuscript include a yearning for safety, salvation, and calm, the love poems within this manuscript are filled with a yearning for a distant other. The overarching obsessions and anxieties of the speakers within this manuscript are related to their attempts to discover their own identity in an androcentric society while being bombarded by, and trying to navigate, religious, social, and familial representations of women.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Understanding the genetic basis of phenotypic variation in organisms is a central problem in developmental and evolutionary biology. In plant science, to gain insights on such problems as how plants respond to environmental changes and how to breed the next generation of crops, a sound quantification of the variation in complex plant phenotypes is crucial. For example, the shape of leaves, the architecture of root systems, and the morphology of pollen grains are all important and interesting phenotypic traits that require mathematical informed methods to model their variation comprehensively.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this dissertation, we develop topological methods and algorithms based on persistent homology, which let us construct informative summaries of the shape of data. We propose a localized form of persistent homology represented by a continuous persistence diagram field. We prove that such fields are stable and robust to noise and outliers. This technique lets us produce compact, and yet rich summaries of global and local morphology useful for modeling and quantifying variation in complex shapes. This enables statistical approaches such as quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis, time series analysis of dynamical traits, and the investigation of correlations between morphological traits to study their evolution and developmental constraints.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We apply the methods to: (i) QTL analysis of multiple tomato introgression lines through a study of leaf shape and root architecture; (ii) time series analysis of dynamic growing maize root systems; (iii) quantitative analysis of morphology of grass pollen grains; and (iv) an analysis of the complexity of dryland spatial vegetation patterns.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>ABSTRACT</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The bias adjustment of visually estimated ship winds in the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS) is addressed through the comparison to the QuickSCAT scatterometer equivalent neutral winds. We assume that visually estimated winds and satellite scatterometer winds share similar characteristics, which are a function of stress rather than wind speed, and treat the estimated ship winds as equivalent neutral winds. Under such an assumption, we use statistical analyses to calculate the bias correction for estimated ship winds. Because observation practices vary by country and data provider, ICOADS identifies datasets by “deck” which is a number that allows for differentiating the source of the records (different deck numbers indicate different data collections provided to ICOADS, each which may contain one or more sources/countries). Three ICOADS decks 792, 926, and 992 contain the vast majority (~90%) of collocated visually estimated ship winds covering the time period November 1999-October 2009. The Root-Mean-Square difference between these visually estimated ship winds and scatterometer winds are 3.0ms-1, 2.8ms-1 and 2.9ms-1 for each major deck respectively. Following the methodology of Freilich (1997) and Freilich and Dunbar (1999), we numerically show that for lower wind speeds (0ms-1-5ms-1 in this case) that the random error in the component of the visually estimated ship winds causes an artificial appearance of an overestimation relative to satellite scatterometer winds. We also extend this statistical artifact test to test higher wind speeds (12ms-1-18ms-1 in this case) through a Monte Carlo approach. An apparent slight drop of the conditional sample means relative to reference line is shown to be a statistical artifact. These artificial biases are properly accounted in this study. A new bias correction, LMS correction, is calculated and also compared to prior corrections such as Lindau (1995). This new bias correction is available for wind speeds ranging from 0ms-1 to 17ms-1, because there are too few spatial and temporal collocated matches at wind speed greater than 17ms-1. We are limited in our ability to perform the adjustments required for intercallibration because when comparing visual winds to scatterometer winds the necessary wind speed observations are rare and small in magnitude.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study shows stylistic traits of Stephen Paulus’s choral writing by providing an analysis of six of the composer’s fifty-eight multi-movement works.  The context in which each work was written (with regard to the commissioning ensemble and in relation to Paulus’s career) is explored briefly, followed by textual and music analysis, focusing on unique qualities of the works as well as characteristics that carry over to his other works.  The full fifty-eight multi-movement choral works are catalogued.  A summation of Paulus’s stylistic traits as represented by these works is presented as well as suggestions for further research.  Additionally, a biography and full catalog are included.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In 2014, Florida formally adopted a performance funding model for its State University System of higher education. The case study provides a qualitative analysis of the policy’s implementation at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, a historically black institution (HBI). Using the lens of coercive and normative isomorphism, this study identifies how institutional relationships between higher education administrators have changed in response to performance funding. Participants, though supportive of the policy as an accountability tool, disliked the specific metric items policymakers use to measure institutional performance.  Participants perceived the metric items and policy goals as contradictory to the mission of their institution. The article identifies recommendations for policymakers to increase institutional buy-in and areas of future research.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This dissertation investigates the interpersonal, communicative dynamic created by the presence of multiple interpreters contributing to a single musical performance in recent chamber music. Although the performance and analysis of contemporary music has been explored by a number of authors in the last thirty years, few have considered this facet, which is unique to chamber music and is particularly relevant to contemporary repertoire. Taking gestural relationships into account adds depth to an analysis and enables new kinds of small- and large-scale associations, which contribute to a greater understanding of form. Using Dora Hanninen’s associative organization, this project will illuminate the formal processes in the chamber music of Franco Donatoni. My dialogical gestural perspective will allow the analyst the flexibility to address multiple interpretations and enable creative, experiential listening opportunities.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation intends to study the ways whereby contemporary Iberian poetry moves (in the double sense of emotionally touching and politically mobilizing), and therefore can potentially produce, different models of sociality within the context of the 2008 financial crisis in Portugal and Spain. For that sake, it draws from the relatively recent affective turn in Cultural Studies, resulting in an approach characterized by an understanding of emotions as practices. Contrary to traditional psychoanalytic perspectives, where emotions are considered inner states and/or properties of the subject, Affect theory studies emotions as a liminal, relational production: the result from the interaction of bodies with their environment, as well as between themselves. This approach has important implications for literary criticism, as it involves addressing literary texts from their very material dimension. Therefore, and apart from paying attention to its meaning, the key question would be what these texts do: what are their effects and how they impress, corporeal and intellectually, on their readers. Issues of agency and subject-object distinction need to be reconsidered once we acknowledge that the literary text acts upon the reader and transforms him/her. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The project is structured in four chapters. The first one focuses in poetic texts which, be it through traditional formats or newer devices, work, following Germán Labrador’s terminology, as spaces of action. These texts, poems from Antonio Orihuela, Filipa Leal, Pablo García Casado or Golgona Anghel, would be affective mediators, able to provide the reader with politically mobilizing narratives and myths. It is possible to identify voices, narratives or scenes that describe or reflect situations with which the reader empathizes, and that are able to move her to the point of changing a state of fear, disappointment or apathy by another of mobilizing indignation. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The second chapter is dedicated to those poetics centered in a re-elaboration of language for subversive purposes. Following the premise that a new world cannot be thought using the old language of oppression, these poetics would strive to overcome the currently mainstream prosaic realism. In this part I will analyze works from María Salgado, Enrique Falcón and Antonio Méndez Rubio together with the Portuguese hypermedia poet Rui Torres; these authors distance themselves from figurative poetics and embrace openness and indetermination, experimenting with various avant-garde means and elements.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In a third chapter, I pay attention to poets and MCs who shift between traditional formats and other material or virtual spatialities for their works, ranging from weblog literature to street walls or hip-hop performances, which entail new restrictions and opportunities. Among others, I study the work of Alberto Basterrechea, also known as neorrabioso (a mock self-definition that means “new enraged”). neorrabioso employs an aphoristic, inflammatory writing with a colloquial and ludic characteristic mark: his brevity is, among other factors, a consequence of the fact that he clandestinely paints his poems in the streets of Madrid. This will of regaining the public sphere for and by poetry is framed in the activities of the 15-M movement, with which neorrabioso shares a project of renewing language in order to counteract institutional newspeak. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The last chapter studies, in an affective key, ecologist discourses in committed poetry. It will take Jorge Riechmann as its central figure, but will also consider other authors such as Rui Lage or Fernando Aguiar. Thanks to their relational quality, emotions and affects like shame or empathy (fundamental for the construction of a sense of community) have worked as dams for human ambitions, particularly in a competitive and individualistic culture such as the Western. Thus, in this chapter I analyze poems susceptible of rousing affects that function as limits: affects that, for instance, contribute to raise awareness that economic growth as an ends to itself is a self-destructive fiction, incompatible with nature’s finiteness, of which human beings are an inseparable part.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The dynamic self-organization of lipids in biological systems is a highly regulated process that enables the compartmentalization of living systems at microscopic and nanoscopic levels.  Exploiting the self-organization and innate biofunctionality of lyotropic liquid crystalline phospholipids, a novel nanofabrication process called “nanointaglio” was invented in order to rapidly and scalably integrate lipid nanopatterns onto the surface.  The work presented here focuses on using nanointaglio fabricated lipid diffraction micro- and nanopatterns for the development of new sensing and bioactivity studies.  The lipids are patterned as diffraction gratings for sensor functionality.  The lipid multilayer gratings operate as nanomechanical sensor elements that are capable of transducing molecular binding to fluid lipid multilayers into optical signals in a label free manner due to shape changes in the lipid nanostructures.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para/>
            <DISS_para>To demonstrate the label free detection capabilities, lipid nanopatterns are shown to be suitable for the integration of chemically different lipid multilayer gratings into a sensor array capable of distinguishing vapors by means of an optical nose.  Sensor arrays composed of six different lipid formulations are integrated onto a surface and their optical response to three different vapors (water, ethanol and acetone) in air as well as pH under water is monitored as a function of time.  Principal component analysis of the array response results in distinct clustering, indicating the suitability of the arrays for distinguishing these analytes.  Importantly, the nanointaglio process used is capable of producing lipid gratings out of different materials with sufficiently uniform heights for the fabrication of an optical nose. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A second main application is demonstrated for the study of membrane binding proteins.  Although in vitro methods for assaying the catalytic activity of individual enzymes are well established, quantitative methods for assaying the kinetics of supramolecular remodeling such as vesicle formation from planar lipid bilayers or multilayers are needed to understand cellular self-organization.  Presented next is a nanointaglio based method for quantitative measurements of lipid-protein interactions and its suitability for quantifying the membrane binding, inflation, and budding activity of the membrane-remodeling protein Sar1.  Optical diffraction gratings composed of lipids are printed on surfaces using nanointaglio, resulting in lipid multilayer gratings.  Exposure of lipid multilayer gratings to Sar1 results in the inflation of lipid multilayers into unilamellar structures, the kinetics of which can be detected in a label-free manner by monitoring the diffraction of white light through an optical microscope.  Local variations in lipid multilayer volume on the surface can be used to vary substrate availability in a microarray format, allowing kinetic and thermodynamic data to be obtained from a single experiment without the need for varying enzyme concentration.  A quantitative model is developed and fits to the data allow measurements of both binding affinity (KD) and kinetics (kon and koff). Importantly, this assay is uniquely capable of quantifying membrane remodeling. Upon Sar1 induced inflation of single bilayers from surface supported multilayers, the semi-cylindrical grating lines are observed to remodel into semi-spherical buds when a critical radius of curvature equal to 300 nm is reached, which is explained in terms of a Rayleigh type instability.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>To combat rising levels of juvenile delinquency in Buffalo, New York, in the 1930s, the Federal Theatre Proejct created the Crime Prevention Serial. The multi-episode series follows the trials and tribulations of Johnnie Smith, a hard-headed, 16-year-old juvenile delinquent from Buffalo, New York. Along with his family, various representatives from law enforcement, some recurring narrators who act as moral guides, and real-life guest speakers from the city of Buffalo, Johnnie’s less-than-honorable escapades offer a fictionalized account of this very real and rising issue. Broadcast every Tuesday and Thursday night at 7:45 pm on Buffalo’s WEBR radio station, the short episodes portray a customized view of juvenile delinquency, reform, and patriotism that simultaneously speaks to national concerns and Buffalo’s distinct local culture and needs. In this way, the Crime Prevention Serial serves as a unique case study that broadly explores a larger question within FTP scholarship: How do specific theatres and the communities in which they exist—in this case the FTP and Buffalo—shape and inform one another? This thesis adds to the existing FTP scholarship by examining three specific tropes and themes constructed in the series—juvenile delinquency, reform, and patriotism—in order to explore the relationship between theatre and community by examining the similaries and discripencies between how these ideas existed within the radio dramas and everyday life.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This thesis interrogates the specific relationship between Buffalo and its local FTP, but also to question how the FTP, through its mandate of local relevance, served as a vehicle for provoking conversation around larger, national issues. How does Buffalo’s crafted text, commenting on pressing national issues actively achieve the FTP’s mission? Understanding the Buffalo FTP’s Crime Prevention Serial challenges a streamlined notion of juvenile delinquency and the FTP and allows us to engage with the intricacies of an issue’s representation, fiction, and reality.  Meticulously crafted, this radio drama weaves together a precise portrayal of a terrifying local and national concern in the hope that young men will abandon lives of crime and return to their families for an idyllic evening, gathered together around the radio.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Throughout the course of the First World War and the Civil War that devastated the country after, Russia’s military logistical network continually failed to provide the supplies necessary for its forces to win the colossal conflict which it found itself in from 1914 to 1920. Russia, even with its vastness and resource rich lands, struggled greatly to properly equip its armies. Yet it was not a lack of resources, or even finished war supplies which crippled the country’s military logistics, but rather a constant mismanagement by Russia’s bloated and inefficient bureaucracy. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	During these years of conflict Russia was governed by three uniquely different governments: the Tsarist Empire in its final years of existence, a weak and semi-democratic Provisional Government, and a military junta under the White Resistance against the growing power of the Bolsheviks. Although all three governments were different in their aims for the Russia they ruled, each continued a legacy of mismanagement and inefficiency of the nation’s military logistics. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	This thesis paper examines each of these government’s attempt to sustain the conflicts they waged with the necessary weapons and supplies. Throughout the time period covered, there is a continual theme of a misuse of Russia’s vast resources, creating a situation where there were plenty of weapons and ammunition but where none was reaching the front lines. Instead, a combination of an inefficient bureaucracy and the monumental egos of that bureaucracy’s leadership saw a mismanagement of resources and a complete breakdown of Russia’s supply capabilities.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Requiem masses have been an important part of classical music literature since the late 15th century and have been used as masses for the dead during funerals.  Over the centuries the use of the requiem text has become more common because composers are setting the text more often. However, composers such as Britten, Penderecki, and Forrest use extra-liturgical poems within their requiem masses, as well as the original Latin which is derived from the Liber Usualis.  More recently, composers have been writing requiem masses that are untraditional in the sense that they are not just about loss of life, yet still retain solemnity and reverence.  Requiem for a Mother is written from the perspective of a grieving mother who is coping with the loss of her child. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Requiem for a Mother makes use of a chamber choir, strings (4, 4, 3, 2, 1), harp, and piano, as well as a soprano soloist to tell a story of grief, love, and acceptance. The choir, singing the Latin text, is that of the people who support the family during their time of loss and grief, while the role of the soprano soloist, singing in English, is that of the mother who is trying to understand why her child is dead. The duration of the requiem is about 25 minutes, with a total of nine movements</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The requiem begins with a prelude, in B minor, that sets up the themes to be used throughout the other movements. Movement II, the first of the soprano solos, depicts the mother reaction to losing her child. As the requiem closes with In Paradisum, the mother comes to terms with her loss and is able to accept what happened and move on.  Requiem for a Mother is dedicated to Danny Quinn.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study investigates the effects of geological structure of the aquifers and the chemistry of water by testing the water chemistry variation such as the main cations (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+) and anions (Cl-, SO4 2-, HCO3 -) and TDS from west of Kuwait in Umm-Gudair field toward the east part of the country in Sulaibiyah and Atraf fields and crossing the Shigaya field in the middle part of Kuwait.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Stable oxygen and hydrogen isotope composition of groundwater were compared with the Kuwait local meteoric water line to examine if there were any interaction between aquifer groundwater and the recent rainfall events in the region of study. Based on the structure of the area of study and the chemistry analysis, variation maps were created to show the spatial distribution of changing water chemistry concentrations in the different structural elements of the study area. A numerical groundwater flowing model was established to better understand the groundwater flowing pattern and velocity while crossing different geological structures such as anticlines and synclines.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Stable oxygen and hydrogen isotope composition of groundwater for Kuwait shows that the aquifer groundwater is effected by evaporation process. The slope and distribution of the Bahrain isotopic ratios show that the groundwater in the area of study does not came from the meteoric water or the rainfall events in the region. Instead the groundwater in the aquifer system is recharged from far distance source area or the groundwater is very old.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Studying the structure of the area and the chemistry analysis variation shows consistant chemical concentration increases in the southeastern direction towards the Ahmadi Arc. The first possible reason behind this change is the long distance and hence water/rock interaction increase. The other reason is Ahmadi arc traps groundwater and with time the rock and water interaction will increase. Faults and fractures in the highly deformed Ahmadi Arc can act as a passage to other fluids moving from deeper to the shallower aquifers. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the Shigaya-B water field, all chemical concentration in groundwater showed decreases except the HCO3- increase. This thesis proposes that high production rate, deformation of aquifers and mixing of aquifers groundwater in Shigaya B field are reasons behind the relative slowdown of Groundwater in Dammam Formation and this mixing and slowing of groundwater is responsible for relative reduction of most chemicals concentration such as TDS, Ca+2, Na+, K+, Mg+2 and Cl-, it is also responsible for HCO3- relative growing in concentration.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The model predicts that in Dammam aquifer at both 1985 and 1995 the groundwater velocity relatively slowing down while crossing Shigaya B anticline crest. Reasons behind this velocity change are the higher rate of production and the tensile fractures in the anticline crest which can act as a window to let groundwater vertically moves from shallower aquifers to deeper ones and vice versa.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Rape had been a much feared, but rarely prosecuted consequence of war in the early history of the United States. Since America was relatively isolated from its enemies, and its soldiers usually interacted with non-Americans, this horrible consequence of war typically seemed distant or othered. When civil war broke out on American soil, it resulted in massive armies of young American men occupying cities populated by women and African-Americans. The consequences of this interaction made the Civil War an important time for the US Federal government to reconsider the rules of war. Public sentiment regarding the treatment of civilians – in particular women, and the legal status of African-Americans had been shifting towards one of increased protection and recognition, while at the same time the military shifted from a policy of conciliation to one of subjugation. The Lieber Code of 1863, which replaced the Articles of War from 1806, was the result of this shift in sentiment. The new code provided rules for court martial trials of soldiers accused of rape or sexual assault, regardless of the victim’s race, and allowed for more vigorous military action with protections for civilians. These trials produced many results beyond strengthening the legal recognition of women and African-Americans. The Union and Confederate governments used the trials as propaganda for their own purposes. When the military governorship of Confederate states ended, many new pathways to power for African-American women ended as well.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Hagfishes (Myxinidae) are common in deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). Two of the species found in the GOM are endemic to the area and potentially provide key ecosystem services (e.g. generate substrate turnover and recycling of organic matter by consuming carrion falls) to the deep environments of the Gulf. Yet, very little is known about hagfish life histories and ecology. I investigated inter and intraspecific variations in trophic structure of Eptatretus springeri, Eptatretus minor, Myxine mcmillanae, including variations along relevant environmental gradients. At the time of this study, the Gulf of Mexico had recently experienced an environmental disaster with the Deep Water Horizon (DWH) oil spill. As a result, I also investigated the potential effects of the DWH oil spill on hagfish trophic structure, and the potential for higher bioaccumulation of mercury (Hg) in their muscle tissue. Feeding ecology and trophic structure were investigated using nitrogen (δ15N), carbon (δ13C) and sulfur (δ34S) stable isotopes and variability in the lipid content (Δδ13C) of each species was used as an indicator of periods of feeding and fasting. I was able to differentiate the isotopic niche of each of the species and determine the different feeding ecologies of E. springeri and M. mcmillanae. The isotopic niche of E. minor overlaps with that of E. springeri and M. mcmillanae. The most depleted mean δ15N values were observed in E. springeri (12.8‰), followed by E. minor (13.9 ‰) and M. mcmillanae (14.9‰). Eptatretus springeri had the highest (Δδ13C), lowest trophic level (δ15N) and exhibited the most isotopic variation with depth. This could suggest this species is an active predator that feeds regularly, and potentially relies on scavenging only to supplement its diet. Eptatretus minor had slightly higher Δδ13C, intermediate but depleted δ15N, and higher δ15N isotopic diversity. These characteristics suggest a more opportunistic foraging behavior for this species, potentially feeding on prey items from several trophic levels. Myxine mcmillanae had the highest δ15N but lowest Δδ13C, and no variation in δ15N with depth. These trends indicate this species could be experiencing irregular feeding with periods of fasting, potentially due to a mostly scavenging behavior and occasionally feeding on larger but infrequentl available carrion falls of large animals. Spatial analysis showed all hagfish species displayed enriched δ15N and δ13C, and depleted δ34S values on the continental slope off Louisiana than along the North Florida Slope and in DeSoto Canyon. These shifts in isotopic signatures could be attributed to influx from riverine sources from the Mississippi River. Temporal variations were also correlated to the seasonality of nutrient discharge from the river. Isotopic shifts seemed to be a consequence of riverine inputs rather than as a result of changing environmental conditions from the DWH oil spill. This study also determined Total Hg (THg) and Hg species (Methyl-Mercury-MeHg, inorganic Hg-IHg) concentrations in hafish muscle tissue. There was significant intra and interspecific variation in THg concentrations of all three hagfish species. Enriched δ15N and much higher THg concentrations were observed in M. mcmillanae (11.9 ppm) when compared to E. minor (2.1 ppm) and E. springeri (1.1 ppm). Mean MeHg concentrations were highest in M. mcmillanae (10.9 ppm), followed by E. minor (1.4 ppm) and E. springeri (0.8 ppm), while mean IHg concentrations were 1.3 ppm, 0.7 ppm, and 0.4 ppm , respectively. However, Hg species displayed a wide range of variation, with IHg concentrations in muscle tissue accounting for up to 75% to 95% of the THg content for some individuals. THg concentrations were studied in relation to several biological and environmental factors (stable isotopes, depth, total, length, body weight and lipid content, spatial and temporal variations) but most of these relationships were not significant for one or more species, which suggests that more than one uptake and depuration pathway or factors could contribute to the bioaccumulation of Hg in hagfishes.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Sometimes ignorance functions as a legitimate excuse, and sometimes it doesn’t. It is widely maintained that, when the ignorance an agent acts or omits from is blameless, it excuses an agent. Call this claim the Blameless Ignorance Principle, or (BI). This principle is at the heart of questions concerning the epistemic condition on blameworthiness; my project explores a number of these with the aim of developing the literature in three areas.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>I first explore the epistemic condition on derivative blameworthiness. An agent’s blameworthiness for something is derivative when it depends upon his blameworthiness for some prior thing that it resulted from. However, not just any negative consequence that a blameworthy action or omission results in is something for which the agent is thereby also blameworthy. It is often maintained that, in addition, the consequence must have been foreseeable for the agent. I develop a two-part argument against this view. First, I argue that agents can be blameless for failing to foresee what was reasonably foreseeable for them. Second, I explain that, if this is so and if (BI) is true, then the foreseeability view is false. Consequently, I consider an alternative view that requires actual foresight and is consistent with (BI).</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Concerned with the 1974 Conference on College Composition and Communication initiative Students Rights to Their Own Language (SRTOL), a resolution calling for writing teachers to respect the rich diversity of languages students bring with them to the classroom, this dissertation investigates the language interactions between  writing tutors and their tutees in a historically black college or university (HBCU) writing center to better understand the intersection of African American Language (AAL) and Edited American English (EAE) . Composition studies has yet to explore the implementation of SRTOL in a historically black university, particularly in the site of a writing center. This dissertation fills that gap. Using a case study methodology, this dissertation constructs a rich description of the ways participants negotiates the challenges posed by linguistic push-pull (Smitherman) guided by three questions: </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>1.  How are AAL and EAE used in the within an HBU writing center? How do the uses of AAL and EAE reflect linguistic push-pull (LPP)?</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>2.  How does the intersection of AAL and EAE support or erode the writing center’s learning goals as well as the student's and or tutor's perceptions of his or her learning goals? </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>3.  What does this intersection of multiple language practices reveal about the benefits and challenges of implementing multilingual teaching in a HBU writing center? </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study included eight self-identify AAL participants, three tutors and five tutees, who negotiated AAL and EAE for two ends: to bond and to work. Given that the tutor-tutee interactions in this study share AAL and EAE, the results of this study revealed that patterns in (a)motivation: reticence, resistance, and diversion. For example, Matthius, an AAL-speaking tutor, used EAE syntactical as well as organizational structures when teaching his participants EAE grammar, but he used rhetorical features of AAL, such as signifying, narrativizing, and indirection, to establish or sustain fictive kinships with his tutees that positively influenced student and tutor outcomes. Meanwhile, Maya's use of these same strategies at time yielded adverse responses. Overall, the interpretation of these data depicts how LPP supports, and at times erodes, the expectation of learning in the FAMU Writing Resource Center.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para/>
            <DISS_para>Though challenges of teaching AAL include the homogenizing HBCUs and deciding who will teach it, the benefits of viewing AAL as multilingualism yielded individual and collective valuation of language and culture. Taken together, AAL tutors and tutees align with Natalie DeCheck’s claim that tutors who share common interests with tutees, such as language, motivate tutees to improve their writing. Specifically, they use AAL to redefine amotivation as an agentive process of learning and instruction. The results of this agency not only expands our understanding of culturally-situated motivation but they also complicates Smitherman’s definition of LPP, to love and hate one’s language simultaneously. Tension between the tutor and tutee, however, proved to be more complex and resulted from varying degrees of LPP. This study, then, also provides insight to intersection of African American language and culture and their impact on AAL student-tutor negotiations of academic literacies. By seeking deeper knowledge of the language and literate practices of African American learners, this dissertation provides a means of supporting and valuing these learners and the spaces they create to value themselves while traversing the often dismal academic terrains.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This work presents a full experimental and theoretical study of the first radical enyne cascade in which chemo- and regioselective interaction of the triple bond with Bu3Sn radicals originates from a conceptually novel source and propagates in an unprecedented sequence of steps that renders alkenes synthetic equivalents of alkynes by coupling cyclization/rearrangement cascade with an aromatizing C-C bond fragmentation. The net result is a convenient transformation of readily available enyne reactants to -Sn substituted naphthalenes that can serve as a launching platform for the preparation of extended distorted polyaromatics.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Every step in the multi-step cascade provides fundamental insights into the new ways to control radical transformations. For example, the remarkable chemo- and regio-selectivity of the initial radical attack originates from the combination of Dynamic Covalent Chemistry (DCC) with kinetic self-sorting. We have identified a new 1,2 stannyl shift as a low-barrier mechanism for the conversion of an unproductive vinyl radical to the radical adduct which can undergo fast 5-exo-trig closure (serving as kinetic self-sorting). We have also identified substitution patterns that can selectively direct the initially formed cyclic radical to react further in one of the following three ways: H-abstraction, -scission and, ring expansion. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Unlike the analogous radical that would be formed from a 5-exo-dig closure of an enediyne, the 5-exo-trig product originating from the enyne is sufficiently flexible to undergo homoallylic ring expansion to the formal 6-endo product. In the final unusually facile C-C fragmentation step, this product undergoes aromatization to provide the otherwise inaccessible 6-endo-dig cyclization product of enediynes. In the overall sequence, the alkene moiety of enynes serves as a synthetic alkyne equivalent because this radical sequence “self-terminates” via aromatizing C-C bond cleavage.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The key “self-terminating” C-C fragmentation is assisted by a new electronic effect in radical chemistry, the three-electron through bonding (TB) interaction. This interaction provides a conduit for selective transition state stabilization in the fragmentation process. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The described reaction sequence contains several mechanistic novelties. First, the chemoselective intermolecular activation of enynes is achieved by directing the tin radical to the correct position via dynamic covalent chemistry assisted by kinetic self-sorting. Unique feature of this design is the incorporation of a radical leaving group (an α-oxy alkyl fragment) which provides selective transition state (TS) stabilization to facilitate the final C-C bond cleavage. This “self-terminating” radical fragmentation enables the conceptually novel use of alkenes as “alkyne equivalents.” </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Overall, our in-depth computational and experimental analysis of the radical chemistry of aromatic enynes paints a richly complex picture.  Ultimately, chemoselective interaction of aromatic enynes with Bu3Sn radicals can be harnessed for three selective cascade transformations for the preparation of Sn-substituted indenes and naphthalenes. We have shown how the otherwise unproductive Sn radical additions to multifunctional substrates can be rerouted via a novel 1,2 stannyl shift to form a productive radical with tunable reactivity. We have utilized this process as a launching platform for the preparation of extended polyaromatics and helicenes. The mild conditions and functional group tolerance of radical cascades are illustrated by the range of electronically diverse polyaromatics and helicenes prepared by this method. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Furthermore, the study of the photochemical counterpart of the same stereoelectronically designed enynes enabled the first practical way to accomplish the last of the four archetypical cyclizations of aromatic enediynes and enynes, the C1-C5 photochemical closure of enynes. The first step in the new reaction cascade is the transformation of aromatic enynes to a twisted excited state, driven by escape from antiaromaticity of the vertical excited state. The role of (anti)aromaticity in this transformation is illustrated by the ACID plots and NICS values given below. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The relief of excited state antiaromaticity (ESAA) provides the initial push for the electronic reorganization associated with the formation of a cyclic structure. Twisting of the alkene regains aromatic character and leads to a unique stereoelectronic situation that formally facilitates the usually unfavorable 5-endo-trig cyclization. Furthermore, the 4-exo-trig cyclization which competes with 5-endo-trig closure in ground state alkenes is disfavored by the twist because the radical orbital at the internal alkene carbon is aligned with the π-system and is not available for intramolecular reactions with the alkyne. The attack of the radical at the external alkene carbon on the triple bond formally merges 5-endo-trig with 5-exo-dig ring closure. The net result is a convenient transformation of readily available aromatic enyne reactants to substituted benzofulvenes. We believe that this is the first example in which ESAA of a benzene ring is explicitly applied to accomplish a new and synthetically useful transformation.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This finding expands the utility of self-terminating aromatizing enyne cascades to photochemical reactions. The 1,4-diradical product of the initial rearrangement undergoes an internal H-atom transfer that is coupled with  fragmentation of an exocyclic C-C bond. This sequence provides efficient access to benzofulvenes from enynes without the need for an external oxidant. Incorporating C-C bond cleavage into the photochemical self-terminating cyclizations of enynes allows the use of alkenes as alkyne equivalents. The final product is analogous to the product of a C1-C5 cyclization of enediynes that is impossible to accomplish in a synthetically useful way for these substitution patterns. The strategic feature of this self-terminating reaction is that, despite the involvement of radical species in the key cyclization step, no external radical sources or quenchers are needed to provide the products. In these cascades, both radical centers are formed transiently and converted in the closed-shell products via intramolecular H-transfer and C-C bond fragmentation.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this thesis a practical approach for characterizing the common mode behavior of the power electronic devices (PED) on board a next generation All-Electric ship (AES) power system is proposed. As the topic of AES design is becoming more and more relevant for the US navy, addressing the AES design challenges get more importance and attention. The AES power system is designed ungrounded to make the system capable of operating after a single phase to ground fault (which is the most common type of fault in power systems). However, the inevitable parasitic coupling in the system can cause overvoltages and spike currents in the case of ground faults. The mentioned parasitic coupling can also form a common mode loop consisting of the system conductors, the parasitic coupling effect at different locations of the system, and the ground path (which is the Ship hull in this case). High frequency contents produced by the fast switching of the power converters can circulate in the so called common mode loop. To design the best grounding scheme for AES power system accurate and reliable models of the common mode characteristics of the shipboard power systems components is needed.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Among the components seen in a shipboard power system the PEDs are the most difficult parts of the system to characterize due to their non-linear time-variant nature. At the Center for Advanced Power Systems (CAPS) at Florida State University the researchers developed a general guideline for characterizing the common mode behavior of the passive components of the power system using scattering parameters measurement. In practical cases the access to the internal parts of a PED may not be available or may have significant safety issues. On the other hand, the detailed information on the operation of the PED, which is needed to characterize the common mode sources in the system, may not be given by the manufacturer. In this thesis, the impedance of the low pass filter is measured using the mentioned Scattering parameter guideline with additional considerations. A frequency domain approach is utilized to reconstruct the common mode voltage of the PED (specifically a full-bridge 3-phase inverter) at the switches by measuring the common mode current in a previously characterized test setup; which included a DC source, a common mode low pass filter, a 3-phase transmission line, and a rotational load with grounded casing. The results show that the common mode voltage of the inverter can be estimated without accessing inside the device while in operation.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The following dissertation examines consumer decision-making in two important contexts. The first is in the domain of health and nutrition decisions. Both governmental entities and corporations alike have tried, albeit unsuccessfully, to provide consumers with a means of easily judging nutritional content and thus, prompting healthier consumption choices. As such, Essay 1 introduces and empirically tests a new labeling format designed to aid consumers in making better nutritional choices. The second domain in which consumer decision-making is studied is within the context of corporate social responsibility (CSR). While extant research has identified numerous benefits of CSR initiatives, relatively little work offers insight into how the amount of CSR influences the attribution of blame. Therefore, essay 2 addresses this gap in the literature by examining empirically the idea that CSR initiatives do not uniformly repress the attribution of blame, nor the intentions to punish, among consumers following a firm-specific irresponsible event. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Essay 1 makes a number of contributions to the transformative consumer research and marketing literatures by introducing a novel concept called integrative nutrition information as a means of encouraging healthier consumption choices. Integrative nutrition information is defined by Essay 1 as the provision of nutrition information that explicitly and simultaneously presents nutritional information in a format that includes both caloric content and required physical activity time to offset consumption. The results of Essay 1 demonstrate that integrative nutrition information leads to lower rates of consumption when compared to current NLEA-mandated labeling standards. In particular, this effect is a byproduct of loss aversion and negativity bias associated with the required physical activity. Additionally, Essay 1 presents boundary conditions on the strength and effectiveness of integrative nutrition information as well as the underlying mechanism—negative affective forecasting—behind these effects. Essay 1 advances the literature on nutritional information (Grunert, Willis, and Fernandez-Celemin 2010; Kiszko, Martinez, Abrams, and Elbel 2014) by providing information so as to motivate healthier choices (Koenigstorfer, Groeppel-Klein, and Kamm 2014; Liu, Roberto, Liu, and Brownell 2012; Vasiljevic, Pechey, and Marteau 2015).  Specifically, Essay 1 answers the call of scholars to consider novel, more innovative ways of motivating healthier consumer choices (Kiszko et al. 2014) by presenting a labeling format that bridges diet and physical activity, the two aspects of a healthy lifestyle, so as to allow for easier and more effective ways to make healthful choices. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Essay 2 adds to the literature on CSR while also advancing the organizational literature devoted to perceived psychological contracts. Specifically, Essay 2 extends these literature streams by examining when, and the degree to which, a company’s CSR stance, that is, the position a company publicly takes on participating in socially responsible initiatives, influences consumer blame subsequent to a socially irresponsible event. The findings of Essay 2 indicate that the attribution of blame and encouragement of punishment following an irresponsible event is moderated by level of CSR stance. Moreover, Essay 2 identifies the underlying process that accounts for this effect. Specifically, when consumers are made aware of a company-specific irresponsible event, they tend to experience feelings of betrayal, which precipitate support for company sanctions. This effect is particularly strong with relatively higher levels of CSR-stances. The insights from Essay 2 make important empirical contributions by establishing a previously undefined effect - that a relatively higher CSR stance leads consumers to appoint harsher punishments following an irresponsible event. Without doubt, CSR initiatives are valuable assets to firms (Du, Bhattacharya, and Sen 2007; Morsing 2006; Torelli, Monga, and Kaikati 2012), but at the same time Essay 2 finds firm managers must recognize the possible negative consequences of a relatively higher CSR stances.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Superior decision-making in chess is thought to rely on a combination of knowledge and search. Research has focused primarily on the chess knowledge base reflected by the importance to chess research of the short-term memory recall paradigm. The direct relevance of research on short-term recall of chess position to the domain-specific knowledge that mediates superior move selection, is based on two theoretical assumptions that have not yet been fully tested. The first assumption is that the chess knowledge base is automatically activated during the perception of a position in a similar manner for move-selection and memory tasks. The second assumption is that the  knowledge that underlies move-selection can be adequately represented in a few seconds by a memory task. Study 1 will estimate the length of the presentation time required to demonstrate superior move selection for skilled chess players. The second study will examine the link between the knowledge structures thought to underlie chess skill (chunks identified in memory tests) and quality of move selection. Study 2 will present a series of chess positions with two different instructions. In the first condition participants will be instructed to recall as much of the presented position a possible and in the second condition they will be asked to select the best move followed by recall. This study will test for significant differences in the activated chess knowledge in the two conditions and propose a theoretical model for expert move selection based on knowledge and search</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Excluding skin cancers, prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in American men. The American Cancer Society estimated 220,800 new prostate cancer cases would be diagnosed in 2015. Prostate cancer is also the second leading cause of cancer-specific mortality at 27,540 deaths estimated in 2015. Of particular concern are the increased incidence, mortality, and aggressive features of prostate cancer seen in African American men. These health disparities are not fully explained by non-biological factors such as socioeconomics, access to care, or treatment. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Prostate cancer presents a compelling case for the clinical usefulness of biomarkers. The lack of an assured prostate cancer susceptibility gene necessitates other molecular markers are required for screening. Because of its slow-growing nature, early prostate cancer is asymptomatic so biomarkers that accurately diagnose asymptomatic prostate cancer would be of great value. Additionally, prognostic markers to discriminate indolent and aggressive disease would be highly prized. The racial differences in prostate cancer also suggest that biomarkers could be particularly useful in heavily burdened populations such as African American men. For a myriad of reasons, however, biomarker discovery has not been as fruitful as anticipated in the wake of advances in high-throughput genomic and proteomic technologies. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Pathway analysis has emerged as a strategy for identifying molecular changes in prostate cancer and uncovering molecular targets for biomarkers and therapy. The thread uniting the studies presented herein is the application of pathway analysis to human prostate cancer to identify altered mechanisms of prostate cancer tumors development and progression. Study 1 used comprehensive genomic patient data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas to identify differentially expressed genes and pathway signatures in prostate cancer. This analysis highlighted the strong association of the “TGF-β signaling” and “Ran regulation of mitotic spindle formation” with prostate cancer and confirmed reported findings from microarray data that suggest “Actin Cytoskeleton Regulation”, “Cell Cycle”, “MAPK Signaling”, and “Calcium Signaling” are also altered in prostate cancer. Study 2 incorporated a similar methodological approach to study paired RC-77 human prostate cancer cell lines. This cell model is one of few models derived from an African American patient. This work completed the first comprehensive proteomic analysis of RC-77 cell lines and found 63 differentially expressed proteins between the malignant RC-77T/E cell line and the non-malignant RC-77N/E, with 18 proteins uniquely detected in RC-77T/E and 2 proteins uniquely detected in RC-77N/E. Many of these differentially expressed proteins fall into the category of structural proteins or have a structural role. A pathway approach was used to provide a context for these differences and revealed correlation of  the “Tight Junction”, “Cell Adhesion Molecules”, “Adherens Junction”, “ECM-Receptor interaction”, “Focal Adhesion”, and “Proteoglycans in Cancer” pathways with either RC-77T/E or RC-77N/E cells. Study 3 applied the pathway analysis to race-, age-, and stage-matched malignant and non-malignant prostate tissues to examine pathway dysregulation in the context of racial health disparities. While this small case study was not able to show racial differences in the expression of individual genes, pathways were differentially associated with African American prostate cancer. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Prior research suggests auditor resources are quasi-fixed at the office-level: local audit offices operate as semi-autonomous units, and resources are costly to transfer across offices.  The objective of this study is to document a relation created by office-level resource constraints; the allocation of additional resources to one engagement is accompanied by a decrease in the resources allocated to concurrent engagements.  To accomplish this, I examine the effect a restatement has on auditor effort for both firms issuing restatements and non-restating clients of the same audit office.  I document increased audit fees and an improvement in audit quality for restating clients, indicative of additional resources being allocated to high-risk engagements.   For non-restating clients of offices issuing a restatement, I document lower audit fees and an increased likelihood of misstatement.  The effects for non-restating clients are strongest in offices issuing multiple restatements and in small offices, where incrementally more resources are drawn from concurrent engagements.  This study contributes to a better understanding of auditor behavior by providing evidence changes in a single client’s risk profile can alter the distribution of office resources and affect audit quality, underscoring the importance of properly assessing and addressing resource limitations.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>An objective index of the onset and demise of the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) is introduced. This index has the advantage of simplicity by using only one readily available variable, All-India rainfall (AIR), which has been reliably observed for more than a century. The proposed All-India rainfall onset and demise (AIROD) is shown to be insensitive to all recorded false onsets. By definition, the seasonal ISM rainfall anomalies become a function of the variations of onset and demise dates, with early onset and late demise resulting in greater season length and total seasonal rainfall. Seasonal rainfall itself is a strong predictor of the following ENSO phase and provides a more accurate depiction of the ISM than does the commonly-used June-September (JJAS) All-India monsoon rainfall (AIMR) index.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This new index provides an accurate and comprehensive representation of the seasonal evolution of the ISM by capturing dramatic changes in large-scale dynamic (i.e. wind- and current-based) and thermodynamic (temperature- and moisture-based) variables, which is found to make the onset an especially important feature to monitor to understand the evolution of the ensuing monsoon season. In particular, the zonal (meridional) progression of 300hPa meridional temperature gradient (meridional ocean heat transport) reversal may be monitored about twenty days before onset to help determine the timing of its arrival. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Interannual variability of ISM features and their associated large-scale phenomena are also analyzed. An early (late) onset corresponds to an increase (decrease) in anomalies of kinetic energy of 850hPa wind over the Arabian Sea and central Indian rainfall up to fifteen and ten days before onset, respectively. Conversely, an early (late) demise corresponds to a decrease (increase) in the aforementioned anomalies up to ten days after demise. Additionally, the preceding December-February ENSO phase is associated with the onset of the ISM, as an early (late) onset is preceded by La Niña (El Niño).</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) has been proposed as an important transdiagnostic variable within various anxiety and mood disorders. It has been suggested that individuals high in IU may interpret ambiguous information in a more threatening manner. A parallel line of research has begun to show that interpretive biases can be modified through cognitive training. Specifically, previous research aimed at modifying negative interpretations through Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM-I) has yielded promising results. Despite the suggested negative interpretation bias for ambiguous information among those high in IU, and the emerging evidence for CBM-I protocols, no research to date has examined the efficacy of an IU focused CBM-I paradigm. The current study investigated the impact of a brief IU focused CBM-I on reductions in IU. The sample comprised 79 undergraduate individuals who were randomly assigned to the active (IU CBM-I) or control CBM-I condition. Results indicated no significant differences in IU in individuals in the control versus active condition from pre-intervention to one month follow-up. Furthermore, change in interpretation bias did not mediate the relationship between condition and reductions in IU (pre-intervention to one month follow-up) through change in interpretation bias. Exploratory analyses found a significant interaction between condition and time from pre- to post-intervention, suggesting that individuals in the active (versus the control) condition evidenced significantly lower IU from pre- to post-intervention. Results of the present study are discussed in terms of theoretical models of IU and directions for future research.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The study conducted U-Pb isotopic dating of the pitchblende mineralization of the Coles Hill uranium deposit in Pittsylvania County, VA. The ore body is found along the Chatham fault and within the Martinsville Igneous Complex. In attempt to constrain the time of uranium mineralization, samples were collected within the fractures to the west of the Chatham fault that separates the host rock from the Danville Basin. Fifteen samples were analyzed for uranium and lead concentrations, as well as their isotopic lead compositions. BSE imaging revealed that the milligram sized samples consisted of multiple phases mixed on a micron scale. Uranium and lead isotopic analyses revealed that some phase or phases contained highly radiogenic (206Pb/204Pb ratios between 2,000 and 3,000) while some phases or phases were dominated by common lead. Highly discordant Pb/U ages of the highly radiogenic samples seem to be due to recent loss of substantial amounts of uranium. Analyses of these on a Concordia plot seems to indicate that uranium loss was not in a single event but occurred over time and likely recently. Therefore it was not possible to directly determine the age of the uranium mineralization. The four samples dominated by lead lie closely at 1115 Ma Pb-Pb isochron. It is inferred from this that the common lead present was derived from Grenville age basement that underlies the Smith River Allochthon.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Nurses comprise the largest single component of hospital staff, and are the primary providers of direct patient care (American Association of Colleges of Nursing, 2011). Nationwide, nursing is the largest healthcare profession, with more than 3.1 million Registered Nurses (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2010). The number of nurses that passed the licensing exam increased steadily between 2001 and 2011, from 68,561 to 142,390 NCLEX-RN passers; representing a 107.7% growth (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2013). Music therapy, as a growing health care profession, has 19% of the Board Certified music therapists employed in a mental health setting, the largest population served, according to the response to the 2015 American Music Therapy Member Survey and Workforce Analysis (AMTA, 2015). With the understanding of the steady increase in upcoming nursing professionals and the growth and need of music therapy in mental health settings, this study aimed to assess nursing students’ attitudes towards music therapy and its role in mental health. Participants (N=194) completed a one-time survey consisting of Likert-scale questions with responses pertaining to knowledge, perception, and opinions on music therapy. The largest group of participants (39%) responded that they knew about music therapy’s role in mental health but were doubtful if this information was accurate. Regarding the effectiveness of music therapy in addressing certain goals in mental health treatment, the goals ‘Decrease Depressive Symptoms’, and ‘Anxiety Reduction” were found to have higher scores than the other goals listed on the survey. Results also showed that participants who indicated that they previously attended/observed a music therapy session, viewed it as more valuable in mental health treatment than those who indicated no former experience. These results were statistically significant at the α = .05 level. Academic level was also a variable that had a significant effect on participants’ perceived value of music therapy in mental health treatment. Participants who identified themselves as seniors rated music therapy as more valuable compared to those students who identified themselves as juniors. Additionally, 52% of participants who stated previous exposure to music therapy indicated future patient’s referral to music therapy to be ‘Extremely Likely’. Implications for these results are explored.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Renewable energy sources are fundamental alternatives to supply the rising energy demand in the world and to reduce or replace fossil fuel technologies. In order to make renewable-based technologies suitable for commercial and industrial applications, two main challenges need to be solved: the design and manufacture of highly efficient devices and reliable systems to operate under intermittent energy supply conditions. In particular, power generation technologies based on solar energy are one of the most promising alternatives to supply the world energy demand and reduce the dependence on fossil fuel technologies. In this dissertation, the dynamic behavior of a Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) supercritical CO2 cycle is studied under different seasonal conditions. The system analyzed is composed of a central receiver, hot and cold thermal energy storage units, a heat exchanger, a recuperator, and multi-stage compression-expansion subsystems with intercoolers and reheaters between compressors and turbines respectively. The effects of operating and design parameters on the system performance are analyzed. Some of these parameters are the mass flow rate, intermediate pressures, number of compression-expansion stages, heat exchangers’ effectiveness, multi-tank thermal energy storage, overall heat transfer coefficient between the solar receiver and the environment and the effective area of the recuperator. Energy and exergy models for each component of the system are developed to optimize operating parameters in order to lead to maximum efficiency. From the exergy analysis, the components with high contribution to exergy destruction were identified. These components, which represent an important potential of improvement, are the recuperator, the hot thermal energy storage tank and the solar receiver.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Two complementary alternatives to improve the efficiency of concentrated solar thermal systems are proposed in this dissertation: the optimization of the system’s operating parameters and optimization of less efficient components. The parametric optimization is developed for a 1MW reference CSP system with CO2 as the working fluid. The component optimization, focused on the less efficient components, comprises some design modifications to the traditional component configuration for the recuperator, the hot thermal energy storage tank and the solar receiver. The proposed optimization alternatives include the heat exchanger’s effectiveness enhancement by optimizing fins shapes, multi-tank thermal energy storage configurations for the hot thermal energy storage tank and the incorporation of a transparent insulation material into the solar receiver. Some of the optimizations are conducted in a generalized way, using dimensionless models to be applicable no only to the CSP but also to other thermal systems. This project is therefore an effort to improve the efficiency of power generation systems based on solar energy in order to make them competitive with conventional fossil fuel power generation devices. The results show that the parametric optimization leads the system to an efficiency of about 21% and a maximum power output close to 1.5 MW. The process efficiencies obtained in this work, of more than 21%, are relatively good for a solar-thermal conversion system and are also comparable with efficiencies of conversion of high performance PV panels. The thermal energy storage allows the system to operate for several hours after sunset. This operating time is approximately increased from 220 to 480 minutes after optimization. The hot and cold thermal energy storage also lessens the temperature fluctuations by providing smooth changes of temperatures at the turbines’ and compressors’ inlets. Additional improvements in the overall system efficiency are possible by optimizing the less efficient components. In particular, the fin’s effectiveness can be improved in more than 5% after its shape is optimized, increments in the efficiency of the thermal energy storage of about 5.7% are possible when the mass is divided into four tanks, and solar receiver efficiencies up to 70% can be maintained for high operating temperatures (~ 1200°C) when a transparent insulation material is incorporated to the receiver. The results obtained in this dissertation indicate that concentrated solar systems using supercritical CO2 could be a viable alternative to satisfying energy needs in desert areas with scarce water and fossil fuel resources.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) provides a unique contrast based on the restricted directionality of water movement in an anisotropic environment. As such, DTI-based tractography can be used to characterize and quantify the structural connectivity within neural tissue. Here, DTI-based connectivity within isolated abdominal ganglia (ABG) of aplysia Californica is analyzed using network theory. In addition to quantifying the regional physical proprieties of the fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), DTI tractography was used to probe inner-connections of local communities, yielding unweighted, undirected graphs that represent community structures. Local and global efficiency, characteristic path lengths and clustering analysis are performed on both experimental and simulated data. The relevant intensity and velocity by which these specific nodes communicate is probed through weighted clustering coefficient measurements for the descriptive weighted matrices. Both small-worldness and novel small world metrics were used as tools to verify the small-world properties for the experimental results. The aim of this manuscript is to categorize and quantify the properties exhibited by structural networks in a model neural tissue to derive unique mean field information that quantitatively describe macroscopic connectivity. For ABG, findings demonstrate a default structural network with preferential specific small-world properties when compared to simulated lattice and random networks that are equivalent in order and degree.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The value of the current pass/fail version of the standardized audit report has been criticized as not providing stakeholders with much information beyond the qualified vs. unqualified opinion (Cohen Commission 1978; Church et al. 2008; Gray et al. 2011; Mock et al. 2013). In 2013, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) proposed addition of Critical Audit Matters (CAMs) to the standardized audit report in the hopes that the auditor further highlighting key areas of risk information will reduce the information asymmetry between financial statement users and management (PCAOB 2013). Current CAM research demonstrates investors (Christensen et al. 2014) and jurors (Kachelmeier et al. 2015; Brasel et al. 2016) incorporate CAM information into their decisions to invest or hold auditors responsible for future misstatements. However, it is unclear if this is because users incorporate the underlying risk information or have misconceptions about auditor ability to substantiate management’s assertions related to that risk even in the presence of an unqualified opinion. In this study, I apply the Mental Models Approach to risk communication outlined by Morgan et al. (2002) to investigate this issue. Qualitatively, I use a combination of interviews and surveys with investors and auditors to specifically identify areas where auditor and investor views of CAMs and overall audit reporting diverge. I find auditors are skeptical of the potential effectiveness of CAMs and of investor ability to interpret CAM information. I also find that while many investors in this study have a working knowledge of some audit terms such as reasonable assurance and materiality, they do not understand that even in the presence of CAMs an unqualified opinion means sufficient audit evidence has been obtained related to the statements as a whole, including CAM items. This misconception results in the investor belief CAMs serve as a tool to highlight areas for which the auditor is not comfortable. In light of these findings, I suggest language making this relationship clear be included with the presented CAM to improve its effectiveness. Next experimentally, I attempt to evaluate the effectiveness of various versions of the CAM risk disclosure, including versions with such clarifying language and the language recommended by the PCAOB.  As one of the goals of the disclosure is to highlight risk disclosure, I measure the effectiveness of CAMs by evaluating how well each disclosure assists investors in aligning their investment choices and personal preferences for or aversion to risk.  I find that although not better than having no CAM at all, CAM disclosure is most effective in creating alignment of investment decisions and risk preferences when there is language that makes clear the sufficiency of the auditor’s efforts to substantiate management’s assertions related to the CAM area.</DISS_para>

      <DISS_content>
         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The low quality of educational services in the favelas (slums) of Rio de Janeiro is well documented (e.g., Abramo, 2003; Alves, Franco &amp; Ribeiro, 2008; Cano, 2012; Cavallieri e Coelho, 2003; Frigotto, 2004; Henriques, 2000; Henrique &amp; Ramos, 2011; Machado, 2002 &amp; 2008; Valladares, 2010). In 2010, the average twenty-five year-old living in a favela would not have completed primary school. The adult illiteracy rate is almost three times higher in the favelas as compared to the population that does not live in Rio’s slums (Rocha &amp; Carusi, 2012). Alves and Ribeiro (2008) showed that children and teenagers that live in favelas are 51 times less likely to be in the appropriate grade given their age compared to a similar population that does not live in the favelas.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The achievement gap between high and low-income children is widely discussed in the literature (see, for example, Bowles, 2014; Caldas &amp; Bankston, 1997; Clark, 1984; Heyneman &amp; Loxley, 1983; Lee &amp; Burkam, 2002; Reardon, 2011).  I was interested in exploring to what extent educational policies that target low-income students were contributing to reducing the achievement gap between poor and non-poor children. To study this topic, I investigated a specific educational initiative implemented in the city of Rio de Janeiro, called Escolas do Amanhã  (EDA), and its potential effects on student learning outcomes, as proxied by average test scores in math and Portuguese, and by average dropout rates of EDA schools compared to non-EDA schools. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Given the lack of random selection, a simple comparison between outcomes achieved at schools within and outside of the program would threaten to bias estimates of the program’s effect. To address the sample selection bias, I employed the propensity score matching technique  to build similar treatment and comparison groups such that the only observed difference could be attributed to program differences.  The assumption is that the schools would have the same disposition to receive the treatment (propensity score), but one group would receive the treatment and the other would not. In the analysis of 4th grade Prova Brasil scores and drop out rates, one hundred and forty-one control units have been matched to one hundred and forty-seven Escolas do Amanhã schools. For the outcomes related to 8th grade standardized assessment score, one hundred and seven control units have been matched to one hundred and forty-seven Escolas do Amanhã. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Although EDA schools underperform in mathematics and Portuguese test scores compared to non-EDA schools, the differences were not significant. Therefore, based on my findings, there is no credible evidence as to whether the  Escolas do Amanhã program improves students test score  or the likelihood of completing elementary education.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Cyberbullying is a problem that many young adults ages 12 to 18 have experienced on a daily basis. Adult support is critical in both the prevention and intervention of cyberbullying. Although parents, teachers, and school administrators have been highlighted as sources of support for cyberbullied young adults, librarians have not been studied as a source of support although school and public librarians engage with teens on a daily basis. Through empathetic services, i.e., activities carried out in everyday in which librarians provide empathy, librarians can support young adults who are experiencing and/or witnessing cyberbullying. Empathy in the library has been infrequently researched within LIS, often under different labels such as pastoral care and customer service. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The purpose of this research was to investigate how rural school and public librarians can be a source of support for rural cyberbullied young adults. The study was guided by three research questions in which I explored the types of support rural young adults desired and received from rural librarians as well as the types of support rural librarians perceived they offered. I also contextualized the results with relational communication theory to investigate an additional dimension for understanding empathetic services in the present and possible future research.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	In this project, I used two qualitative methods: semi-structured interviews and structured video autoethnography. The 14 participants in this project included three school librarians, four public librarians, and seven young adults. The participants were all residents of rural Southwest Georgia. In this project, I focused on rural young adults and rural librarians within this region. In addition to the participants, I also acted as a participant and maintained a personal written autoethnography to reflect on my research process. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	In my analysis, I found that while young adults often saw librarians as sources for information, mentorship, and everyday help, they also saw potential for librarians to engage in advocacy and empathy in the library for teens. In many interviews and video entries, the librarians frequently highlighted their important role in information provision and instruction for young adult. While a few librarians acknowledged that they provided social, emotional, psychological, and empathetic support for their young patrons, librarian participants typically diminished the importance of this role in their work. However, librarians revealed a desire to not only increase their improve their role as a provider of information and instruction but also to increase the social, emotional, psychological, and empathetic support they provided in their libraries.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Since this is an exploratory project, I proposed that future research is needed into relational communication theory as a framework for empathetic services. I also suggested that empathy in the library is a little researched area in LIS and often overlooked by librarians in the field. Additional research is needed in the important role of empathetic services in librarianship. This research fills a gap in the literature about rural librarians as a source of support for rural cyberbullied young adults and introduces the term “empathetic services”.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>It has become common practice among saxophonists to transcribe or arrange music that was originally composed for other instruments. The definition of a transcription is to change the instrument for which the work is written; no octave placements, notes, articulations, dynamic markings, etc. are altered. The definition of an arrangement is the transfer of a work between instruments with some changes in octave placements, articulations, dynamic markings, etc. with possible re-composition of sections to better suit the instrument the new instrumentation.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This paper will focus on two arrangements: Capriccio Fantastico sull'opera Rigoletto di Verdi, composed by Italian performer/composer Donato Lovreglio for flute and piano, arranged for soprano saxophone and piano; and Verklärte Nacht, Op. 4, composed by Arnold Schoenberg for string sextet, arranged for 11-part saxophone ensemble; and one transcription, Fantasia da Concerto su motivi di "La Traviata" de G. Verdi, also composed by Donato Lovreglio for clarinet and orchestra, transcribed for alto saxophone and orchestra or piano. For the arrangements, an examination of the adaptations to better suit the new instrumentation will be made. Transferring idiomatic techniques between instruments can often prove difficult and there are certain techniques on saxophone that will most effectively emulate the original intent of the composer. Additionally, providing the context of the techniques within these works will lead to a better recreation of these techniques and more convincing performances.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>One of the reasons these works were selected was because of the necessity to utilize and incorporate the altissimo register in order to remain true to the composer’s original intent. The arrangements and transcriptions generally approach the altissimo register using consonant intervals that can be audiated more easily for students than some of the saxophone's post-tonal standard repertoire. This particular technique is vital for the modern saxophonist and deserves special mention and attention.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Teachers’ interactions with children represent an important source of influence in children’s learning and development. Classroom organization, or the way the teacher manages the physical and behavioral aspects of the classroom environment, is one way that teachers can provide needed support to students who might otherwise struggle to be successful in the classroom environment. It is hypothesized to facilitate more time spent working productively on academic tasks which, in turn, is associated with higher academic achievement. In this study, teachers’ classroom organization was observed and rated in the first, second, and third grades, and students’ word reading, reading comprehension, and listening comprehension were measured each year. Cross-sectional analyses of the second and third grade data were conducted in order to replicate the findings of a previous study using the first grade data from the same data set (Pilcher &amp; Kim, 2015). The relations of ratings of classroom organization and the interactions of classroom organization with children’s prior performance (measured in the fall of first grade) in each year were also examined longitudinally. The sample included 264 students and 29 teachers in year one, 36 teachers in year two, and 35 teachers in year three. In the second and third grade cross-sectional analyses, classroom organization was not associated with student outcomes, and no significant interactions of classroom organization with prior achievement were detected. No significant longitudinal relations of classroom organization with student achievement were detected, but there were two significant interaction effects. Second grade teachers’ classroom organization interacted with prior performance to predict students’ third grade word reading and reading comprehension such that students whose scores were below the mean in the fall of the first grade had third grade scores that were very similar or only slightly higher when their second grade teachers provided higher levels of classroom organization. Students who began first grade with word reading and/or reading comprehension scores that were above the mean had third grade scores that were much higher when their teachers provided high levels of classroom organization in the second grade. The most likely explanation for these findings seems to be that children who leave first grade without the prerequisite skills for engaging in meaning-based instruction in second grade are unable to benefit from having a second grade teacher who provides a high level of classroom organization.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The notion of this piece came about through the fusion of a wide number of influences. First and foremost is my love for, and practical experience with, music that makes use of the electric guitar. I wanted to transform the guitar’s role and context to fit the aural image I had for a meditative, expansive work that could evoke a sense of space. The harmonic constructions of incomplete or altered iterations of the overtone series was largely influenced by composers Gérard Grisey and James Tenney. The concept of integration of guitar and bass with more standard instruments from the concert hall is largely influenced by the work of Italian composer Fausto Romitelli and the tendency toward delicate sounds and subtle variation was inspired by the music of Morton Feldman.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>During this case study there was an investigation of the perceived impact of social media posts on a college athlete’s performance and self-evaluation.  The goal was to have up to ten Division I athletes from Southeastern colleges or universities.  The convenience sample was recruited through flyers posted on social media and word of mouth.  The participants completed a demographic survey, which allowed them to identify their race and age group (18-20, 21-23, or 24-26).  The survey also asked the athlete to describe their academic classification (freshman, sophomore, junior, senior), as well as their athletic classification (red shirt freshman, true freshman, sophomore, junior, senior), and what sport they play. The athlete also completed a face-to-face interview, with the exception of one athlete, about social media posts and the impact the posts have on them on and off their perspective fields.  For this qualitative study descriptive statistics were used through the survey data received from the participants.  Traditional qualitative analysis techniques were used to identify themes found from the interview responses.  The results of the study revealed the social media activity of the athletes, how social media posts about themselves or teammates impact them on the field, and how the posts have affected how they identify who they are and perceive themselves.   </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this thesis, we study the entanglement properties of quantum systems to characterize quantum phases and phase transitions. We focus on the free fermion lattice systems and we use numerical calculation to verify our ideas. Behavior of the entanglement entropy is used to distinguish different phases, in addition the area law of the entanglement entropy is studied. We propose that beside the entanglement entropy, there is physical information in the entanglement Hamiltonian of the reduced density matrix of a chosen subsystem. We verify our ideas by studying different free fermion models. The verification is made by comparing the results we obtain from studying the behavior of the entanglement Hamiltonian with the known previous results. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>As starting point, to show that entanglement Hamiltonian eigenmodes have physical information, we employ the $XX$ spin chain model. Real space renormalization group method predicts that the ground state is the product state of singlet states and thus those singlet that cross the boundary make the entanglement. We use the entanglement Hamiltonian to show that its single particle eigenmode shows the location of the entangled singlet spins. This is done in the case of ground state at $T=0$. We also studied the entanglement properties of the highly excited eigenstate of the system.  We use modified version of real space renormalization group for excited state and we show that in  $T \neq 0$ case where singlet and triplet state with total $S_Z =0$ make entanglement, entanglement Hamiltonian eigenmode shows the location of the entangled spins. We distinguish one  eigenmode of the entanglement Hamiltonian as the maximally entangled mode. This mode corresponds to the smallest entanglement  energy and thus contributes the most to the entanglement entropy. In addition, we use two one-dimensional free fermion models, namely the random dimer model and power law random banded model to show that for a localized-delocalized phase transition, behavior of the maximally entangled mode is similar to the behavior of the eigenmode of the original Hamiltonian at the Fermi level. We quantify this by comparing their overlaps and the inverse participation ratio of eigenmodes. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The behavior of the entanglement entropy as a well-known quantity is studied in disordered free fermion models. In random dimer model and power law random banded model where the correlated disorder yields to the localized-delocalized phase transition, we show that entanglement entropy saturates in localized phase and diverges in delocalized phase. In addition it violates the area law in delocalized phase. Entanglement entropy of Anderson model in one, two, and three dimensions is also studied and we observed that area law is correct even for the delocalized phase of the Anderson model in three dimensions, provided that system size is larger than the mean free path. The study of a single impurity, one non-zero on-site energy, in the Anderson model is also examined. We concluded that this single impurity changes only the subleading term of the entanglement entropy which is proportional to the inverse of the subsystem size. This subleading term has non-oscillation and oscillating part.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation explores the language that instructors of a second language (such as Spanish) provide their students. Given that input (i.e., communicative samples of the target language (TL)) is a fundamental concept to all theories of language acquisition, this dissertation examines the quantity, the quality, and the frequency of the input that instructors provide in the classroom. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation reports on a study of instructors’ input (N=14). Participants included instructors at four different levels of Spanish (Elementary I and II and Intermediate I and II), from different native languages (native speakers (NS) of Spanish, and non-native (NNS) speakers), and include both female and male instructors. By recording, transcribing, and coding the speech samples from four class periods per language instructor (which accounted for more than 2700 minutes of instructor speech), this study looked at how much TL (Spanish), and how much English, instructors use in the classroom, the contexts in which they use English, the types of input modifications they make, as well as the frequency of verb types (person, number, tense, and mood). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Analyses of the classroom input data revealed that all instructors but one used the TL between 78-95% of the class time. Based on previous literature, it is suggested that instructors in this study were much more homogeneous in their TL language use, and used it an appropriate amount of time. Results also indicated that NS produced a higher number of TL words than NNS. However, NNS produced a higher percentage of TL input of their total percentage per class. Results also showed that female instructors produced a higher percentage of speech. Regarding the use of English, the speech samples showed that there was a high amount of code switching in the language classrooms. The contexts of English use followed the trends from previous literature. English was predominantly used to explain tasks, and to explain grammar, and to move faster in the curriculum and save time. However, by analyzing the samples, it was proven that the use of English for this matter was contra productive. Every time that the language was switched to English there were extra explanations that might have not even been needed. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Results also showed that NS instructors used English to bond/empathy with students, significantly more than NNS instructors. The higher amount of English use was found for Spanish Elementary II. Results support the idea that topic familiarity leads to more comprehension in the L2, because the concepts in Spanish Elementary II were more abstract, unlike the grammar presented in Spanish I. Regarding the modifications of the input, results showed that instructors at all levels modify their input; however, instructors at beginning levels simplify their input more, by slowing their rate, simplifying their syntax and producing high frequency vocabulary words. All instructors but one made use of technology to enhance their input. Results suggest that media is becoming a fundamental tool in the language classroom, and without multimedia or visual supplements instructors might not be taking advantage of the potential contribution of the learners’ capacity to process that material in the visual mode as well. Results also showed that the frequency of the verbs in the classroom is different from what has been shown in previous research and in language corpora, suggesting that the context in which communication occurs determines the type of input that is given. By conducting a survey among the instructors’ participants about their perspectives of language use in the classroom, it was shown that instructors have a wider perspective of the amount of input they provide in the class and the modifications they do, suggesting the importance of having serial classroom observations periodically.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Ultimately, the results from this research will inform practitioners and materials developers as to the kinds of input learners need outside of class in order to complement what they receive in class. Second, I propose to use the data compiled in this project to create the first classroom based input corpus (database) for Spanish and made it available to researchers in second language acquisition.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this review was to identify and describe assessments used in music therapy and music medicine used with children and adolescents with mental health symptoms. After database searches were completed and studies screened for inclusion a total of 28 studies were included in this review. Of the studies meeting inclusion 6 examined the use of  assessments used to assess mental health symptoms exhibited by children in music therapy treatment. In addition, there were 12 studies that addressed assessments used with both children and adolescents, and 7 that assessed only adolescents. Music medicine studies meeting criteria for inclusion in the review were 3 in total. Some commonalities in the assessment design employed within specific population groups were found. In addition, commonalities were found within the types of assessment used within each population group, and in some cases, across different population groupings. While findings from this review indicate some commonalities one should be hesitant in making the decision to use them in clinical practice due to the small number of participants included in most of the studies. Further research or researchers may want to further limit the scope of review in order to focus primarily one diagnosis or set of symptoms. In addition, they may want to look at the use of one specific type of assessment used within mental health settings.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The crystallization and melting behaviors of model long chain branched ethylene 1-butene random copolymers (LCB PE) have been studied via differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and the spherulitic morphology was analyzed by polarized optical microscopy (POM). Special emphasis is placed to the analysis of crystallization memory of melts of these materials at temperatures above the equilibrium melting point. Two sets of LCB PEs have been studied. The first comprises LCBs with increasing complexity while the content of short ethyl branches remains constant. Included in this set are linear short branched, 3-arm star, H, super H, pompom and comb types. The linear, 3-arm star and H LCBs display the shift of the crystallization temperature to higher values, consistent with the melt memory observed in other short-branched random copolymers. Seeds remain in the melt due to slow diffusion of the ethylene sequences that formed the initial crystallites. Lack of observable shift in the more complex LCB samples, and slightly higher crystallization temperatures are attributed to even more restrict melt diffusion due to their highly viscous melt as indicated by rheological measurements. The same effect is observed in a second series of 3-arm star samples with increasing arm length. Only the samples with relatively low melt viscosity display the shift to higher crystallization temperatures. Self-nucleation in the more viscous LCB materials remains strong even above 250°C.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>To determine if the distinct deuterium (D) and oxygen-18 (18O) signature of precipitation from a tropical storm or hurricane could be used as a natural tracer in a springshed, isotope analyses of water samples from Wakulla Spring in north Florida were done over the course of two Atlantic hurricane seasons. Water samples were collected between Feb. 10, 2012 and Aug. 27, 2012 and between March 19 and Oct. 21, 2013. Additionally, water samples and water quality data from a total of 20 springs in north and central Florida were collected between Jan. 14 and Feb. 18, 2012 during a period of prolonged drought; the springs were sampled again between Sept. 20 and Nov. 9, 2012 after rains in the summer and fall increased groundwater levels. The δD and δ18O values of the samples from the 21 springs, including Wakulla Spring, showed that the springs during non-baseflow conditions have much more variability in isotope composition than they had have during baseflow conditions. Comparison between the two sets of samples provided a range in isotope values for springs fed by the Upper Floridan aquifer. The 2012 hurricane season had one major storm, Tropical Storm Debby from June 23 to 27, which brought over 500 mm (20 in) of rain to the Wakulla Springs study area.  A clear signal of the tropical storm was observed in the Wakulla Spring water samples as isotopically light rain recharged the aquifer and emerged at the spring. A minimum in δD (of -30‰)and δ18O (of -5.1‰)on July 4 to 5 indicated a mean transit time of nine days from the heavy rainfall that occurred on June 25 and 26.  The average isotope values during baseflow prior to the storm were -17‰ δD and -3.3‰ for δ18O.  The transit time was similar to travel times found by dye trace studies of the sinking streams in the springshed.  The exact isotope composition for Tropical Storm Debby was not known, so there was not enough data to apply isotope-based hydrograph separation to the streamflow record for Wakulla River. The maximum measured streamflow was documented at 2,600 cfs by an acoustic Doppler current profiler measurement on June 26, 2012. During the 2013 hurricane season, rainfall was recorded and collected for isotope analysis. No major storms reached the study area during the 2013 Atlantic hurricane season except for a weakened Tropical Storm Andrea which brought a small amount of rain on June 6 (2.27 in, 58 mm). The precipitation had very negative isotope values (δD = -109‰ and δ18O = -14.7‰).  A minimum δ18O value of -4.1‰ was seen in Wakulla Spring samples 29 and 33 days later but it was not clear if these values could be attributed to the very small amount of isotopically light precipitation since precipitation samples from a few other intense summer storms during the month had values slightly more negative than -4.1‰.  The use of tropical storm precipitation was shown to be an effective and simple method for studying the hydrology of a springshed with the potential for very light isotope composition of rainfall distributed over a large land area and a very distinct signal in springflow. The drawbacks are that the opportunities to apply the method are limited by the unpredictable occurrence of tropical storms and hurricanes and that a two-component mixing model for hydrograph separation may not provide enough information for watersheds with complex hydrology. The use of tropical storm or hurricane precipitation as a natural tracer in a springshed would work well in ongoing studies of springs, where the information it provides could be added to geochemical tracer data and isotope data for other components of aquifer storage.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>News stories about food safety at restaurants in Florida typically employ illustrative exemplars (examples) that describe violations discovered by state regulators. Previous research indicates that vivid exemplars can alter the public’s perceived health risks. This study further explored whether or not exemplars, when presented through a reporter’s personal testimony, affect participants’ perceptions or behaviors. Through an experiment, participants (N = 286) were randomly exposed to one of two conditions: (a) a news story featuring exemplars without personal testimony and (b) a news story featuring exemplars with personal testimony from a reporter. Participants were asked to rate perceived risks and likely behavior. Data showed significant differences between conditions and participants were clearly impacted by the exemplars presented, rating the perceived risks as high and noting a likely change in their behavior. Results are discussed in terms of practical implications for reporters, state regulators, public relations professionals and restaurateurs.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Found throughout nature, science, industry, and medicine, conjugated dienes and trienes are ubiquitous. While their behavior changes upon substitution, they are all built from the same fundamental units of either 1,3-butadiene or the 1,3,5-hexatrienes. These basic units undergo fascinatingly complex photochemistry, which is mimicked or changed upon substitution. Developing a proper understanding the photochemistry of these fundamental units, and the reasons for divergence from their basic behavior upon substitution, enables their use in optical applications and provides evidence which can be used to advance modern molecular quantum mechanics.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The compounds studied are the 1,4-diphenyl-1,3-butadienes, the isomers of Vitamin D3, and the 1,3,5-hexatrienes. These compounds undergo reaction upon excitation with ultraviolet light that causes bond breakage, reordering, and reorganization. The primary process studied herein is the cis-trans photoisomerization of double bonds. This process is described primarily through the application of the one bond twist, hula-twist, and bicycle pedal photoisomerization mechanisms. Significant debate focused on finding a unifying explanation to excited state cis-trans photoisomerization currently surrounds these mechanisms. The reader is encouraged to access the abstract of the electronic dissertation to view the movies modeled for these cis-trans photoisomerizations, which are described later on page 63 of the dissertation.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation is split between three parts. First, the photoisomerization of the 1,4-diphenyl-1,3-butadienes was studied in ethanol to search for evidence of conical intersections, which are considered equivalent to transition states in photochemical reactions. Second, since the validity of the hula-twist mechanism has been questioned on many occasions in the literature, the prima facie evidence used for its justification, the photoisomerizations of Previtamin D3 in volume confining media, were reinvestigated using more powerful methods. To conclude this work, the photoisomerizations of the 1,3,5-hexatrienes were reexamined, as no experimental evidence currently accounts for the majority of their photochemical decay.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Surprisingly, results provided prior to this work account for less than 10% of the hexatrienes excited state decay. Extracting the information contained in this dissertation required the development and application of unique and sophisticated spectral decomposition techniques for UV-Vis, fluorescence, fluorescence excitation, and 1H-NMR spectroscopies.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The results of this work suggest that conical intersections exist close to the twisted excited singlet geometries of the 1,4-diphenyl-1,3-butadienes, show that the original experimental evidence for the hula-twist mechanism was based upon a misinterpretation of the photoisomerizations of Previtamin D3, and reveal that cis-trans photoisomerization accounts for nearly all of the excited state decay of the 1,3,5-hexatrienes in solution.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The impact of the first study reconciles previous reports for the photoaddition of alcohol to the 1,4-diphenyl-1,3-butadienes under a general path of addition to a short lived phantom intermediate. This mechanism is likely general and extends to similar molecules which undergo photoaddition of alcohol in the singlet state. It additionally confirms that the twisted singlet intermediate of the 1,4-diphenyl-1,3-butadienes is zwitterionic in nature, and that the bicycle pedal photoisomerization mechanism occurs in a step-wise and not concerted manner, in certain circumstances. The second study raises concern regarding the validity of the conclusions from numerous studies which reported hula-twist products, and perhaps should be reconsidered as photoisomerizations from one bond twist or bicycle pedal precursors. The concluding study signifies need for renewed interest in the photochemistry of the 1,3,5-hexatrienes by theory. The latest theoretical studies on the matter are not in harmony with the recently obtained experimental evidence.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation presents contributions to several problems relevant to cyber physical system (CPS) vulnerability research.  Cyber physical systems encompass any computational systems that interact with physical processes, encompassing critical infrastructure networks, industrial control system networks, SCADA networks, and more.  Vulnerability research encompasses three main areas of cybersecurity: finding new vulnerabilities, exploit development, and exploit mitigation.  This work primarily focuses on exploit mitigation, and ethically utilizes the other factors for conclusive validation of the research contributions.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Contributions in this work span problems in, but not limited to dynamic trust management; vulnerability research education; CPS situational awareness and threat intelligence; CPS physics impact analysis; embedded CPS malware analysis; and finally embedded CPS forensics.  Notable contributions include the acclaimed Offensive Computer Security open courseware, the introduction of physics-based-intrusion-detection for cyber physical systems, novel threat intelligence and situational awareness framework for CPS, and novel embedded CPS virtualization and simulated physics integration methodology for dynamic analysis and physics analysis for embedded CPS.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The contribution results have been peer reviewed and published, and the list of publications generated during the doctorate research is listed in the Biographical Sketch.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>All of these areas and contributions are critically relevant to critical infrastructure and industrial control systems.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Underwater vehicles suffer from reduced maneuverability with conventional lifting append-\ ages due to the low velocity of operation. Circulation control offers a method to increase maneuverability independent of vehicle speed. However, with circulation control comes additional noise sources, which are not well understood. To better understand these noise sources, a modal-based prediction method is developed, potentially offering a quantitative connection between flow structures and far-field noise. This method involves estimation of the velocity field, surface pressure field, and far-field noise, using only non-time-resolved velocity fields and time-resolved probe measurements. Proper orthogonal decomposition, linear stochastic estimation and Kalman smoothing are employed to estimate time-resolved velocity fields. Poisson's equation is used to calculate time-resolved pressure fields from velocity. Curle's analogy is then used to propagate the surface pressure forces to the far field.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This method is developed on a direct numerical simulation of a two-dimensional cylinder at a low Reynolds number (150). Since each of the fields to be estimated are also known from the simulation, a means of obtaining the error from using the methodology is provided. The velocity estimation and the simulated velocity match well when the simulated additive measurement noise is low. The pressure field suffers due to a small domain size; however, the surface pressures estimates fare much better. The far-field estimation contains similar frequency content with reduced magnitudes, attributed to the exclusion of the viscous forces in Curle's analogy. In the absence of added noise, the estimation procedure performs quite nicely for this model problem. The method is tested experimentally on a 650,000 chord-Reynolds-number flow over a 2-D, 20\% thick, elliptic circulation control airfoil. Slot jet momentum coefficients of 0 and 0.10 are investigated. Particle image velocimetry, unsteady pressure and phased-acoustic-array data are acquired simultaneously in an aeroacoustic wind-tunnel facility. The velocity field estimation suffers due to poor correlation with the unsteady pressure data, especially in the 0.10 momentum coefficient case. The prediction without slot jet blowing matches single microphone measurements within 0-10 dB over the frequency range of interest while the prediction with the jet active is quite poor and differ from measurements by as much as 35 dB. Suggestions for improvement of the proposed method are offered.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Data from the acoustic array are then investigated. Single microphone spectra are obtained, and it is shown that background noise is significant. In order to circumvent this problem, beamforming is employed. The primary sources of background noise are from the tunnel collector and jet/sidewall interaction. DAMAS is employed to remove the effects of the array point spread function. Spectra are acquired by integrating the DAMAS result over the source region. The resulting DAMAS spectral levels are significantly below single microphone levels. A scaling analysis is performed on the processed array data. With a constant free-stream velocity and a varying jet velocity the data scale as $M^6$. If momentum coefficient is held constant and free-stream velocity is varied the data scale as $M^7$.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Research suggests that women gossip more often than men. We, along with previous researchers, argue that this exchange of information may be a means by which women compete for mates. That is, women use social information to besmirch the reputations and long-term mating potential of rivals. Because men value chastity in their long-term partners and this trait is invisible, women’s sexual reputations may not only influence their long-term mate value, but may also be vulnerable to defamation. Furthermore, Hess and Hagen (2009) have argued that women may use their same-sex friendships to help them in this reputational competition. If women compete with one another using social information, their psychologies and friendship patterns should be shaped for this informational battle at three stages: defense, reconnaissance, and dissemination. Across four online studies we tested predictions stemming from this informational warfare framework. In Studies 1 and 2, we evaluated whether women’s interests, worries, and friendship expectations are better suited than men’s for reputational competition. In Studies 3 and 4, we experimentally manipulated the mating threat level of a target woman and found that women relayed reputationally relevant information about her strategically. Specifically, women passed on more negative and less positive social information about a hypothetical a woman who flirted with their mates (compared to one who did not) and an attractive woman (compared to a less attractive woman). That is, women hurt more than helped the reputations of other women who were more formidable mating competitors compared to less.  Furthermore, highly competitive women were more informationally aggressive than less competitive women. These findings support the contention that women compete with one another using social information and reputational attacks.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The transition from high school to college represents a major source of distress as students experience the challenges of academic demands, changing relationships, and scheduling responsibilities. The impact of these stressors may affect a student’s academic achievement, self-esteem, physical health, and mental health, with suicide believed to be a second leading cause of death among this population. The Interpersonal-Psychological Theory of Suicidality indicates the importance of social connection in reducing the occurrence of suicidal desires and behaviors, stating that experiences of thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness are causally related to suicide risk. Resident Assistants (RAs) function as a persistent social connection in the lives of student residents. As research supports, RAs often act as gatekeepers to residents, and have recently been used in this role to support suicide prevention on college campuses. This study analyzes the intervention behaviors of RAs during the semester following the training. Using a university-wide, de-identified data set of 81 campus RAs, this project seeks to determine how an RA's perceived competency and knowledge following a suicide prevention training predicts the number of residents believed by an RA to have had thoughts of suicide, RA intervention, and the frequency by which RAs wished they had offered support in the subsequent semester. Results of this study found no significant relationship between perceived competence and knowledge post-training and intervention behaviors post-semester. Despite a lack of a significant relationship between variables, results are valuable in demonstrating the need to improve RA suicide prevention training program quality and frequency, and to consider other potential mediating variables which might explain intervention behaviors.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Previous research revealed mixed findings regarding the direction of the relation of inhibition and creativity.  The goal of this study was to determine if the task used to measure inhibition accounts for this variance in direction and if these various tasks would demonstrate convergent validity, despite contention that inhibition cannot be deconstructed into separate types.  It was hypothesized that attention inhibition measures would correlate negatively to creativity, whereas memory inhibition measures would correlate positively.   Confirmatory factor analyses showed that the inhibition measures did not demonstrate convergent validity based on the proposed two factor model of attention and memory inhibition.  Also, most of the inhibition tasks were unrelated to creativity and intelligence, though the n-back task, a memory inhibition measure, positively predicted scores on the Remote Associates Test, a convergent thinking creativity test (r(59) = .39, p = 0.002).</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Energy efficiency is an important design consideration in nearly all classes of processors, but is of particular importance to mobile and embedded systems. The data cache accounts for a significant portion of processor power. We have previously presented an approach to reducing cache energy by introducing an explicity controlled tagless access buffer (TAB) at the top of the cache hierarchy. The TAB reduces energy usage by redirecting loop memory references from the level-one data cache (L1D) to the smaller, more energy-efficient TAB. These references need not access the data translation lookaside buffer (DTLB), and can sometimes avoid unnecessary transfers from lower levels of the memory hierarchy. We improve upon our previous design to create a system that requires fewer instruction set changes and gives more explicit control over the allocation and deallocation of TAB resources. We show that with a cache line size of 32 bytes, a four-line TAB can eliminate on average 31% of L1D accesses, which reduces L1D/DTLB energy usage by 19%.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This thesis is a study of the functions of music and dance in Zumba classes held at the Forest Meadows Park community center in Tallahassee, Florida. It examines how music and dance are the generative mechanisms of communitas in this cultural space. Within the context of that exploration, this study analyzes the larger social and economic forces that surround these classes as a result of the mass-mediated Zumba phenomenon. As a multimillion dollar corporation, Zumba benefits by promoting the embodiment and creative appropriation of exotic cultures. Zumba’s musics are used to create a generic image of primarily Latin peoples that idealizes them as sensualized beings, and this idea contributes to the exoticism of generic styles such as “Latin music.” </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>While engaging with this idea, I argue that this commodified Zumba experience is not an exploitative mechanism. Zumba does not intend to misrepresent various world cultures for its own gain, and that is not the experience of the Zumba practitioners at Forest Meadows. Rather, this creative appropriation is an empowering mechanism that is attained, in part, through mimetic representation wherein the copy—the Zumba culture—can gain the power of the original. In gaining this representative power, Zumba becomes an opportunity for participants to engage with a fabricated notion of “Latinness” that ultimately leads to feelings of empowerment, self-confidence, and equality. Those sentiments, which blossom from Zumba’s exotic element and schizophonic mimetic representation, support the development of communitas. At the most basic level, music and dance are the generative mechanisms of that communitas experience; therefore, this study analyzes how these music and dance styles facilitate this experience.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Climate models currently struggle with the more traditional, coarse ( O(100 km) ) representation of the ocean. In these coarse ocean simulations, western boundary currents are notoriously difficult to model accurately. The modeled Gulf Stream is typically seen exhibiting a mean pathway that is north of observations, and is linked to a warm sea-surface temperature bias in the Mid-Atlantic Bight. Although increased resolution ( O(10 km) ) improves the modeled Gulf Stream position, there is no clean recipe for obtaining the proper pathway. The 70 year history of literature on the Gulf Stream separation suggests that we have not reached a resolution on the dynamics that control the current's pathway just south of the Mid-Atlantic Bight. Without a concrete knowledge on the separation dynamics, we cannot provide a clean recipe for accurately modeling the Gulf Stream at increased resolutions. Further, any reliable parameterization that yields a realistic Gulf Stream path must express the proper physics of separation. The goal of this dissertation is to determine what controls the Gulf Stream separation. To do so, we examine the results of a model intercomparison study and a set of numerical regional terraforming experiments. It is argued that the separation is governed by local dynamics that are most sensitive to the steepening of the continental shelf, consistent with the topographic wave arrest hypothesis of Stern (1998). A linear extension of Stern's theory is provided, which illustrates that wave arrest is possible for a continuously stratified fluid.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Evaluating the performance of models predicting a binary outcome can be done using a variety of measures. While some measures intend to describe the model's overall fit, others more accurately describe the model's ability to discriminate between the two outcomes. If a model fits well but doesn't discriminate well, what does that tell us?  Given two models, if one discriminates well but has poor fit while the other fits well but discriminates poorly, which of the two should we choose? The measures of interest for our research include the area under the ROC curve, Brier Score, discrimination slope, Log-Loss, R-squared and F-score. To examine the underlying relationships among all of the measures, real data and simulation studies are used.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The real data comes from multiple cardiovascular research studies and the simulation studies are run under general conditions and also for incidence rates ranging from 2% to 50%. The results of these analyses provide insight into the relationships among the measures and raise concern for scenarios when the measures may yield different conclusions. The impact of incidence rate on the relationships provides a basis for exploring alternative maximization routines to logistic regression.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>While most of the measures are easily optimized using the Newton-Raphson algorithm, the maximization of the area under the ROC curve requires optimization of a non-linear, non-differentiable function. Usage of the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm and close connections to economics research yield unique parameter estimates and general asymptotic conditions. Using real and simulated data to compare optimizing the area under the ROC curve to logistic regression further reveals the impact of incidence rate on the relationships, significant increases in achievable areas under the ROC curve, and differences in conclusions about including a variable in a model.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The story follows James Offenbach, a 25-year-old nomadic runner, who has spent seven years as a transient, stealing whatever food and supplies he needs to allow him to continue his self-inflicted isolation. He breaks this isolation when he meets Hieronymus Loom, an inventor, physicist, and shop owner, who sells, among other inventions, boxes of “pure space.” After Loom takes a suspicious interest in James, the runner finds himself living in Loom’s building—a place where rooms change size and shape, cats can be in two places simultaneously, and, somewhere, there exists a machine that splits spacetime into units of pure space and pure time. While James tries to find out the secrets behind Loom’s work, Loom’s reasons for keeping James around slowly reveal themselves.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study examined the effect of message framing to promote sleep behaviors. Participants (N = 156) were randomly assigned to read either a gain- or loss-framed message.  The gain-framed message focused on the benefits of sufficient sleep duration and good sleep quality, and the loss-framed message focused on the costs of insufficient sleep duration and poor sleep quality. Participants’ motivational orientation (the extent to which they seek out positive outcomes or avoid negative outcomes) and sleep behavior were assessed at baseline.  Potential mediational measures were assessed including time participants spent reading the message, recall of message content, and the extent to which participants elaborated on the message.  Before participants left the lab, they reported their sleep-related intentions for the following week.  One week later, participants reported their sleep duration, sleep quality, and sleep hygiene behaviors.  Contrary to my hypothesis, a gain-framed message did not promote sleep intentions, sleep duration, sleep quality, or sleep hygiene behaviors better than a loss-framed message.  Further, inconsistent with my prediction, motivational orientation did not moderate message framing effects on sleep behaviors.  Because there was no effect of message framing or the interaction of motivational orientation and message framing on sleep behaviors, mediational effects were not examined.  The results of the present study suggest that a gain-framed message was not more effective at promoting sleep behaviors than a loss-framed message.  Perhaps, sleep is too complex of a behavior for such a subtle manipulation as message framing.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, early intervention services are offered to children and their families from birth to three years of age. Likewise early childhood special education services are offered from three to five years of age. Research demonstrates that among the intervention frameworks available, applied behavior analysis has the largest evidence base, solidifying its status as the best practice for early intervention and early childhood service. This paper endeavors to provide comparative information to evaluate the effectiveness and validity of other intervention practices based on developmental and relationship-based theory such as the Montessori Method and DIR®/Floortime™. In addition, the use of music therapy within early intervention and these specific intervention frameworks will also be discussed.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Vegetation is a fundamental component in urban ecosystems which provide human beings with various ecosystem services. Land changes due to rapid urbanization worldwide cause an unbalanced distribution of various vegetation types, which is difficult to map and characterize. Although many efforts have been made to examine the potential drivers of land changes, the specific processes leading to the spatial heterogeneity of vegetation patterns have not been fully understood. The overall objective of this research is to identify a remote sensing and GIS-based approach to help improve vegetation mapping in a complex urban area and to examine the factors shaping the observed vegetation patterns in the Atlanta metropolitan area as a case study site. The dissertation has gone through several major components. First, the algorithmic parameters affecting image classification accuracy by random forests are evaluated using both the classifier’s accuracy and the map accuracy. Second, the performance of random forests for classifying complex landscape types relative to several popular classifiers including Gaussian maximum likelihood, support vector machines, and artificial neural networks is evaluated. Third, a multiple classifier system is further developed to derive a land cover map emphasizing various vegetation types for the study site. Last, the spatial patterns of various vegetation types are quantified using landscape metrics, and the factors shaping the observed vegetation patterns are explained from the biophysical, socioeconomic, and geographical perspectives at multiple observational levels using GIS and statistical analysis. Overall, this study has contributed to a better understanding of human and natural interactions in a complex urban environment through the combined use of remote sensing, GIS-based spatial analysis, and landscape metrics.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The recent two decades have witnessed a developing historical debate between China and Japan. Standing in the center of this debate are different historical interpretations presented in textbooks. Both China and Japan seem to blame each other for promoting supposedly politically-biased historical education. This has become a growing problem causing wide concerns even internationally: on the one hand, there is an increasing debate about the supposed existence of "Anti-Japanese" education in China since the last decade of 20th century; on the other, many scholars from China, Japan and the Western world also criticize what they see as a distorted (or omitted) history of the war presented in Japanese textbooks. According to the "framing" theories introduced by scholars such as Foucault, Giltin, Gamson, and Modigliani in the late 20th century, history textbooks, just like media, could "organize the world" both for authors who wrote them and students who rely on them. There are many skills in framing history in textbooks and one of them is the skill of "pointing at one [to] abuse another." Using a specific technique to analyze the interplays between changing politics and educational narratives surrounding World War II (which began in China in 1937) in Chinese and Japanese middle school textbooks during a certain period: 1950-1990, the paper aims to discover the history of changing narratives about World War II in both Chinese and Japanese middle school history textbooks and how they interacted with politics over time.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to better understand how local veterans use music in their daily lives and attempt to comprehend their interests in music therapy services.  Data was analyzed for 45 participants, 36 non-student veterans and 9 student veterans.  The participant age range was 27-78 and the mean age of all the participants was 56.8.  Results determined that all of the participants encountered music in their daily lives and the mean level of enjoyment in music was 8.91.  Sixty-five percent of the participants had used music to help any positive or negative experiences related to his/her military service.  The most commonly used CAM therapies were the following: massage therapy, meditation, chiropractic and osteopathic medicine, and nutrition/diet.   Most of the participants had low levels of knowledge about board certified music therapy services, but reported the highest level of interest in learning about or trying a music therapy session to increase relaxation (6.89), compared to coping skills (5.82) and socialization (5.80).  Non-student veterans had the highest level of interest in learning about or trying a music therapy session to increase relaxation (7.09) and student veterans had the highest level of interests in learning about or trying a music therapy session to increase relaxation (6.11) and coping skills (6.11).  Finally, participants were more likely to participate in music therapy sessions if they were organized at their local veteran groups or organizations (5.96) compared to creative arts or recreation therapy sessions, including music therapy, at their local VA facilities (4.96).</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Corporate cash holdings have a significantly positive impact on executive compensation, </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>distinct from the well-documented relation between performance and compensation. An increase of cash holdings by 10% of assets corresponds to about $2.7 million additional CEO total compensation. This relation is driven primarily by discretionary compensation components such as bonus and option-based compensation. In companies with weaker governance, the relation between cash holdings and executive compensation is even stronger. Using awards and losses associated with corporate litigation as exogenous shocks to the firms’ cash, I show that CEO compensation readily responds to these changes in cash holdings. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Prior studies postulate that the optimal level of firms’ cash holding is dynamic and, </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>thereby, managers should actively adjust cash holdings. I find that the more volatile a firm’s cash holdings, the higher its firm value. The correlation is more pronounced in smaller firms, younger firms, and firms in high tech industries. The findings are robust when controlling for the level of cash holdings and cash flow volatility, among other factors. The positive connection between cash holdings volatility and firm value is consistent with the need for active management of cash. Specialized managers who actively adjust the amount of cash holdings help enhance the firm value more than generalist managers, consistent with the idea that specialized management has a </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>better understanding of the firm’s cash needs.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Crimean War (1854-1856) followed quickly by the Indian Revolt (1857-1858) caused many civilians to become interested in the affairs of the army and the lives of soldiers. The increased visibility of the army created numerous calls for reform. Civilian moral reformers and government officials embarked on a project to create a more ‘respectable’ army. This project was not teleological, nor was it voiced in a unified or always consistent manner. Furthermore, movements for moral reform consistently faced the realities of the financial constraints of the mid-Victorian Liberal State. The project was gendered, and it involved competing discourses of masculinity. This dissertation offers a thick description of key debates involving corporal punishment, soldiers’ sexuality, the desirability/inability of soldiers to marry, and programs to assist their wives and children. It argues that one cannot understand the Victorian Army without considering what occurred in civilian society. These two worlds intersected and intertwined in numerous ways throughout the mid-nineteenth century.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Health condition monitoring and failure detection play a crucial role in estimating the performance of solar panels such as degradation trend over time and occurrence of failures. Monitoring and detecting significant degradation can help solar panel owners establish as-needed maintenance strategies on a timely manner.  But in some occasions, degradation trend estimation becomes challenging due to limited availability of training data such as many missing observations in time series over a large time span and a lack of history of failure records that are sufficient to establish statistical models. To fill the gap, this thesis proposes a new approach of iterative multi-task learning of Gaussian process in time series data (MTL-GP-TS) by sharing information among similar-but-not-identical datasets from multiple solar panel locations. The proposed MTL-GP-TS model learns unobserved or missing values in a particular time series dataset to forecast the future trend with autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, resulting in substantial improvement of forecast over conventional time series modeling approaches. Moreover, the estimated degradation trend with proposed MTL-GP-TS method has the potential to improve the monitoring of significant performance degradation compared with the conventional time series model. This thesis also studies the effect of  temporal dependent weather factors on the solar panel performance by integrating a covariate with the MTL-GP-TS algorithm. A case study has demonstrated that inclusion of weather factors into the monitoring of degradation with PV-Weather data integration model can significantly improve the solar panel performance prediction.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The purpose of this project was to create an original composition for high school level band, to create a set of teaching materials specific to the composition, and to provide an analytical method for the creation of literature-specific teaching materials others can use to develop similar projects for the band repertoire. The center of the project is the composition True Love of Mine—A Fantasy on Scarborough Fair for Symphonic Band.  A rationale regarding choice of literature, a connection between the warm-up process and music rehearsal, and a creative design for concept teaching is discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can be defined as group of complex disorders of brain development that includes difficulties with social interaction, verbal and nonverbal communication, and repetitive behaviors (Autism Speaks, n.d.).  It is estimated that roughly one in every 68 children has been identified as being on the autism spectrum (Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014).  This number has increased since the first epidemiologic research was conducted in the late 1960s, in which only one in every 2500 children were identified, and researchers suppose this increase is due to better awareness and recognition in diagnostic practices (Blumberg et al., 2013; Schieve et al., 2011).  The greater number of children identified with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has led to more services available to help, including music therapy. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>         As ASD has developed clearer definitions and information, music therapists have begun to expand their interventional approach (Reschke-Hernández, 2011).  However, to date, no study has examined what types of interventions are being used.  Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the types of professional collaborations, use of non-musical technology, and music therapy interventions that are incorporated by music therapists when working with children in the ASD population.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>         Participants (N= 582) for this study were board-certified music therapists in the United States that were contacted through The Certification Board for Music Therapists (CBMT) organization and held at least a Bachelor’s degree in music therapy. After giving consent, each participant completed a survey created by the researcher.  This survey contained single answer, multiple choice answer, and fill-in-the-blank questions. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Data was analyzed to create sums, percentages, and means for each research question. The data revealed that of the music therapists who participated in this study, they indicated always collaborating with other professionals and therapists when working a client with ASD.  Furthermore, this collaboration happened regardless of environment or length of time working in a particular environment, and sometimes happened multiple times a week.  Data also found that music therapists altered their therapy approach to some capacity while collaborating with other professionals. Finally, participants relied heavily upon non-musical equipment as a supplement, especially technology, and used it regularly during therapy sessions.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The southeastern Blue Ridge hosts a suite of metamorphic rock units that provide insight to the Neoproterozoic to Paleozoic tectonic influences that impacted the Laurentian continent.  The Ashland-Wedowee-Emuckfaw belt of the southernmost Appalachians is a suite of metamorphic rocks that have recorded Neoproterozoic through Paleozoic tectonic history of the Appalachian orogen.  The the rocks are of the Ashland-Wedowee-Emuckfaw belt are products of deep ocean and continental slope/rise sedimentary environments in addition to suites of plutonic rocks that were deposited along the Iapetus margin of the Laurentian continent during the Cambrian through the Mississippian.  Situated in east central Alabama and west central Georgia, the metasedimentary units of the Ashland-Wedowee-Emuckfaw belt, the Wedowee Group and the Emuckfaw Group of the southeastern Blue Ridge, have been studied in reconnaissance for the past four and half decades with no clear understanding of the unit contacts and structural features.  In the past the contact between the Wedowee Group and the Emuckfaw Group has been mapped as a fault contact along the length of its trace.  The structures along the contact boundary are not well defined, and the analysis and interpretations of previous workers are incomplete.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A detailed geologic map study of the Graham 7.5 min. Quadrangle and the surrounding quadrangles, located in the Northern Piedmont of Alabama and Georgia, was conducted with the support and under the guidelines of the Educational Mapping Cooperative agreement (EdMap) between the United State Geological Survey and Florida State University to establish the contact relationship and the structural relationships between the Wedowee and the Emuckfaw Groups along with field sample geochemistry and thin section petrography.  The new data from this research was integrated with data of previous research and used to determine the regional development of the Wedowee and Emuckfaw contact and the structural relationship of these units along their contact boundary.  In the mapped research area there is evidence of polydeformation and regional metamorphism.  The general structures that dominate the mapping area are antiformal and synformal regional folds that are isoclinal and digitated along the contact boundary between the Wedowee and the Emuckfaw groups.  The geochemical data of field sample shows that the rocks from the Wedowee amphibolite units and the Emuckfaw amphibolite units were formed in a common tectonic setting related to an extensional environment outbound of the Laurentian continental hinge zone above the subducting Iapetus Ocean lithosphere.  Geochronological studies by previous workers bracketed the relative ages of these units, as well as providing the framework for the tectonic history of both the Wedowee and Emuckfaw Groups. Potassium/argon dating of metapelites and unranium/lead dating of zircons from metapelite and metavolcanic units brackets the ages for the Wedowee and Emuckfaw in an early to middle Ordovician extensional environment.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>During the age of non-avian dinosaurs, ancestors of present-day mammals were likely small insectivores, relegated to nocturnal and subterranean niches. This nocturnal “bottle-neck” is postulated as a driving force of numerous physiological and sensory adaptations including those of the visual system. The consequences of structural mutations of opsins upon spectral sensitivity and environmental adaptation have been studied in great detail, but lacking is knowledge of the potential influence of alterations in gene regulatory networks upon the diversity of cone subtypes and the variation in the ratio of rods and cones observed in diurnal and nocturnal species. Exploiting photoreceptor patterning in cone-dominated zebrafish, we uncovered two independent mechanisms by which the sine oculis homeobox homolog 7 (six7) regulates photoreceptor development. In a genetic screen, we isolated the lots-of-rods-junior (ljrp23ahub) mutation that resulted in an increased number and uniform distribution of rods in otherwise normal appearing larvae. Sequence analysis, genome editing using TALENs and knockdown strategies confirm ljrp23ahub as a hypomorphic allele of six7, a teleost orthologue of six3, with known roles in forebrain patterning and expression of opsins. Based on the lack of protein-coding changes and an identified deletion of a conserved sequence about 40 kb upstream of six7 loci, a cis-regulatory mutation is proposed as the basis of the reduced expression in ljrp23ahub. Comparison of the hypomorphic and knock-out alleles provides evidence of two independent roles in photoreceptor development. EdU and PH3 labeling show that the increase in rod number and uniform distribution is associated with extended mitosis of photoreceptor progenitors, and TUNEL suggest that the lack of green cones is the result of cell death of the cone precursor.  These data add six7 to the small but growing list of genes essential for specification and patterning of photoreceptors in non-mammalian vertebrates, and form the basis of a model that underscores the potential of alterations in transcriptional regulation as a mechanism underpinning photoreceptor variation across species.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In July 2013, the social media Facebook campaign, Save the Miami-Dade Public Libraries (SMDPL) sought to influence the Miami-Dade County Mayor and Board of County Commissioners to reverse proposed budget cuts and maintain existing library funding levels. In this study, I examined the SMDPL campaign by conducting a discourse analysis of Facebook discussions that included posts, comments and any artifacts referenced such as other websites, mainstream media, public official memoranda and public documents, among others. I examined the expressions of value and the policymaking process using Moore’s Creating Public Value Theory. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study found that Creating Public Value offered an examination of public institutions as subsets of public sector governance. The study found that discourse is an element of the public value created that resulted in expression of public value outcomes and operational capacity for communities.  However the study also found that public library advocates missed opportunities to demonstrate rather than assert, specific public library values. Information sharing using social network sites can be important sources of what a community values in their libraries and their public sector institutions. Future research could examine how these values influence the actions of public officials and the discourse can become a source of examining what all types of communities’ value in libraries.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>To better constrain the timing of panda’s dietary shift from omnivorous to bamboo-exclusive herbivores, this study analyzed stable isotopes of carbon and oxygen in tooth enamel samples from two pygmy pandas from Yanliang Cave (early Pleistocene), three baconi pandas from Gongjishan Cave (late middle Pleistocene to early late Pleistocene), and five giant pandas from Baxian Cave (late Pleistocene) in the Chongzuo Ecological Park of Guangxi Province in South China. In addition, the carbon and oxygen isotope compositions of enamel samples from other mammals associated with the pygmy panda at Yanliang Cave were also analyzed. The results show that the pygmy panda, Ailuropod microta, had the lowest enamel-δ13C values compared to other coexisting mammals at -19‰, suggesting that the pygmy panda had a pure C3 diet composed of plants growing in the understory of a closed-canopy forest. A pure C3 diet for the pygmy panda, if confirmed by more data, would be consistent with an already established dietary niche of bamboo (a C3 plant). Reconstructed δ13C values of diets for the Yanliang fauna range from -25.6 to -32.1‰, indicating that these early Pleistocene mammals ate predominantly C3 vegetation and lived in an environment dominated by C3 plants. This suggests that the area was comprised of wooded habitats ranging from closed canopy forests to woodlands. Significant intra-tooth δ13C variations observed in some grazing animals suggest that a small amount of C4 grasses may be present in patches of open areas in a predominantly forested landscape. The reconstructed δ18O values of meteoric water in the area during the early Pleistocene fall within the range of -7.6 to -7.8‰; lower than the present-day mean annual precipitation δ18O values in the region, suggesting a wetter climate or stronger monsoon season in the early Pleistocene than today. The baconi panda (Ailuropod baconi) and giant panda (Ailuropod melanoleuca), had less depleted δ13C values with an average of -16.7‰ and -17.2‰, respectively, compared to the early Pleistocene panda. Assuming they also consumed bamboo exclusively, this would suggest an ecologic shift to a more open woodland environment towards the end of the Pleistocene.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Research shows that quality teachers are the single most significant influence on the quality of education available to students. This recognition of the importance of quality teachers on quality education is reflected in goal 6 of the EFA: Quality Education. EFA proxies for quality, however, are dubious measures of the concept......What does the concept quality mean when applied to the work of teaching or to the business of education? How do we know quality when we see it? Is it the same from culture to culture or does it differ based on the educational aims of different societies?</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Despite EFA's emphasis on improving the quality of education, quality education remains elusive in many developing countries. Cambodia, for instance, has enjoyed considerable international assistance for more than four decades, yet the quality of Cambodian education remains low by both Cambodian and international standards. What might explain the failure of decades of assistance to improve education in Cambodia? This study argues that before this question can be answered and more effective steps taken in the development of Cambodian education we must have a clearer understanding of the conceptualization and operationalization of the concept "quality" in the constructs "quality teachers" and "quality education" in the Cambodian context to understand whether and how it differs from that implied in the theory and practice of Cambodia's international donors. Differences may help explain the difficulty encountered in improving the quality of education in Cambodia and point to more effective strategies to achieve this elusive goal.  To this end, this inquiry deployed a hybrid methodology called philosophical ethnography to discover the conceptions of quality held by Khmer teacher training instructors and administrators. This discovery is guided by the idea of dialogue expressed by Jürgen Habermas and implemented by Paolo Freire.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Findings indicate that there is a tension between traditional Khmer conceptions of quality and those emphasized in modern conceptions of quality education. Traditional Cambodian conceptions of quality reflect Buddhist social virtues including of ទាន (tian, generosity), មេត្តា (mey-ta, generosity), ករុណា (garunna, compassion), មូទិតា (mutita, empathetic joy), and ឧបេក្ខា (upeka, equanimity) to be a good person in a moral sense. This differs from modern conceptions of quality that emphasize equality, individual achievement, and economic drive for education to produce a person with the knowledge, skills, and abilities to do some job that supports the growth of the economic machine.   </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The results of this study suggest that the introduction of modern ideas of quality in education beginning with the French in the 19th century and continuing today through foreign aid donations have permeated the education sector in Cambodia influence how Cambodian teacher trainers perceive quality education with respect to how day to day operations of education should function and influence contemporary policy decisions. Despite the push to change reform Cambodian education, participants indicate that being a good person (in the Buddhist sense) is still how quality should be measured and should be the primary objective of Cambodian education.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Some saints have poverty. Others, the ill or indigent. Evelyn Ellenberger has herself.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This novel deals with themes of asceticism and sainthood as the main character, Evelyn, experiences mystic visions of St. Catherine of Siena and tries to prove to her family and to herself that she, too, is destined for sainthood. As a young girl, Evelyn Ellenberger experiences a freak accident with a neighbor’s bull. Though she miraculously survives the encounter, the incident leaves her permanently scarred and inspired. Throughout her adolescence Evelyn is isolated and ostracized for a mysterious illness, which her psychiatrist father diagnoses as a case of Anorexia Mirabilis, a miraculous lack of appetite most commonly seen among medieval saints. Initially, her father is her only supporter until he tries to exploit his daughter’s extreme asceticism for personal gain. Years later, Evelyn Ellenberger suspects that she is pregnant and risks her relationship with her husband to pursue her own veneration as the saint she believes she is destined to become. A semi-recovered and pregnant Evelyn returns to her childhood home just as Hurricane Sandy is about to hit. Convinced that her pregnancy is the second miracle needed for sainthood, Evelyn scours her father’s home and office determined to prove her case for canonization. Over the course of the novel, the characters discover that no one is as pure and holy as they claim to be. At the height of the storm, Evelyn realizes that saints aren’t extraordinary people but ordinary people who do extraordinary things and that all of us could be saints if you catch us in the right moment.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The purpose of this research was to expose the potential deficits that exist in the standard music therapy practice- specifically involving the “Iso Principle.” The study also serves to gauge the perceptual views of those who are not familiar with music therapy as they learn the theoretical constructs. A demographic questionnaire and series of statements regarding the Iso Principle were presented to 97 adults both before and after an educational presentation on the use of Iso Principle in Hospice settings. Each participant marked the degree to which they believed the statement to be true in his or her subjective experience on a scaled differential, which was then statistically evaluated. The results were indicated 93.75% of the completed survey responses had an increase in numerical score from pre-test to post-test with 100% of the total post-test responses on the positive side of the differential spectrum.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>We sometimes fail to notice objects and events in our environment because our attention is directed elsewhere—a phenomenon called inattentional blindness. Our attentional set—the features we prioritize in our environment—plays a large role in determining what we notice. For example, adopting an attentional set for green makes green objects more likely to capture attention. Although a large body of research has explored the types of attentional sets we may adopt, few have explored the time course of attentional sets. And, out of these, none have explored how experience with a no-longer useful attentional set can impact the activation of new attentional sets. In two experiments, I show that a minimal amount of experience with an attentional set can cause that set to remain active past the point when it is no longer useful: Noticing of an unexpected object was higher when its color matched the color of previous targets, but new distractors, than when its color matched the color of objects that were always distractors. Furthermore, noticing was equivalent between times when the unexpected object’s color matched the color of objects that were previous distractors, but new targets, and times when its color matched the color of objects that were always targets. Overall, this finding suggests that past experience with an attentional set can impact the time it takes to adopt a new attentional set.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC) is a potential candidate for power conversion in a Medium Voltage DC System (MVDC) based electric ship. One of the major advantages of  utilizing MMC in an MVDC environment is the capability of limiting DC side fault current and fast re-start process because re-energizing of the MMC cells is not necessary. The MMC cells have various configurations e.g. half-bridge, full-bridge. The full-bridge MMC is more suitable for the MVDC system and fault current handling. However, the modeling, control, coordination in a multi-MMC system, and fault handling of a full-bridge MMC based MVDC system is still not fully investigated and understood.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This thesis focused on the key issues of the full-bridge MMC controls and modeling in an MVDC environment and the fault current limiting using multiple MMCs. The fundamental characteristics of the MMC topology are also discussed. Followed by the single MMC control design, the MMC control scheme for the MVDC system is designed to adapt to the capability of having a fast and controllable DC voltage and current. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To decrease the complexity of the MMC circuit, two simple averaged models of MMC are proposed. To verify the accuracy of the averaged models, the simulation results are compared with the results from Controller Hardware in The Loop (CHIL). The results of the comparison show that the proposed two types of averaged models predict the steady state values with very a good accuracy. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>For studying the behavior of a multi-MMC based MVDC system under DC side fault scenarios, an MVDC test system is proposed in this work. For comparison purposes, the real-time system model and off-line model are developed respectively. The off-line MMC model uses the individual IGBT component from the MATLAB/Simulink/SimPowerSystem software package whereas the real-time model is built using the library provided by OPAL-RT. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The multi-cell circuit which has many nodes is simplified as a two-node voltage source and an equivalent resistance in series connection by applying the Th\'evenin equivalent. This thesis also discusses the challenges of determining the sampling time and how to group the MVDC system component models so that it is able to run in a multi-core real-time simulator.   </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Besides the modeling of the MVDC system components (e.g. the MMCs, the loads), a fault current limiting strategy is also proposed in this work. This thesis put forward an operation mode for the multi-MMC system in a way that only one MMC is allowed to run in voltage controlled mode and the other MMCs are required to run in power controlled mode. By employing this operation mode, the fault current can be limited in the case of a DC side fault scenario. And no operation mode switching is needed as this operation mode also works for normal operation. The proposed fault current limiting strategy also contains the sequence of the converter actions. Five simulation cases are designed to test the proposed fault handling strategy. The simulation results show that the peak fault current is related to the operation conditions e.g. the pre-fault load current carried by MMCs, and the MMC control has some effect on mitigating the peak fault current. The proposed fault current limiting strategy is able to limit the fault current to a certain level in an MVDC system made up of single MMC, two MMCs and four MMCs with different loads conditions.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The benefits of a smart grid system greatly depends on the efficient implementation of the power delivery system utilizing the data communication infrastructure. This makes it necessary to have a co-simulation platform to test the enabling technology. The Hardware in the loop testbed (HIL-TB) at the Center for Advanced Power Systems (CAPS) is a cyber-physical testbed that provides a real time co-simulation platform for testing the smart grid operations and control. Due to the inherent complexity involved in initializing and running the individual components of the HIL-TB, the testbed is typically inaccessible and is mostly used for demonstrating only a single test scenario. As the test setup involves manual intervention, the idea of repeatability is lost. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The aim of this thesis is to address the above raised concerns related to HIL-TB. The objective is to develop a methodology to perform comprehensive testing and analysis of distributed control algorithms that are developed for smart grid power systems. In order to quantify the effect of the algorithm on the underlying power system, it is necessary to develop metrics. This also allows the comparison of various algorithms and assess the effect on different feeder configurations. To verify the system level functionality for different operating conditions, the factors affecting the system performance are determined. The values for these factors needs to be chosen intelligently to maximize the accuracy and minimize the number of experiments. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The HIL-TB validation framework presented in this thesis is built based on the principles of design of experiments. The framework provides a platform for the assessment of the control algorithms that would help de-risk the effects of the new techniques on the power system.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This work is an annotated bibliography of original reed quintet repertoire.  It can serve as a practical resource to musicians, reed quintets, composers, music educators and musical scholars of all levels.  For each original composition, there are detailed annotations including information about the composer, title, instrumentation, year composed, length, genre, level, commissioning information, publisher, recording availability, a brief discussion of the form/style of the piece, and copyright information.  Since annotations are only provided for original reed quintet repertoire, I have included four indexes of other reed quintet repertoire from 1985 until 2015: Original reed quintet music with additional parts, Arrangements, Arrangements including additional parts and Historical Reference.  These indexes include titles, composers and arrangers of all arrangements, chamber repertoire, arrangements of chamber repertoire, and original repertoire with additional instruments.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The system including the congeners &lt;i&gt;C. maculatus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;C. chinensis&lt;/i&gt; has long been a model for competition studies. Members of these two pest species often cohabit facilities designed for the storage of dried legumes, a crucial nutritional resource for the larvae of both species. In both natural and laboratory settings it has been observed that &lt;i&gt;C. chinensis&lt;/i&gt; routinely drives &lt;i&gt;C. maculatus&lt;/i&gt; to extinction. These observations convinced many ecologists that the trophic relationship between the two species presents an unequivocal case of competitive exclusion. Several predictively successful mathematical models based on resource competition alone accordingly estimated the competitive disparity between these two bean beetle species, suggesting that individual &lt;i&gt;C. chinensis&lt;/i&gt; are approximately four times better competitors for a shared resource than their average &lt;i&gt;C. maculatus&lt;/i&gt; counterparts.  Recent studies (Kishi et al. 2009; Kyogoku and Nishida 2012, 2013; Kishi and Nakazawa 2013; Kishi and Tsubaki 2014) have called into question this apparently straightforward conclusion since there are few if any characteristic life history traits or behavioral mechanisms associated with exploitative or interference competition that would explain the competitive disparity. The authors of these studies contend that reproductive interference—a negative interspecific sexual interaction that reduces the fitness of at least one of the species involved—is a largely ignored but equally consequential factor when it comes to explaining interspecific population dynamics. This study tests for the presence and explanatory importance of reproductive interference on per capita female fitness by simultaneously manipulating conspecific density and operational sex ratio in the presence (and absence) of heterospecific males. The experimental design also reveals the operative mechanism(s) behind reproductive interference. Results of this study clearly support outstanding claims for the causal significance of reproductive interference in this system.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Deep-sea organisms are increasingly subject to bycatch interactions worldwide. Recent studies have shown that discard mortality can lead to significant declines in deep sea fish stocks, and highlight the inherent vulnerability of deep sea organisms to overexploitation due to their shared suite of conservative life history characteristics. Estimating the post-release mortality (PRM) rates of these deep-sea organisms is a necessary step towards responsible fisheries management, particularly as PRM represents a substantial source of uncertainty when estimating total fishery mortality. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The deep-sea giant isopod &lt;i&gt;Bathynomus giganteus&lt;/i&gt; and its relatives are captured as bycatch in numerous fisheries, although knowledge is limited regarding their population trends or response to capture and release. In order to assess and predict PRM in &lt;i&gt;B. giganteus&lt;/i&gt;, we used reflex action mortality predictors (RAMP) whereby the presence or absence of target reflexes was used to create a delayed mortality model, and considered factors affecting mortality. Mortality rates five days post-capture ranged from 50-100% and both RAMP scores and time at the surface were significant predictors of mortality, although our conclusions regarding the effect of surface time are limited. In-cage video documented little movement within the 24 h monitoring period following cage deployment, and it appeared that surviving individuals often fed within the holding period after cage deployment. Our results suggest that PRM in &lt;i&gt;B. giganteus&lt;/i&gt; is common and that this unaccounted source of mortality should be quantified and investigated for other deep-sea crustaceans as well. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Similarly, bycatch interactions with deep-sea elasmobranchs can lead to dramatic declines in abundance over short time scales. Sharks hooked in the deep sea could face a higher likelihood of severe physiological disturbance, at-vessel mortality, and PRM than their shallower counterparts. Unfortunately, robust PRM rates have not yet been estimated for deep-sea elasmobranchs and as such are not currently incorporated into total fishery mortality estimates or bycatch assessments, limiting the effectiveness of conservation or management initiatives. We empirically estimated PRM for two focal species of deep-sea shark, the Cuban dogfish &lt;i&gt;Squalus cubensis&lt;/i&gt; and the gulper shark &lt;i&gt;Centrophorus&lt;/i&gt; sp. using post-release cages deployed at-depth. We calculated 24 h PRM rates of 49.7% (± 8.5 SE) for &lt;i&gt;S. cubensis&lt;/i&gt; and 83% (± 16 SE) for &lt;i&gt;Centrophorus&lt;/i&gt; sp. and identified shark size (total length), blood lactate, blood pH, and vitality scores as predictors of PRM in &lt;i&gt;Squalus cubensis&lt;/i&gt;. We also observed all PRM within 11 h post-capture and demonstrated the effects of capture and recovery depth on stress and behavior. Our results suggest that PRM rates of deep-sea sharks are higher than previously assumed, and highlight the need for filling in this gap in fishery mortality estimates for other common deep-sea discards in the future.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Intermetallic magnetic materials, such as SmCo5 and Nd2Fe14B, play important role in our daily lives via their use in many high-tech devices and technologies. Understanding the interplay between the crystal structure, electronic structure, and magnetic properties can provide useful information for the improvement of existing and discovery of new magnetic materials. ThCr2Si2 structure is one of the most abundant intermetallic structure types that accommodates a variety of compounds with a general formula AT2X2 (A = alkali, alkaline metal or rare earth metals, T = transition metal, X = metalloids, or nonmetals). The magnetic behavior of itinerant systems with ThCr2Si2 structure type can be very sensitive to modifications of the electronic structure caused by chemical substitution, applied pressure, or magnetic field, even if such perturbations are small. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Although extensive studies have been performed on ternary silicides and germanides and on FeAs-based superconductors of this structure type, much less attention has been paid to ternary rare-earth cobalt arsenides. The overarching goal of this work is to provide a synthetic methodology toward rare-earth cobalt arsenides and to investigate their structure-property relationships. We use physical pressure, chemical compression, or chemical substitution to alter the crystal and electronic structures and thus impact the magnetic behavior of these materials. The general synthetic and characterization methods are described in Chapter 2.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter 3 reports the synthesis of RCo2As2 (R = La, Ce, Pr, Nd) by reactions of constituent elements in molten Bi. All compounds exhibit high-temperature ferromagnetic ordering of Co magnetic moments. Electronic band structure calculations revealed a high peak in the density of states at the Fermi level, thus supporting the itinerant nature of magnetism in the Co sublattice. The magnetic ordering in the lanthanide sublattice takes place at lower temperatures, with the R moments aligning parallel or antiparallel to the Co moments.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para> In Chapter 4, we demonstrate that the action of physical pressure, chemical compression, or aliovalent substitution in ACo2As2 (A = Eu, Ca) has a general consequence of causing these antiferromagnetic materials to become ferromagnets. The mixed valence triggered by applied pressure in EuCo2As2 results in the increase of the Co 3d density of states at the Fermi level, promoting itinerant ferromagnetism. Similar to high-pressure form of EuCo2As2, ferromagnetic ordering of Co moments can also be achieved through chemical compression of Eu sites in Ca0.9Eu0.1Co1.91As2 or direct electron doping in Ca0.85La0.15Co1.89As2. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The study of chemical compression was extended to a Ca1-xEuxCo2As2 series of solid solutions. As shown in Chapter 5, chemical pressure exerted in these structures on the Eu site causes it to display mixed valence, which varies from +2.17 for x ≤ 0.6 to + 2.14 for x ≥ 0.65. The solid solutions with x ≤ 0.6 exhibit ferromagnetic ordering while the ones with x ≥ 0.65 exhibit antiferromagnetic ordering. We demonstrate that the change in the magnetic behavior is associated with the changes in the electronic band structure and the increase in the bonding character of Co-Co interactions at the Fermi level for Eu-rich phases.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The Bi-flux method used for the synthesis of RCo2As2 was also successfully extended to more complex structures, R2Co12As7 and RCo5As3, as described in Chapter 6. All R2Co12As7 compounds exhibit high-temperature ferromagnetic ordering of Co moments and low-temperature ordering of R moments. In contrast, all RCo5As3 materials are paramagnetic with the exception of antiferromagnetically ordered PrCo5As3. The dramatic difference in the behavior of R2Co12As7 and RCo5As3 also can be justified by changes in the electronic band structure.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Based on the understanding of correlations between magnetic properties and electronic structure attained in preceding chapters, we demonstrate in Chapter 7 the prediction of ferromagnetism in another layered-structure material, AlFe2B2.  The compound was prepared by two alternative synthetic routes, arc melting and synthesis from Ga flux. The predicted itinerant ferromagnetic behavior was confirmed experimentally, with the magnetic ordering taking place near room temperature. The measurement of magnetocaloric effect (MCE) as a function of applied magnetic field revealed an isothermal entropy change of 4.1 J kg–1 K–1 at 2 T and 7.7 J kg–1 K–1 at 5 T. These are the largest values observed thus far for any metal boride and for any magnetic material of the vast AT2X2 family of layered structures. Importantly, AlFe2B2 represents a rare case of a light-weight material prepared from earth-abundant, benign reactants, which exhibits a substantial MCE while not containing any rare-earth elements.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Our DNA is under continuous stress by endogenous and exogenous attacks such as genotoxic chemicals, ionizing radiation, and metabolic products. DNA damage is extremely detrimental, even a single unrepaired damage is sufficient to kill a cell. Cells mobilize a tightly-regulated complex repair signaling pathways to either repair or remove the damaged DNA and avoid harmful consequences such as genome instability syndromes and malignant transformations. Here, we show the rapid and transient recruitment of the transcription factor YY1 to laser-induced damage sites in living human cells in real time, suggesting an early and direct role of YY1 in DNA repair. Use of a panel of YY1 deletion constructs reveal that part of the C-terminus of the protein is required for the YY1 damage response and is the repair response domain. The recruitment of YY1 to DNA damage sites is not regulated by ATM or PARP1. However, in ATR hypomorphic cells, YY1`s retention at the damage sites was prolonged, suggesting YY1 might be directly or indirectly regulated by ATR. We also show experimentally that the transcription factor YY1 is dispensable for the recruitment of a number of major repair proteins. Overall, our findings provide evidence for early recruitment and point to important role for YY1, whether direct or indirect, in DNA repair. Future research will focus on the role of YY1 at DNA damage sites and will further our understanding in the role of YY1 in genome integrity and maintenance.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Scholars of economic interdependence argue that economic trade will diminish the longstanding disputes and rivalry, if any, leading nations to closer cooperation. However, this argument has failed to exhibit any validity in the case of Indo-China relations. Historically, the Sino-India relationship has been based as a love-hate relationship. Liberal scholars and reputable economists predict that the future of their relationship will be based on cooperation. But in reality, such a relationship has failed to manifest. Instead, both nations— despite the friendly rhetoric —view each other as rivals, if not enemies. This thesis will concentrate on exploring whether the economic interdependence argument holds true. To support their increasing bilateral economic cooperation, I used sources from India, China, and international economic institutions. I examine whether the increasing economic cooperation in the form of bilateral trade has reduced the undying border disputes and enduring rivalry associated with such disputes. After studying the unresolved border disputes, increase in the military buildup by both the sides, and misperception of each other in their actions, one can argue that Sino-India relations have the case of enduring rivalry, and it has never ended despite the increasingly closer economic cooperation. For that purpose, I explore the substantial literature from the Western, Indian and Chinese research institutions and academic scholars. Further, I research the perception of the leadership and strategic community in both India and China.  Furthermore, both the nations have developed strategies to contain the influence of each other in their respective regions. Thus, bilateral trade between them has neither created closer cooperation as one might expect, nor reduced the security dilemma associated with power politics. Considering such a condition, this work expects that the future of Indo-China cooperation will more likely an enduring rivalry and be characterized by a security dilemma negating any influence of economic cooperation. In other words, the outlook of their relationship will more likely be conflictual based on power politics.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>While Bayesian meta-analysis has flourished both in methodological and substantive work, group-specific Bayesian modeling remains scarce. Common practice for choosing prior distributions entails using typical non-informative priors. Currently, there is a push to use more informative prior distributions. In this dissertation I propose a group specific weakly informative prior distribution. The new prior distribution uses a frequentist estimate of between-studies heterogeneity as the noncentrality parameter in a folded noncentral t distribution. This new distribution is then modeled individually for groups based on some categorical factor. An extensive simulation study was performed to assess the performance of the new group-specific prior distribution to several non-informative prior distributions in a variety of meta-analytic scenarios. An application using data from a previously published meta-analysis on dynamic geometry software is also provided.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Relative to males, females have historically been underrepresented among recognized creators, inventors, and innovators. Despite vast strides toward female empowerment and gender equality in various social, political, and employment arenas, a trend of gender imbalance in many creative endeavors has persisted into the present day. Although real-world and anecdotal evidence present a clear disparity, the actual empirical literature regarding gender and creative capabilities presents a more muddled picture about gender differences. Some studies have suggested female superiority; some suggest male superiority; some suggest gender equality; and still others suggest that either gender can excel creatively depending on various measurement and contextual factors. The purpose of the current study was 1) to systematically investigate the accumulated evidence on gender differences in creativity and 2) to explore the conceptual factors and potential moderators that may account for past discrepancies in the literature. Specifically, a meta-analysis was conducted to address the question of whether females and males tend to differ in mean level of creativity across the empirical literature and also whether a variety of moderating variables (i.e., creativity construct, domain specificity of measure, measure format, sample age, study era) affect the relationship between creativity and gender. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In order to collect a pool of primary studies to address these questions, a systematic literature search was conducted, pulling for studies across the lifespan and throughout historical eras. All studies relating gender to an individual-level, quantitative measure of creative ability or achievement were eligible for inclusion, resulting in a variety of included assessment instruments (i.e., divergent thinking performance tests, evaluation of creative products, self-report inventories, other-report inventories). The literature search returned 271 eligible studies, yielding 480 independent effect sizes and a total N of 137,247 participants. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Analyses showed a significant relationship between creativity and gender overall (g ̅= .056, p &lt; .05), such that females showed slightly higher creativity than males across all studies. Creativity construct and age were found to be marginally significant in moderating the association between gender and creativity, and creativity test format was significant at p &lt; .05 as a moderator. However, in a multiple regression combining the predictive power of these three variables, age was no longer found to be a significant moderator. Domain specificity and study era were also not found to be significant moderators. Results of the study were discussed in terms of the strengths and limitations of the design, suggestions for future research, and practical implications for both males and females in pursuing their creative passions.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study was an exploration into how seniors who participate in art workshops at the senior center experienced and made sense of their art museum visitations.  In light of the rapidly increasing aging population in most countries around the world and the corollary notion that their well-being would be a global benchmark for civilized living (Kinsella &amp; Phillips, 2005), the arts and creativity have been gaining momentum as a model for healthy and purposeful aging (Cohen, 2000, 2001; Hanna, 2013; Hanna &amp; Perlstein, 2008).  Despite the efforts to make art museums accessible to senior citizens, little empirical evidence and literature can be found that address the museum experiences of older adults, especially those who are considered to be receptive to visiting art museums, based on characteristics of the art exhibition.  This study fills that critical gap through the use of phenomenological research methods that incorporate observations, in-depth interviews, a focus group, and document analysis techniques.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The research site was selected by conducting evaluations using Serrell’s (2006) Framework for Assessing Excellence in Exhibitions from a Visitor-Centered Perspective to identify characteristics of six art exhibitions.  The exhibition chosen was rated excellent regarding its levels of achievement for all criteria: &lt;i&gt;comfortable&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;engaging&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;reinforcing&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;meaningful&lt;/i&gt;.  The museum fieldtrip was set up to take participants to see the selected art exhibition.  The fieldwork contributed a comprehensive perspective of not only experience but also motivation and reflection dimensions of the museum visitation that seniors constructed through the dynamic interaction of personal, sociocultural, and physical contexts.  The data from the observation field notes, transcriptions of in-depth interviews and the focus group, and document review were analyzed by using phenomenology data analysis methods and emerging themes were presented in the form of composite descriptions.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The results of the data analysis showed that participants were infused by a spirit of inquiry and had a need for being social.  Older age-related needs and life-learned wisdom played a key part in shaping seniors’ museum experiences emotionally and intellectually.  The essence and shared meaning of this group of seniors’ art museum visitation experiences culminated in seven key findings: seniors perceived themselves as curiosity-driven museum visitors with older age-related needs and values; sociocultural circumstances played a key part in seniors’ art museum visit motivations; seniors constructed their museum experiences on their interests in art with a touch of life-learned wisdom; not only physical but also communication and attitude accessibilities are crucial to older museum visitors; seniors preferred personal interactions in order to maintain social connections; sociable experiences made seniors’ meaningful museum experiences memorable; and the art museum visitation cultivated seniors’ senses of purpose in terms of staying creative.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To make contributions to the current paradigm for creative aging, the findings put forward knowledge that conveys practical ways for art museums and senior centers to work together on making arts and creativity services.  These services can dynamically play an important role in building an effective ecosystem of leisure activities for promoting active lifestyles and social well-being among senior citizens.  The findings of this study were used to develop seven recommendations that revolve around how art museums and senior centers can foster older visitors’ meaningful and memorable museum experiences and collaborate on constructing and sustaining a full cycle of arts experiences and creativity engagement, from passive observation to active participation, not only in but also across communities.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between family structure, SES, and condom use and hookup rates among a sample of N=1,346 African American college students.  In addition, the moderating role of sexual attitudes in the association between the relationship of family structure and sexual behaviors and also between SES and sexual behaviors was examined.  Gender differences in sexual behaviors and attitudes were also explored.  There were significant gender differences in the number of hookup partners, sex attitudes and condom usage.  SES was a strong predictor of the number of hookup partners men and women had as well as condom usage. With women from higher SES reporting hooking up with more partners that they knew prior as well as lower condom use. Family structure was not a significant predictor of sexual behaviors. Women were 1.2 times more likely to use condoms than men. Men also reported over three times as many hookup partners compared to women. Women reported more conservative sexual attitudes than men.   Overall, sexual attitudes buffered the association between family structures and hookup partners and SES and hookup partners.  This study found that African American college students are partaking in normative sexual behaviors and that several factors work together to influence their sexual behaviors and attitudes.  Future implications are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The dissertation explored the efficacy of using a POMDP to select and apply appropriate instruction. POMDPs are a tool for planning:  selecting a sequence of actions that will lead to an optimal outcome.  RTI is an approach to instruction, where teachers craft individual plans for students based on the results of screening test.  The goal is to determine whether the plans crafted by a POMDP model in a RTI setting offer advantages over the current practice that uses simple cut score methods. Two simulated data sets were used to compare the two approaches; the model had a single latent reading construct and two observed reading measures: Phoneme Segmentation Fluency (PSF) for phonological awareness and Nonsense Word Fluency (NWF) for phonics. The simulation studies evaluated the POMDPs forecasts of the students’ end-of-year reading performance, and the studies compared how the students were placed into instructional groups using the two approaches. The POMDP-RTI model forecasted the students PSF and NWF scores for the last time period based on their scores in the previous time period as well as a forecast standard deviation.  In the study, 91% of PSF scores and 94% of NWF scores fell within two standard deviations. The assignment to tiers was very different (after the initial time block) with just over half the students assigned differently under the two models at the last time point.  The growth was better under the POMDP-RTI approach with a difference in mean reading ability of .49 on a standardized scale.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The gain is because the POMDP model can take into account past observations and instructional history in its forecasts.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>ABSTRACT</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Dr. Augustus J. Pearson is widely known as choral music educator who made significant contributions to choral music education and influenced many of his students. Moreover, his far-reaching influence as a choral conductor in various institutions, organizations, and communities is noteworthy. This study documents Pearson’s contributions within the field of choral music education. Augustus J. Pearson was born in Topeka, Kansas on February 8, 1944 to Jamie and Augustus J. Pearson, Sr. He received his earliest musical training from his mother. He was a graduate of Topeka High School, where he was a member of the band and choir. He also played the organ and the piano. He served as the organist at Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church in Topeka, Kansas, where his father was pastor. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>He went on to pursue graduate study at the University of Michigan, where he earned a Master of Music degree in Voice. Later, he received a graduate assistantship and university endowment scholarship to complete a Doctor of Musical Arts degree from the University of Kansas. He was a member of the Phi Kappa Lambda National Honor Society, the American Choral Directors Association (ACDA), MENC, and the National Association of Negro Musicians. His college-teaching began  in 1974 at Morris College.  Afterwards, he taught at Fayetteville State University from 1979-1989 and at the Florida A&amp;M University from 1991-1995.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Apart from the mesons that the constituent quark model predicts, QCD allows for additional states beyond the quark-antiquark system. Previous experiments have performed partial wave analysis on pion-production data and claim observation of an exotic JPC = 1−+ state decaying via ρπ. The g12 experiment took place at Jefferson Lab using the CLAS spectrometer, a liquid hydrogen target was used and a tagged photon beam. By studying the reactions γp → nπ+π +π − and γp → ∆++π +π −π −, the photoproduction of mesons decaying to 3π was studied using two different but complimentary channels. Events are selected with low four-momentum transfer to the baryon, in order to enhance one pion exchange production. For both 3π systems the data exhibit two intermediate decays, ρπ and f2π. For the γp → nπ+π +π − reaction over 600k events were acquired resulting in the largest 3π photoproduction dataset to date. The exotic JPC= 1−+ partial wave does not show resonant behavior and more so it is strongly consistent with a non-resonant non-interfering wave relative to a resonant π2(1670). Furthermore, the partial wave analysis shows production of the a2(1320) and π2(1670) mesons. For the first time we report observation of a photoproduced a1(1260) meson. For the γp → ∆++π +π −π − reaction nearly 350k events were analyzed. A partial wave analysis was performed for the first time on this channel. The a1(1260), a2(1320), and the π2(1670) mesons were observed. Observation of the a1(1260) confirms the result first reported in γp → nπ+π +π − reaction.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Recently, the interest for renewable resources for fibers particularly of plant origin has been increasing. Reduction of use of traditional textile materials is now considered more critical due to the increasing environmental concern. Natural fibers are renewable, biodegradable, recyclable, and lightweight materials with high specific modulus, in competition with man-made fossil materials and fiberglass. Natural fibers are used for preparation of functionalized textiles to achieve smart and intelligent properties. However, the incorporation of these fibers in composite systems has been challenging due to their hydrophilic nature. Nevertheless, the fact that these biodegradable materials can be manipulated at a nano-scale to complement desired objective and application has made them a favorable option.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The idea behind this project is to explore ways to convert green waste to high value materials and to utilize natural building blocks to design textile reinforcement materials. In this work, cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) supplied from the University of Maine were hydrophobized by silylation and characterized using Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Results from FTIR spectroscopy showed a formation of Si-O-C bonds, indicating better fiber-matrix adhesion. Raman spectroscopy showed disruption of hydrogen bonding which indicates interference of parallel nanocellulose fiber adhesion to neighboring fibrils. The TGA suggests that the thermal stability of the functionalized CNF is higher than that of the corresponding neat sample, which could be a result of stable Si bond formation.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The raw materials (neat and functionalized) were encapsulated in a polystyrene matrix through a solvent and non-solvent precipitation process, and then extruded using single and dual heat processing. The extruded thin filaments were tested according to the ASTM D638 (tensile test of plastics). Results showed an increasing Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS) and Elastic Modulus, with peak values attributed to the dual-heat processing up to 79% and 69% increase respectively at 5wt% loading. Further increase was seen at 10wt% loading up to 112MPa UTS, and modulus up to 10.7GPa for the dual-heat processing. The UTS increase is assumed to be a result of linear arrangement of CNF in the matrix during the extrusion process. The results revealed the strong reinforcing ability of CNF and their compatibility with thermoplastic matrix if functionalized.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This dissertation seeks to increase understanding about why older African Americans have equal or lower rates of mental illness than whites; despite the general tendency that disadvantaged individuals have worse mental health than advantaged individuals. To explain the unexpected finding from a methodological standpoint, this study uses the 2008 and 2012 Waves of the Health and Retirement Study and examines racial differences in the factor structures of mental illness focusing on symptoms included in the CES-D (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression) and the BAI (Beck Anxiety Inventory). To understand the implications of these racial differences in the stress process, this study also examines how discrimination, as a type of stressor, manifests into different mental health outcomes (somatic or mood-based symptoms) between older African Americans and whites. The analysis employs structural equation modeling and finds that modeling CES-D and BAI items as mood-based and somatic constructs of general distress has better model fit than modeling these items than as separate constructs of depression and anxiety (Chapter 2). In regard to racial differences in the factor structure of these models, the analysis finds that the factor structure of the somatic model differs between the racial groups whereas the factor structure of the mood-based model does not differ. When examining how discrimination manifests into different mental health outcomes, the analysis shows that discrimination is related to increased mood-based symptoms among whites and unrelated to mood-based symptoms among African Americans (Chapter 3). Additionally, everyday discrimination and lifetime discrimination are related to increased somatic symptoms among whites. Among African Americans, physical disability and financial status based discrimination are related to increased somatic symptoms, and lifetime discrimination and ancestry-based discrimination are related to decreased somatic symptoms. The findings from this dissertation suggest that current measures of mental illness (e.g., CES-D, BAI, etc.) may not measure the same constructs across racial groups and that modeling mental illness as mood-based and somatic constructs may give better insights into the prevalence of mental illness among older adults. Further, this study sheds light on the potential effects of discrimination on an alternative and more culturally specific expression of mental illness symptoms (somatic symptoms). This study also extends the literature on discrimination and mental health by illustrating how different forms of discrimination impact different mental health outcomes.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>CNTs have been considered as the excellent candidate to revolutionize a broad range of applications. There have been many method developed to manipulate the chemistry and the structure of CNTs. Laser with non-contact treatment capability exhibits many processing advantages, including solid-state treatment, extremely fast processing rate, and high processing resolution. In additon, the outstanding monochromatic, coherent, and directional beam generates the powerful energy absorption and the resultant extreme processing conditions. In my research, a unique laser scanning method was developed to process CNTs, controlling the oxidation and the graphitization. The achieved controllability of this method was applied to address the important issues of the current CNT processing methods for three applications.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The controllable oxidation of CNTs by laser scanning method was applied to cut CNT films to produce high-performance cathodes for FE devices. The production method includes two important self-developed techniques to produce the cold cathodes: the production of highly oriented and uniformly distributed CNT sheets and the precise laser trimming process. Laser cutting is the unique method to produce the cathodes with remarkable features, including ultrathin freestanding structure (~200 nm), greatly high aspect ratio, hybrid CNT-GNR emitter arrays, even emitter separation, and directional emitter alignment. This unique cathode structure was unachievable by other methods. The developed FE devices successfully solved the screening effect issue encounter by current FE devices. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The laser-control oxidiation method was further developed to sequentially remove graphitic walls of CNTs. The laser oxidation process was directed to occur along the CNT axes by the laser scanning direction. Additionally, the oxidation was further assisted by the curvature stress and the thermal expansion of the graphitic nanotubes, ultimately opening (namely unzipping) the tubular structure to produce GNRs. Therefore the developed laser scanning method optimally exploited the thermal laser-CNT interaction, successfully transforming CNTs into 2D GNRs. The solid-state laser unzipping process effectively addressed the issues of contamination and scalability encountered by the current unzipping methods. Additionally, the produced GNRs were uniquely featured with the freestanding structure and the smooth surfaces.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>If the scanning process was performed in an inert environment without the appearance of oxygen, the oxidation of CNTs would not happen. Instead, the greatly mobile carbon atoms of the heated CNTs would reorganize the crystal structure, inducing the graphitization process to improve the crystallinity. Many observations showing the structural improvement of CNTs under laser irradiation has been reported, confirming the capability of laser to heal graphitic defects. Laser methods were more time-efficient and energy-efficient than other annealing methods because laser can quickly heat CNTs to generate graphitization in less than one second. This subsecond heating process of laser irradiation was more effective than other heating methods because it avoided the undesired coalescence of CNTs. In my research, the laser scanning method was applied to generate the graphitization, healing the structural defects of CNTs. Different from the reported laser methods, the laser scanning directed the locally annealed areas to move along the CNT axes, migrating and coalescencing the graphitic defects to achieve better healing results. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The critical information describing the CNT structural transformation caused by the moving laser irradiation was explored from the successful applications of the developed laser method. This knowledge inspires an important method to modifiy the general graphitic structure for important applications, such as carbon fiber production, CNT self-assembly process and CNT welding. This method will be effective, facile, versatile, and adaptable for laboratory and industrial facilities.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Wind energy has become one of the most important and thriving renewable energy resources in the world. Transforming the kinetic energy of wind into electric power is more environmentally friendly than traditional processes such as the combustion of fossil fuels. It provides independence from the limited fossil fuels reserves by using an unlimited resource. In order to develop a wind power facility, it is important to develop an initial wind resource assessment to guarantee the selected site will be profitable in terms of electric energy output. Several countries lack developed wind atlases that indicate a rough estimate of wind resource in their territories, which is an obstacle for inexpensive wind resource evaluations. In order to perform site evaluations generally an anemometer must be put in place to take wind measurements. This process is costly and time consuming since at least a year of data must be observed. The quality of wind resource depends on several geographic and atmospheric characteristics such as: air density, site location, site topography, wind speed and direction. This study was conducted to provide an initial wind resource assessment on three locations in Venezuela which do not have previous evaluations: Cerro Copey, Punta de Piedras and Los Roques. The assessment was done remotely based on the national meteorological service meteorological observations; wind resource and turbine power output uncertainties were taken into account. The wind assessment was done through Monte Carlo simulations mathematically considering several uncertainties with emphasis on surface roughness for vertical extrapolation. The results exhibit wind energy potential of the three sites and a throughout wind resource characterization of the site with the most potential: Cerro Copey.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>&lt;i&gt; Tango-Études pour Flûte Seule ou Violin Seule&lt;/i&gt; by Astor Piazzolla and &lt;i&gt;Sonata for Violin and Piano &lt;/i&gt; by Philip Glass are discussed.  As examples of the musical genres nuevo tango and minimalism, respectively, they are presented as repertory options for violinists interested in undertaking a work from these classifications or for those interested in the music of Piazzolla or Glass.  As pieces that were written in the late twentieth century and early twenty-first century, their short histories are explored and contextualized by considering why they were written, and how they typify the composers’ oeuvres.  &lt;i&gt;Tango-Études&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Sonata for Violin and Piano&lt;/i&gt; have been recorded and released on commercial albums and have commanded international attention since their creation, yet they currently remain on the periphery of the mainstream repertoire for violin.  Even so, their value as performing repertoire, in general, and as representations of the relatively small body of solo violin music by Piazzolla and Glass, specifically, proves great and makes them worthy of study and performance.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Health care facilities are seeking opportunities to expand patient and family centered care and meet patient clinical goals at minimal additional costs. The Affordable Care Act has put an emphasis on positive patient experience by reimbursing facilities that meet the diverse needs of their patients. Evidence-based music therapy (MT) services effectively meet patient clinical goals and increase patient satisfaction. Hospitals that have MT programs are experiencing cost savings and revenue retention benefits.  Therefore, health care professionals are gaining interest in medical MT programs. Many areas in the country have limited MT services and new programs are being established. Creating a program requires effective planning and adaptability to change. A new program’s success relies on constant staff education regarding the benefits of MT and building interpersonal relationships with health care professionals who will advocate for services. This study was designed to describe the process of creating and implementing a new comprehensive medical MT program at a hospital that does not have MT services. The program facilitator aimed to use this experience as a resource for MT-BCs desiring to develop programs and to advance clinical MT.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This mixed-methods study investigated the use of different types of instructional techniques as mediational tools for developing student vocabulary development and retention in the Japanese classroom.  The experimental treatment, designed to introduce vocabulary through its components in a more interactive, visual manner, was implemented during regular subject-matter instruction over the course of one semester, covering vocabulary of four chapters from the textbook used in the curriculum.  A total of 34 participants were divided into two classes.  One class, composed of 19 of the total participants, received three types of explicit instruction using mediation through three different experimental treatments. The remaining 15 participants in the other class were part of the control, receiving no instruction beyond what is typically found in the curriculum.  All participants in the experimental treatment class were also given questionnaires for the qualitative portion of the study.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Analysis of the data revealed that there was no statistical significance between those participants who received explicit vocabulary instruction and those in the control group.  Further, there was no statistical significance found upon analysis of the students’ grades in the experimental treatment group across both the posttest and delayed posttest.  Results suggest that the length of time given for each type of mediation was not sufficient for participants in the experimental treatment group to focus on the mediational tools being presented to them, whereas students in the control group gradually showed improvement possibly due to consistent use of the same technique for acquiring the vocabulary throughout the four chapters.  The study then makes a number of recommendations for future studies using a similar methodology.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The work in this dissertation presents methods developed for the measurement of small molecules in islets of Langerhans, including reactive oxygen species and amino acids. Reactive oxygen species were measured using fluorescence imaging. The conditions of dye loading, incubation, and imaging were optimized to develop a robust and reproducible protocol to measure these species using the fluorescent dye, 2’,7’-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCF-DA). The protocol that was developed minimized photobleaching and leakage of H2DCF from murine islets and utilized a normalization procedure to further reduce experimental variability. The method allowed for ~25 min of DCF measurement in living islets. We used the developed protocol to compare DCF fluorescence from batches of islets incubated in varying glucose concentrations and observed ~1.5-fold higher fluorescence signals in 3 vs. 20 mM glucose. The presence of diazoxide increased DCF fluorescence at all glucose concentrations tested while addition of 30 mM K+, to increase [Ca2+]i, reduced the fluorescence by ~15%. With the developed protocol, all experimental methods tested to increase [Ca2+]i resulted in a decrease in DCF fluorescence, potentially indicating involvement of ROS in intracellular signaling cascades.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	To characterize the potential roles that amino acids may play in islet physiology, derivatization of amino acids in high-salt buffers commonly used in islet experiments with naphthalene-2,3-dicarboxaldehyde and micellar electrokinetic chromatography separation conditions were optimized. The optimized conditions used D-norvaline as the internal standard and allowed quantification of 14 amino acids with limit of detections ranging from 0.2 nM to 7 nM. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) of the migration times were 0.04% – 0.54% and the RSDs of the peak areas were 0.2% – 5.8% for the various amino acids. The effects of glucose and 2,4-dinitrophenol on amino acid secretions from islets were tested and a suppressive effect of glucose on gamma-aminobutyric acid release was observed, likely acting through adenosine triphosphate inactivation of glutamate decarboxylase.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	To understand the secretion dynamics of these amino acids, a microfluidic system was developed to perform online monitoring of the secretion profiles of amino acids from 2 – 5 islets.  The device contained an islet chamber with the ability to perfuse stimulants, and an amino acid measurement system with derivatization and electrophoretic separation integrated on a single microchip. The setup was optimized to allow -15 kV to be applied to the device for high efficiency and rapid separations of derivatized amino acids. The compositions of the derivatization and separation buffers were optimized to prevent precipitations in the channels, which allowed continuous monitoring of secretion for over 2 hours.  With this method, 10 amino acids were resolved with limits of detection ranging from 1 – 20 nM. When murine islets were perfused with 3 mM glucose, the secretion rates of 9 amino acids were measured and ranged from 30 to 400 fmol islet-1 min-1. As the glucose concentration was increased to 20 mM, the dynamic changes of amino acids were monitored. The biological relevance of the amino acid secretions was verified using 2,4-dinitrophenol as an inhibitor of the proton motive force. The microfluidic system was also used to measure dynamic changes of amino acid release from human islets, which showed different release profiles compared to their murine counterparts.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Landfilling is widely adopted as one of the most economical processes for solid waste disposal. At the same time, landfill leachate is also a great environmental concern because of its complex composition and high contaminant concentrations. Recirculating leachate appears to be one of the least expensive methods for partial treatment and disposal of leachate at properly designed and operated landfill sites. The leachate recirculation not only improves the leachate quality, but also shortens the time duration required for landfill stabilization. In addition, aerated leachate recirculation can bring air into the landfill, leading to aerobic organic decomposition, as well as iron precipitation. It has been discovered that up to 84% BOD, 86% COD, 90% iron and manganese can be removed after 4 months’ recirculation. In Northwest Florida, high concentrations of iron have been observed in the landfill leachate, which is believed to be released to the landfill leachate from iron-rich soil owing to changes in pH and redox conditions induced by organic waste decomposition. Therefore, aerated leachate recirculation has obvious benefits in this region. Although aerated leachate recirculation has these advantages, leachate is only partially treated. The leachate must be further treated in order to meet the discharge requirements. Among all the treatment methods, biological treatment of wastewater with a biofilter is the most promising and most well characterized technology. During biofiltration operations, the growth of microorganisms develops biofilms on the medium surfaces and the microorganisms in the biofilms absorb soluble and colloidal waste materials in the wastewater as it percolates over the medium surfaces. The BOD can nearly be completely removed if the wastewater retention time in the media is sufficiently long for the microorganisms to absorb wastewater constituents. In this research, aerated recirculation and pressurized suspended fiber biofiltration were tested for the treatment of leachate from landfills in Northwest Florida. The pressurized suspended biofilter can efficiently achieve the filtration function with limited space. The suspended fiber provide a tremendous amount of surface areas in a small volume. Therefore, microorganisms can grow around the fibers at a density of greater than 1 × 108 cells per ml, the only means to culture cells at in vivo-like cell density. Another advantage of the pressurized suspended fiber filtration is that the oxygen transfer barrier can be overcome and consequently significantly increased dissolved oxygen level can be achieved. As an innovative technology for wastewater treatment, the pressurized suspended fiber biofilters also makes biological contact oxidation possible, which can significantly improve BOD and COD removal and decrease the sludge yield. For iron removal, contact oxidation is achieved by microbial mediated iron oxidation and fixation during which ferrous iron is oxidized to ferric iron and fixed onto the filter media. Consequently, there is minimal ferric iron suspending in the solution that can escape the filter. Using the combined aerated leachate recirculation and pressurized fiber biofiltration, chemical oxygen demand (COD) of the landfill leachate can be reduced to as low as 8 mg/l and iron content can be reduced to as low as 0.02 mg/l under appropriate dissolved oxygen and alkalinity conditions.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This thesis investigates wondrous events in G.E. Lessing’s play Nathan der Weise as well as Kleist’s novellas Der Findling and Das Erdbeben in Chili. These textual analyses explore the effects that wonders have on the three narratives as well as literature in general. Several prominent scholars from the mid-eighteenth to early-nineteenth century are engaged for their interpretations of wonder and miracles from religious, philosophical, and aesthetic perspectives, so as to gain a contemporary understanding of the topics. Such interpretations inform the three textual analyses that focus on major ‘wonders’ that indicate the crucial role this topic has in literature. This thesis posits wonders and the wondrous to occupy a central discourse in these stories and make up the narrative core not just for literature, but for storytelling in a broader sense. This idea is validated by the ambiguity of the concept of Wunder/wonder, and its movement between the fields of religion and literature. Wonder uncovers an elemental foundation in literature; it reveals the dynamic potential storytelling has on society, while the stories show the ways in which society utilizes stories – and thus the wondrous – to maintain its order. Ultimately, the wonders discussed deal with a rupture, a wound, in the common, established order. The reciprocated sense of wonder leads both characters and readers deeper into the ‘wound,’ further into the discourse and to the core of literature, society, religion; that which is based in wondrous narrative. Such discourses, as the stories reveal, base themselves in the struggle between nature and culture. Literature and poetry asserts itself as a medium between nature and culture alternative to reason, religion, myth, and so on through its regenerative display of the wound and thoroughgoing presence of wonder.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This dissertation, titled Investigating Music Information Objects, is a study of the nature, description, representations, and ideas related to music information objects (MIOs). This research study investigates how music practitioners from various traditions describe and conceptualize MIOs, using a theoretical framework to classify such descriptors and characteristics (the term “attributes” might also apply). The introduction in Chapter 1 provides an overview of purpose, problem statement, significance of this research, research questions, approach, and theoretical framework used. Next, Chapter 2 is a literature review of relevant research. Chapter 3 describes the method and analysis procedures that were used. Chapter 4 presents the research findings, and Chapter 5 discusses implications of the study for Information Science and music information research; provides theoretical extensions to the existing framework; and, offers conclusions taken from this study’s findings, along with areas for future research.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>“The Greatest Blasphemy” analyzes how difference is made meaningful in ancient and modern discourses surrounding the “heresy” of Carpocratianism and demonstrates its role as a symbol of opposition to what would soon become the dominant narrative of asceticism and renunciation in the fourth and fifth centuries CE. Living in Alexandria, Egypt during the first half of the second century, Carpocrates was labeled a heretic by a cadre of opponents from the second to the twelfth century. This project collects and analyzes the relevant source material, reconstructs what we can know about Carpocratianism, and assesses the function of the charges leveled against Carpocratianism in various historical contexts. Since none of Carpocrates’ writings survive, my project offers a first-of-its-kind reconstruction of Carpocratianism using the writings of his opponents and extant fragments from his son Epiphanes. My work contextualizing the teachings of Carpocrates within early Christianity and Greco-Roman philosophy examines early Christian thought at the intersection of sexuality and the soul from a new perspective. This project demonstrates how Carpocrates’ teachings that wives should be held in common, that souls transmigrate to other bodies after death, and that one must experience everything in life in order to escape this world demonstrates the deficiency of our continued use of certain classifications (e.g., “Christian,” “Greco-Roman,” “Platonic”). My project is situated within, and pushes against, the last two and a half decades of scholarship on early and late antique Christianity that focuses on the role and influence of asceticism and renunciation. As such, it explores how Carpocrates and other early Christian thinkers serve as the tip of the iceberg, so to speak, of resistance to the advancement of asceticism and renunciation in the fourth and fifth centuries, even as their ancient detractors and many modern scholars have classified them as something other than “Christian.”</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>An obsession with vampires pervades today’s popular culture; we encounter vampires at every turn in such media as television, film, and literature. A similar vampire craze emanated from the melodramatic theaters of Paris and London in 1820. The release of John Polidori’s seminal vampire novel, The Vampyre, in 1819 ignited a flourishing of melodramas adapting and responding to that text. Contemporary critics wrote that no theater in either Paris or London was without its vampire. This thesis focuses on the two melodramas that inaugurated this vampire mania: Le Vampire by Charles Nodier, Achille de Jouffroy, and Pierre-Frédéric-Adolphe Carmouche, premiered on 13 June 1820, and The Vampire; or, the Bride of the Isles by James Robinson Planché, premiered on 9 August 1820. Firmly rooted in the genre of melodrama, which espouses a dualistic, black-and-white worldview, these theater pieces are obliged to put forth a clearly identifiable villain. This is problematic when the vampire is certainly dangerous but not physically identifiable by any abnormalities. Analysis of the incidental music and textual allusions in the melodramas reveals various methods of musically enhancing suspense and emotional drama, grounding these specific vampires in a tradition of evil villains, and, perhaps most important, identifying the monster and reminding audience members whom they should fear. Considerations of these interactions between music and text inform an understanding of how the vampire might have been experienced in these two cities in 1820 and cast light upon what the audiences might have feared. Because any modern adaptations of the vampire must in some way confront the foundation laid by John Polidori and these melodramas, popular culture’s first vampire craze, this thesis resurrects these vampire plays from their burial places beyond the earshot of music history. We can better understand our current notions of vampires (and their melodramatic natures) if we understand their past.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation includes a series of studies that present innovative methodologies to improve tornado risk and vulnerability assessments. Limitations of the historical tornado dataset are well known and relate to inconsistencies in data collection procedures, rating assessments, updates in technology, and public awareness. The limitations make it difficult to accurately evaluate tornado risk and vulnerability. Thus, the research presented in this dissertation aims to 1) improve tornado risk assessments using the historical dataset by accounting for known non-meteorological factors and 2) enhance tornado vulnerability assessments by utilizing a new dataset containing more precise damage survey data. This work includes three individual studies, two focused on risk and one on vulnerability, using different geographic scales.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Tornado occurrence rates computed from the available reports are biased low relative to the unknown true rates. A method to estimate the annual statewide probability of getting hit by a tornado improves this low bias by using the average report density as a function of distance from nearest city center. The method is demonstrated on Kansas and then applied to 15 other tornado-prone states from Nebraska to Tennessee over the period 1950--2011. The adjusted rates are significantly higher than the raw rates and thus, the return periods are less than previously thought (closer to 1000 years). The expected annual number of people exposed to tornadoes has also increased for every state.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The evaluation of tornado occurrences is improved using a statistical model that produces a smoothed regional-scale climatology. The model is applied to data aggregated at the county level, including annual population, annual tornado counts, and an index of terrain roughness. The model has a term to capture the smoothed frequency relative to the state average and is used to examine additional hypotheses concerning relationships of tornado activity with terrain roughness and County Warning Area. Tornado reports are found to increase by 13\% for a two-fold increase in population across Kansas after accounting for improvements in rating procedures. The pattern of spatially correlated errors also shows Kansas tornado activity to be consistent with the dryline climatology. The model is significantly improved by adding terrain roughness, which has a negative relationship with tornado activity and its flexibility is demonstrated by fitting it to data from Illinois, Mississippi, South Dakota, and Ohio.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Advancements in technology have improved the collection of tornado damage survey data which can be used to enhance vulnerability assessments. The National Weather Service (NWS) Damage Assessment Toolkit (DAT) contains the most extensive GIS-based damage survey data available to the public which provides more precise damage path areas. These data are used with socioeconomic data in two statistical models. The models are developed to determine which factors are significant predictors of the incidence and magnitude of casualties while accounting for maximum EF Scale rating, total path area, and population density at the storm level. Percent unemployment is a significant predictor and produces the best model for the incidence of at least one tornado casualty. Although percent elderly generates the best model for predicting the magnitude of casualties, it is only marginally significant and its relationship is negative. The Southeast has the highest averages of the sensitivity factors considering all of the tornado events.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>These results highlight the need for heightened tornado awareness and preparedness as our exposure to these events increases due to our population continuing to expand. As demonstrated in this work, these methods can be used to enhance regional/local tornado forecasts, insurance risk estimates, public policy, urban planning, and emergency management and mitigation with the detection of spatiotemporal patterns in tornado activity (due to variations in climate) and vulnerability (due to changes in population demographics and urban sprawl). They can be employed to examine other geographic locations on multiple scales. They can also be adapted to study the patterns and relationships of other spatial and temporal phenomena.</DISS_para>

      <DISS_content>
         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Gregorian chant is typically thought of as a product of the early medieval era. Its monophonic melodies evoke a simple beginning from which Western music evolved; its timbres are associated with the austere monuments of the early Church; its image on the page is somewhat familiar, but foreign; even its present-day performers appear to be from an entirely different time. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Despite its origins and the fact that it is typically studied as a historical artifact, chant is also part of a living institution worthy of examination. This dissertation discusses Benedictine music and ritual in relation to their  historical origins and within the Rule of St. Benedict, but also in their current states as performed and embodied traditions. The sociological models of habitus and meshwork allow study of these cultural products in their present states while keeping mindful of their origins and their accumulation of meaning over the course of many centuries. Through performance of ritual, Benedictines form communitas that structures and unites them while simultaneously integrating new people and ideas into their group. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The Gregorian repertoire as it is known today is largely the work of the Solesmes monks who, in the nineteenth century, collected, edited, and revitalized this body of music. Their efforts bear many traits of its time, including a subsequent Romantic reading of the repertoire as a whole, which this dissertation contends with. By using ethnographic fieldwork to observe chant performance in its modern context, I depart from the standard narrative and  discuss how Benedictine communities use music and ritual to reinforce and create their complex system of beliefs. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>While the ethnographic chapters look at many factors of musical performance, each is somewhat focused on a particular issue. Chapter 3 discusses how the monks at Solesmes use music as a vehicle for institutional traditions, and as a means of embodying completely their spiritual texts. Chapter 4 shows how the monks at St. Leo Abbey tear down cultural boundaries and draw outsiders into the mysteries of their faith through invitatory musical practices. As I discuss in that chapter, though, the lack of distinguished borders can be problematic when a community such as this is too easily moved by outside groups. Chapter 5 shows how the monks at Clear Creek Abbey use music as a means of exclusion and of strengthening the communitas of their monastic body. These three chapters draw on fieldwork I conducted at those monasteries, including interviews with monks and visitors and analysis of the rituals I observed. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The primary goal of this dissertation is to show how a repertoire regarded mostly for its historical presence is, in fact, rich with present-day meaning. Through ritual performance, monks recall the past while also integrating their lives and experiences into their stream of traditions. A secondary goal is to use this work as a pedagogical model for future scholars who may be similarly inspired to research taken for granted musical traditions.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to explore continuous and summative ratings of listener enjoyment across a variety of genres and to examine the roles of musical training and familiarity. A secondary purpose of the research was to explore possible relationships between musical training and enjoyment (preference) and estimations of excerpt duration. Specific research questions were 1) Does genre influence ratings of listener enjoyment? 2) Does genre influence initial listener response time? 3) Is there a difference between summative and continuous ratings of enjoyment based on genre? 4) Do patterns in the continuous rating of listening enjoyment emerge as a function of genre? 5) Does musical training influence preference ratings or response time? 6) Is there a relationship between familiarity and preference ratings or response time? 7) Does preference affect estimations of excerpt duration?</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Twelve musical excerpts were selected such that the genres of classical, popular, and world music were each represented by four unfamiliar and varied excerpts. Excerpts were edited to be 60 seconds in duration and were played for participants (N = 150) in a counterbalanced presentation order. Participants provided preference ratings using the Continuous Response Digital Interface in either a continuous or summative response condition. After each excerpt, participants provided a rating of their familiarity with the excerpt on a pencil-and-paper Likert-type scale and also provided a written estimate, in seconds, of each excerpt’s duration.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A mixed model analysis of variance revealed significant main effects for genre and major in preference ratings, as well as a significant interaction between genre and major. Participants most preferred the classical genre, followed by popular, and world music. Music majors also tended to rate excerpts significantly higher than nonmajors. The interaction occurred primarily in the popular music category, in which nonmajors rated the excerpts nearly as high as the majors. Majors also responded faster than nonmajors in the continuous response condition. Correlations between preference and familiarity were moderate and uniformly significant, whereas there appeared to be no association between familiarity and response times. Correlations between preference ratings and estimates of excerpt duration also indicated no association.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The present study is situated amongst a large body of research on music preference. While some findings support previous research, other findings raise more questions and encourage further exploration. Implications of current results and suggestions for future research are discussed.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This dissertation presents and evaluates the structure-sensitive optical and electronic properties of gold nanostructure systems: plasmonic gold nanoparticle networks and monolayer-protected gold nanoclsuters. Plasmonic nanoparticle assemblies were prepared using the iron(III) tetrakis(1-methyl-4-pyridyl)porphine (FeTMPyP) μ-oxo bridged dimer molecule as a nanoparticle linker. The adsorption orientation of the iron porphyrin and the resulting geometry of FeTMPyP bridged solid and hollow nanoparticle aggregates was studied using linear extinction and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) measurements.  For both the FeTMPyP-induced SGN and HGN structures, addition of FeTMPyP to nanoparticle solutions, caused a red shift of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) and the formation of a red-shifted coupled plasmon mode relative to the LSPR of the isolated system, indicating formation of aggregate structures. Along with UV-Vis-NIR extinction spectra, wavelength-dependent SERS studies of FeTMPyP further confirmed the orientation of the FeTMPyP dimer in the inter-particle gap of plasmonic nanoparticle aggregates.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>  The dielectric dependent excited state relaxation dynamics of iron (III) tetra-4-N-methylpyridylporphine molecule (FeTMPyP) was investigated in a series of solvents using steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopies. The linear absorption spectrum for FeTMPyP in water was dominated by a multi-component Soret band, corresponding to π → π* and charge-transfer (C-T) electronic transitions. The lower energy charge-transfer component was significantly influenced by the dielectric properties of the dispersing medium. Over the range of solvents used, the charge-transfer component shifted by 70 meV due to C-T stabilization when lower-dielectric solvents were used. Femtosecond time-resolved transient absorption measurements were carried out to determine the influence of dielectric environment on the electronic relaxation dynamics. A relaxation model, which involves 400 nm excitation, followed by femtosecond internal conversion, charge transfer and thermalization of the C-T state explains the excited state dynamics observed for FeTMPyP. The dielectric-dependent time constant, τ2, correlated linearly with the energy shift of the proposed charge-transfer state relative to the initially prepared state. The results from this study suggest that the charge-transfer transitions of this iron porphyrin can be used as a spectroscopic probe in order to extract environmental properties. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>   Studies on the electronic relaxation properties of molecule-stablized gold nanoclusters is presented. Polarization-resolved transient absorption (TA) measurement were employed to study the spin conversion dynamics in the Au25 nanocluster system. Using these methods, we have successfully detected spin relaxation dynamics and quantified picosecond lifetimes. Spin-sensitive transient absorption signal was only observed when pumping systems with open-shell character compared to the lack of spin dynamics observed when excitation occurred from closed shell HOMO states. Spin dynamics were only observed when pumping the open shell HOMO state of the neutral Au25 cluster. Due to splitting of the superatomic P orbitals, the anionic and cationic Au25 species represent closed shell systems, and we report no observed spin-sensitive dynamics in our experiments. The results here are consistent with the previously observed paramagnetism for the neutral Au25 nanocluster. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>   Ligand-induced modifications to the electronic relaxation dynamics of the Au102(SR)44, nanocluster were studied using femtosecond time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy. Time-resolved data revealed unique relaxation processes for the Au102 nanocluster depending on the thiol molecule used in the oligomeric units. Both Au102 nanocluster systems exhibit “molecule-like” dynamics, having no pulse energy dependent rates and a long-lived nanosecond relaxation component indicative of a significant energy gap. The solution-phase electronic relaxation for the organo-soluble Au102(SPh)44 system following 400-nm excitation proceeds by: (1) relaxation of the initially prepared excited state in 1.70 ± 0.10 ps, (2) vibrational cooling occurring with a lifetime of 7.60 ± 0.60 ps, and (3) low energy radiative decay on the timescale of nanoseconds. The relaxation dynamics obtained for the water soluble Au102(SPhCOOH)44   nanocluster, involved: (1) fast picosecond processes with lifetimes of 0.70 ± 0.10 ps and 2.80 ± 0.50 ps which corresponded to internal conversion from initially prepared excited states, (2) a relaxation component of 70.10 ± 4.30 ps that was assigned to intersystem crossing from the lowest triplet state to the ground state and (3) a longer time constant (&gt; 2 ns) attributed to low energy radiative decay.  The observed ligand-dependent relaxation rates of the Au102 nanocluster points to unique interactions occurring between the Au core and the ligand groups. Significant charge-transfer (C-T) interactions at the surface of ligand protected nanoclusters have been examined and were found to strongly influence the electronic relaxation properties of Au102 nanoclusters. A mechanism based on charge transfer can account for the ligand-dependent relaxation rates.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>With the recent advances in using nonlocal approaches to approximate traditional partial differential equations(PDEs), a number of new research avenues have been opened that warrant further study.  One such path, that has yet to be explored, is using reduced order techniques to solve nonlocal problems.  Due to the interactions between the discretized nodes or particles inherent to a nonlocal model, the system sparsity is often significantly less than its PDE counterpart.  Coupling a reduced order approach to a nonlocal problem would ideally reduce the computational cost without sacrificing accuracy.  This would allow for the use of a nonlocal approach in large parameter studies or uncertainty quantification.  Additionally, because nonlocal problems inherently have no spatial derivatives, solutions with jump discontinuities are permitted.  This work seeks to apply reduced order nonlocal concepts to a variety of problem situations including anomalous diffusion, advection, the advection-diffusion equation and solutions with spatial discontinuities.  The goal is to show that one can use an accurate reduced order approximation to formulate a solution at a fraction of the cost of traditional techniques.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>In my dissertation I evaluate perspectives of development participation in Foz do Iguaçu, Brazil. Using semi-structured interviews and Q methodology, I assess what priorities exist in Foz economic strategies, what groups are perceived to be over- and under-represented in local Foz politics, and what worldviews are prominent among stakeholders in Foz urban development. Brazil is a key example of a developing country whose regional and global roles differ. Within South and Latin America, Brazilian influence is often hegemonic and indicative of regional economic and political trends. At the global scale, Brazil’s hegemonic strength is less clear. Processes of urban development in Brazil intersect political, economic, and cultural questions from multiple scales (neighborhood, city, state, country etc.). Commonly visible in these processes are marginality and subalternity, expressions of inequality and subjugation to higher rule or authority. Within my project, I aim to measure perspectives on development among local stakeholders in order to test for populations and worldviews that are underrepresented in Brazilian development planning and decision-making. I use semi-structured interviews and archival research to explore the views of residents in Foz do Iguaçu, Brazil, and neighboring cities. These interview data are used to form statements for Q analysis in the same region. In the resulting analyses I find two areas of needed scholarly and policy attention: trans-border political participation and critical urban geopolitics. From my collected data, I argue that development politics require better understanding and implementation of integrative approaches, both demographically and ideologically. I also draw attention to the roles of researchers accessing such knowledge in foreign contexts, arguing that cross-cultural geographic study (particularly using Q methodology) can be a useful tool for reciprocative knowledge exchange.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Past research suggests that reading comprehension performance relies not solely on cognitive skills such as decoding, vocabulary, and inference skills, but also on attention and behavior. Specifically, the literature has pointed to attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and test anxiety as possible influences on reading comprehension test performance. Previous work has examined the individual effects of ADHD and test anxiety on reading comprehension test performance. However, there is little research investigating their joint effects on reading comprehension test performance. The proposed study will attempt to answer three questions through a series of structural equation models (SEM). First, do ADHD and test anxiety affect reading comprehension test performance?  Second, if so, are these effects independent or redundant? Third, in addition to their main effects, do test anxiety and ADHD interact in affecting reading comprehension test performance? Taken together, these results will inform researchers on the effects of ADHD and test anxiety about reading comprehension test performance.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This treatise examines how John Barrows helped contribute to the expansion of the horn repertoire.  Barrows accomplished this in several ways.  First, he had a very close relationship with composer Alec Wilder.  Wilder wrote several pieces for solo horn and piano, each of these for John Barrows.  An in-depth look at Barrows’s playing style reveals that it is complimentary of Alec Wilder’s compositional style for the horn.  Second, Barrows was an active chamber musician.  During his time with the New York Woodwind Quintet, Barrows premiered roughly twenty new works for woodwind quintet and Barrows was instrumental in the creation of Barber’s Summer Music.   The relationship between Barrows and Alec Wilder also brought many new pieces to the chamber horn repertoire, including works for the tuba, horn, and piano, which were the first pieces written for this ensemble.  Finally, Barrows himself was also a composer and two of his pieces for younger horn players are published as well as a woodwind quintet and a horn trio.  A collection of his unpublished works is held in the Mills Music Library at the University of Madison-Wisconsin.  Through Barrows’s efforts, the amount of works for solo horn and for horn in the chamber setting increased substantially.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The M2 proton channel from Influenza A is an established drug target, with multiple functions during the viral lifecycle.  Amino acid mutations, in the residues lining the channel pore, have rendered M2 resistant to previously licensed inhibitors.  Given the propensity for genetic reassortment of Influenza A and history of pandemics due to emergence of novel human strains, M2 has been subject of numerous structural characterization efforts.  Attempts at rational drug design targeting M2 proton channel have been impeded by the limited number of experimental techniques having capabilities for elucidating atomic level interactions of the protein-ligand complexes in the native-like membrane mimetic environment.  Solid state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (ssNMR) is a technique that has all of these capabilities for structural characterization of membrane protein drug targets in lipid bilayers.  Coupling ssNMR with Computer Aided Drug Discovery (CADD) is the precise approach needed to decrease time and resources required to generate novel therapeutics.  Here, we present a first structural characterization of the full length wild type M2 channel in complex with inhibitor, and of the S31N mutant in the apo and drug-bound state.  Through the use of diverse ssNMR experiments we tested stereoselectivity of drug binding in the channel pore, structural changes due to mutation, and characterized novel inhibitor interactions.  Molecular dynamic simulations were performed by our collaborators and were in good agreement with our experimental findings. Together these results deepen our understanding of the atomic level interactions stabilizing wild type inhibitors in the channel pore, and structural changes in the mutant leading to loss of compound efficacy.  Most importantly, specific interaction described herein are essential for successful outcomes from structure based CADD and be used in future computational efforts.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation examined the relationship between Asian international doctoral students’ self-regulation on academic and social integration and explored how acculturation tendencies function as a mediator between self-regulated learning and academic and social integration.  Previous research has indicated that self-regulated learning has a great influence on students’ learning.  Little research, however, has been undertaken directly regarding international students or doctoral students.  Despite the fact that the number of international students has increased annually, there has been little research focused on how acculturation tendencies can influence the learning process, especially for Asian students.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The framework of this study integrated self-regulated learning theory, acculturation, and academic and social integration perspectives to explore the relationships among Asian international doctoral students’ learning experiences.  It was proposed that students’ self-regulated learning relates to their academic and social integration and that acculturation mediates between self-regulated learning and academic and social integration.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation adopted a sequential explanatory mixed methodology, using an online survey to collect quantitative data in the first phase with follow-up interviews to collect qualitative data at the second phase.  The researcher-developed survey, the Asian Doctoral Students’ Self-Regulated Learning Survey, was created to gauge the participants’ self-regulation, acculturation tendencies, and academic and social integration within their doctoral programs.  A pilot study was conducted.  There were 435 doctoral students who participated in the first formal survey phase followed by 12 interviewees with different acculturation tendencies in the second phase.  After the data were collected, mediation tests and multiple regressions were used to examine the relationships between self-regulated learning, acculturation, and academic and social integration.  A cross-case analysis was also employed to compare commonalities and differences in learning difficulties and strategies among acculturation tendencies in order to mobilize case knowledge for broader educational applications.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Findings from this study showed that Asian international doctoral students’ self-regulated learning related to their academic and social integration, but acculturation tendencies served as a mediator between self-regulated learning and academic and social integration.  Students with different acculturation tendencies provided valuable accounts of their challenges and strategies during their time in the United States.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Findings from this research help clarify today’s Asian doctoral students’ learning experiences in the United States.  This is an important contribution to the existing literature about self-regulated learning, acculturation, and doctoral students’ academic and social integration.  Educators, policy makers, international centers, and higher education personnel can better understand the international student population and develop effective programs and policies to maximize international students’ impact and improve their integration in their doctoral programs and institutions.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Microwaves have been for their ability to heat water and food rapidly. And thanks to scientific technology and global marketing, the microwave oven was invented and got widely used in 1970’s and 1980’s. . Microwave radiation has specific characteristics: is an electromagnetic waves that contains an electric magnetic component. As electromagnetic radiation, it can move in the vacuum as light speed, it has no mass, and cannot colide with each other; the most important property of microwave is it can generate energy. Recently more and more scientsts are using microwave machines as heating sources due to its high efficient in heating solutions. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Claisen rearrangements are long-established, well-understood reactions that have proved highly utilitarian in the area of synthetic organic chemistry. In particular, the Claisen and related Cope rearrangements provide a stereo-specific method of carbon-carbon bond formation through a concerted [3,3]-sigmatropic shift. In this study, this reaction is chosen to show the microwave enhancement in heterogeneous catalysis and chaperone effect. The constant temperature reaction method is used in the microwave reactions that helps to compare to the thermal reactions with the corresponding temperature. In chaperone reactions, constant power is used based on its high effect on microwave radiation absorption and the temperature stablization.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The nonlocal models considered are free of spatial derivatives and thus are suitable for modeling problems with solutions exhibiting defects such as fractures in solids.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Those models feature a horizon parameter that specifies the maximum extent of nonlocal interactions. A multiscale finite element implementation in one dimension and two dimensions of the nonlocal models is developed by taking advantage of the proven fact that, for smooth solutions, the nonlocal models reduce, as the horizon parameter tends to zero, to well-known local partial differential equations models. The implementation features adaptive abrupt mesh refinement based on the detection of defects and resulting in an abrupt transition between refined elements that contain defects and unrefined elements that do not do so. Additional difficulties encountered in the implementation that are overcome are the design of accurate quadrature rules for stiffness matrix construction that are valid for any combination of the grid size and horizon parameter. As a result, the methodology developed can attain optimal accuracy at very modest additional costs relative to situations for which the solution is smooth. Portions of the methodology can also be used for the optimal approximation, by piecewise linear polynomials, of given functions containing discontinuities. Several numerical examples are provided to illustrate the efficacy of the multiscale methodology.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The dissertation reports a series of hydrological studies that relates to seawater intrusion in a karst aquifer. In the Woodville Karst Plan (WKP), karst conduit system is well developed and directly open to the Gulf of Mexico that allows seawater intrudes into the aquifer. The Spring Creek Springs Complex and Wakulla Spring, located in a marine estuary and 11 miles inland, respectively, are the two major groundwater discharge spots and connected through subsurface conduit network in the Woodville Karst Plain (WKP), North Florida, USA. Investigation of seawater intrusion in the Woodville Karst Plain is the objective and motivation of this dissertation work.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Potential evidence of the longest documented seawater intrusion through conduit network in the Woodville Karst Plain (WKP) is found by the data analysis of electrical conductivity and chemical measurements. Five periods of increased electrical conductivity have been observed in the karst conduits supplying water at Wakulla Spring, one of Florida’s largest first magnitude springs. A composite analysis of rainfall, electrical conductivity and geochemical data provides strong evidence that the increases in conductivity are directly tied to saltwater intrusion occurring at the Spring Creek Springs through the conduit network. This interpretation is supported by the conceptual model established by prior researchers, and represents the first and longest documented case of saltwater intrusion through conduit network in the WKP.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Several numerical models are able to simulate the density-dependent seawater intrusion issue. On the other hand, discrete-continuum numerical models are designed to simulate groundwater flow and solute transport in a dual-permeability karst aquifer. However, none of the pre-existed code or model is able to deal with the two issues together. Therefore, a hybrid discrete-continuum numerical model of Variable-Density Flow and Solute Transport - Conduit Flow Process (VDFST-CFP) is developed as a new modeling method that provides more accurate simulation of seawater intrusion in a coastal karst aquifer with conduit network. Darcy-Weisbach equation is applied to simulate non-laminar groundwater flow in the conduit system. Density-dependent groundwater flow with appropriate density terms in both the conduit and porous media systems are analytically derived, then coupled with transport equations and solved numerically using finite difference method with an implicit iteration procedure. Two synthetic two-dimensional cases are developed to validate the newly developed VDFST-CFP model by comparing with other numerical models. The VDFST-CFP model improves simulations of density-dependent seawater/freshwater mixing processes and exchanges between the two domains. In comparison with the discrete-continuum models, Darcy equation of the continuum numerical models overestimates the flow rate but the VDFST-CFP is accurate under turbulent flow condition. The pros and cons of model uncertainties, assumptions, conceptual simplifications and numerical techniques of the VDFST-CFP are discussed.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Several studies of numerical modeling have been done as an important method to evaluate seawater intrusion in coastal karst aquifers with conduit network, since field observations are usually insufficient. A regional groundwater flow cycling numerical model is developed to provide a general understanding of the flow regime that controlled by seawater/freshwater interaction in the WKP, using a discrete-continuum CFPv2 model. Non-laminar flows in conduits and flow exchange between the two domains are coupled in the hybrid numerical model. The time-variable salinity and equivalent freshwater head at the submarine spring have significant impacts on seawater/freshwater interaction and discharges of springs. Simulated results match well to measurements with correlation coefficients 0.891 and 0.866 at Spring Creeks Springs and Wakulla Springs, respectively. The impacts of sea level rise on regional groundwater flow field and the relationship between the two springs are evaluated as well by the numerical model.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The controlling factors of seawater intrusion in a dual-permeability are evaluated by local and global parameter sensitivity analysis with a two-dimensional SEAWAT model, which also estimates the extents of seawater intrusion in the WKP. The local sensitivity study indicates the salinity at the submarine spring is the most parameter to simulations in both the conduit and porous medium, which are effective to all parameters near the mixing zone. The results of global sensitivity analysis exhibit similar pattern with the local study but are different for some parameters due to their non-linear relationship to the simulations. Simulations in the porous medium are sensitive to not only matrix parameters but also conduit conditions because of the conduit-matrix interaction. Dispersivity is important in a homogeneous porous medium model but is no longer significant in an advection-dominated karst system. The effects of the identified important parameters on the extents of seawater intrusion are quantitatively evaluated by examining the variation of salinity at the submarine spring with rainfall recharge, sea level rise and longer simulation time under an extended low rainfall period.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems have been studied by engineers and researchers for years [1-7], yet the applications of Triboluminescence (TL)-based SHM system for aerospace and civil structures are to a degree unexplored. Carbon fiber reinforced polymers composites (CFRP composites) have been increasingly applied in structure manufacturing due to their extraordinary mechanical properties. To realize the in-situ monitoring and minimize the effects of embedding damage sensors into CFRP composites, TL crystals and carbon materials were used. Therefore, in this study, TL crystals (ZnS:Mn) acted as damage indicators, and solid-state all carbon photovoltaic sensors can form a sensory network to detect TL light and identify the damage/defects.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Photovoltaic (PV) sensors introduced in this study focuses on using micro-sensor devices within the composite materials SHM system, which also explores the utilization of TL materials in these advanced materials systems. The conception of this 3D sensing system will be brought up in the first two chapters. The methods of fabricating different kinds of photovoltaic (PV) intrinsic sensors are described later in detail. The experimental results will focus on the effects of cell thickness, counter electrode (CE) type, and cell length on the cell light/electricity conversion efficiency. In the last part of research work, PV sensors have been tested under various light wavelengths using LEDs and TL crystals. Applications in industrial areas and future prospects will be discussed in the last chapter.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study explores extreme surface temperature events in Southern Hemisphere winter (June – August) from 1979 to 2011 and their relation with meridional mass circulation by using daily ERA-interim Re-Analysis data from European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Meridional mass circulation indices are developed to quantitatively represent the warm air mass being transported into the polar region in the upper atmosphere and the cold air mass being transported out of the polar region in the lower atmosphere. Our results show that weaker poleward warm air mass transport aloft is associated with weaker cold air transport toward equator in the lower troposphere, resulting in cold air being confined in the polar regions. Similarly, stronger poleward warm air mass transport in the upper atmosphere is related to stronger cold air transport out of the polar regions, causing enormous cold air outbreaks in the mid-latitude regions.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We find that regions to the south of 45S exhibit a robust relationship between surface air temperature anomalies and meridional mass circulation. Weaker circulation is associated with abnormally cold in Antarctica and abnormally warm in regions from 45S to 60S. Conversely, stronger circulation is related to anomalously warm in Antarctica and anomalously cold in the surrounding continental shelf, particularly over Weddell-Scotia Sea and north Ross Sea where are the two preferred routes for cold air coming out of Antarctica. On the other hand, temperature anomalies over the regions north of 45S are not sensitive to the meridional circulation variability. The fact that surface air temperature anomalies over the Southern Ocean rarely exceed 4C suggests that cold air coming out of Antarctic has limited impacts on the Southern Ocean due to its large thermal inertia. In summary, the meridional mass circulation indices provide a robust diagnostics for extreme cold events in 45S - 90S domain very well, but may not be adequate to describe all cold events over the vast mid-latitude regions in the Southern Hemisphere.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>With the advancement information and communication technologies, networked computing devices have been adopted to address real-world challenges due to their eﬃciency and programmability while maintaining scalability, sustainability, and resilience. As a result, computing and communication technologies have been integrated into critical infrastructures and other physical processes. Cyber physical systems (CPS) integrate computation and physical processes of critical infrastructure systems. Historically, these systems mostly relied on proprietary technologies and were built as stand-alone systems in physically secure locations. However, the situation has changed considerably in recent years. Commodity hardware, software, and standardized communication technologies are used in CPS to enhance their connectivity, provide better accessibility to costumers and maintenance personnel, and improve overall eﬃciency and robustness of their operations. Unfortunately, increased connectivity, eﬃciency, and openness have also signiﬁcantly increased vulnerabilities of CPS to cyber attacks. These vulnerabilities could allow attackers to alter the systems’ behavior and cause irreversible physical damage, or even worse cyber-induced disasters. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>However, existing security measures cannot be eﬀectively applied to CPS directly because they are mostly for cyber only systems. Thus, new approaches to preventing cyber physical system disasters are essential. We recognize very diﬀerent characteristics of cyber and physical components in CPS, where cyber components are ﬂexible with large attack surfaces while physical components are inﬂexible and relatively simple with very small attack surfaces. This research focuses on the components where cyber and physical components interact. Securing cyber-physical interfaces will complete a layer-based defense strategy in the “Defense in Depth Framework”. In this research we propose Trusted Security Modules (TSM) as a systematic solution to provide a guarantee to prevent cyber-induced physical damage even when operating systems and controllers are compromised. TSMs will be placed at the interface between cyber and physical components by adapting the existing integrity enforcing mechanisms such as Trusted Platform Module (static integrity), Control-Flow Integrity (dynamic integrity) to enhance its own security and integrity. Through this dissertation we introduce the general design and number of ways to implement the TSM. We also show the behaviors of TSM with a working prototype and simulation.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>DIF detection methods identify the difference between the performances of subgroups when the subgroups are matched by examinees’ ability level or a proxy variable, such as total test score (Holland &amp; Wainer, 1993). Log-linear Models (LLM) method is one of the DIF detection methods. This method was first introduced by Mellenbergh (1982) to investigate the relationship among item responses, subgroups, and categorized total test score in terms of DIF detection. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study examined the performance of LLM as a DIF detection method for dichotomous items and polytomous items. LLM method was compared with Mantel-Haenszsel (MH) and logistic regression (LR) methods to detect uniform DIF and with LR to detect non-uniform DIF in dichotomous item response data. MH was not included in non-uniform DIF detection, because, the previous studies indicated that it is not able to detect non-uniform DIF (Narayanon &amp; Swaminathan, 1996; Uttaro &amp; Milsap, 1994). In addition, LLM was compared with Mantel, generalized Mantel-Haenszsel (GMH), ordinal logistic regression (OLR), logistic discriminate function analysis (LDFA) methods in polytomous item response data. For this purpose, both simulation study and empirical study were conducted under various sample sizes, ability mean differences (impact) and item parameters. Since the previous studies did not investigate the effect of ability mean differences on DIF detection with LLM, this study also focused on the effect of ability mean differences between subgroups. This study found that MH was better to detect uniform DIF when LR and LLM indicated equally well performance on uniform and non-uniform DIF detection. In Addition, GMH and LLM performed better than Mantel, OLR, and LDFA for the polytomous item response data.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The work in this dissertation presents methods for study of glucose stimulated insulin secretion as well as other hormones involved in glucose homeostasis.  A microfluidic system was developed to investigate the entrainment of insulin secretion from islets of Langerhans to oscillatory glucose levels. A gravity-driven perfusion system was integrated with a microfluidic system to deliver sinusoidal glucose waveforms to the islet chamber.  Insulin levels in the perfusate were measured using an online competitive electrophoretic immunoassay with a sampling period of 10 s. The insulin immunoassay had a detection limit of 3 nM with RSDs of calibration points ranging from 2–8%.  At 11 mM glucose, insulin secretion from single islets was oscillatory with a period ranging from 3–6 min.  Application of a small amplitude sinusoidal wave of glucose with a period of 5 or 10 min, shifted the period of the insulin oscillations to this forcing period.  Exposing groups of 6–10 islets to a sinusoidal glucose wave synchronized their behavior, producing a coherent pulsatile insulin response from the population.  These results demonstrate the feasibility of the developed system for the study of oscillatory insulin secretion. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A dual detection microscopy system was developed to simultaneously image intracellular messengers and monitor insulin secretion from islets of Langerhans.  Glucose stimulated insulin secretion plays a critical role in glucose homeostasis, but the underlying mechanism is still unclear.  To develop an automated system to simultaneously study the correlation between intracellular events and insulin secretion, fluorescence imaging and laser induced fluorescence detection for insulin immunoassay were integrated into a single microscopy system.  Intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) was used as a representative secondary messenger and studied with insulin secretion from islets during exposure to constant and oscillatory glucose levels.  Both of [Ca2+]i and insulin were oscillatory during constant glucose levels and entrained to a small amplitude sinusoidal wave of glucose (0.5 – 2 mM).  [Ca2+]i and insulin oscillations were temporally but not necessarily quantitatively correlated.  Oscillatory glucose waveforms amplified insulin oscillation amplitude without further increasing [Ca2+]i, which could be related to amplifying pathway.  The developed system was also applied to study the effect of glucokinase activator 22 on [Ca2+]i and insulin secretion.  These results indicated the robustness of the developed method, which can be potentially expanded to include other intracellular messengers to study the mechanism of glucose stimulated insulin secretion.   </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A method was developed that allowed simultaneous monitoring of the acute secretory dynamics of insulin and islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) from islets of Langerhans using a microfluidic system with two-color detection.  A flow-switching feature enabled changes in the perfusion media within 5 s, allowing rapid exchange of constant glucose concentrations delivered to groups of islets.  The perfusate was continuously sampled by electroosmotic flow and mixed online with Cy5-labeled insulin, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled IAPP, anti-insulin, and anti-IAPP antibodies in an 8.15 cm mixing channel maintained at 37 °C.  The immunoassay mixture was injected for 0.3 s onto a 1.5 cm separation channel at 11.75 s intervals and immunoassay reagents detected using 488 and 635 nm lasers with two independent photomultiplier tubes for detection of the FITC and Cy5 signal.  RSD of the bound-to-free immunoassay ratios ranged from 2 to 7% with LODs of 20 nM for insulin and 1 nM for IAPP.  Simultaneous secretion profiles of the two peptides were monitored from groups of 4−10 islets during multiple step changes in glucose concentration.  Insulin and IAPP were secreted in an approximately 10:1 ratio and displayed similar responses to step changes from 3 to 11 or 20 mM glucose.  The ability to monitor the secretory dynamics of multiple peptides from islets of Langerhans in a highly automated fashion is expected to be a useful tool for investigating hormonal regulation of glucose homeostasis.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The ability to detect picomolar concentrations of glucagon and amylin using fluorescently labeled mirror image aptamers, so-called Spiegelmers, is demonstrated.  Using Spiegelmers as affinity probes, noncompetitive capillary electrophoresis affinity assays of glucagon and murine amylin were developed and optimized.  The detection limit for glucagon was 6 pM and for amylin was 40 pM.  Glucagon-like peptide-1 and -2 did not interfere with the glucagon assay, while the amylin assay showed cross-reactivity to calcitonin gene related peptide.  The developed assays were combined with a competitive immunoassay for insulin to measure glucagon, amylin, and insulin secretion from batches of islets after incubation with different glucose concentrations.  The development of these assays is an important step towards incorporation into an online measurement system for monitoring dynamic secretion from single islets.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Big data has brought both opportunities and challenges to our research community. Complex models can be built with large volumes of data researchers have never had access before. In this study we explore the structure learning of Bayesian network (BN) and its application to reverse engineering of gene regulatory networks (GRNs). A Bayesian network is a graphical representation of a joint distribution that encodes the conditional dependencies and independencies among the variables. We proposed a novel three-stage BN structure learning method, called GRASP (GRowth-based Approach with Staged Pruning). In the first stage, a new skeleton (undirected edges) discovery method, double filtering (DF), was designed. Compared to existing methods, DF requires smaller sample sizes to achieve similar statistical power. Based on the skeleton estimated in the first step, we proposed a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) method to sample the edges and their directions to optimize a BIC-based score. SMC method has less tendency to be trapped in local optima, and the computation is easily parallelizable. On the third stage, we reclaim the edges that may be missed from previous stages. We obtained satisfactory results from simulation study and applied the method to infer GRNs from real experimental data.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The underlying physics and spin dynamics that govern magnetic molecules yield ideal behavior for their potential use as qubits in a quantum computer. To characterize the spin dynamics of these magnetic molecules, electron spin resonance (ESR) techniques are often used. In this study, a method in which the use of superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) and vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) technologies can be combined with traditional ESR measurements is explored. This was achieved by modification of a commercial sample probe such that microwaves can effectively reach the sample under study. Additionally, the ability to tune the coupling parameter of a superconducting cavity is achieved through the use of temperature and magnetic field. This is of particular importance in on-chip ESR measurements and can be described by the losses in the device. This investigation describes a versatile setup which can be used to study a variety of magnetic molecules in multiple temperature regimes.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The age of big data has re-invited much interest in dimension reduction. How to cope with high-dimensional data remains a difficult problem in statistical learning. In this study, we consider the task of dimension reduction---projecting data into a lower-rank subspace while preserving maximal information. We investigate the pitfalls of classical PCA, and propose a set of algorithm that functions under high dimension, extends to all exponential family distributions, performs feature selection at the mean time, and takes missing value into consideration. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Based upon the best performing one, we develop the SG-PCA algorithm. With acceleration techniques and a progressive screening scheme, it demonstrates superior scalability and accuracy compared to existing methods. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Concerned with the independence assumption of dimension reduction techniques, we propose a novel framework, the Generalized Indirect Dependency Learning (GIDL), to learn and incorporate association structure in multivariate statistical analysis. Without constraints on the particular distribution of the data, GIDL takes any pre-specified smooth loss function and is able to both extract and infuse its association into the regression, classification or dimension reduction problem. Experiments at the end serve to demonstrate its efficacy.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Liver fibrosis is the common end stage of all chronic liver diseases, such as chronic viral hepatitis, alcoholism, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, autoimmune hepatitis, alpha 1 anti-trypsin deficiency and some rare metabolic diseases. Fibrosis it is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. However, the specific and efficient anti-fibrotic therapy is still lacking. Thus, better understanding the underlying mechanism of liver fibrosis is critical in order to find a cure.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Liver fibrosis is histologically characterized by excessive deposition of extracellular matrix composed primarily of type I collagen. Type I collagen is a complex protein composed by folding by two α1(I) and one α2(I) polypeptides into triple helix. The production of collagen polypeptides is regulated by the cis-acting sequence of their respective mRNAs, the 5’ stem loop (5’SL). In the 5’ untranslated region of collagen α1(I) and α2(I) mRNAs, there is a secondary structure forming a stem loop (5’SL). This cis-acting element regulates type I collagen expression in fibrosis by binding an RNA binding protein, La ribonucleoprotein domain family, member 6 (LARP6). LARP6 specifically binds to 5’SL of collagen mRNAs with high affinity and sequence specificity. The binding recruits several effector proteins to stimulate type I collagen production in fibrosis. LARP6 is a phosphor-protein, however, how the phosphorylation of LARP6 is involved in the process of collagen biosynthesis has not been studied before.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>My dissertation focuses on the role of LARP6 phosphorylation in biosynthesis of type I collagen in fibrosis. I have identified eight serines of LARP6 that undergo phosphorylation and six of these serines have never been reported to be phosphorylated before. I have characterized the functional consequence of phosphorylation of these serines, identified the responsible kinases, and analyzed the role in collagen biosynthesis. These studies are presented in the dissertation as three logically connected chapters.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the chapter two provide evidence that phosphorylation of LARP6 follows a hierarchical order; namely, that phosphorylation of S451 is the initial event, which is required for phosphorylations of other serines. Phosphorylation of S451depends on the activity of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Akt inhibitor, GSK-2141795, which is in clinical trials for treatment of solid tumors, reduced collagen production with EC50 of 150 nM. This effect is explained by inhibition of LARP6 phosphorylation and suggests that Akt inhibitors may be effective in treatment of</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>xi</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>various forms of fibrosis. The S451A mutant of LARP6 lacks phosphorylation, not only at 451 position, but also at several other serines. Its overexpression has a dominant negative effect on collagen biosynthesis; the S451A mutant drastically reduces secretion of type I collagen and induces synthesis of aberrant and over-modified collagen polypeptides. This indicates that LARP6 phosphorylation at S451 is critical for activation of the protein in translation and folding of collagen polypeptides.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the chapter three I have characterized two other phosphorylations of LARP6, the phosphorylation of S348 and S409. These sites are phosphorylated by mTORC1 and are redundant. Mutation of both of these serines is required to inactivate LARP6. The double mutant, S348A/S409A, acts as a dominant negative protein in collagen biosynthesis, which retards secretion of type I collagen and causes excessive posttranslational modifications. Similar effects are seen using mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin or by knocking down mTORC1 function by siRNA. The phosphorylation of S348A or S409A is needed for two processes: 1. To recruit an accessory protein STRAP to collagen mRNAs and 2. To enable normal subcellular trafficking of LARP6. STRAP is needed to coordinate translation of collagen α1(I) and α2(I) mRNAs, what becomes critical in fibrosis. In the absence of S348/S409 phosphorylation LARP6 is also sequestered in increasing amounts at the ER membrane. The mechanistic details and significance of the S348/S409 phosphorylation are described in chapter 2.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The role of TGF-β1 in LARP6 phosphorylation is described in the fourth chapter. TGF-β is the most potent profibrotic cytokine and this discovery provides the link between the TGF-β activity and the LARP6 dependent mechanism of collagen synthesis. The phosphorylation of LARP6 at S396 is stimulated by TGF-β and it promotes the distribution of LARP6 into the nucleus. This is necessary for binding of the newly transcribed collagen mRNAs and their inclusion in the LARP6 dependent metabolic pathway, resulting in more efficient type I collagen expression.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In conclusion, my dissertation work has characterized different phosphorylation events of LARP6 and how they are involved in regulating the function of LARP6 in type I collagen biosynthesis. These findings will contribute to better understanding of the underlying mechanism of overproduction of type I collagen in fibrosis, and provide the rationale of using kinase inhibitors for treating fibrotic disorders.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Motivated by understanding the devastating financial crisis in 2008 that was partially caused by underestimation of financial risk, we propose a class of time-varying mixture models for risk analysis and management. There are various metrics for financial risk including value at risk (VaR), expected shortfall, expected / unexpected loss, etc. In this study we focus on VaR and one commonly used method to estimate VaR is the Variance-Covariance method, in which normal distribution is usually assumed for asset returns that may underestimate the real risk. To address this issue, in this study</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>we propose a series of two-component mixture models - one component is normal distribution and the other is a fat-tailed distribution such as Cauchy distribution, student's t-distribution or Gumbel distribution. Instead of assuming distribution parameters and weights to be constant, we allow them to change over time which guarantees </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>exibility of our models. Monte Carlo Expectation-Maximization method and Monte Carlo maximum likelihood estimation were used for parameter estimation. Simulation studies are conducted and the models are applied in stock market price data.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Migraine affects approximately 38 million people in the United States, and is the 8th most disabling condition in the world. Though several hypotheses implicate neuronal and trigeminovascular involvement with migraine onset and progression, an exact pathophysiological change is yet to be identified that can explain the onset, progression and termination of migraines. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The brain allocates over 50% of its energy reserves on a cellular basis to the regulation of sodium (23Na) concentration; therefore, any alterations of 23Na concentrations and fluxes related to these distributions are critical and have potential implications for migraine. Biochemical imbalances resulting from Ca2+ and 23Na have been identified in the lumbar CSF of chronic migraineurs with the onset and progression of migraine, along with mutations in the 23Na and Ca2+ channels in the rare familial hemiplegic gene in migraineurs. In adddition, there is a lack of identification and/or characterization of metabolic markers in acute migraine. It thus follows that identification of specific acute metabolic changes, potentially influenced by excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters or ionic fluxes, may improve understanding of the onset and progression of migraine. High field MR imaging and spectroscopy provide the unique opportunity to interrogate metabolites dynamically and in vivo. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The first objective of this study was to evaluate in vivo 23Na fluxes in the brain using rat models with the onset and progression of migraine. Ultra-high field of 21.1 T was employed to provide the sensitivity and resolution to evaluate in vivo alterations in bulk sodium induced by migraine in a rodent model. 3D 23Na scans were acquired for the whole brain, followed by rigorous segmentation, to localize sodium changes in the brain. The second objective of this study was to evaluate the biochemical and metabolic imbalances that are evident in acute migraine and may be indicative of a collection of dysfunctional pathways that are specific to migraineurs. Again, in vivo MR spectroscopy was performed at 21.1 T to obtain the sensitivity and specificity necessary to identify potential biomarkers of dysfunction.   </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Accordingly, all scans were performed using the 21.1-T, 900-MHz ultra-widebore at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, Tallahassee, FL. Animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Florida State University and the Huntington Medical Research Institutes (HMRI) in Pasadena, CA.  While in the magnet and following preparatory scans, data were acquired from Sprague-Dawley rats that were subjected to an in situ intraperitoneal injection of nitroglycerin to induce migraine. Baseline data prior to injection and time course following injection for up to three hours were acquired to map both sodium and metabolic changes.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>As demonstrated by 23Na MRI, significant brainstem activation was observed with migraine onset and progression in the migraine induced groups compared to the control groups. Statistical significance also was evident for Taurine, total Creatine and Lactate with elevations in glycine levels for the acute migraine models compared to the control groups indicative of an impaired metabolic system as well as neuroprotective action. The ramifications of these findings and potential pathways for their action are discussed.</DISS_para>
