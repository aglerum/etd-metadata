         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Computer-based simulations are commonly used to train students when it is exceptionally expensive or very unsafe to practice the skill in the actual situation. Despite the promise of simulative environments, there is an inadequacy in the learning and retention of learned concepts. This study examined the effects of variability of practice provided via contextual interference and cognitive flexibility on learner’s learning and retention of the knowledge in the simulative environment.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	To study the effects in this context, two different types of interference conditions were presented to the learners; block interference and random interference. Both the block and random contextual interference groups troubleshoot 8 defects in a chemical simulation, PC Distiller, an alcohol water distillery.  For the block interference, all the four sets of one component were performed before the faults on second component sets were introduced, while random orders of the tasks were used in the random interference.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Forty nine freshman engineering students participated in the study. Participants were randomly assigned to the interference conditions: block and random. Participants were also required to complete a cognitive flexibility test to measure the shift of attention, and were measured via Wisconsin Card Sorting Test.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The results showed a significant difference in the learning performance and retention performance of the random interference group. Although, learners in the random interference group scored higher in the retention task, there was no significant difference between the two interference groups on learning and retention. Cognitive flexibility was also found to be having little predictive power of the outcome variable, learning performance and retention performance. 	However time spent by the learners in troubleshooting a task had a significant main effect on the learning performance and retention of knowledge. Time on task was negatively related to the scores in the learning performance and retention. Learners from both the block and random interference groups, who took less time to solve the problems scored better. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The findings of this study have several implications for further research. Future studies might focus on learners experience and prior knowledge and use a sample for comparing the experts with the novice learners. In order to raise and produce better results on the learning tasks any information on participant’s motivation could help in situating the learning task in the simulated environment. One key implication for instruction is the usefulness of the random interference condition in improving retention of knowledge which is also supported by the literature. Research considering these implications will provide educators to optimally use the simulative technology in learning and instruction.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The limitations of the study focus on the time and financial constraints, type of instructional material and learner’s motivation. These factors should be considered by other researchers in this field who wish to improve learning in the simulated environment.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation examines the relationship between the presence of international investors and firm success. The first chapter of my dissertation examines the relationship between international venture capital investors and private firm success spanning 81 countries over the years 1995-2010. The data examined indicate that, relative to deals in which the investor base is purely domestic, private firms that have an international investor base have a higher probability of exiting via an initial public offering (IPO) and higher IPO proceeds. The evidence is consistent with the view that while the benefits of internationalization may be difficult and costly to manage, for those firms that succeed in managing cross-border coordination costs, there is potential value for an IPO firm. The benefits relative to the costs of internationalizing the investor base for private firms sold in acquisitions, by contrast, are much less pronounced. The second chapter of my dissertation analyzes a firm’s decision to issue new equity internationally. Though over eight percent of firms conducting an IPO between 1995 and 2010 choose to conduct foreign IPO, in which the firm issues only abroad, this form of IPO fails to raise significantly more proceeds net of costs than matched IPOs with similar firm characteristics. On the median, foreign IPO firms forego proceeds equal to $ 1.58 million, approximately 4.7% of the value of their total assets or 5% of their total net IPO proceeds. As firms select whether they will issue equity at home, abroad, or both, this result is surprising. We are unable to explain the difference in proceeds using any indirect costs or benefits of international issuances discussed in the literature or several additional hypotheses we propose - that firms may be attempting to take advantage of hotter IPO markets, lower indirect costs, a better legal environment, or the ability to issue subsequent SEOs. As we are unable to explain the difference in proceeds, this constitutes the Foreign IPO Puzzle.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>In the inchoate field of comparative genocide studies, religion and sexual violence remain largely understudied. Using typologies as an investigative tool, this study examines the 1995 Bosnian and 1994 Rwandan genocides as case studies. It will be argued that religion--in its expression and institutionalized form--potentiates genocidal violence in significant ways, and that the mutually reinforcing concepts of "othering," justification, and authorization are ideal types for teasing out the nexuses of the culture-specific logic of religion and the phenomenon of genocide. Moreover, rape and other forms of sexual violence were recently construed as "weapons of war," and four proposed genocidal rape types that align with the 1948 Genocide Convention demonstrate how this weapon furthers genocidal aims. Ultimately, it will be concluded that the comparative study of the religious and sexual facets of genocide--including the religious inflections of sexual violence--deepen our understanding of the dynamics of genocide, open up new lines of inquiry into genocide studies, and contribute to genocide prevention and prosecution efforts.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to investigate the shared and unique contributions of three metalinguistic skills to the word reading and reading comprehension abilities of Adult Basic Education (ABE) students.  Across studies, the metalinguistic skills of phonological awareness, morphological awareness, and orthographic knowledge have emerged individually as important predictors of ABE students’ word reading and reading comprehension skills.  In contrast to the children’s literature, no studies have simultaneously included and considered the shared and unique predictive utility of all three metalinguistic skills to reading skills in ABE students.  In addition, the study examined whether the relations of the three metalinguistic skills to reading comprehension were mediated by decoding and vocabulary knowledge.  Jointly, the best fitting models indicated that the predictors accounted for 64% of the word reading variance and 91% of the reading comprehension variance.  The metalinguistic skills did not emerge as uniquely predictive of word reading or reading comprehension skills; however, all three metalinguistic skills were significantly, indirectly related to reading comprehension via decoding and vocabulary knowledge as mediators.  These results help to develop a more comprehensive model of the underlying component processes involved in ABE students’ word reading and reading comprehension skills.  The findings also may inform instructional practices and future intervention research in ABE programs.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The focal cohort in this study is the Millennial generation, the group of people born between the years of 1982 and 1999. Research shows that many Millennials are delaying marriage and having children, which significantly impacts how we will design spaces for this generation’s needs based on their current point in life (Strauss &amp; Howe, 1991).  Their social factors influence their location, housing choices, and their personal meaning of home. It is important to look at the American life cycle as it has actually been lived by each generation. Because Millennials are more involved with keeping up with trends, and incorporating them into their lifestyle, design needs are much different than in the past. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Millennials desire a sense of community and connection to their surroundings (PRC, 2010). This generation wants walkability, convenience, housing variety, and affordability within their housing environment, and a mixed-use development is an applicable solution that successfully accommodates these desires (RCLCO, 2013). Currently there is a lack of housing opportunity that will accommodate Millennials’ needs at their current point in life (PRC 2010; Jones, 1995). This lack of available housing makes building an emotional connection to their homes and surrounding community extremely difficult for Millennials (Jones, 1995). In order to accommodate this desire for emotional connection to their surroundings, it is essential to understand the Millennials’ needs in relation to their meaning of home. The Millennial generation as a whole, connect their personal and social identity to their physical surroundings, therefore, these young adults desire to establish a personal identity through “sense of place” in their home and a social identity through “sense of community” in their living environment (Jones, 1995). Determining what needs Millennials find important within their home environment allows for the opportunity to enhance their emotional connections with their surroundings. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study illustrates the findings from the research study, and provides a proposed design solution for a mixed-use housing environment for Millennials. A group of Millennials have been be surveyed to determine how they accommodate their needs, gaining further insight on how accommodating Millennial’s needs enhances these desired meaningful connections. The resulting data lead to a greater understanding of the meaningful relationships that Millennial’s desire to create within their surroundings, and how to better accommodate their needs through design.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>America's postsecondary education system currently supports nearly 11 million people, but only 33-37% of these students will actually graduate with a Baccalaureate degree (Kuh, Kinzie, Schuh, Whitt &amp; Associates, 2005; OECD, 2009). Researchers have been examining various aspects of America's "persistence puzzle" for the past 30 years. The majority of these studies have focused on the academic and social environs of first-year, native students enrolled in large university programs (Braxton, Sullivan, &amp; Johnson, 1997), where America's transfer student populations have been restricted or excluded (Townsend &amp; Wilson, 2009). These restrictions represent a rather significant oversight in the current literature, given that approximately 52% of America's first-year postsecondary students are enrolled in community college programs (Cejda, 1997; Keener, 1994) and that nearly 40% of today's graduates will transfer between several institutions before obtaining a baccalaureate degree (NCES, 2005). Furthermore, the majority of these studies have relied on quantitative methods/data, which address persistence as an outcomes, rather than a series of events/experiences that contribute to a student's decision to withdraw (Tinto, 1993). As a result, we know very little about the psychological and environmental challenges students face as they transition between institutions (Laanan, 2004). Even those studies that have referred to the "transfer shock" students experience during their transition have failed to explore the methods, attributes, stresses (both psychological, social &amp; cultural), or the strategies students employ to relieve these stresses (Holahan, Green, &amp; Kelley, 1983; Laanan, 2001). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	This study examined the adjustment process of vertical transfer students who recently transferred to a four-year, Research I, Baccalaureate university in the southeast United States. It applied Adelman's (2006) definition of a vertical transfer student as: someone who began his or her postsecondary education in a community college, earned a at least 10 college credits and then transferred to a Baccalaureate university. This definition was then applied to a specific group of vertical transfer students who recently transferred from a single, local community college, less than three miles from the university, as these students represent approximately 43.3% of the total incoming transfer student population at the Baccalaureate institution (OIR, 2012b). The primary goals of this study were to define the transfer student experience, assist future transfer students with their transitions, and assess the quality/effectiveness of current programs so that staff, faculty and administrators could align and/or improve cooperative persistence programs that exist between these two institutions. After all, the rigors these students face during their adjustment to life as university students will have a significant impact on their persistence and/or success (Astin, 1984, Tinto, 1993, Townsend &amp; Wilson, 2009).</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>While a number of research groups offer quantitative diagnostic indices of aggregate annual Atlantic Basin tropical cyclone (TC) activity, the literature is comparatively thin concerning methods to similarly quantify seasonal U.S. landfall risks. An accurate diagnostic assessment of annual TC risk would be of great public utility and economic value, but the methods used to assess yearly activity demonstrate little skill in evaluating count or severity of TCs making landfall in the continental United States. As existing models are optimized to capture variability in cumulative seasonal TC activity, they are suboptimal statistical diagnostic tools for assessing the potential for sensible impacts of storms on populated areas. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This project aims to address this utility gap in existing seasonal aggregate TC potential indices by taking a broader view of the factors that influence where TCs develop and move in the Atlantic Basin, shifting the focus to the physical parameters most closely linked to the historical conditions associated with U.S. landfall events. Using an extended record of Atlantic TC activity and reanalysis model datasets, characteristic atmospheric and oceanic traits of elevated U.S. TC landfall risk are identified, with the aim of quantifying the internal variance and predictability of these risks using empirical Poisson regression models. The resulting product, the Landfall Diagnostic Index (LDI), incorporates spatially and temporally averaged measures of relative sea surface temperature, layer-averaged steering winds, zonal shear vorticity, and upper-level divergence to yield a seasonal TC activity metric that has significant fidelity to the interannual and seasonal cycle variability of continental U.S. hurricane landfalls.  The LDI offers physical insight into the causes and nature of TC risk on each of these scales, in particular highlighting a potential inherent tension between the conditions most favorable for elevated TC counts and those favoring steering currents directed towards the continental United States.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This study examines Spanish gender assignment among mixed bilingual children with 121 English Language Learners and 17 Spanish Language Leaners from North and South Florida through the results of a receptive gender marking task. Two groups of younger (ages 4 to 6) and older (7 to 10) students participated and were tested on their accuracy of gender markers (el and la) on picture naming task of overtly and non-overtly marked feminine and masculine nouns. All participants demonstrated greater accuracy with overtly marked versus non-overtly marked nouns and with feminine versus masculine marked nouns. Greater overall gender assignment accuracy and the accuracy of marked markers was seen with older bilinguals compared to younger bilinguals. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Comparisons regarding overall accuracy of gender assignment were made according to location. The results showed greater accuracy for overall gender assignment and marked nouns (overtly, non-overtly, masculine and feminine) for the participants from the South Florida compared to North Florida. For South Florida, years studying Spanish was significantly related to overall gender assignment accuracy. Equivalently, for North Florida, the number of years of exposure to Spanish was significantly related to overall gender assignment accuracy.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Roadway crashes claim more than 30,000 lives each year in the United States, and they continue to affect the lives of people adversely. This problem becomes even more challenging when aging populations are considered due to their vulnerability and fragility to crashes. This is especially a major concern in Florida since the crash risk for the aging populations is increasing day by day proportional to the population growth of aging Floridians. This study investigates the spatial and temporal patterns of aging-involved crashes using Geographical Information Systems (GIS)-based methods with a case study on three urban counties in Florida. These counties are selected based on the high aging-involved crash rates, as identified by the Safe Mobility for Life Coalition of Florida. Among the methods studied, a network distance-based kernel density estimation method, namely SANET, is identified as a very effective tool since it provides an unbiased distribution of the crashes by calculating the actual distances between the crashes over the roadway network. GIS-based results are also supported with a binary logistic regression analysis in order to identify the significant factors affecting the aging-involved crashes. Results indicate that high risk locations for aging-involved crashes show different spatial and temporal patterns than those for other age groups. These pattern specific differences include the following: (a) Intersections have an adverse effect on the 65+ populations more than other adult age groups, (b) Aging-involved population crashes occur during the mid-day rather than the peak hours, which is not a similar pattern for other adult age groups, especially for the working populations, and (c) Weekdays have more aging-involved crashes than the weekends contrary to the other age group crashes. Investigating these distinct patterns thoroughly can lead to better aging-focused transportation plans and policies.</DISS_para>

      <DISS_content>
         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study is to analyze the evolution of the federal government’s role in developing policies designed to assist low-income students prepare for and enroll in college.  Specifically, the study analyzed public laws beginning in 1964 with the first federal policy directed to the issue and extending thirty years to 1993. Seventy-six laws were analyzed.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study contributes to the field of higher education policy research in two ways.  First, the study uses an historical evolutionary approach to describe the landscape of federal programs designed to assist low-income students prepare for and enroll in college.  This study, for the first time, applies Hearn’s (2001) framework of primary program vehicles, policy objectives, target populations, and delivery systems to explain the evolution of federal policy in this area over time.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study found that Congress enacted 30 primary program vehicles between 1964 and 1993. These primary program vehicles were enacted in fits and starts resulting in a proliferation of vehicles offering overlapping services.  Examining the evolution of the vehicles over time shows increased Congressional attention at the end of the period covered by the study. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Congress took a fragmented approach to policy objectives.  This study reveals that a clear focus on access was supplemented by a focus on preparation, information, and cost. By addressing these objectives, Congress focused on the barriers – academic, social, and financial – that low-income students face in accessing higher education.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Congress charted a clear path with target populations.  This study found that Congressional attention slowly shifted away from low-income students between 1964 and 1993.  From the mid-1960s to the 1970s, low-income students were the main target population. By the late-1970s, Congressional attention shifted to include some students who were not low-income. By the end of the period covered by the study, the focus was clearly on middle-income students.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>One area of relative stability was delivery systems.  This study reveals that Congress primarily provided assistance through campus-oriented vehicles rather than through student-oriented vehicles.  On the whole, the approach taken by Congress to the delivery systems is restrictive because it limits the choices that low-income students have in where to attend college.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Although Congress attended to access, it did not maintain its commitment to assist low-income students exclusively; instead, its attention gradually shifted to middle-income students.  Combining analysis of primary program vehicles, policy objectives, target populations, and delivery systems shows that Congress failed to focus enough on low-income students to close the higher education access gap for low-income students.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Second, this study fills the gap in attention that has been paid to whether Congress used laws other than the Higher Education Act to address the income-based disparities in access to higher education.  This study found that primary program vehicles were enacted under the Higher Education Act, the Public Health Service Act, the Economic Opportunity Act, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, the Job Training Partnership Act, and the Energy Policy Act. By including laws that were passed outside of the higher education arena, the study also reveals the way Congress has attended to the college access issue in areas such as public health, K-12 education, job training, and energy. In doing so, it shows that 46.67% of federal action around college access is addressed outside of the Higher Education Act and its reauthorizations.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Finally, this study builds what is arguably the most comprehensive database of federal laws directed at college access for low-income students (Table 3.1).  This study also contributes an enumeration of the primary program vehicles enacted under those laws (Tables 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4).  By providing a more complete description of the actions that Congress has taken in its attempts to address the gap, this study also provides future researchers, evaluators, advocacy groups, and policymakers with fertile ground for further exploring the federal role in assisting low-income students to prepare for and enroll in college.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This thesis addresses whether or not, according to theologians, virgins could maintain their virginity even after instances of physical loss, such as rape. I will use post-structuralism as the method. This thesis will use a socio-cultural analysis by viewing virginity’s relationship with the norms of society. It will examine virginity and its place within texts and the Christian tradition. Most importantly, it will view how virginity has changed over time, and from one thinker to the next in response to the tension between the body and spirit. Beginning with Augustine, and into the medieval era, there are theological ideas that allow for virginity to remain even after physical losses like rape. This was not true for most thinkers before Augustine. Physical virginity was rendered absolute in order to claim virginity. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The goal is to assess raped virginity’s place within medieval society. Virginity offered an escape to women who did not wish to marry and bear children, and also offered the highest honor of heavenly reward alongside martyrdom. However, maintaining physical virginity could not always be guaranteed. Rape was a threat to many Holy Virgins in medieval Europe, especially in times of violence. This paper will assess how women of the convents were able to maintain their virginity even when threatened with violation. The change in the theology of virginity provided a way for these virgins to challenge rape. Spiritual virginity, which was in constant tension with bodily virginity, was an idea developed in response to rape, allowing a woman’s access to virginity regardless of physical intactness.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Microcontact printing (μCP) is a soft lithographic technique based on transferring an ink material from a stamp on to a substrate through physical contact to produce features at the micrometer scale. Compared to other surface-patterning techniques, μCP is known for ease of use, low cost, high reliability, and high versatility. It is being used across diverse fields of scientific and engineering research, and holds potential to be useful for large-scale manufacturing. My doctoral research is focused on the development of μCP techniques for fabricating functional micropatterns and microparticles for biomedical applications. Polyelectrolyte Specifically, my work consists of the following four projects.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>First, I developed a method based on μCP of polyelectrolyte for surface micropatternng. The method is featured by the use of an unmodified poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS) stamp to print polyelectrolytes on a substrate coated with a monolayer of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-silane. The method is applicable to various polyelectrolytes including poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH), branched and linear poly(ethylene imine) (PEI), poly-L-lysine (PLL), poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDAC), chitosan, double stranded DNA, and poly(sodium 4-styrene sulfonate) (PSS). The printed polyelectrolyte structures, which include monolayer, bilayer, and stretched molecular bundles, are stable in aqueous solutions and have been used for micropatterning quantum dot nanoparticles, DNA, proteins, and live cells.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Second, I utilized a novel polyelectrolyte ink material for μCP. The ink material is poly(4-aminostyrene) (PAS) which can be converted to aryldiazonium salt and exhibits pH-dependent hydrophobicity. I demonstrated that PAS could be microcontact printed using an unmodified PDMS stamp, and the printed PAS could be diazotized to further micropattern biomolecules including DNA and protein and nanomaterials including single-walled carbon nanotubes and gold nanoparticles. I also revealed that the diazotized PAS could be used to enable μCP of a metallic structure on a carbon surface.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Third, the hydrophobic nature of PAS at the neutral pH allowed the microcontact-printed PAS-based polyelectrolyte multilayer to be used as masks for wet etching. In addition, I used this technique to produce highly engineered microparticles. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Third, while investigating the diazonium chemistry of PAS, I developed a novel paper indicator for sensing nitrite The paper indicator is featured by using three different modalities including colorimetric assay, Raman spectroscopy, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. This method is simple and inexpensive, and promises to have wider applicability than the existing paper indicators for nitrite sensing.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Lastly, I developed a novel μCP technique for functionalizing and assembling live cells by integrating μCP of polymeric biomaterials with the use of a temperature-sensitive water-soluble sacrificial layer. It can not only functionalize live cells with microscopic polyelectrolyte and thermoplastic structures of various sizes and shapes, but also to assemble the cells into macroscopic stripes and sheets. The technique is also applicable to multiple types of cells, including human leukemic cells, mouse embryonic stem cells and human mesenchymal stem cells in the forms of single cells and cell aggregates. In addition, the technique can be used with biodegradable and biocompatible polyelectrolytes and thermoplastic. Compared with the conventional methods, this technique is inexpensive, easy to use, highly versatile and potentially useful for diverse biomedical applications, such as drug delivery, cellular therapies and tissue engineering.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Pangasius fish, mainly Pangasius hypophthalmus (tra/swai) and Pangasius bocourti (basa), which belong to the Pangasiidae family of catfish, are imported farm-raised freshwater fish from Asian. Nowadays, the U.S. is one of the largest importers of Pangasius fish worldwide. As mounting quantities of Pangasius fish being imported every year, the names of “tra/swai” and “basa”, however, seldom appear on restaurant menus. Since processed fish products in restaurants are not subjected to the requirement of labeling species/origins, it is unclear how and to what extend Pangasius are used in restaurants. The overall objective of this study was to investigate if Pangasius fish has been used as a substitute for domestic catfish (Ictaluridae family), high valued fish species, e.g. grouper and snapper, and fish products without specifying the species on the menu from local restaurants. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In total, 47 different fish products from 37 local restaurants in a medium size city were sampled and a commercialized rapid lateral flow strip assay (EZ PangasiusTM kit) were used to identify Pangasius fish. The results showed that 26.7% of domestic catfish tested was substituted by Pangasius, and 22.2% of high-valued fish, grouper, was verified to be Pangasius while no cases of substitution for snapper, sea bass and sole samples tested were found. In addition, a high percentage (66.7%) of dishes displayed under the general name of “fish” on the menu were identified as Pangasius, revealing the favorable choice of imported Pangasius for various fish products due to its sensory quality and cheap price. Isoelectric focusing (IEF) was further conducted to characterize protein patterns of each sample in comparison with authentic fish standards, and the results showed that all the Pangasius positive samples were exclusively tra/swai rather than basa. One year later 7 tested Pangasius positive dishes, including 4 in catfish group and 3 without specifying the species, were sampled again as follow-ups. Indirect non-competitive enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (iELISA), which applied a Pangasius-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) T7E10, was used to analyze these follow-up samples. The results revealed the continuous use of Pangasius as substitutes for domestic catfish (4 out of 4) and as “anonymous” ingredients for the products without labeling the species. This study exhibited the prevalence of Pangasius in restaurants and also revealed the existence of dishonest behaviors in restaurant business, which called for the need to set up specific measurements and regulations to discourage the fraudulent practice using tra/swai or basa.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Does adopting a National Human Rights Institution (NHRI) makes states' international commitments more constraining?  If so, why would states adopt the constraining institution in the first place?  When states do adopt an NHRI, how do they design it?  I answer these three questions in three separate essays in the dissertation.  Past scholarship emphasizes the role of domestic institutions for international human rights commitments.  NHRIs, domestic institutions tasked with the protection and promotion of human rights, represent another institution to explore.  Focusing on the generally secretive practice of torture, I argue NHRIs provide information to potential mobilizers and domestic legal systems increasing the probability states follow through on their commitment not to torture.  I find that when a country already ratified the Convention Against Torture (CAT), the presence of an NHRI substantively decreases the chances the state tortures often.  Given NHRI ability to constrain state behavior, why do states adopt NHRIs?  Most NHRI adoption happens within a norms cascade.  I argue states weigh the reputational benefits with the costs of NHRI adoption.  Shaming by other actors approximately signals how those actors perceive the state in question's status with respect to the international society of states.  Those states never or always shamed do not reap high enough benefits to adopt; more adoption exists in the middle.  I test the hypothesis with a Cox Proportional Hazards model and find support that states adopt NHRIs to manage their international status.  Not all NHRIs are created equally, though.  Considerable variation exists pertaining to what actions NHRIs can legally take to affect their charge; some even levy punishment.  The final essay proposes a theory of legislature delegation to NHRIs with the executive seeking to influence the process to retain maximum discretion in the future.  Electoral laws and political situations allow the executive to leverage her power with respect to the legislature in order to decrease the probability the NHRI may levy punishment.  The executive may even hijack the whole process and create the NHRI unilaterally through decree also decreasing the probability legal NHRI punishment powers.  Estimating a Bayesian logistic regression, that accounts for selection and uncertainty, I find support for the theory.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation examines the ways in which Lydgate's Troy Book, both the textual and visual narratives, functioned in fifteenth-century England.  As Henry V sought to legitimate his claim to the throne usurped by his father, he capitalized on the burgeoning sense of an English national identity by patronizing literature in the English vernacular as a means to glorify both nation and language.  In an age in which genealogical claims were the most important indicator of a person's right to rule, Henry exploited the Trojan origin myth, which had circulated in England and other European communities since the early Middle Ages, not only to glorify England as an inheritor of Rome's imperial mission and to solidify the Lancastrian claim, but also to help solidify and renew the English claim to the French throne.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The Troy Book was immensely popular in the fifteenth-century and was reproduced in at least twenty-three manuscripts, including fragments.  Eight of these manuscripts received illustrations, and a basic visual program can be detected in each of them.  However, two of these manuscripts are exceptional for the inclusion of illustrations beyond this basic program - London, British Library, MS Royal 18 d. ii (c. 1455-62) and Manchester, John Rylands Library, MS English 1 (c. late 1440s).  Because the manuscripts were produced at different points in the fifteenth century, a careful examination of the images in light of contemporary historical events helps establish the patron's views and ambitions that may have helped shape the pictorial narrative.  I will argue that the anomalous images in the Royal manuscript must be read in light of both the recently failed war with France and the current civil war between the houses of York and Lancaster and that these images represent aristocratic anxieties and desires for peace.  This argument will culminate in an examination of the images in the Rylands manuscript, the most sumptuous of the Troy Book manuscripts, which includes sixty-nine miniatures.  It was commissioned slightly earlier than the Royal manuscript during the waning fortunes of the Hundred Years War and conforms most closely to the purposes of the original text: to glorify Trojan origins and England by identifying Henry V with Hector, to act as a manual for chivalry and proper war practices, to emphasize the role of fortune in worldly events, and to provide moral instruction to both the aristocracy and the nobility.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The decision to be self-employed has been studied in numerous scholarly papers. In particular, there has been interest in the decision to become an entrepreneur in relation to the macroeconomic climate. Scholars reference the potential for an economic boom to “pull” entrepreneurs into self-employment. On the other side of the debate, scholars argue that recessions “push” individuals with low skills into working for themselves. This paper finds no evidence of either theory when looking at state level growth rates in real gross domestic product and state level growth rates in unemployment claims. However, there is evidence of a differing effect of the macro environment by age and educational attainment</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The current studies focus on individual difference predictors of the phenomenon inattentional blindness (IB; when observers fail to notice a salient but unexpected event when attention is occupied by another task).  Study 1 (conducted on Mechanical Turk) explicitly examined unexpected object salience as the moderator between the potential relationship between working memory capacity and IB.  Salience was varied in two ways: 1) the color of the unexpected item (gray vs. red) and also the distance of the unexpected item from fovea (near vs. far).  A second lab-based study explored the degree to which attentional control is an important individual difference predictor of IB, with the idea that individuals more susceptible to attention capture will be more likely to notice the unexpected event, and individuals who are better able to filter irrelevant information will miss it more.  Study 2 tested this hypothesis by examining the relationship between four classic measures of attentional control (measuring implicit capture of attention using reaction time) and IB (measuring explicit detection of an unexpected object using participant report).   Contrary to hypotheses, working memory capacity was not a significant predictor of IB, even in instances in which the unexpected object was highly salient (Study 1). Moreover, Study 2 found no relationship between classic measures of implicit capture (based on RT) and explicit capture (participant report of noticing an unexpected event).  Instead, age, processing speed, and conscientiousness demonstrated predictive ability in distinguishing noticers and non-noticers.   Results suggest that attentional control (measured via working memory capacity or classic measures of attention capture) is unrelated to explicit detection of an unexpected stimulus.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In higher education today, international students from various sociocultural backgrounds have contributed to the internationalization of many colleges and universities. The factors that help them succeed academically in a different cultural environment have become an important topic of research designed to improve the quality of higher education in a globalized environment. This qualitative study adopts a sociocultural perspective to explore their conceptions of academic success and their strategies for achieving it, by analyzing cultural factors that impinge on the experience of Chinese international graduate students in the US.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>There were three phases in this in-depth qualitative research. In the first phase, using semi-structured interviews, the researcher investigated Chinese students’ conceptions of academic success, the factors that they perceived as most influential on their attempts to achieve it, and the strategies that they adopted to optimize their chances. In the second phase, based on results from the first round, a follow-up interview was conducted to probe for further details and to understand the strategies adopted by these students according to their study-abroad experience. In the third phase, new data were collected through a focus group discussion to generate a deeper understanding of the students’ perspectives on academic success and its relation to acculturation. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The final results from this study indicated that the conceptions of academic success of these international students and their strategies for attaining it were not only characterized by cultural and socio-institutional values and norms , but were also shaped and reshaped by the international students’ individual characteristics and personal acculturative attitudes and experiences. Chinese international graduate students have developed acculturative strategies, characterized as ─ Americanization, Globalization and Individualization ─ to achieve their visions of academic success. The findings offer possible answers to help explain how Chinese international STEM students manage to achieve academic success despite the challenges such as language barrier and acculturation process (dealing with cross-cultural barriers on cultural, institutional and personal levels). They also provide new perspectives on acculturation theories and suggest practical implications for university international student affairs work.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>platform. We explore efficient implementations for two main financial problems on GPU: pricing, and computing sensitivities (Greeks). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Since most Monte Carlo algorithms are embarrassingly parallel, Monte Carlo</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>has become a focal point in GPU computing. GPU speed-up examples reported in the literature often involve Monte Carlo algorithms, and there are software tools commercially available that help migrate Monte Carlo financial pricing models to GPU. We present a survey of Monte Carlo and randomized quasi-Monte Carlo methods, and discuss existing (quasi) Monte Carlo sequences in NVIDIA's GPU CURAND libraries. We discuss specific features of GPU architecture relevant for developing efficient (quasi) Monte Carlo methods. We introduce a recent randomized quasi-Monte Carlo method, </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>and compare it with some of the existing implementations on GPU, when they are used in pricing caplets in the LIBOR market model and mortgage backed securities.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We then develop a cache-aware implementation of a 3D parabolic PDE solver on GPU. We apply the well-known Craig-Sneyd scheme and derive the corresponding discretization. We discuss memory hierarchy of GPU and</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>suggest a data structure that is suitable for GPU's caching system. We compare the performance of the PDE solver on CPU and GPU.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Finally, we consider sensitivity analysis for financial problems via Monte Carlo and PDE methods. We review three commonly used methods and point out their advantages and disadvantages. We present a survey of automatic differentiation (AD), and show the challenges faced in memory consumption when AD is applied in financial problems. We discuss two optimization techniques that help reduce memory footprint significantly. We conduct the sensitivity analysis for the LIBOR market model and suggest an optimization for its AD implementation on GPU. We also apply AD to a 3D parabolic PDE and use GPU to reduce the execution time.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Recent surveys have shown that over 6.8 billion mobile phones are in use today where roughly 50% are running the Android Operating System. This large population of devices can be utilized for message-passing interface (MPI) computing. There have been few examples of this in practice due to the complexity of installation and lack of functionality. However, I propose a new framework which permits client devices to dynamically join and leave an MPI-based network without drastically affecting its performance. It uses the MPICH2 library to execute processes and pass messages between the devices. Unlike the previous implementations, this framework uses Java (in the form of an Android application) to perform the initialization steps and execution of MPICH. As a result, the purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing the framework as an independent library.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this dissertation, methods of estimating the sensitivity of complex exotic options, including options written on multiple assets, and have discontinuous payoffs, are investigated. The calculation of the sensitivities (Greeks) is based on the finite difference method, pathwise method, likelihood ratio method and kernel method, via Monte Carlo or quasi-Monte Carlo simulation. Direct Monte Carlo estimators for various sensitivities of weather derivatives and mountain range options are given. The numerical results show that the pathwise method outperforms other methods when the payoff function is Lipschitz continuous. The kernel method and the central finite difference methods are competitive when the payoff function is discontinuous.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The research described in this dissertation is concerned with two different types of magnetic materials. Both types of systems involve competing interactions between transition metal ions. New approaches involving magnetic resonance in the large hyperfine fields at nuclear sites have been developed. The interactions responsible for the properties that have been investigated in the materials studied are geometric frustration in an insulator and ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions in a metal alloy. Further details are given below.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The extended kagome frustrated system YBaCo4O7 has 2D kagome and triangular lattices of Co ions stacked along the c-axis. Antiferromagnetic (AF) ordering accompanied by a structural transition has been reported in the literature. From a zero field (ZF) NMR single crystal rotation experiment, we have obtained the Co spin configurations for both the kagome and triangular layers. A ‘spin-flop’ configuration between the spins on the kagome layer and the spins on the triangular layer is indicated by our results. Our NMR findings are compared with neutron scattering results for this intriguing frustrated AF spin system. The non-stoichiometric oxygenated sister compound YBaCo4O7.1 has application potential for oxygen storage. While, its’ magnetic properties are quite different from those of the stoichiometric compound, in spite of their similar structures of alternating kagome and triangular Co layers. Various techniques, including ZF NMR have been used to investigate the spin dynamics and spin configuration in a single crystal of YBaCo4O7.1. A magnetic transition at 80 K is observed, which is interpreted as the freezing out of spins in the triangular layers. At low temperatures (below 50 K), the spin dynamics persists and a fraction of spins in the kagome layers form a viscous spin liquid. Below 10 K, a glass-like spin structure forms and a large distribution of spin correlation times are suggested by nuclear spin lattice relaxation behavior.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The magnetic shape memory alloys Ni-Mn-Sn exhibit interesting properties including, field induced transformations, conventional and inverse magnetocaloric effects. They have potential for use as sensors, actuators and energy conversion devices. The Heusler alloy, Ni50Mn50 xSnx with x=10 is one of these materials. It undergoes a transition from an austenite phase to a martensitic phase at 400 K, with the emergence of rich interesting magnetic properties below the transition. Coexistence of ferromagnetic (F) and AF spin configurations is reported in these compounds. 55Mn NMR has been used as a local probe to study the magnetic properties of this alloy. Rich peak features are observed with the various components assigned to nanoscale F or AF regions. Our results have provided detailed information on the AF regions, which has not been provided by other techniques. Measurements of the temperature dependence of the NMR spectra, in ZF and in a perturbing field were made. The spin-lattice relaxation dependence on T provides detailed information on the nanocluster size distribution and relative concentrations of the F and AF regions. Recently, the Heusler alloy Ni50-xCoxMn40Sn10, with 5 ≤ x ≤ 8, have attracted interest because the low thermal hysteresis and the large change in magnetization which they exhibit at the martensitic transition. Evidence for phase separation of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic regions at low temperatures is provided by magnetization and small angle neutron scattering measurements. Superparamagnetism and intrinsic exchange bias effects have been detected below 50 K. Zero field 55Mn NMR has provided detailed information on the nanoscale magnetic properties of samples with x = 7 and, for comparison, x = 14. For x = 7 F and AF regions, with a broad size distribution are identified and our results show that F clusters with the highest blocking temperatures are associated with regions rich in Co ions.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Transition metal complexes have unique photophysical and photochemical properties which will play significant roles in a wide range of biological and artificial systems as photocatalysts, solar energy harvesters, ligand emitters, sensors and so on. Comprehensive studies on the excited state dynamics of transition metal complexes are of great interest for developing new material and devices. Photoinduced structural change represents a primary excited state dynamic process that determines the photophysical and photochemical properties of transition meal complexes. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>My work is focus on application of a series of pyrazolated bridged platinum dinuclear complexes, which are also called butterfly-like platinum (II) complexes due to the molecule structure. I have studied the excited state dynamics of these butterfly-like platinum (II) complexes, which show interesting photoinduced structural change and environment dependent luminescence. Using these new platinum binuclear complexes with controlled excited state properties, there are some sensors, such as phase change sensor, viscosity sensor and temperature sensor can be achieved.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Despite the prevalence of delinquency during adolescence and the influence of culture on parenting behaviors and adolescent outcomes, few comparative studies have examined the association between parental warmth and delinquency trajectories both longitudinally and cross-culturally.  Thus, this study sought to identify cultural differences in individual delinquency trajectories and those associations with parental warmth. In Study 1, latent growth modeling (LGM) was used to examine the individual trajectories of delinquency and the protective effect of parental warmth on delinquency trajectories using the U.S. sample from the Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). In Study 2, using the Korean sample from the Korean Youth Panel Survey (KYPS), the same two research questions were investigated.  Lastly, Study 3 explored cultural differences in such associations between the United States and South Korea. Findings showed the patterns of delinquency across time and culture, indicating delinquency decline from middle to late adolescence in both the U.S. and Korean samples.  Results also demonstrated the protective effect of parental warmth concurrently and longitudinally in both countries.  More importantly, there were cultural differences in such associations, indicating that the longitudinal protective effect of parental warmth was larger for U.S. adolescents than Korean adolescents.  Implications of the study suggest the need to improve a warm relationship between parent and adolescent to reduce delinquency. It is also important to understand cultural influences on parenting and adolescent outcome for educators, clinicians, politicians, interventionists, and researchers.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation develops a model of material composing knowledge, which considers the role that surfaces, environments, and tools play in the composing processes of student writers as they shift their writing practices across multiple contexts. The research questions ask if and how knowledge of materiality aids students in transferring their writing knowledge and practice across dissimilar composing tasks, such as the remediation of a Print Newsletter into a networked text. To address these questions, it builds upon a model of composing developed by Anne Beaufort that looks at five domains—discourse community knowledge, rhetorical knowledge, writing process knowledge, genre knowledge, and subject matter knowledge—that comprise a model of writing aimed at fostering transfer, and this study considers the addition of a sixth domain: material composing knowledge.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This exploration of material composing knowledge extends upon research already conducted within the field of writing studies that looks at how transfer occurs in writing courses. Its situated location within an upper-level writing course, “Writing and Editing in Print and Online,” provides the opportunity to look at a class in which students are explicitly called upon to recontextualize, that is to transfer, their writing practices across three contexts: print, screen, and network composing. This study made use of think-aloud protocols to render visible the decisions students made while they remediated a previously-created text for a new context and resulted in the development of three characterizations of student participants as Remixers, Assemblers, and Synthesizers. These three characterizations reflected the ways in which student participants relied upon prior knowledge, material composing knowledge, and their stances as what Mary Jo Reiff and Anis Bawarshi describe as border-guarders and border-crossers. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The study resulted in the following four claims: (1) considerations of surfaces, environments, and tools play a large role in how these students approached recontextualizing their writing across print, screen, and network contexts; (2) students relied heavily upon prior knowledge—in particular, their out-of-school literacies, when recontextualizing their writing practices; (3) the kinds of prior knowledge these students had with varied materials—tools, surfaces, environments—greatly influenced how they approached the recontextualization of their writing; and (4) the concepts of border-guarding and border-crossing extend beyond students’ knowledge of genre and beyond the transition from high school to college—these concepts can be seen in the ways that these students employed and repurposed materials while composing. As a result, this dissertation suggests that material composing knowledge can serve as another valuable knowledge domain that would fit within the model developed by Beaufort, and that this domain would prove especially useful when students engage in transferring their writing knowledge and practices across dissimilar writing tasks. Additionally, this research suggests three pedagogical applications, that we should (1) incorporate activities that emphasize reflection-in-action as a way to assist students articulate their decisions, (2) emphasize the role of workarounds as opportunities for transferring writing knowledge and practices from one context to another, and (3) provide models or detailed scenarios that describe what successful and unsuccessful attempts of recontextualizing writing look like.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of epilepsy in adults, and patients with TLE often suffer from seizures refractory to antiepileptic drugs. A deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of TLE is critical for improving treatment. In this dissertation we assess how TLE affects neuron in the rat presubiculum (PrS), a less-studied parahippocampal brain region believed to drive activity in structures implicated in TLE, specifically the medial entorhinal area (MEA). We conducted an electrophysiological assessment and created a classification schema to characterize neurons in superficial layers of PrS in control rats in order to expand upon limited knowledge available PrS neuron physiology. The PrS is comprised of seven electrophysiologically distinct cell types, suggesting greater functional heterogeneity than previously envisaged. By correlating morphology of recorded neurons with physiology, we determined that morphologically similar neurons may have very different physiological properties. PrS cell types include classes of projection neurons capable of coupling activity of spatially distributed structures. The extent to which physiology of PrS neurons is altered by TLE was assessed in chronically epileptic rats. Three of the previously identified PrS cell-types were encountered in epileptic rats. Regular-spiking cells, the most common cell-type in PrS, known to include MEA-targeting projection neurons, were the only PrS cell-type that became hyperexcitable in TLE. These cells displayed altered excitatory and inhibitory synaptic drive that likely contributes to cell hyperexcitability. Excitatory and inhibitory drive in superficial MEA neurons was measured while PrS activity was altered using either electrical stimulation or focal application of compounds to compare PrS contributions to MEA excitability between control and epileptic animals. Synaptic inputs from PrS to MEA neurons are conserved, and PrS stimulation is sufficient to trigger epileptiform activity in MEA neurons under epileptic conditions. PrS influence on excitatory and inhibitory synaptic drive in MEA is layer specific. Our data suggest that contribution to stellate cell inhibitory drive from PrS is reduced, and PrS may be decoupled from pyramidal neurons in epileptic rats. The work presented in this dissertation greatly advances our basic physiological knowledge of neurons in the PrS, and for the first time assesses how TLE impacts physiology of PrS neuron and their ability to drive activity in the MEA.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation covers several topics around the idea of the Schwartz-MacPherson Chern classes, which were independently constructed by M.H. Schwartz around 1965 and R. MacPherson in the early 1970’s. First we review a more recent construction of Schwartz-MacPherson Chern class due to G. Kennedy using projective Lagrangian conormals and make explicit some details not found in that work. Around 1980, J.-L. Verdier obtained a specialization formula for Schwartz-MacPherson Chern classes, which was recovered by Kennedy again using the Lagrangian setting and Fulton-MacPherson intersection theory, elaborating on work of C. Sabbah. A verbatim reading of this approach reveals several subtleties. We introduce an alternate blow-up construction to address some of these subtleties, as well as an alternate definition based upon the work of C. Sabbah. We then prove that either of these constructions indeed provides a complete alternative proof of Verdier’s specialization formula. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the early 2010’s P. Aluffi revisited Verdier’s work and developed a more calculable approach to specialization utilizing constructible functions and the Weak Factorization Theorem of Abramovich, Karu, Matsuki, and Wl􏰀odarczyk. Aluffi’s construction gives an explicit formula when in the case of a divisor with normal crossings and nonsingular components. We take those ideas to the Lagrangian setting to define a new Langrangian cycle, the Asp cycle. All of the proofs in that section utilize Langrangians. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We prove that the Asp cycle agrees with the specialization cycle introduced by Sabbah and Kennedy in the special case in which the subvariety is the central fiber of a family over a smooth curve. Thus the Asp cycle may be viewed as a generalization of the Kennedy-Sabbah cycle. We give a corresponding generalization of Verdier’s specialization formula.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>At the polar latitudes, maritime mesocyclones form throughout the year, often near or embedded within cloud streets associated with massive cold air outbreaks. Such storms appear on the 100–1000 km horizontal scale. However, polar mesocyclones tend to exist on the lesser end of the horizontal scale. As a storm’s size decreases, the likelihood that they will be well-represented in data also decreases. Underrepresentation of polar mesocyclones in reanalyses will affect climatological forecasts and research that utilize such data. Namely, the air-sea interactions associated with polar mesocyclones will be undercut, thereby impacting estimates of ocean circulation. Additionally, many reanalyses underestimate near-surface wind speeds, which is linked to but not exclusively dependent upon the problems associated with data resolution. Harsh polar conditions make regions of scientific interest unfavorable for in situ data collection, which compounds the aforementioned issues.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This research examines the relatively new Arctic System Reanalysis (ASRv1) and its ability to represent three polar mesocyclonic systems of differing size. Should ASRv1 represent polar mesocyclones effectively, it could be a prime candidate in establishing an arctic atmospheric state for air-sea modeling. The product is compared to high-resolution Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model simulations, with ERA-Interim information providing the initial and boundary conditions. Simulation results are checked against available 10m equivalent neutral wind data from QuikSCAT to ensure that the model is producing reasonable atmospheric conditions. Comparisons are drawn for near-surface wind fields and surface turbulent fluxes to focus on ASRv1’s depictions of air-sea interactions for polar mesocyclones. Differences betwixt ASRv1 and the WRF simulations are given with the likely explanations—physical, dynamical, and data-based (e.g., resolution, model options)—behind such differences.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Injurious falls often have tragic consequences such as loss of independence, bodily harm and high monetary costs. Evidence on the effects of lexical cognitive tasks on gait in healthy older individuals is lacking. This study investigated the effects of a specific language task on changes in gait that might put people at risk for injurious falls. Participants included 6 males and 6 females, aged 59 to 77. The GAITRite Walkway System was used to generate a Functional Ambulatory Profile (FAP) score for each trial. FAP is derived from a formula that includes critical gait parameters highly related to risk of falls. The higher the lower the FAP score, the more likely the individual will experience an injurious fall. Scores range from 0 to 100, however, 95 to 100 is considered within normal limits. The three walking conditions included the following: walking without talking (baseline), walking while saying the months of the year forward (low-load) and walking while saying the months of the year backward (high-load). Cognitive-linguistic load was manipulated while phonological, lexical and semantic characteristics remained the same throughout each condition. Results showed the following: differences in velocity and double support time variables were statistically significant among all conditions. Older individuals demonstrated a statistically significant lowered FAP and stride length score across conditions of walking alone and simultaneous walking and reciting the months of the year backwards. Results revealed that differences in velocity and double support time variables were statistically significant across all conditions. Moreover, velocity and double support time may be assumed to significantly influence fall risk across all conditions. Our sample of older individuals demonstrated a statistically significant lowered FAP and stride length score across conditions of walking alone and simultaneous walking and reciting the months of the year backwards (higher cognitive load). However conditions of walking alone and simultaneous walking and reciting the months of the year forwards and conditions of reciting the months of the year forwards compared to reciting the months of the year backwards were non statistically significant. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>More research must be conducted to identify specific lexical cognitive tasks that most affect gait within different populations and disorders. The ultimate goal is to educate individuals who are at risk for injurious falls on the specific language tasks to avoid while ambulating. This data may prevent or minimize the frequency in which persons simultaneously walk and talk, hopefully to decrease prevalence of injurious falls.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The study was conducted to investigate the design, and implementation of an interprofessional continuing education (IPE) course in biomedical ethics to healthcare providers; and to evaluate this course. The impact of the course on teamwork and perception among participants was also examined. The course was designed using a problem-based learning (PBL) approach using the We Learn framework (Macdonald, Stodel, Thompson, &amp; Casimiro, 2009). The study was conducted in the Ministry of Health in Oman. The participants of the study included the instructional designer (who was also the researcher), the course instructor, five group instructors, and 28 learners. The learners were different healthcare professionals who work in the four tertiary hospitals in the capital city. The study employed design and development research (Richey &amp; Klein, 2007) and focused on examining the process of product development and evaluation. A case study method was applied for data collection. Data were collected from all of the participants using surveys, interviews, and logs. The study findings indicated there was a decrease in learners’ perceptions that may be due to unrealistic entry level. However, they expressed that working in IPE was enjoyable. They had consensus that PBL was appropriate and promoted interactions between learners. Overall, the course was implemented as designed. The course is to be revised and include cases with local context.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Establishing stable, high quality romantic relationships is an important developmental task during emerging adulthood with prognostic significance for future relationship development such as marriage (Fincham &amp; Cui, 2011). Studies suggest that considerable challenges exist for African American men in developing and maintaining healthy romantic relationships. These studies suggest that man African American men may be more likely to pursue a sexual partnership trajectory that involves multiple and/or concurrent sexual partners at the expense of committed monogamous romantic relationships (Bowleg, 2004). Such patterns of involvement increase the likelihood that as young adults, African American men will place themselves at risk of contracting and transmitting sexually transmitted infections like HIV/AIDS (Adimora et al., 2004).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Individuals enter into romantic relationships already having exposure to numerous developmental influences that affect their behavior. Exposure to adversity during childhood, such as abuse, neglect, and other stressors, is one important factor in understanding the development of satisfying and committed romantic relationships (Miller et al., 2011; Walker, Holman, &amp; Busby, 2009). Informed by the internal working model persepctive (Hazan &amp;Shaver, 1987) and research on abuse and other adversities (e.g. Burton &amp; Jarrett, 2000; McLoyd, et al., 2000; Umberson, Williams, Thomas, Liu, &amp; Thomeer, 2014), we hypothesized that young men with elevated levels of adversity would evince relationships characterized by one of two patterns. The first involves avoiding deeper levels of commitment and participating in relatively superficial romantic relationships. The second pattern involves participating highly committed relationships, but projecting their anxieties and fears in ways that create volatile and conflictual interactions. For men with low levels of adversity I expected that there relationships would conform to a more healthy pattern as characterized by commitment, low levels of conflict and supportive relationships.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para> Hypotheses were tested with data from men in committed relationships in the African American Men’s Health Project (AMP), which included 361 African American men between the ages of 19 and 22 years. To better understand the kinds of relationships that young, African American men participate in, I conducted a person-centered analysis which confirmed the expected relationship patterns. I identified three profiles or relationship types: (1) healthy relationships, (2) volatile relationships, and (3) superficial relationships. The participants in healthy romantic relationships are characterized by high commitment and support and low criticism and conflict. The volatile group is characterized by high commitment, criticism, conflict, and low support. The superficial group is characterized by low commitment, support, criticism, and conflict. Further analysis confirmed that more adverse childhood experiences predicted increased odds of belonging to a volatile instead of a healthy relationship. Findings suggest targets for preventive interventions designed to foster healthy relationships among African American men.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In 1951, the Professional Golfer’s Association (PGA) code of ethics included a passage describing the necessity for a professional golfer to uphold the sport of golf above material gains in order to serve the game, fellow golfers, the industry of golf. Coupling five years golf experience with industry knowledge and respect for fellow professionals and golfers formed the foundation for the PGA professional. Clearly, the PGA, for many years, has held a position that the professional golfer must develop a specific identity that enables him or her to uphold the role of golf professional in the eyes of the PGA and in the eyes of the golf consuming public.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Beginning in 1975 at Ferris State University, the PGA, and the university, formed a partnership and curriculum to develop future PGA professionals known as the Professional Golf Management University Program. Building from the success of the Ferris State Program, the PGA expanded the PGM University program to an additional 19 institutions within the United States. Since its inception, the PGM University Program has produced hundreds of graduates and boasts a 100% job placement rate (PGA Education, 2013). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Through the use of qualitative research methods (i.e., ethnography, participant observation, autoethnography, and interviews), I investigated the impact that a PGM University program has on the identity development of its students. Guided by theories of identity (Brown, 2000; Burke &amp; Stets, 2009; Hogg &amp; Terry, 2000; Hogg et al., 1995; Tajfel, 1974; Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1979), the social theory of Pierre Bourdieu (1978, 1984, 1988) Ericsson and colleagues’ theory of deliberate practice (1993), and theory pertaining to self-presentation (Leary, 1996), I provide a conceptual model of golf professional identity formation that is cognizant of personal histories, economic realities, and the influence of deliberate sport practice.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Resulting from eighteen months of participant observation and interviews with ten students, I found that the PGM program had a distinct impact on both the role and social identities of the students, and that they formed a PGM influenced social identity prior to a PGM influenced role identity. I also found that deliberate practice was important for the group and was utilized to attain the skill level necessary to pass the Playing Ability Test (PAT); however, the use of deliberate practice tapered off after the completion of the (PAT). Emanating from the results of the project, I offer theoretical and practical implications for the study of identity, and deliberate practice. I conclude by offering future research directions and by offering an informed critique of the focal PGM program.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Although self-regulated learning has been identified as important for students in academic settings, the construct of teacher self-regulation is less well understood. The literature on teacher self-regulation is reviewed in this dissertation, identifying the weaknesses of studies to date and gaps in the literature. The largest gap is the existence of a valid measure of teacher self-regulation that can be used in the U.S. K-12 teacher population. Without such a measure, the possible relationships between teacher self-regulation and important outcomes like teacher learning, student self-regulation, and student achievement cannot be examined. By collecting evidence from various sources (i.e., expert review, teacher review, teacher responses, factor structure, etc.), this dissertation evaluated the reliability and validity of the English-version of the Teacher Self-regulation Scale (TSRS), which was originally developed and validated in Turkey and has since been validated in the Iranian English-as-Foreign-Language (EFL) teacher population. The TSRS, consisting of 40 items, is based on a theoretical model of self-regulation proposed by Zimmerman (2000) and captures nine factors. A series of confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) were conducted to test the factor structure using responses collected via an anonymous online survey from 923 U.S. K-12 teachers recruited from teacher professional organizations. In addition, the internal consistency of the nine subscales were assessed. In this sample, the nine-factor model did not fit the data well suggesting possible cross-cultural differences. Furthermore, unidimensionality was confirmed for only eight of the nine subscales: emotional control, goal setting, help seeking, intrinsic interest, mastery goal orientation, performance goal orientation, self-evaluation, and self-instruction. Theoretical relationships between teacher self-regulation subscales and another measure of teacher self-regulation, teacher sense of responsibility and teacher self-efficacy were also tested using a series of path analyses. A series of multiple regression analyses identified a number of demographic variables as significant predictors of teacher self-regulation subscales. Across the eight subscales, being a teacher of English/Language Arts and a female were significant predictors of higher TSRS responses, whereas being a native English speaker significantly predicted lower TSRS responses. There was also a significant positive relationship between years of teaching experience and TSRS responses for a number of subscales. Further research is needed to better represent the construct of teacher self-regulation.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Human life and diseases are inseparable. For millions of years, humans and their ancestors suffered from diseases, caused by infectious pathogens (e.g., bacteria, viruses, parasites) and caused by our own bodies as they age and degenerate. Within the last century, with the advent of public health measures, improved nutrition and medicine, such as antibiotics, some of the infectious diseases have been controlled. However, infectious diseases still lead to most of the non-age related deaths in the world, especially in nations with insufficient health support.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>My research has taken the complex and dynamic contact networks as well as heterogeneity in disease transmission and recovery into account. Real social networks among individuals were used to generate an adjacency matrix in my formulas. Both, transition and recovery rates have been used as unique variables for each individual. I have used the forward Kolmogorov equation to solve the system.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To control and prevent the infectious diseases such as influenza, sexually transmitted diseases, we have to model the dynamics of a particular disease, estimate the parameters, and forecast the behavior of the disease over time. The estimated parameters help us to design and implement interventions, such as vaccination, closure of public places, to limit the spread of diseases. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>R0, the reproduction number is an important parameter in epidemiology. R0 is the average number of secondary infections produced by a primary infection. If R0 is larger than one an epidemic will most likely happen, an R0 smaller than one suggests that the disease outbreak is local and will die out. In this study I have shown that R0 estimators that only use the the number of contacts and some network features such as covariance of coefficient are not enough to estimate the epidemic threshold. I have formulated R0  to consider both node degree distribution as well as the spectral gap in the eigenvalue of a weighted adjacency matrix of contact network.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Only recently, researchers have developed theoretical approaches that can take into account dynamic networks and, independently, that can use genomic data of the pathogen, sampled from infected persons, to reconstruct the path of an epidemic. By considering the location and time of the sampled pathogen sequence data we can combine the sampled infection network and the mutational history of the pathogen to reconstruct a more accurate contact network. We can reconstruct this dynamic contact network using genetic data and epidemic parameters via a Hidden Markov Model. Sampled genome sequenced data of the pathogen are the observation and a set of dynamic networks are the hidden states in our HMM framework. The system switches between the set of dynamic contact networks to fit the best pattern to observation data. The outcome of such an analysis is the accurate dynamic network among samples of the pathogen. These set of dynamic networks capture the dynamics of the social contact network of the infected people. My model will most likely enable earlier detection of infectious disease spread in dynamic social networks than currently available methods.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>For almost 20 years, research on Processing Instruction (PI) has shown that PI is an effective tool for altering the processing strategies of learners, and has been generalized over a variety of linguistic structures and for a variety of target languages. This presentation seeks to extend the PI research agenda by investigating a processing problem that has not been widely researched: the Preference for Nonredundancy Principle. Specifically, if learners receive PI targeting gender agreement (that falls under this principle), will they make gains on interpretation and production tasks with gender agreement? </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation examines whether PI targeting noun-adjective gender agreement leads to L2 Spanish learners improved performance on interpretation and production tasks. In addition, it asks if PI will improve noticing of gender agreement mismatches in an online self-paced reading task. Another goal of this dissertation is to investigate whether the effects of PI on gender agreement (primary effects) will extend to subject-verb agreement, which is a similar form with a similar processing problem (secondary transfer-of training effects). L2 Spanish learners (N = 112) received either Processing Instruction (PI group) or no instruction (Control group). A pretest, immediate posttest, and delayed posttest design was used to examine the impact of PI on learners’ performance on interpretation, production and self-paced reading tasks.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The participants in this study made significant improvements on production tasks at the delayed posttest, which suggests a positive effect for the PI treatment. On the other hand, the self-paced reading task shows that the learners’ did not recognize mismatches in the primary structure (gender agreement), which suggests that it is not yet part of their internal grammar (i.e., their developing system). We propose that PI is effective in altering how learners approach a production task, but that more input is needed to see results on a sensitive measure like self-paced reading. We discuss our findings in light of the Input Processing theory and its implications for future PI research.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Today, with three generations – Baby Boomers, Generation X, and Millennials – working side by side within the workforce, miscommunications, and every day annoyances take place (Glass, 2007).  These three generations, each shaped by different life experiences and defining moments in history, share an office environment and bring distinctive expectations as well as distinct approaches to work and communication (Lee Hecht Harrison, 2007). This study considers the impact of the built environment on multigenerational workforce, the effectiveness of employees’ interactions, and communications. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>As the oldest generation in the workplace, Baby Boomers expect to work at least part-time in their retirement years. Their eventual retirement will inflict the largest brain drain ever experienced by corporate America (Lee Hecht Harrison, 2007). This brain drain, also called the human capital flight, will result in corporations losing valuable technical skills and knowledge. The next generations are smaller in size and with their limited professional experience and organizational knowledge transferring the knowledge needed for future business success must be a priority (Gordon, 2007). Researching each generation and today’s office environment provides a framework for discussing the current workforce and evolving workplace as well as pursuing practices that will leverage both collective and personal knowledge within the organization as well as the best qualities of each generation. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This thesis study applied information from a review of the literature, the application of observational studies, and valuable insight from focus group interviews to develop a prototype workplace design. This research study merges the attributes of the fields of interior design and knowledge management while examining the multigenerational workforce of today and the researcher’s anticipated workforce scenario in 2030. The researcher utilized the data collected and applied it to the design of a Phase 1: 2015 and Phase 2: 2030 accounting firm office. The researcher aimed to leverage the best qualities of current workplace design processes of knowledge management, and attributes of the Baby Boomers, Generation X and Millennials. The research and application encourages firms, researchers, and designers to take full advantage of all dimensions of talent and contributions to the success of the organization, productivity of employees, and satisfaction of clients, while also providing a context for addressing both the changing aspects of the workforce and workplace.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Talent development and performance are two commonly investigated areas of psychological research, yet a minimal number of studies have been conducted that examine the specific factors that contribute to the development and performance of psychologists.  The purpose of this study was to understand and describe elements of emotional intelligence and self-efficacy that was hypothesized to develop during doctoral psychology education and that ultimately contributes to performance in psychologists .  The present study provided an opportunity for research data to be collected and analyzed that assisted in identifying emotional intelligence and self-efficacy in psychology doctoral students, and the role of these constructs in relation to master psychologists, who are considered the "best of the best" among psychologists (Skovholt &amp; Jennings, 1999). A pilot study was conducted on master's level mental health counseling and social work students to confirm the feasibility of the present dissertation study.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study examined 90 clinical, counseling, and school psychology doctoral students from United States doctoral graduate programs, which comprise a subset of psychologists-in-training and psychology graduate programs.  Two predictor variables (total years of graduate study and total hours of supervised clinical experience) and one criterion variable (performance-based emotional intelligence) were explored, with general self-efficacy and psychotherapy-specific self-efficacy serving as mediator variables.  The Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) was included to measure performance-based emotional intelligence.  Additionally, the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE) and Counselor Activities Self-Efficacy Scale (CASES) were used to measure the mediator variables.  These measures were chosen due to their psychometric properties and use in the previous literature.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A multiple regression analysis and multiple mediation bootstrapping analysis were performed to test the first and second research questions, respectively.  Findings revealed that supervised clinical experiences predicted higher performance-based emotional intelligence scores and that psychotherapy-specific self-efficacy and general self-efficacy were not mechanisms through which doctoral academic experiences affected performance-based emotional intelligence.  Overall, total years of graduate study and total hours of supervised clinical experience accounted for 18.9% of the variance in performance-based emotional intelligence.  Limitations of the current study, implications of the findings, and suggestions for future research are offered.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Adults enrolled in basic education exhibit poor academic performance, often reading at elementary and middle-school levels. The current study investigated the similarities and differences of reading skills and eye movement behavior between a sample of low-skilled adult readers and first grade students matched on word reading skill. T-tests for matched pairs found no significant differences on language comprehension, reading comprehension, or eye movement variables. Regression analyses revealed that language comprehension made greater contributions to reading comprehension for adults (verses children) in the simple view of reading model. Processing time (gaze duration) was found to account for unique variance in both passage reading comprehension and sentence comprehension efficiency after controlling for word reading and language skills for adults. For children, processing time was only a significant predictor for sentence comprehension efficiency.</DISS_para>

      <DISS_content>
         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Retention research has been empirically studied for over 70 years (Attewell, Heil, &amp; Reisel, 2011; Bowen, 2009; Braxton, 2000; Goldrick-Rab &amp; Roksa, 2008; Nora, Barlow &amp; Crisp, 2005; Turner, 2004), yet there is minimal research describing high-risk students’ perceptions and learning that occurred after being placed on academic probation after their first semester of college and mandated to complete an academic strategies course during their second semester. The purpose of this study was to explore first-year students’ perceptions of being placed on academic probation as they adjust to college and completing a mandated academic strategies course at a large public postsecondary institution in the Southeast. This study employed grounded theory methods to understand how students interpret their academic failure after being placed on academic probation and mandated to take an academic strategy course. The research framework was guided by Tinto’s (1975) theory of student departure that suggests students who connect both academically and socially in a college environment will persist to degree attainment. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>College students may have negative experiences after entering college and experiencing academic failure, e.g., earning below a 2.0 GPA, during their first semester. Because these students are still transitioning into the academic environment, they may be at greater risk for attrition than students who have not experienced initial academic failure. This research explored 14 students’ perceptions of experiencing academic failure and their perceived learning that occurred in their second semester. Students who earn below a 2.0 GPA at this particular university are placed on academic probation and mandated to take a 1-unit (12 week) course that focuses on teaching students academic skills, such as learning strategies, time management, and self-regulation strategies, and therefore provides a unique situation to explore students’ adjustment to college.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>     Data collection consisted of individual in-depth interviews conducted with a majority Caucasian sample of 14 students in their second semester of college. The result was the emergence of a theory of college transition grounded in the perspectives and experiences of the students. Results identified ways students evaluated their experiences with academic failure and identified how students may or may not be using strategies (e.g., learning or volitional) while experiencing transition in college. The results also indicated the positive influence family relationships and academic strategies course instructors had on high-risk first-year students’ motivation to persist towards a college degree.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>     The findings are relevant for prospective first-year and current students, as well as for parents, college administrators, and faculty. This research also has implications for retention services and student affairs practice. Finally, the findings inform both theory development and future research, particularly transition theory.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The goal of this research is to understand the role, influence, and attitudes of downtown Atlanta business elites on downtown redevelopment policies. The downtown business elites has dominated the local politics of Atlanta for decades in order to achieve their redevelopment objectives. This research investigates the behavior of Atlanta business elites on downtown redevelopment policies from 1950s to 2000s in light of the 1996 Summer Olympic Games experience. This research explored the interplay between Atlanta’s downtown business elites and the city elected officials as well as other interested parties in order to analyze the power and involvement of elites on the urban policy-making process. This study is grounded in urban regime theory to analyze how the business elites of downtown Atlanta attempted to transform Atlanta from a regional-national hub into an international city using the city’s hosting of the Olympic Games as a convenient vehicle to implement their vision.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>First, the author lays out the picture in 1950s by introducing the regime actors in Atlanta and by explaining how the regime was shaped and has evolved over decades. Next, the author investigates how the business elites used the Olympics as a convenient vehicle to implement their own vision for downtown redevelopment. Finally, the author discusses the short- and long-term impacts of the Olympics on downtown Atlanta redevelopment. By establishing a connection between the Olympic bidding idea, Olympic legacy, and the changing role of downtown Atlanta business elites in urban policy-making process, this study contributes to the body of literature in urban politics by linking the regime theory and mega-event literature to expand the understanding of Atlanta’s local political power structure and the city’s policy dynamics in light of the 1996 Olympic experience.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The results indicate that the regime in Atlanta has changed since its creation because of several internal and external factors, including the relative decline of downtown Atlanta, growing and attractive competitive suburbs, and changing demographics. Local growth advocates have promoted Atlanta first as a regional, then a national, and finally an international city. The Olympic bid was a logical result of the existing regime in Atlanta seeks to transform the city into a world-stage player. Downtown Atlanta business elites sought to use the Olympics as a convenient strategy to create an international city image, reverse the declining trend of office and retail businesses in downtown, and to increase the primacy of downtown Atlanta over growing suburbs in the region. The elites seized the opportunity presented by a potential Olympic hosting in Atlanta to make promises and implement a vision that revitalizes certain downtown areas. Atlanta’s Olympic strategy gave positive results in the short-run, however did not help to increase the primacy of downtown Atlanta in the long term due to short-term focused strategies selected by downtown business elites as well as prioritized regional issues and shifted focus of business elites to regional growth. The findings suggest that regime theory has limited ability to explain the changes in governing coalition.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Following 9/11 and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, anti-Muslim prejudice and violence dramatically escalated in the United States.  We argue that a major contributor to this prejudice and aggression is endorsement of Right-wing Authoritarianism (RWA) because people high in RWA tend to respond aggressively towards groups that are perceived as threatening current societal norms particularly when they perceive that such aggression is supported by authority figures.  We posit that Americans high in RWA view Muslims as threatening traditional American norms and perceive the military action in predominantly Muslim nations as indicating approval by the U.S. government for aggression toward Muslims. Across three studies, we found consistent support for our hypotheses that RWA is associated with negative attitudes and hostile behavior toward Muslims.  The implications for the impact of RWA on prejudice toward Muslims are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Understanding of the transport phenomena in Li-air batteries is crucial for improving the performance and design of Li-air batteries. In this dissertation, the basic transport equations that govern the operation of Li-air batteries are derived by starting from the underlying mass and charge transport properties of the chemical species involved in the operation of the battery. Then, two approaches are presented to solve the transport equations. In the first approach, we use first-order approximations to derive a compact model for the discharge voltage of Li-air batteries with organic electrolyte. The model considers oxygen transport and volume change in the cathode, and Butler-Volmer kinetics at the anode and cathode electrodes, and is particularly useful to the fast prediction of the discharge voltage and specific capacities of Li-air batteries. In the second approach, we propose a finite-element model in which the basic transport equations are discretized over a finite space-time mesh and solved numerically to predict the battery characteristics under different discharge conditions and for different geometrical and physical parameters. Then, the transport equations are reexamined and improved to account for different pore microstructures, pore size distribution effects, and electron transport mechanisms through the discharge product. The different microstructures are simulated numerically and the performance of Li-air batteries is analyzed in each case. A novel hybrid model is introduced to explain the perceived transition from one microstructure to another.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>My thesis is an experimental project that explores the connection between aesthetics and meaning-formation. The inspiration for the project emerged out of my research into the work of a group of poets known as infrarrealistas, whose most famous member, Roberto Bolaño, has become one of the widely read writers of our times. In the recently published anthology titled Perros habitados por las voces del desierto (2014) Rubén Medina, a founding member of the group, explains the infrarrealistas’ artistic motivation as an attempt to capture the multiple forces that shape the subject’s identity (16); forces that operate beneath the complex symbolic systems of communication. These forces are responsible for shaping the subject’s immediate experience, or being-alive-ness.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Influenced by the group’s motivations and recent conceptualizations within the field of affect theory, the following project is an exercise in using poetry as a way to re-conceptualize the experience of being alive. Discursive formulations are avoided in an attempt to create a text whose meaning derives from its affective connection with the reader, and not from the intricate economies of meaning that limit the affective scope of academic and scholarly language. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	As a result, the following thesis upon first glance looks like the work of a mad man. Poems, citations, excerpts from books, pages from my personal diary are bundled together in a way that challenges what is commonly understood as an academic thesis. However, its validity rests in the fact that it tries to engage with current work in the field of affect theory, experimenting with aesthetics and meaning-formation, and leaving aside the discursive formulations to engage with its reader at an affective, or visceral level.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>There is an increase in the diagnosis of mental illness in the inmate population within correctional facilities in the United States. Most of these inmates are male, and many of them are fathers of minor children. Although fathers are plentiful among inmate populations, there is a lack of empirical research on incarcerated fathers, and even less on those with mental illness.  This study contributes to extant literature on incarcerated fathers by examining the effects on a type of social support (visitation) on depression symptomatology, using stress process and behavioral theory to frame the study. A handful of studies suggest that social support is linked to positive adjustment during incarceration, and positive adjustment may buffer symptoms of depression. Specifically, I addressed whether amount of visitation or type of visitor is associated with reports of depressive symptoms in a sample of 400 fathers diagnosed with depression and incarcerated with the Florida Department of Corrections. After controlling for a number of variables known to influence visitation and depression, results showed that visitation was related to a lack of increase in reports of depressive symptoms 12 months after incarceration and fewer reports of depressive symptoms. Post hoc testing revealed a significant difference between inmates receiving zero visitations and those receiving 1-5 visits. Further, results also showed that the type of visitor (spouse/girlfriend, child, or parent vs. sibling, friend, or other relative) did not specifically affect changes in depressive symptoms. Recommendations are made for future research that aim to enhance successful prison adjustment, maintenance of social support systems, and reentry policy initiatives for the incarcerated fathers suffering from depression.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Aramaic Book of Ahiqar, an ancient instruction that combines a novella and set of wise sayings, was discovered among a cache of papyri dating to the 5th c. B.C.E. belonging to a community of Judeans on the southern Egyptian Nile-island of Elephantine. The text describes a court scribe named Ahiqar who is betrayed by his nephew and successor Nadan and sentenced to deathy by the Assyrian king Esarhaddon. Ahiqar is saved, however, by his friend Nabusumiskun, the very person who is supposed to execute him. At this point the text breaks off, but it picks up again in the middle of a series of instructions, presumably from Ahiqar to his son. The content and form of these sayings share significant stylistic, thematic, and contextual similarities to the biblical wisdom corpus, particularly the book of Proverbs and the Egyptian instructions. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Much of the past century of research on Ahiqar has centered on philological, paleographical, and lexical matters in an effort to determine the text’s original language, provenance, and date. There are some very large methodological gaps. In particular, very little analysis has been done with respect to Ahiqar as a piece of literature. What is the overall message and character of Ahiqar? What is its underlying ethic? What does Ahiqar say about the divine, humanity and the cosmic order? How do the answers to each of these questions relate to the text’s material context and readership? Three primary impulses will guide this study in trying to answer these questions: (1) the Book of Ahiqar will be treated as is, thus the narratve and sayings will be interpreted together and not separated according to some diachronic-redactional analysis; (2) comparison with external sources will feature the Egyptian materials, especially the instructions, which have been largely ignored in previous studies; and (3) the message and characteristic features of Ahiqar will be measured against the backdrop of the Judean community at Elephantine.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>After a survey of previous scholarship and methodological response (Chapter 1), I begin with a literary and formal analysis of Ahiqar (Chapter 2). Narratological and other recent approaches to the Ahiqar narrative reveal a complexity in plot movement and character. Two significant aspects come to the surface: the ambiguous role of the king and the opposition drawn between Nadan and Nabusumiskun. A survey of the formal and stylistic features among the sayings demonstrates a tremendous amount of variety and yet at the same time a significant amount of coherency and overlap, indicating that a saying’s context is integral to understanding the nuances of its meaning. The overall structure, content, and function of Ahiqar suggest that its generic background lies within the ancient instruction tradition, particularly those from Egypt. In Chapter 3, I find that the primary message of Ahiqar revolves around the power and danger of the spoken word. Discretion is generally advised. A pervasive ethic of caution undergirds this message. The text also extols the virtues of contentment and humility. In Chapter 4 I take a rhetorical approach that centers on the financial and economic advice. In contrast to several other instructions, the social outlook in Ahiqar typically appropriates the perspective of someone in financial distress or from a lower socio-economic position. Shifting to the socio-political sphere, I determine that the narrative and sayings blur ethnic boundaries, resulting in a reimagining of  community that no longer depends on strict ethnic or familial ties. Finally, I turn to anthropological and theological issues (Chapter 5). Here, I argue that Ahiqar evinces a negative anthropology, a conclusion supported by the ethic of caution and a few sayings that speak to human nature and its limits explicitly. Ahiqar’s portrayal of the divine contributes to a pervasive tone of anxiety, whereby the gods are symbols for justice but at the same time are inscrutable in their benevolence and wrath. The king, who symbolically stands at the intersection of humanity and the gods, is a similarly ambivalent figure, and, like the gods, can be terriblly and unpredictably destructive.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Bulimia nervosa (BN) is a serious eating disorder characterized by binge episodes and compensatory behaviors. It often persists for several years and is associated with increased medical complications and risk of death, underscoring the need to better understand factors maintaining this disorder. Weight suppression (WS), the difference between one's highest previous and current weight, has been found to predict both the onset and maintenance of BN. However, no studies have examined mechanisms that may account for the effects of WS on BN. We hypothesized that high WS would lead to reduced leptin levels. Reduced leptin may increase risk of binge eating, given leptin's role in modulating reward responses, including responses to food. The current study examined the relationship between WS, leptin levels, and the reinforcing value of food in women with BN (n=32) and non-eating disorder controls (n=30). Participants provided information on WS, completed a fasting blood draw to obtain serum leptin, and completed a novel progressive ratio task to measure the reinforcing value of food. Individuals with BN had significantly greater WS (p=.001) and reinforcing food value (p=.01) compared to controls. Additionally, higher WS was associated with both lower leptin (p=.02) and increased reinforcing value of food (p&lt;.01). Contrary to our hypotheses, BN and control participants did not differ on leptin levels, and leptin levels were not associated with the reinforcing value of food. Overall, findings support that efforts to conform to the thin ideal may alter drive to consume rewarding foods and leave women vulnerable to binge episodes; however, the mechanisms through which WS contributes to food reward and binge eating remain unknown. Given limitations of the current study, future studies should use longitudinal designs and examine other hormones (e.g., ghrelin and glucagon-like peptide 1) to better understand factors driving associations between WS and bulimic symptoms.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Human mesenchymal stem cells are a class of adult multipotent cells that are of interest to researchers for their clinical potential. While this cell type has been intensely investigated, there is still a significant amount to be learned about how these cells function. The presented studies utilized small molecular compounds to investigate the abilities of hMSCs. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Project one investigated the roles matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play in adipogenic differentiation of hMSCs. MMPs are a family of metzincin proteinases that cleave the extracellular matrix (ECM), an activity that is critical to the differentiation process. These studies utilized the novel YHJ series of mercaptosulfonamide-based MMP inhibitors, which display high selectivity and potency for intermediate and deep pocket MMPs. Differentiation assays, kinetic assays, and qPCR were employed to characterize these inhibitors and determine their affect upon adipogenesis. Even though the YHJ MMPIs are not as stable as the hydroxamate-based MMPI GM6001, they produced comparable effects. Reduction in Lipid accumulation was also comparable to inhibition of peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) with the antagonist T0070907. Moreover, MMP inhibition was able to suppress lipid accumulation in cells co-treated with Troglitazone, a potent agonist of PPARγ. This is important as MMP inhibition is a potential avenue for obesity treatment research. Finally, the selectivity provided by the YHJ MMPIs allowed for the identification of MMP-3 (stromelysin-1) as a possible regulator of adipogenesis.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Project two investigated hMSC resistance to the apoptotic effects of chemotherapeutic drugs. This has been of major interest, as hMSCs can confer resistance to tumor microenvironments. However, the effects of internalized chemotherapeutics upon hMSCs remain largely unexplored. Cellular viability and proliferation assays, combined with different biochemical approaches, were used to investigate the effects of Paclitaxel exposure upon hMSCs. The results indicate that hMSCs are highly resistant to the cytotoxic effects of Paclitaxel treatment, even though there was no detectable expression of the efflux pump P-glycoprotein, the usual means by which a cell resists Paclitaxel treatment. Moreover, Paclitaxel treatment induces hMSCs to adopt a non-proliferative fibroblastic state, as evidenced by changes to morphology, cellular markers, and a reduction in differentiation potential that is not directly coupled to the cytoskeletal effects of Paclitaxel. Taken together, these results show that Paclitaxel treatment does not induce apoptosis in hMSCs, but does induce quiescence and phenotypic changes.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The timing and mechanisms responsible for the expansion of C4 grasses have been a topic of considerable debate over the last two decades. Although abundant evidence indicates that there was a worldwide, rapid increase in C4 ecosystems (RICE) in the late Miocene, recent studies from the Great Plains and the Barstow Formation suggest that there may have been a significant amount of C4 biomass prior to the RICE event. This study examines stable carbon isotopic ratios of herbivore tooth enamel of 89 individuals from the Dove Spring Formation of southern California, which is geographically close to and geologically younger than the Barstow Formation. Taxa analyzed in this study include the Antilocapridae, Castoridae, Camelidae, Equidae, Gomphotheriidae, Merycoidodontidae, and Rhinocerotidae families. The enamel δ13C values of all taxa sampled are -10.1 ± 1.1 ‰ (n=89), ranging from -13.3 to -6.7 ‰. Most studies have used -8 ‰ as the cutoff for a pure C3 diet. However, a cutoff value of -8 ‰ for a pure C3 diet is reliant on the modern atmospheric δ13C value. Proxy data indicate that the δ13C value of atmospheric CO2, the carbon source of terrestrial plants, has varied significantly in the geologic past, leading to corresponding changes in the δ13C of plants and ultimately tooth enamel. The estimated δ13C value of atmospheric CO2 in the middle to late Miocene was -5.8 ± 0.2 ‰, making the pure C3 diet cutoff value higher than the modern value by ~2 ‰. With a higher end member δ13C value for a pure C3 diet, much of the reported evidence of an early spread of C4 grasses in areas such as the Great Plains and southern California may be a false signal from water-stressed C3 plants and the amount of C4 biomass in the geologic past may have been greatly over-estimated. After accounting for the changes in the δ13C of atmospheric CO2, enamel-δ13C values from the Dove Spring Formation indicate that late Miocene herbivores in the area had primarily C3 diets and lived in an environment dominated by C3 plants. Re-evaluation of previously published enamel-δ13C data from the nearby Barstow Formation to account for the carbon isotopic difference between the middle Miocene and modern atmospheric CO2 also shows that herbivores living in the area in the middle Miocene had C3-based diets. Serial isotope data from the teeth from the Dove Spring Formation revealed little or no intra-tooth δ13C variations, confirming that these ancient herbivores consumed C3 plants year round. The lack of seasonal signal in the carbon isotope data of the serial samples provides further evidence that there were little or no C4 plants in local habitats of southern California in the middle and late Miocene. If the C4 photosynthetic pathway did spread to southern California prior to the rapid increase in C4 ecosystems in the late Miocene the herbivore taxa sampled did not incorporate C4 biomass into their diets, possibly as a result of selective feeding. The results of the stable carbon isotopic analysis, along with the evidence from the rock record, the life habits of the fossil taxa present—both grazers and browsers—indicate that the area had a very different environment in the late Miocene. The carbon isotope data suggest that the environment in the El Paso Basin in the middle to late Miocene was likely consisted of diverse habitats including C3 grasslands, wooded C3 grasslands, and riparian forests.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The lithostratigraphy, depositional environment, and diagenetic history of the Lower and Upper Cretaceous rocks have been studied from TEC DIW-1 deep well drilled in the Polk County, Florida. A total of 47 samples were obtained from the core and cuttings in the study area. Microscopic examination of core and samples of drill cuttings from the well provided the basic data associated with the part of the stratigraphic section discussed in the study. Four lithostratigraphic units have been distinguished; (1) the Pine Key Formation, (2) the Atkinson Formation included in the Gulf Series, (3) the Dollar Bay Formation, and (4) the undifferentiated Panther Camp, Rookery Bay and Corkscrew Swamp formation included in the Comanche Group. Carbonate rocks of the study area were classified on the basis of their original depositional texture as outlined by Dunham (1962) and identified facies were compared with standard microfacies types according to Wilson (1975) and Flugel (1982). The determined microfacies of the Pine Key Formation include mudstone and peloidal fossiliferous wackestone suggesting deposition under relatively shallow marine environments. Restricted shelf lagoon to tidal areas are generally suggested environments that reflect deposition settings within shallow marine inner shelf conditions. The undifferentiated Panther Camp, Rookery Bay and Corkscrew Swamp Formation includes five microfacies involving peloidal foraminferal packstone, foraminiferal grainstone, peloidal wackestone, fossiliferous packstone, and dolomitized foraminiferal wackestone. The shallow marine inner shelf settings are also interpreted for this part of the sequence. Shallow marine shelf lagoon to restricted shelf lagoon areas are the environments representing depositional settings of the Dollar Bay Formation that includes the microfacies of intraclastic foraminiferal packstone, foraminiferal wackestone, peloidal foraminiferal packstone, fossiliferous grainstone, algal packstone, and arenaceous peloidal fossiliferous packstone. Microcrystalline marine calcite, pore-filling sparry, isopochaous, as well as pore-filling bladed cements, fabric selective secondary porosity including types of moldic and intraparticle, micritization, dolomitization by aggrading neomorphism or selective replacement dolomitization are the main diagenetic features of the Pine Key, undifferentiated Panther Camp, Rookery Bay and Corkscrew Swamp, and Dollar Bay Formations. On the basis of these features, meteoric phreatic, mixing zone, and marine phreatic diagenetic indicators have been identified.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Empathy is conceptualized a multi-dimensional construct that underlies aspects of prosocial human behavior (Davis, 1980). Historic conceptualizations of psychopathy posit that the characteristic callous disregard for others associated with psychopathic traits may be due, in part, to deficient empathic responses (Blair et al., 2006). The current study examined the differential relationship between symptomatic features of psychopathy and facets of empathy measured via self-report and behavioral performance on computer tasks in a mixed gender undergraduate student sample (N=66). Within this sample, meanness, a facet of psychopathy that encompasses a cold and callous interpersonal style, demonstrated the strongest negative associations with self-reported facets of empathy. Meanness was also uniquely associated with decreased accuracy in recognizing fearful faces. Across behavioral tasks, weak associations were found between behavioral indices of empathy and self-reported empathy, leading to concern regarding the construct validity of these behavioral tasks. Taken together, these findings extend and clarify the nomological networks of both psychopathy and empathy by bridging domains of measurement.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>To declaim publicly is an old dramatic practice that requires of its performer a mastery of communicative clarity and confidence, or at least the appearance of it. The orchestral performance tradition is in many ways analogous to this practice: it is long-standing and inseparably public, and it demands both emotive and technical mastery of its performers to effectively convey the sentiment of the works played. Likewise, the impression of confidence is imperative—there is little room for the timid performer on the orchestral stage. Nor is there forgiveness for the timid composer or for the composer who communicates ineffectively. In this respect, a composition whose musical ideas form a coherent, logical flow is valuable. Declamation’s composition is thus in no small part concerned with the logical flow of ideas from one passage to the next—the carefully crafted organization of contrast and similarity that is at the heart of countless symphonic masterworks.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To fill the void left by the preclusion of contrasting key areas fundamental to the opening movements of so many staples of tonal symphonic literature, Declamation comprises a fundamental conflict between other dramatically effective parameters: it presents a struggle between the chromatic and the quasi-diatonic, between the densely contrapuntal and the uniquely melodic, between the aggressive and the subdued. As in first movements of tonal symphonies, the narrative shape of Declamation is concerned with the mediation of these fundamental dichotomies. The formal shape that results from these dichotomies and their mediation is not a “sonata form,” and to claim it as such would lessen the value of the term. However, the narrative shape of Declamation is one that attempts to recreate the dramatic allure, the inevitable yet captivating resolution of conflict that is the charm of the sonata-form movement, as evidenced by so many magnificent works of the symphonic genre.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The overall focus of this study is the wellbeing of African descent bisexual women (ABW), within three interrelated main areas of inquiry: social support, health care, and resources for resilience. Due to the history of the dispersal of African people, compounded by marginalization of African descent bisexual women, this united cross-national research strategy was intended to transcend historical divides and bring more attention to these women's concerns.  The cross-national design was also intended to highlight similarities and contrast differences in countries with different health care systems, toward increasing understandings of the women's experiences.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The qualitative research method of grounded analysis guided this study. The researcher completed individual face-to-face semi-structured in-depth interviews with six self-identified ABW in the US in 2013, and with eight women in the UK in 2014. The researcher's original intention was to implement a study inclusive of women living with HIV (WLWHA).  However, without WLWHA participants, information on their life experiences was not able to be gathered during this study.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The researcher gathered and analyzed information about ABW life experiences related to resources and quality of social support and health care when bisexual identity is and is not disclosed. The women were also asked about resources that sustain them and support resiliency. Eleven subthemes emerged from the data, related to four main themes.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The participants spoke of their intersectional identities, and needs for affirming social support and culturally competent health care.  The participants made recommendations toward creating more inclusive and supportive environments for delivery of health and social care. The women's needs include: Access to quality physical and mental health care; Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and intersex (LGBTQI) inclusive nondiscrimination policies posted in agency settings; more LGBTQI-identified providers; universal HIV and STD screening;  information about healthy relationships, especially on how to communicate assertively about sexual health with a female partner; and inclusive social services that acknowledge the families of sexual minority women.  Participants also shared about activities of resilience, including their writing and activism for socioeconomic justice. The findings are intended to increase diversity awareness and sensitivity among health and social care providers.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to explore how asking for general music preferences compares to asking for music preferences that relate to the intended objective (in this case, relaxation), and to determine if one of these types of preferred music was more effective than the other in eliciting relaxation. Participants, who were undergraduate non-music majors (N = 71), took part in a music listening study in which their perceived relaxation and galvanic skin response (GSR) levels were recorded. Participants were placed in one of three groups: the participant-selected preferred music group (PM), the participant-selected preferred relaxing music group (PRM), or the unfamiliar, non-preferred music group (NPM). Results indicate that participants in the PM and PRM groups experienced significant increases in perceived relaxation and significant decreases in GSR levels, but there was not a significant difference between the two groups in the amount of change. Therefore, preferred music and preferred relaxing music appear equally effective in increasing relaxation responses. These findings provide support for the continued use of patient-preferred music in music therapy settings and offer alternative suggestions for assessing music preferences.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The prospect of SG is green, power efficient, and economical to its customers. Many emerging innovations have reached a consensus that the traditional power grids need to be combined with modern data networks, in order to establish a new platform that supports distributed renewable energy devices, electrical measuring sensors, and intelligent energy management and control systems, etc. For example, an energy management system is proposed to connect data aggregators with renewable energy devices in the network area. A wireless sensor network is used to provide the communications between SG data centers and consumers, and manage residential energy with an optimization-based scheme. In SG, the stability of an energy management scheme becomes heavily dependent on accurate real-time communications among intelligent energy management agencies in residential homes, micro-grids, and main grids.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Within a large-scale distributed (or centralized) smart grid (SG), the communication network is designed to connect multiple power management systems and collect data from hundreds or thousands of power sensors over a wide geographical area. One dominant feature of innovated SG communication network is that one power device is coupled with a single Ethernet or non-Ethernet communication agent to exchange control state or management information with others. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Generally speaking, an intelligent agent helps its corresponding power device negotiating with other peers to dynamically form an ad-hoc group through the data network infrastructures. Then, many meaningful power management algorithms are operated in the logical group. The grouping topology recognized by a specific agent needs to reform when the participating group members can not satisfy the demand from operating power management algorithms. Upon our ad-hoc ideas, the main problem arises: in a changed group, the networking size, traffic load, queueing effect and security requirement are varied, so an agent experiences different communication cost over group reforming. We define such inevitable difference as communication inconsistency of SG ad-hoc grouping. If the timeout parameters of communication control are set statically in grouping procedures, the inconsistency definitely triggers the timeout, crashes the group and aborts the running cycle of power management algorithms very often. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Thus in this work, an adaptive timing solution is developed for connecting distributed intelligent agents in ad-hoc manner to greatly enhance the flexibility and performance of grouping algorithms in SG communication network. A timing adaptive grouping (TAG) protocol is proposed to make every distributed agent capable of adjusting its operational timing configurations (OTCs) in pace with the changing of ad-hoc groups, so that prevents the harmfulness of communication inconsistency to the stability of grouping procedures. More specifically, we first develop a set of queueing model to describe the network traffic of various power management applications among distributed agents in connection with different scale of ad-hoc grouping topologies. Second, the security cost of SG communications is modeled, estimated and validated with various grouping agents' characteristics. Third, based on the network grouping model including both queueing and security cost, we analyze the ad-hoc delay performance and illustrate that the model can be used to predict the average operating delays of networking agents. Fourth, based on the delay parameters derived from previous modeling, the TAG protocol is developed with our Smart Timing Adaptive (STA) algorithm to facilitate each distributed agent dynamically judging variant ad-hoc grouping conditions. Finally, we have implemented a validation testbed with the capabilities of integrated real-time communication and power exchange to demonstrate the ad-hoc grouping operation of SG power management applications. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Due to the ripple effect of inconsistent communication delays among the ad-hoc SG groups with dynamic changing topology, the network performance becomes a major concern to support power management applications. To deal with that, in a large NSF project of Future Renewable Electric Energy Delivery and Management (FREEDM), we implement a SG prototype, called the FREEDM Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testbed. The so-called Distributed Grid Intelligences (DGIs) act as the distributed intelligent agents in the SG prototype which can group specific peers to exchange power load among power demands and supplies. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>There are also many other existing works contributing a variety of platforms to integrate power and communication systems. But, in our FREEDM project, we build a SG testbed, which is a new platform that combines an HIL power system and a real-time communication system. The power system devices are managed by the DGIs that are connected into the communication networks. The DGIs act as intelligent energy management agencies for the power system, while information nodes for the communication networks. The DGI instances are coded on embedded computer boards with processing and communication capabilities.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A DGI represents its power device to communicate with other DGI instances or DGI nodes. DGIs being connected in LAN and WAN may be grouped together to meet the power demand and supply requirement. A DGI group may cover a LAN, or a LAN and WAN simultaneously, depending on the location of DGI nodes. When electrical faults isolate a section from the power system, in communicational sense, the section is still connected to and can exchange the information of grid states with other sections in the power system. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The real-time and HIL features of the testbed are reflected in the design of both power and communication systems. To implement the concept of HIL in the power system, some power devices are implemented by real-world electrical hardware, while other devices are simulated in the Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS) platform. To implement the concept of HIL in the communication system for the DGIs, the DGI LANs are implemented by Ethernet switches, while the DGI WAN is simulated in real-time by OPNET, a network simulator program. Within OPNET, there is a system-in-the-loop (SITL) interface that interprets DGI traffic between real packet formats and simulated formats.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>After World War II, globalization impacted both, higher education and student affairs.  As a result, both increased efforts to internationalize campuses, academics, and student services.  The purpose of this research is to examine how student affairs responded to the internationalization in higher education during 1951 to 1996 in the United States (US).  Documents and oral histories provided a narrative of how professionals, institutions, and professional associations, specifically the major student affairs associations, ACPA: College Student Educators International; NASPA: Student Affairs Administrators in Higher Education; and the National Association of Women Educators (NAWE), evolved over this 45 year time period.  This research highlights the importance of concurrent and grassroots movements, professional experience, and institutional and associational influence that led to a "tipping point" in 1995 and 1996.  Each of these main themes contributes to the larger story of the internationalization in student affairs in the US.  Post 1996 student affairs has continued to internationalize as literature and collaborative relationships among professional associations worldwide highlight differences and similarities of student affairs and services across the globe.  This research provides a horizontal history for the internationalization in student affairs in the US until 1996; however, it highlights a need for further research in the history of student affairs, student affairs and services around the world, and the current state of internationalization of student affairs and services.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of the present study was to determine if naturalistic language intervention could be effective in a Child and Youth Care Center (CYCC) in South Africa to prevent and to treat potential impairments in orphan’s communication. In the study, the communication styles of Zulu Child and Youth Care Workers (CYCW) were explored. Given the cultural, linguistic, and socioeconomic barriers associated with the intervention, the study also aimed to ascertain the challenges to providing language rich opportunities in residential care programs. A single case, multiple baseline design across participants was employed to determine the effectiveness of coaching on CYCWs’ frequency of language facilitation strategy use. Qualitative analyses were employed to identify participant characteristics, barriers to implementation and to assess the study’s social validity. Despite barriers to implementation, the CYCWs made changes in their style of communication that have been shown to be more supportive of children's early language learning. Coaching use of language facilitation (LF) strategies was found to be socially valid for use in this CYCC in Durban, South Africa. This study demonstrates the viability of coaching CYCWs to embed LF strategies within daily routines. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Anxiety disorders contribute substantially to the overall public health burden of psychopathology.  Anxiety sensitivity (AS), a fear of anxiety related sensations, is one of the few known malleable risk factors for anxiety pathology.  Previous AS reduction treatments have utilized highly trained clinicians or graduate students.  A completely computerized AS treatment would reduce costs and increase dissemination possibilities.  An emerging set of computerized treatments for anxiety known as cognitive bias modification for interpretation biases (CBM-I) have shown clinically significant reductions in anxiety symptoms.  Another emerging literature focused on memory consolidation in fear learning has shown that simple augmentations can increase treatment response.  The current study evaluated a CBM-I for AS. The incremental and interactive effects of cortisol augmentation via a cold-pressor challenge were also examined.  Participants were 89 individuals with elevated levels of AS who completed an intervention appointment, as well as one-week and one-month follow-up assessments.  Results indicated that the CBM-I for AS was successful in reducing overall AS (55% post-treatment) and these reductions were maintained through one-month post-intervention (64%).  Results also revealed that individuals in the active condition reported significantly less incidents of panic responding to a physiological straw-breathing challenge and that change in interpretation bias significantly mediated the relationship between CBM-I treatment condition and post-treatment AS reductions.  However, results indicated no incremental or interactive effect of the cold-pressor. Taken together, the results show that the current CBM-I intervention was superior to previous AS interventions in terms of immediate and one-month AS reductions.  Given its brevity, low-cost, and portability this intervention may be useful in reducing the societal burden of anxiety disorders.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation stems from an ethnographic experience, i.e., a course on the Six Healing Sounds of Qigong taught by Dr Yu Zhang, which I and other students attended in 1991 in Los Angeles, California. The course led to the following questions: What is qigong? What are the Six Healing sounds? Are the claims of this healing tradition to ancient origins accurate? These questions led to the following conclusions: Qigong is indeed a practice of ancient origins, albeit one that comes from different streams of Daoist and medical practices. Its name is a recent design by the Chinese government in the early 1950’s, with the ulterior goal of creating an effective, low cost health care system rooted in Chinese culture.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Apart from the answers provided above, I argue that qigong is a body technology that uses slow, gentle exercises, visualizations and standing and sitting meditations to elicit a state of reverie, a liminal or altered state of consciousness that is conducive to bodily, mental and spiritual experiences and transformation.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>	Sickle cell disease is a group of inherited blood disorders in which the hemoglobin of the red blood cells is abnormal, cause the shape of the cell to be sickle, and cause severe pain. The purposes of this study were to discover if music therapy could decrease pain, anxiety, and heart rate, while increasing mood and oxygen saturation. Hospital inpatients (N=30) between the ages of four to fourteen participated in a two day randomized control study. Participants were either randomized into the experimental portion of the study and received a thirty minute music therapy session (N=15), or in the portion with no intervention (N=15). A pre and post-test was administered on each day for both groups patients were asked about their pain, anxiety and mood, and the heart rate and oxygen saturation were taken down. An exit survey was given to those in the experimental group. Results indicated that the music therapy session did have a statistically significant decrease on heart rate (p=.024) and increase in oxygen saturation (p=.048) from pre-to post-session on both days. No other significant differences were found. Implications for future research studies and clinical practice are examined.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Homelessness is a complex issue that impacts families in many ways.  One pathway of addressing homelessness among families has been the use of transitional housing programs. Previous research demonstrates the importance of social support among homeless parents, including their involvement in transitional housing programs.  While these programs may serve as a support for families experiencing homelessness, little is known about the lived experiences of social support among homeless parents including their strengths and challenges.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to understand if and how social support is an important resource for families experiencing homelessness.  More specifically, this study aimed to explore the social support networks of families living in transitional housing, including their immediate families and non-homeless friends and family members, and the challenges they experience in accessing these supports.  In addition, this study sought to understand if and how transitional housing programs may act as a support for homeless families and the challenges that accompany this.  Finally, this study aimed to understand homeless families' perceptions of other needed supports within their housing program.  Both ecological systems theory and structural family therapy were used as guiding frameworks in this study.  These theories provided both a detailed look at family life and relationships and also a broader lens to view the family within their environment and larger context. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Using a qualitative design, data for this study were collected through in-depth semi-structured interviews.  Participants included 20 parents living in transitional housing with at least one child.  Interviews were conducted to assess parents' experiences in transitional housing, their social support networks, and their suggestions for change.  An ethnographic framework supported by constant comparative analysis was used to analyze the data.  This included the process of open, axial, and selective coding.  Trustworthiness was promoted through the use of observation data for triangulation as well as several other measures.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Results revealed themes related to parents' isolation from support, parents' family as a source of strength, and the impact of the program on their support network.  Parents also identified several additional support needs including employment services, interpersonal supports, increased services for children, and increased awareness of and access to supports.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This paper examines a series of light metaphors in Goethe’s Faust. The purpose is to display a connection between each light metaphor and major developments in Faust’s character, namely his development from a restless scholar imprisoned in his study to a blind man shortly before his death. The order in which the light metaphors are introduced is not chronological; rather they follow a thematic sequence from night to day to night. The purpose of this particular progression is to show more clearly Faust’s movement from one mindset to the next. The order, moonlight to rising sun to rainbow to setting sun to inner light, reinforces much of what is claimed in this paper’s main argument.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	I assert that a series of light metaphors are connected to Faust as the subjective extensions and expressions of his thoughts about the nature of knowledge and man’s place in relation to the Absolute in the wake of series of trials and tribulations. Furthermore, I argue that these light metaphors, when connected thematically as opposed to chronologically, trace the cyclical nature of Faust’s, and possibly man’s, intellectual enterprise. This thesis combines my own interpretation of the main text with those of other major scholars in the field in order to best argue my points. In the end it will be shown that the various light metaphors are connected to Faust’s personal development and display the perennial disposition of human activity as he searches for truth and knowledge in a world of uncertainty.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Currently, more sophisticated techniques such as factor analyses are frequently applied in primary research thus may need to be meta-analyzed. This topic has been given little attention in the past due to its complexity. Because factor analysis is becoming more popular in research in many areas including education, social work, social science, and so on, the study of methods for the meta-analysis of factor analyses is also becoming more important. The first main purpose of this dissertation is to compare the results of seven different approaches to doing meta-analysis of confirmatory factor analyses. Specifically, five approaches are based on univariate meta-analysis methods. The next two approaches use multivariate meta-analysis to obtain the results of factor loadings and the standard errors of factor loadings.  The results from each approach are compared. Given the fact that factor analyses are commonly used in many areas, the second purpose of this dissertation is to explore the appropriate approach or approaches to use for the meta-analysis of factor analyses, especially Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). When the average sample size was small, the results of IRD, WMC, WMFL, and GLS-MFL approaches showed better performance than those of UMC, MFL, and GLS-MC approaches to estimating parameters. With large average sample sizes (larger than 150), the performance to estimate the parameters across all seven approaches seemed to be similar in this dissertation.  Based on my simulation results, researchers who want to conduct meta-analytic confirmatory factor analysis can apply any of these approaches to synthesize the results from primary studies it their studies have n &gt; 150.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation research aims to provide a better understanding of people’s credibility assessment of online information (i.e., Web credibility assessment), which is an important part of their information behavior. In particular, this research focuses on older adults as a research population as they are a less studied user group in the literature on information credibility. Considering the ever increasing presence of older adults on the Web and their needs for health information in their daily lives, this research explores older adults’ credibility assessment of online health information within the context of everyday life information seeking (ELIS).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The methodology employed in this research consists of a qualitative meta-study (Phase I) and semi-structured interviews (Phase II). In Phase I, the researcher analyzed 84 primary research reports on information credibility, identifying conceptual typologies of important facets of credibility assessment such as conceptualization, operationalization, variability (user characteristics and contexts), and process. Based on these conceptual typologies, the researcher proposed a new, extended framework of Web credibility assessment, named WC framework, that contains three main components, Assessment of WC—i.e., conceptualization and operationalization to measure Web credibility; Variability of WC—i.e., variables regarding individual and context; and Process of WC—i.e., the overall process of Web credibility assessment.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In Phase II, the researcher conducted semi-structured interviews with twenty-one older adults whose ages ranged from 61 to 80 (M = 70.3) in the manner of one-on-one, in-person. The purposeful sampling methods, such as convenience sampling and snowball sampling, were used to recruit older adults who meet the sampling criteria of the study: age (55 years old or older), residency (Florida residents for an in-person interview), and Internet use experience. Also, a prescreen test was carried out via a telephone interview to make sure that the participant’s cognitive function was adequate for the study. Those who met all the sampling criteria and passed the prescreen test were recruited for an in-person interview which lasted around 45 minutes.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The interview data revealed that older adults needed health/wellness information regarding medication and supplements, symptoms of and cures for specific diseases, medical quality assurance, health insurance, nutrition, and exercise. In seeking health information, they used both interpersonal and online sources. As for the interpersonal sources, the research participants mentioned medical professionals (e.g., doctors and physicians), partners, family, and friends. On the Web, they referenced information from non-profit (i.e., non-commercial) institutions’ websites such as government websites (e.g., NIH, CDC) and university hospitals’ websites (e.g., Johns Hopkins Medicine, Harvard Medical School). The most frequently mentioned commercial website was WebMD. Depending on the purposes of health information seeking, some interviewees mentioned that they used pharmacists’ websites (e.g., Walgreens and CVS). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>When judging the credibility of online health information, they employed various cues/markers and heuristics that are related to the attributes of the operator (i.e., source), content (i.e., message), and design (i.e., media) of Web resources. Based on the new framework developed in Phase I, the informants’ Web credibility assessment process was characterized with the two stages: initial and final evaluations.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Lastly, both theoretical and empirical implications of the research and future research directions were discussed. Specifically, the new Web credibility assessment framework (i.e., the WC framework) advanced our understanding of the conceptualization of Web credibility and can be used as a knowledge resource in developing context specific credibility assessment models as well as information system interfaces that provide effective support for information credibility evaluation by users. Likewise, findings from the semi-structured interviews can inform online information system developers and librarians about how older users search for online health information and how they assess its credibility. Ultimately, the findings of this research should help the development of more effective online systems, services, and, training modules that are aligned with the online information behaviors of this rapidly growing, important user population—i.e., older adults.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In 1917 America found itself embroiled in a worldwide battle concerning the identities and rights of nations. It was all of a sudden required to re-think its ethnic and cultural identity in the light of both its “melting pot” origins and the new nationalized standards for moral goodness and badness (enemy countries were now seen as unquestionably morally bad, allies morally good). One aspect of American culture that was particularly confused by this transition was the music world. American music culture, and especially art or “classical” music culture, had been founded on a deep-seated appreciation for the German tradition. German performers, composers, theorists, historians, critics, and, most of all, repertoire were embraced and beloved by Americans. In fact, many musicians were what we might call “hyphenated” Americans, first- or second-generation German immigrants who made music their livelihood in America. What’s more, in the years leading up to the war, America had developed a widespread understanding of the moral nature of music that was based largely on national musical styles. Popular thought proclaimed that music was a distinctly moral art and that Italian and French styles represented its lowest moral output. German musical style, on the other hand, fulfilled music’s highest potential to be morally good. When in 1917 this understanding collided with the unwavering declaration that Germany (and its cultural output) was the enemy, the embodiment of evil, American music culture responded with understandable confusion and vehemence. Robberies, lootings, bomb threats, riots, trials, restraining orders, police presence, mass demonstrations, internments, and deportations plagued German-American and German musicians, as well as those who dared to perform German repertoire. Many of these incidents can be seen within the sociological framework of “moral panic,” Stanley Cohen’s description of cultural events that represent disproportionate responses to supposed moral threats. To study them adequately is to see them not only as interesting stories but as signposts pointing to deeper cultural issues and insecurities. In the wake of these wartime and post-wartime moral panics, America was forced to re-examine its conceptions of musical morality, as well as its relationship to German performers and repertoire. Although it reincorporated German culture quite quickly following the war, it did so self-consciously, with a newfound desire to expand its national boundaries to include American, British, and French repertoire and performers into its core. This diversity of styles found its greatest success as part of the new valuing of plurality that came with modernism. Furthermore, America’s distinct ability to incorporate and celebrate pluralism helped it to become the new world center for art music in the twentieth century despite its long-term struggle to create its own distinct musical style.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study examined the relationship between fathers' engagement patterns and children's cognitive development in early childhood. The study specifically examined fathers' home engagement patterns based on their engagement in caregiving, play, and literacy activities when children were around 9-month-old and 24-month-old, and children's later cognitive development in preschool in relation to their fathers' engagement patterns as measured earlier.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study used multiple data sources from Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort (ECSL-B). These sources included 9-month self-administered resident father survey (N=5,700), 2-year self-administered resident father survey (N=4,300), direct child assessment (N=4,850), and parent interviews. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The current study found that there were differences in fathers' actual engagement based on child's gender when infants were around 9-months old. Although majority of father classes were similar for boys and girls, there were two distinct groups of fathers who exhibited different engagement patterns for boys and girls. The results for father-toddler engagement patterns were more consistent across genders. Initial gender-separated analysis showed only minor differences in item response probabilities meaning the disparity of fathers' engagement patterns based on gender mostly disappear when their children are around 2 years old.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The results suggested that fathers who had the highest likelihood of engaging their infant children had generally negative effect on girls' literacy and mathematics scale score in preschool. Additionally, 2-year fathers' engagement classes did not predict children's mathematics and literacy performance in preschool after controlling for family, child and father characteristics. This study concludes with limitations and recommendations for future research.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Latent class analysis (LCA) results confirmed differences in fathers' actual engagement based on child's gender in their infancy. Fathers with the highest likelihood of engaging their infant children had generally negative effect on girls' literacy and mathematics scale score in preschool. The LCA results for father-toddler engagement patterns were more consistent across genders. The disparity of fathers' engagement patterns based on gender mostly disappear when children are around 2 years old. Although fathers' engagement with their toddlers had far less negative effects on children's cognitive development when compared to their engagement with their infants, this effect was more salient for girls' literacy and mathematics performance.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Several factors overshadowed the effects of father engagement patterns. Among them were SES, ethnicity and mother involvement index. Specifically, SES level in 9-month and 2-year had greater impact on children's cognitive development in preschool. The results showed that father engagement patterns can have varying effects for different ethnic groups and mothers' actual engagement with their children. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The findings of this study have potential to impact on policy makers, parents and researchers in different ways. Policy makers can benefit while dealing with policies governing the regulations of parents involvement in early years, parents can use the findings as guide for their child rearing practices and last but not least researchers can use the findings for designing further studies to look into effects of  father engagement on children' development.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Airline mergers allow carriers to restructure routes to create an improved network configuration, providing efficiency gains that are passed through in various ways to consumers. The gains and losses from network changes are assessed following three different mergers: America West with US Airways in 2005, Northwest with Delta in 2008, and Continental with United in 2010. Recognizing airlines introduce fluctuations in airline route structure on a regular basis for reasons unrelated to mergers, the consumer surplus change is contrasted with a baseline of network system changes that occur in markets unaffected by the merger. Merger-affected markets show welfare gains relative to unaffected markets.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Evaluating airline mergers from a prospective standpoint poses unique challenges due to the uncertainty of adjustments in the network of route offerings that are likely to occur in response to the integration of the merging carriers. Machine learning techniques (e.g. Random Forest) are employed from a purely predictive standpoint to simulate route adjustments. The mergers above are used to evaluate the effectiveness of these techniques. A prospective merger analysis is also provided for the US Airways and American Airlines merger in 2014 since it is too early at this time to evaluate the post-merger outcomes.  Welfare simulations allowing only airfares to change are compared with price and network simulations. The results indicate that only accounting for price changes due to merger understates possible benefits that come from improved route adjustments. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para> Concerns of reduced competition from the Department of Justice regarding the United and Continental merger resulted in a negotiated transfer of 36 slots to Southwest airlines at Newark Liberty International airport, impacting both fare and route options. By acquiring the slots, Southwest entered about half the markets at Newark. This fact is used to implement a difference-in-difference-in-difference method that isolates the price impact of the slot transfer from confounding influences. Results suggest that the slot transfer led to a fare reduction of 7\%. A broader range of product characteristics is incorporated when estimating the change in consumer surplus. Nonetheless, results indicate positive welfare gains from the slot transfer.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation provides evidence that changes in network characteristics provide important benefits of mergers. A broadened perspective of merger analysis if important to more accurately determine who benefits and who is harmed.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This study explores the roles of salesperson characteristics and influence tactics on converting customer commitments to sales fulfillments. A sample of 258 salesperson-customer interactions revealed that by offering recommendations and exchanging information with customers, salespeople can increase the propensity for customer’s purchase commitments to actually be fulfilled. Conversely, it was discovered that by utilizing threats, promises, ingratiation, or inspirational influence tactics, salespeople fail to convert commitments into fulfillments. Additionally, long-term orientation, customer orientation, and adaptive selling behaviors were not found to have an impact on the commitment-fulfillment relationship.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	These result extent sales influence research in two main ways. First, it is demonstrated that salespeople who are “experts” are most likely to achieve successful sales fulfillments. Second, managers can apply this by teaching salespeople to be experts. In other words, effective salespeople can be taught, they are not merely “born” effective or not effective.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Wave-driven transport, also known as Stokes drift, is the motion of a particle due to the orbital motion induced by a passing wave.  This orbital motion does not form closed loops, leading to a net displacement over a single wave period.  Stokes drift has previously been qualitatively shown to be a factor in ocean surface particle transport, with most studies focused exclusively in near-shore regions. However, Stokes drift has never been quantified beyond theoretical studies and case studies limited to small regions. Here, Stokes drift is calculated directly from Wavewatch III model data in the Gulf of Mexico for April-July 2010. Its magnitudes are compared between deep and shelf water areas, and against the magnitudes of surface currents and parameterized wind drift. These comparisons are also made specifically for the time period surrounding the passage of Hurricane Alex through the southwestern Gulf of Mexico. While there is not a major difference between the absolute magnitudes of Stokes drift in shelf vs. deep water areas or when compared to wind drift, Stokes drift is larger in shelf water areas relative to surface currents than in deep water. During Hurricane Alex, Stokes drift magnitudes were much larger in the immediate area of the storm, while in the oil spill area there was little change until after the storm was out of the Gulf, at which time swell had propagated into the region, increasing Stokes drift magnitudes.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>According to objectification theory, western culture is saturated with dominant views of heterosexuality as well as the overt sexualization of the female body. As such, women are acculturated to internalize sexually objectifying experiences leading to psychosocial distress in the form of shame, anxiety, a lack of body responsiveness, and an inability to experience peak motivational states. Evidence suggests self-objectification can increase the risk for various mental and behavioral health problems that differentially affect women, namely substance use to appear sexually attractive or to cope with an objectified body consciousness. To test this theory, 348 college women from one southeastern university were surveyed using five previously validated scales. Structural equation modeling was used to explore pathways between latent constructs. A confirmatory factor analysis indicated the measurement model fit the data well after omission of five items. Results from the path analysis provided evidence in support of the first two hypotheses: a) the experience of being sexually objectified leads to the increased use of alcohol among college women in this sample and b) the internalization of that sexual objectification leads to the increased use of alcohol. Contrary to the third and fourth hypotheses, however, c) self-objectification did not mediate the relationship between sexual objectification and alcohol use and d) neither feelings of shame nor anxiety, a lack of body responsiveness, nor the inability to engage in peak motivational states mediated the relationship between self-objectification and alcohol use.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Power lines in distribution networks are subject to several subjects such as bad weather conditions, contact with animals, equipment malfunction, etc. These conditions may cause a fault in the power lines that may damage the devices in the network if it is not self-cleared by the protection devices present. A fault location identification method is proposed that can accurately identify the fault location within seconds so that utilities companies have a better understanding of where to mitigate the fault. The algorithm collects data from the measurements available from the smart grid devices such as Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), Reclosers, Power Quality Meters, and other smart meters present in the grid. The algorithm is suitable for distribution networks with Distributed Generation (DG) and smart measurement infrastructure that can transmit event-driven data such as pre and post-fault voltages or currents. To overcome the problem presented by the lack of metering points to know every operating condition in the system, the technique is based on State Estimation to locate the fault. The research work presents a MATLAB-based state estimation (SE) technique applied to identify the fault location in Real-Time. The validation of the method was assessed by simulating the IEEE 37 nodes test feeder as an operating distribution grid with DG with Opal-RT technology. Fault-on voltage and current from virtual smart meters measurements are gathered in Real-Time. The Real-time data from the smart meters is fed to the State Estimation algorithm to determine the fault location which is then presented in a Graphic User Interface (GUI) for the easy understanding of a utility company operator. The method was tested for different transformers configuration, a multisource distribution grid with DG presence, symmetrical and asymmetrical fault types giving the accurate location in 90% of the cases.</DISS_para>

The investigation consists of two groups: a control group and an instruction group. The instruction group participated in perception trainings while the control group did not. As this region of Spain is also bilingual, and there are no studies currently in the literature that describe the Spanish of Valencian speakers, this study also presents data from native speakers who completed the same task as the non-native speakers.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation consists of three individual studies that examine the influence of military capabilities on international conflict.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter 2 examines the influence of naval power on non-contiguous hostile disputes. I present a unique argument that links absolute naval power to international conflict through uncertainty of resolve and fears about future threats. Increasing a state's naval power increases the amount of issues they will dispute. Yet these issues are likely to be of low salience. Because the issues are of low salience defenders will be uncertain about the resolve of challengers. Additionally, because of the increase in naval power, defenders will fear future threats. Defenders that fear future threats are more likely to resist coercive threats. As such, defenders have incentives to bargain aggressively against challengers. In this case, we should be more likely to observe military disputes as challengers look to signal their resolve. Utilizing a new data set of naval power, I show that as states acquire naval strength they are more likely to initiate non-contiguous hostile disputes. Additionally, I find that contrary to realist and expected utility theory expectations, relative naval power has little influence on hostile dispute initiation. The findings have implications for the future actions of states whose naval strength is growing. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter 3 examines the influence of military parity on international conflict. Studies of power parity and conflict implicitly assume all balanced dyads are created equal. However, variation exists within the capabilities of the states in these particular dyads. I address the question of what affects the likelihood of conflict onset within relatively balanced dyads. I argue uncertainty – in particular the uncertainty of the expected costs of conflict – determines the likelihood of conflict among these dyads. More uncertainty of costs means a greater likelihood of miscalculation leading to bargaining errors. First, I argue as an opponent's capabilities increase, uncertainty of costs increase and the likelihood of conflict increases. Second, military action serves a purpose in bargaining and can help reduce uncertainty by signaling a state's willingness to inflict and endure costs in order to gain a better settlement. Third, information transmission is likely to be effective only when states have the capability to inflict significant costs. As such, while greater capabilities will lead to a high likelihood of conflict onset, they also lead to a reduced likelihood of conflict escalation. The testing of non-directed dyads from 1946 to 2001 supports the theory's implications.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter 4 examines what influences the likelihood of a war ending with an absolute outcome. Past work has focused on understanding questions about war outcomes in-terms of win, lose, or draw (Slantchev, 2004; Bennett and Stam, 1998; Stam, 1998). Yet little-to-no attention has been paid to understanding why some wars end with one side losing their ability to resist rather than a limited negotiated settlement. Here I present one of the first empirical tests for determining the likelihood of a war ending with an absolute outcome. I argue that two conditions increase the likelihood of a war reaching an absolute outcome. The difficulty and costs involve mean that a state must have the willingness and capabilities to impose such an outcome. Wars where credible commitment concerns are present gives the willingness while asymmetric power gives the capabilities to pursue an absolute outcome. The contribution of this study is to move beyond the questions of limited war outcomes to helping us understand war at its most punishing phase. Such an understanding can help identify which wars have the potential for reaching extremes, allowing the international community to attempt other solutions.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Osvaldo Golijov’s The Dreams and Prayers of Isaac the Blind for klezmer clarinet and string quartet is a reflection of the history of Judaism through means of quotation and imitation.  Best known for having forged a style that melds two cultures, Golijov uses his Jewish heritage and the Latin influence of his birthplace as a  resource for his compositional voice.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The first chapter focuses on Osvaldo Golijov’s parents, his home life, religious upbringing, and musical training.  Also, in this chapter is The Process of National Reorganization, the political corruption that plagued Argentina and Golijov’s adolescence and how it impacted Golijov’s music and influenced him to leave Argentina.  This leads into discussion of Goljiov’s discovery of his compositional voice through the fusion of the music of his Jewish and Latin backgrounds, and how his compositional style opened doors for collaborations and commissions with other artists and organizations.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To understand why Golijov would pay homage and title this piece after Isaac the Blind, information on Isaac the Blind and his influences on the Jewish people is present in the second chapter.  This chapter also includes a brief history of Klezmer music to aid those who do not possess a klezmer background in understanding the spirit and notation of this quintet.  An explanation of the High Holy Days and its connection to Klezmer music is included to determine its quotation throughout the composition.  This chapter concludes with musical examples from the original prayers and dance band music and reference to their quotation in The Dreams and Prayers of Isaac the Blind.  The intention of this document is to suggest that this piece can be performed by musicians of all ethnic backgrounds and provide the necessary information to the content in this work and the spirit in which it was written.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In 2013, Gannett Company, Incorporated acquired the Belo Corporation and its twenty broadcast television licenses (Gannett.com, 2013b). However, for seven of these television stations, outright ownership by Gannett would be in direct violation of the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) newspaper broadcast cross-ownership rule (NBCO) and the local television ownership rule, also referred to as the duopoly rule (Turner, 2014). To retain control, if not outright ownership, of these stations, Gannett entered into Joint Sale Agreements (JSAs) and Shared Service Agreements, also known as sidecar agreements, with Sander Media and Tucker Media Management, which allowed Gannett to circumvent the NBCO and duopoly rules (Malone, 2013). Specifically, the agreements concerned seven television stations in five Designated Market Areas (DMAs): Phoenix, Arizona; Tucson, Arizona; Louisville, Kentucky; St. Louis, Missouri; and Portland, Oregon. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>These DMAs raised concerns in terms of the NBCO rule and the duopoly rule because Gannett already owns and operates either a top four broadcast television station or a major daily newspaper in these areas, which critics suggest would severely impact the number of unique voices in each DMA. The research questions that this thesis addresses include: how did sidecar agreements gain traction as a business practice for broadcasters despite the NBCO and duopoly rules? How are the sidecar agreements realized specifically between Gannett, Sander, and Tucker? And, how do the sidecar agreements allow Gannett to exert undue influence on Sander and Tucker? Ultimately, this research will demonstrate the importance of the NBCO and duopoly rules in protecting the democratic function of the media.</DISS_para>

      <DISS_content>
         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In the United States, the number of people in the over 65 year category will rise to 80 million, or 20% of the total population by 2040 (Palmore, 2009). This older group traditionally requires more services ranging from healthcare to housing than younger generations. Skilled nursing facilities provide long-term care for older adults who need around the clock nursing support, and are likewise increasing in number to accommodate this change.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>One of the challenges facing retirement communities is respecting residents’ rights of autonomy and control while still following the many required laws and regulations placed on skilled nursing establishments (Frank, 2002). Administrators often desire to create a home-like environment, but the setting may still interfere with residents’ ability to make personal choices, which is an essential component associated with empowerment in the home (Frank, 2002). Given the value of stories in revealing hopes, dreams and perceptions, some researchers suggest that narrative inquiry is a valuable technique for gathering data in studies of the elderly. There is an advantage of older adults presenting their views on life: researchers can gain a better grasp of the needs of any individual by accessing his or her personal accounts of the aging experience (Harrigan &amp; Raiser, 1998).  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study explored the built environment’s role in perceived empowerment by skilled nursing residents. Literature suggests that a sense of control, choice, and autonomy are factors that can determine if an older resident is satisfied with their living conditions that, in turn, may facilitate empowerment and overall well-being. This concept is the foundation for the study’s primary research question: What role do empowering elements in the built environment play in supporting quality of life for skilled nursing residents? The Person-Environment (P-E) Fit Theory by Kahana, Lovegreen, Kahana, &amp; Kahana shaped the study’s approach (2003), which evaluates the interaction of personal preferences and environmental characteristics along the following four physical and two social domains: Physical Amenities/Aesthetics, Resource Amenities, Safety, Stimulation/Peacefulness, Homogeneity/Heterogeneity, and Interaction/Solitude. As the name suggests, the goal is to have a positive “fit” of the preferences and characteristics that leads to resident satisfaction and psychological well-being (Kahana et al., 2003). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The research study was comprised of two phases. The first phase involved interviewing skilled nursing residents which allowed them to share stories with the researcher of their lived experience in their long-term care facilities. They were asked about their perceptions of the spaces in the facilities that the residents determined to be empowering. The second phase took the form of observation mapping in which the researcher tracked the movement and activities of the general population of residents in the common areas of the study’s two site facilities. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Through the residents’ stories and site observations, this study reviewed a range of residents’ lived experiences from roommate relations to favorite pastimes to quiet moments. The P-E Fit theory domains proved a helpful model to understand certain physical aspects of empowerment in skilled nursing facilities. However, those domains were not able to fully explain some of the psychosocial concepts that residents expressed, which they perceived to be beneficial. The researcher discovered emerging themes for empowerment that combined both the physical findings as supported by the P-E Fit domains and these additional psychosocial findings that included personal relationships, sense of belonging, sense of identity, and knowledge of community culture. The emerging themes lead to the development of ten guidelines for skilled nursing facilities that identify and recommend empowering elements in the built environment. These included resident room equals home; centralized place to access resources, freedom to access community spaces, centralized social gathering spaces, places for retreat, connection to nature, off-campus adventures, places to explore personal interests, sense of belonging, and safety. The intent is that these guidelines will benefit skilled nursing facility administrators, staff, and other design professionals who seek to empower and improve quality of life for older adults.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Via a phenomenological, qualitative research approach, this study aimed to gain a better understanding of the experiences shared by parents of boys with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs).  Specifically, 7 parents of school-age boys with ASDs were interviewed for this study in order to gain insight into parents’ shared perceptions of the challenging behaviors of their children and how those behaviors affect their perceived stress.  The study further explored how parents describe coping skills that might mitigate the relationship of parent stress and challenging behaviors in children with ASDs.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this research was to investigate the time usage skills of undergraduate students in college marching band. Specifically, this study investigated and compared the time usage of collegiate marching band members, music majors, and non-music undergraduate students. Participants (N = 80) were undergraduate students at a large southern university in the United States. Data were collected through a researcher-designed time log. Using the time log, participants recorded hourly activities for one week. Time logs provided a simple format for participants to easily and quickly record activities in several categories. The time log also contained a series of several demographic questions.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Results of this study indicated that non-marching band students had more free time than marching band students. Non-marching band participants allocated more time for leisure-related activities than marching band participants. Compared to other activities, results indicated that participants spent the most time sleeping and engaged in leisure related activities. These results are consistent with related research, which found that people spend most of their time sleeping and in leisure. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Although this study occurred during homecoming weekend, marching band students appeared to have adequate time to study, even with the sizeable amount of weekly rehearsals and weekend performances. Marching band students used more of their free time to study and complete homework compared to non-marching band students who chose to watch TV or socialize with friends. Non-marching band music majors devoted more time to practice than marching band music majors; however, total instrumental playing time was significantly greater for marching band music majors. Results also indicated that the opinions of others, such as parents and high school guidance counselors, may have influenced college students’ decision to enroll in marching band.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Further results indicated that students not enrolled in marching band may not use marching band rehearsal hours for academic-related activities. Marching band students appeared to use their free time more effectively than non-marching band students, choosing to study and complete homework, rather than engaging in leisure activities. Further research should continue to identify time usage challenges for college marching band members to further understand the process used by those students to make time use decisions.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>There is a plethora of interesting science and many applications that rely on wrinkling in thin sheets. Though wrinkling may not be appreciated in some instances, in many other situations wrinkles can help to comprehend various physical phenomena. This work reports on the development of materials that can induce surface roughness through the creation of wrinkled surfaces. The textured surfaces are engineered through a bilayer system consisting of poly(dimethylsiloxane) and a modified surface layer. This research sought to study and understand methodologies for the controlled formation of wrinkles on surfaces of structures.  The creation of wrinkled surfaces was explored in metal deposited thin films atop PDMS. A series of experiments were designed to investigate the significant material parameters that effect low deformation wrinkling mechanics. In doing so, the experimental bilayer system successfully validated an empirical model. Building upon the understanding of key material parameters that affect low deformation wrinkling, oxidized PDMS was used to extend this knowledge in mechanically perturbed-induced wrinkling. A model was constructed that describes the wrinkle profile in terms of the paramount process parameters of plasma treatment. This feature enables integration of micro/nano-wrinkle manufacturing on large-scales. Finally, wrinkle morphology was controlled in a series of wrinkle patterning experiments. Transformations of various wrinkle patterns was achieved by coordinating the amount/direction of strain exerted on the system and exploiting the strain release process, and also by manipulating the geometric properties. The versatility of wrinkle patterning techniques demonstrates further advances in surface roughness engineering. The impact of this work is aimed at enhancing aerodynamic technologies and capabilities. This study demonstrated that by modifying the PDMS surface to create bilayer systems, the wavelength, amplitude, and surface roughness of the wrinkled films can be effectively controlled.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>ABSTRACT</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This case study explored the leadership processes and procedures one principal and her administrative team used to implement planned educational change at North Valley Middle School, a pseudonym given to a predominately African American populated middle school located in north-western Florida. Through the use of qualitative methods a purposeful sample of one school was selected and interviewed extensively. The study revealed themes that emerged from analysis of interview transcripts. These transcripts were used to explain, illustrate, and describe one principal’s leadership path, processes and decision-making to implement educational change. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this study, I sought to develop and test a theoretical model for assisting educational leaders to devise a logical and systematic approach to reform schools. Specifically, I investigated a process and illustrated a leadership procedure that one principal used to implement planned educational change in a predominately African American populated middle school as suggested from a literature review. Those components were identified within five areas in the literature: (a) the Florida School Grading System, (b) leadership, (c) turnaround schools, (d) closing the achievement gap, and (e) planned educational change.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The dimensions of nanoobjects are important because the properties of nanoobjects are related to dimension and automatic manufacturing inspection of nanoobject requires dimensional information. The current approaches to estimate the projection lengths (one of the important dimensions of nanorods) are manual, error leading and time consuming. So, an automated approach is essential to determine the projection lengths . We propose an innovative approach to estimate projection lengths of nanorods from scanning electron micrographs. Extracting projection length is very crucial to dimensional quality engineering because once we have projection length, we can determine actual length of each nanorod and establish a proper measurement system. The large volume of production of nanorods depends on proper manufacturing process of nanorod which is challenging until there is any proper measurement process exists to understand the manufacturing process of nanorod.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Our proposed automated algorithm can extract nanorods by following steps: consider an image of nanorod, determine top edges and side edges of each nanorod separately, associate edges to corresponding nanorods, extract correct nanorods. Then we estimate the projection lengths. Low signal to noise ratio and high degree of overlaps of nanorods in scanning electron micrographs are the major challenges in this research task.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Currently there is no image processing algorithm that can measure the dimensions of nanorods from scanning electron micrograph. Hence our research work will contribute to this area. We calculate the total number of true and false detection of nanorods obtained by our automated algorithm. We compare the algorithm with other relevant algorithms (e.g. Normalized cut, Snake and simagis). This research work is promising to dimensional quality control as it can contribute to establish a proper measurement system of nanomanufacturing.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation challenges the conflict thesis between science and religion promoted by philosophers Alvin Plantinga and Philip Kitcher. I analyze their conflict thesis as an epistemological disagreement about the nature of inquiry. Alvin Plantinga argues that a fideistic method of reasoning is required to make sense of science, while Philip Kitcher promotes a scientisim as the only way to make sense of religion. I argue that fideism and scientism are acceptable in a disciplinary context of inquiry. However, the investigation of the relationship between science and religion is an interdisciplinary context of inquiry where fideism and scientism instigate conflict. Therefore, conflict between science and religion is an artifact of Plantinga's and Kitcher's extension of disciplinary forms of inquiry into an interdisciplinary context. I look to the work of virtue epistemology, having identified the nature of inquiry as a primary cause of their conflict, to help distinguish disciplinary from interdisciplinary forms of inquiry. Disciplinary forms of inquiry are inquires where intellectual faculty virtues are more prominent than character virtues. Thus, one finds a consensus in disciplinary inquiry in how to proceed with research, e.g., Plantinga's fideism and Kitcher's scientism. Interdisciplinary research is a form of inquiry where the method of inquiry itself is in question, a form of inquiry has not been agreed to in terms of how to proceed with inquiry. Thus, intellectual character virtues take precedence to faculty virtues as agents are navigating the borders of different forms of inquiry. This distinction allows me to understand Plantinga and Kitcher as engaging in excellent disciplinary research but less-than-excellent interdisciplinary research. The dissertation concludes with showing how their work represents poor instances of interdisciplinary research, providing a positive example in the work of Michael Ruse.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>For decades, sport consumer behavior scholars have been interested in understanding individuals' psychological connection to sport teams. Through their efforts--including the development of concepts such as team identification--scholars have provided a foundation for subsequent research into various consumer thoughts, attitudes, and behaviors in relation to identification with or attachment to a team. However, scholars have not studied how sport consumers construct the team in regard to their psychological connection to it. Moreover, sport consumer behavior scholars have not addressed the potential fluidity and/or partiality of the sense of self one derives from supporting a team. These scholars have also often overlooked the contextual circumstances in which sport-related identities are negotiated and maintained. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Collectively, the preceding shortcomings are what led me to the research I conducted in this dissertation. Given the complexity of the research aims, I conducted qualitative research with sport consumers, utilizing Syracuse University Men's Basketball as a case to study. I utilized phenomenological interviews and concept mapping to understand the meaning of team in the mind of consumers and how individuals derive a sense of self from such an entity. In conducting the research, I remained cognizant of the situational aspects of the research environment, acknowledging the temporal sensitivity of the research act. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In pursuing of Research Aim 1 (i.e., to understand the meaning of "team" in team identification), I discovered that the individuals interviewed consider the coach, current and former players, fans, facility, geographic location, rivalry, and a history of success part of the "team" they identify with. I also found that the meaning of "team" varies based on its use in regard to psychological connection (i.e., identification) versus performance. Finally, I discovered that the meaning of "team" is continually changing and thus, relatively unfixed. Considering Research Aim 2 (i.e., to understand the stability and sources of identity associated with supporting the team), I discovered that the group identity of Syracuse University Men's Basketball is constructed in both a social and cultural sense, and largely influenced by history. Essentially, the sense of self individuals derive from supporting Syracuse University Men's Basketball is continually changing based on the life-world of the individuals and changes in the program; this allowed me to highlight the importance of context in studying fan identity. In addition, I discussed the enmeshed nature of group identity regarding Syracuse University Men's Basketball and Central New York. In pursuing Research Aim 3 (i.e., to understand how construction of "team" influences micro and macro consumer behavior), I found that fans, facility/location, rivalry, and history/success are all influential in thoughts and behaviors toward Syracuse University Men's Basketball, as well as the social well-being of fans. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Collectively, the research I have conducted in this project allows me to contribute to the sport consumer behavior by illustrating the complex meaning of team in regard to individuals' psychological connection to sport teams. This research should be of interest to scholars and practitioners in regard to branding, targeted marketing, and consumer well-being. Future research into this area should allow scholars and practitioners to understand how the meaning of team and team-related group identities may change over time and in varied sport environments, and the influence of such on behaviors.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The current study sought to examine the effects of a multi-session computerized interpretation bias modification (IBM) program designed to reduce hostile interpretation biases in individuals with elevated levels of trait anger. Fifty-seven participants were enrolled in a randomized study comparing IBM (n = 28) to a control condition (CC; n = 29). Sessions took place twice a week for two weeks. Measures of hostile interpretation bias, past week anger, and trait anger were administered before and after treatment to determine the effectiveness of the intervention. Follow-up assessments were conducted one month following treatment completion to examine the durability of the effects of treatment. We found that, relative to CC, IBM successfully increased participants' tendency to make benign interpretations of ambiguous scenarios and this effect was maintained at a one-month follow-up assessment. Additionally, we found that, among participants with high levels of pre-treatment hostile interpretation bias, IBM successfully reduced trait anger and past week anger compared to CC. Further, in individuals without symptoms of mania/hypomania, IBM led to significant reductions in trait anger. These effects of IBM on trait anger were mediated by changes in hostile interpretation bias. The findings of the current study suggest that interpretation bias modification is an effective treatment for reducing hostile interpretation biases and levels of problematic anger in individuals without symptoms of mania and with high levels of hostile interpretation bias.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Membrane proteins contribute about 30% of the proteome and about 60% of the drugs in the market target membrane proteins. But only about 1.5% of structures in Protein Data Bank are membrane proteins which reflect the challenges in membrane protein studies.   </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	In this dissertation work M2 full-length protein from Influenza A, a drug target to treat Influenza, is studied in lipid bilayer environment. ssNMR, the best technique to date to study membrane proteins at atomic resolution, has been utilized and intermonomer distance measurement is carried out throughout the study. Differently isotopically labeled protein mixtures were utilized for experiments to obtain unambiguous measurements, even though this method significantly reduces the sensitivity.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Influence of amantadine, an antiviral drug, towards distinctive residues at different locations of the channel, such as N-terminus channel pore opening, channel interior and C-terminus of the channel has been characterized. M2 is known to be sensitive to its environment and here the influence of factors such as drugs, pH and membrane constituents such as cholesterol is studied. Distance information obtained for M2 full-length is compared with some of the existing M2 structures of truncated constructs and the importance of studying M2 protein as much as its native-like environment is emphasized. Among multiple drug resistant mutations of M2, S31N mutation contribute almost 100% of drug resistant strains observed in flu infected humans. Therefore, studies involving S31N mutation is an essential part of M2 proton channel studies. Hence, multiple experiments has been performed to obtain structural insights of this oligomeric protein and to compare them with that of M2 wild-type protein, in addition to study of its effect to environmental conditions such as pH.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Menopause leads to an increased risk for osteoporosis in women. Although drug therapies exist, increasing numbers of people prefer alternative therapies such as dietary supplements, e.g. calcium, vitamin D, and collagen hydrolysates for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. We have previously shown that a three-month intervention using a calcium-collagen chelate dietary supplement (CC) was efficacious in improving bone mineral density (BMD) and blood biomarkers of bone turnover in osteopenic postmenopausal women. The present study reports the long-term efficacy of CC in reducing bone loss in postmenopausal women with osteopenia. Thirty-nine women were randomly assigned to one of two groups: 5 g of CC containing 500 mg of elemental calcium and 200 IU vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) or control (500 mg of calcium and 200 IU vitamin D) daily for twelve months. Total body, lumbar, and hip BMD were evaluated at baseline, six and twelve months using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Blood was collected at baseline, six and twelve months to assess levels of blood biomarkers of bone turnover. Intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis was performed using repeated measures analysis of variance pairwise comparisons as well as multivariate analysis to assess time and group interactions. The loss of whole body BMD in women taking CC was substantially lower than that of the control group at twelve months in those who completed the study and the ITT analysis, respectively (CC: -1.33% and -0.33% vs. control: -3.75% and -2.17%; P = .026, P = .035). The CC group had significantly reduced levels of sclerostin and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP5b) (P &lt; .05), and higher bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP)/TRAP5b ratio (P &lt; .05) than control at six months. These results support the use of CC in reducing bone loss in osteopenic postmenopausal women.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Mercury is a naturally occurring, pervasive element in the environment, with many chemical forms.  Toxicology, environmental cycling and retention, and production of mercury by industrial processes and natural and manufactured emissions of mercury chemical species are the foremost concerns pertaining to this element and its congeners.  Organomercury forms, particularly methylmercury, are some the most potent neurotoxins to animals, including humans.  Therefore, the understanding of cycling, biochemistry and biogeochemistry of mercury compounds is important.  Mercury isotopes are a useful tool for understanding the reactions, movements and transformations of mercury chemical species throughout the mercury biogeochemical cycle.  Mercury isotopic composition is useful because it has two dimensions of the isotopic fingerprint: variations of mass dependent fractionation and mass independent fractionation.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>            The objectives of our studies were several, with emphasis on constraining mercury concentration and isotopic compositions of invertebrates and fish in the northern Gulf of Mexico (NGOM) and interpreting possible mechanisms for these constraints.  In Chapter 2, work was performed on four restricted areas in the NGOM and included organisms which were related by food web and habitats, with particular interest in the economically and recreationally important species gag grouper (Mycteroperca microlepis).  The goal of this study was to better understand the interactions of mercury and mercury isotopes with regard to trophic level, age, size and bioaccumulation of methylmercury in the biological species.  In Chapter 3, muscle and liver tissues from individual adult gag grouper were analyzed.  The aim of this work was to investigate findings in the previous study of a large, consistent mass dependent fractionation variation in gag grouper muscle tissue and propose possible causes and mechanisms responsible for the variation.  Chapter 4 studied specimens surrounding the 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the northern Gulf of Mexico.  We analyzed a time series of pre-spill specimens and impacted post-spill specimens from the same area north-northeast of the blowout site for differences in mercury concentration and isotopic composition. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>		Studies from Chapter 2 concluded that mercury isotopic composition is dependent on the two-dimensional constraints of geographic and spatial variability.  Geographic variability in mass dependent fractionation is related to the percentage of dominant mercury input, especially terrestrially-derived dissolved organic and particulate matter.  Two recent models of mercury sources and receptors in the Gulf of Mexico foster this finding.  Spatial variability in mass independent fractionation is directly related to habitat, specifically the depth of an organism's habitat in the photic zone.  This effect is prominent in the open ocean.  Findings from the coastal seagrass area were somewhat anomalous to the oceanic trend, but explained by the correlation of dissolved organic matter to MIF variations in experiments by other groups.  Of all four constrained study areas from Chapter 2, the coastal area has the most fluvial and estuarine dissolved organic matter content.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>		In Chapter 3, we investigated causes of the large 2.0 / δ202Hg mass dependent fractionation in muscle tissues of 43 gag grouper from the Chapter 2 study.  Muscle and liver tissues were analyzed from individual, adult gag grouper specimens from one of the same restricted offshore study areas as in Chapter 2.  There were significant, systematic mass dependent fractionation variations between individual muscle and liver tissue pairs, but no significant variations in mass independent fractionation.  However, both MDF and MIF variations were correlated with total length of specimens.  δ202Hg is related to bioaccumulation of methylmercury and it was shown that specimens bioaccumulated mercury with age.  As mass independent fractionation is related to source of mercury, the lack of MIF variation in individual tissue pairs demonstrates that mercury source in muscle and liver is the same.  The proposed cause of mass dependent fraction between the two tissues is enzymatic demethylation in the liver, and therefore detoxification of methylmercury, which explains the large δ202Hg variation in gag muscle in the previous study. Another possible mechanism of fractionation is demethylation by oxidative protein metabolism in fish muscle, where remaining inorganic mercury is transported to and stored in the liver.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>		Work in Chapter 4 demonstrated slight but not statistically significant metabolic effects of the BP oil spill reflected in mercury isotopic composition of red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus).  However, comparison of red snapper from two other studies, as well as atmospheric and sediment isotope data, allowed for a synthesis of mercury isotope biogeochemical cycling in the northern Gulf of Mexico.  This isotopic composition picture reinforced geographical and spatial constraints from Chapter 2, especially in red snapper, where terrestrial input increased from westernmost to easternmost study sites.  Additionally, a relationship was proposed between dominant methylation in sediments and MDF signatures in fish.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Recent literature on comparative institutional analysis has found that the set of institutions consistent with the concept of economic freedom correlates with higher levels of per capita income (Gwartney, Holcombe, and Lawson 2004), more rapid economic growth (Dawson 2003, 2006; Gwartney, Holcombe, and Lawson 2004, 2006; de Haan, Lundström, and Sturm 2006), more entrepreneurial activity and investment (Gwartney, Holcombe, and Lawson 2006; Dawson 2006; Bjørnskov and Foss 2008), less unemployment (Feldmann 2007, and 2010), a healthier populace (Becker, Philipson, and Soares 2005) and happier individuals (Bjørnskov, Dreher, and Fischer 2010; Gropper, Lawson, and Thorne 2011). Some researchers have examined the impact of economic freedom on income inequality (Berggren 1999; Scully 2002) as well as quality of life adjusted inequality (Becker, Philipson, and Soares 2005). However, there has been little research investigating the impact of economic freedom on women’s lives and status. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	This dissertation is a broad examination of the impact economic freedom has on the lives of women across the world. Chapter one reviews the existing literature on inequality, institutions, gender and economic development. It also discusses the major data sources used throughout this study. Chapter two focuses on the measurement of gender disparity in formal and informal economic institutions and incorporates these new measures into the existing indexes of economic freedom. In chapter three, a model explaining the determinants of gender discrimination is developed, which is related to Becker’s (1957/1971) economic model of discrimination. The measure of gender-disparity in informal institutions developed in chapter two is used to empirically test this model. Chapter four empirically tests the impact of economic freedom on a key set of development outcomes for women: educational outcomes. The final chapter summarizes the major findings of this study, and discusses their implications for public policy and future lines of economic research</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Two core dimensions of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), harm avoidance and incompleteness, have been proposed to underlie overt symptom subtypes (Summerfeldt, 2004). Foa, Abramowitz, Franklin and Kozak (1999) have found that patients with OCD who could not articulate fears of a specific consequence (i.e. harm) of not completing rituals displayed less improvement from cognitive behavioral therapy using exposure and response prevention (ERP) than patients who could articulate feared consequences (i.e., were motivated by harm avoidance). Summerfeldt (2008) argued that current treatments may not be as effective for patients with feelings of incompleteness as they do not report obsessional fears that can be disconfirmed in treatment and has suggested that exposure treatment with a focus on purposefully leaving stimuli incomplete would be effective for such individuals. The aims of the current study were to: (1) evaluate the effectiveness of a purely exposure-based treatment (ERP) for feelings of incompleteness in comparison to progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) among individuals with elevated levels of dispositional incompleteness; and (2) determine if reductions in feelings of incompleteness were associated with reductions in multiple OC symptom dimensions and perfectionism. Undergraduate students with elevated feelings of incompleteness completed self-report questionnaires and behavioral assessments of incompleteness (visual and tactile), ordering and arranging, washing, and contamination approach during a pretreatment evaluation. Forty-eight participants were randomly assigned to complete three sessions of either ERP or PMR. Following these sessions, participants completed a post-treatment evaluation including the questionnaires and behavioral assessments administered at pretreatment, and a behavioral assessment of checking. Participants completed questionnaires one month following the post-treatment assessment. Results suggest that ERP, in comparison to PMR, was effective in reducing visual and tactile incompleteness on behavioral tasks; however, there were no differences between groups on other behavioral measures of OC symptoms or task-related perfectionism. No group differences were found on self-report measures of dispositional incompleteness, OCD symptoms, or perfectionism at post-treatment or follow up. ERP did result in greater reductions in harm avoidance at post-treatment compared to PMR. Exploratory moderation analyses revealed that among individuals low in pretreatment OCD severity, ERP was associated with greater reductions in incompleteness, ordering symptoms, and trait anxiety than PMR; no effects of condition were found among those high in pre-treatment OCD symptoms. These findings suggest a higher dose of ERP may be necessary to reduce incompleteness among individuals with elevated OCD symptoms. Further clinical implications are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The neuroendocrine system presents a diversity of patterns in hormone secretion across a large range of temporal scales. These patterns of secretion are crucial to many aspects of animal survival and behavior. This offers a wealth of important and interesting topics of study amenable to theoretical, experimental, and computational approaches. The pituitary gland plays a large role in neuroendocrine physiology by decoding signals from the brain, translating those signals and relaying them to the glands and tissues of the body via the circulatory system. The cells of the anterior pituitary gland use a diverse set of biochemical processes to accomplish this task. The first step is the activation of a hormone receptor, which convert an extracellular signal to an intracellular one. These receptors in turn trigger cascades of chemical reactions involving enzymes and intracellular messengers, as well as changes in membrane potential dynamics and intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion concentrations, all of which are important in controlling the production and secretion of hormones at appropriate levels.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The first portion of this dissertation studies how such biochemical systems respond to patterned inputs, such as pulsatile patterns that are characteristic of hormones in the reproductive system, growth hormone, and stress-responsive hormones. We examine how models of some common intracellular signaling components such as receptor binding and protein phosphorylation respond to pulsed inputs. We then study how a preference for a specific input pulse frequency may arise from the interactions between transcription factors, which are molecules regulating the expression of genes and in this case responsible for production of a hormone. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The next portion of this work describes experiments performed to demonstrate the direct actions of a hormone, oxytocin, on three pituitary cell types. Intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion concentration was measured in primary cultured female rat pituitary cells in vitro using video microscopy and a fluorescent \ca-sensitive dye. Oxytocin triggered increases in intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration as well as secretion of hormone from gonadotrophs, somatotrophs, and lactotrophs in a manner consistent with a direct action via the oxytocin receptor. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Finally, computational tools are presented for harnessing the computational power of graphics processing units to rapidly compute numerical solutions to initial value problems such as those that arise in the study of pituitary cell electrophysiology. This provides tools for more rapid model exploration by computing the ensembles of parameter combinations required in parameter sweep and parameter space sampling computations in parallel. This allows rapid computations to be performed on inexpensive modern desktop or laptop computers. As a case study, we use a model of membrane potential dynamics of pituitary lactotroph cells, which is produces spiking and bursting patterns. We compare the actions of three K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel conductances known to be increased by the action of the hormone dopamine in lactotrophs. Paradoxically, low levels of dopamine stimulate Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; increases despite only increasing these typically inhibitory conductances, a result previously hypothesized to be due to a transition from spiking to bursting.  We compare the mechanisms by which one of the K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels is able to promote this stimulatory effect while the other two are not, and we find that this effect is robust in a population of model cells with randomized background parameters.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Equity markets are becoming an intricate part of economic growth.  They provide a source of capital, among other things, that companies may use to grow, innovate, and compete in a domestic or the world market.  With the increase of equity markets and their implications of economic growth there has been some recent research on the valuation of equity markets.  Many of the political, economical, and institutional factors that are suggested to influence equity market valuation have been extrapolated from the research on bond markets and FDI.  While concurring with many of the factors already discussed in the literature, this thesis suggests that a factor is missing in the analysis.  I claim that stock market valuation is conditioned on the domestic stock market participation level within that country’s stock market. I contend that an increase of stock market participation by the domestic populace, conditioned on the type of regime, will increase the valuation of the equity market of that country.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Many states within the U.S., including Florida, have seen steady population growth since the 1950s.  While population growth can lead to economic growth, excessive growth of urban areas can lead to negative externalities such as road congestion, air and water pollution, decreased access to open space, habitat loss, and habitat fragmentation. This realization has led to increasing political and stakeholder pressure to more comprehensively assess impacts of land-use planning projects on human-natural systems.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The Ecosystem Services Assessment (ESA) approach is a relatively new approach which is described in the peer-reviewed literature as comprehensive and holistic. This dissertation study researched the potential of an ESA approach as a planning tool in Florida by addressing the following research questions:</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>1)	What are the guidelines for best practices in ESAs from the literature?</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>2)	How are ESAs currently used in land-use planning projects in Florida?  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>3)	How is the traditional approach used in land-use planning projects in Florida? </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>4)	What are key differences between the ESA approaches used in the case studies and the guidelines for best practices in ESAs?</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>5)	What are key differences between an ESA approach and a traditional approach as they are currently used in Florida? </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The research questions were investigated through the use of an online survey, in-depth interviews, and analysis of three Florida case studies. Experts in the field of ecosystem services research were interviewed to assess how ESAs are used in Florida and to gather background information for the online survey and case studies. The target group for the online survey included respondents working for local, state, regional, federal and tribal government agencies, non-profit organizations, research institutes, universities, and other relevant persons who had been involved in projects in which ecosystem services were valuated, quantified, or described. The case studies that were assessed for this research are the Central Everglades Planning Project, the Florida Conservation Lands study, and the Tampa Bay Project.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Previous studies have found interactions between the meaning of a word and the spatial position of the word (Barsalou, 2008; Zwaan and Yaxley, 2003). Some studies find that words or sentences with a directional component facilitate detection toward the congruent spatial direction (e.g., Šetić &amp; Domijan, 2007; Dils &amp; Boroditsky, 2007; Dils &amp; Boroditsky, 2010; Pecher et al; 2010). For instance, the word “jump” would cue toward the top of a screen. Other studies find the opposite effect, where words with implicit spatial meaning show an interference effect (e.g., Bergen et al, 2007; Estes et al, 2008; Dils &amp; Boroditsky, 2010). In these cases the word “jump” would result in faster reaction times to stimuli in the bottom of the screen. This experiment attempts to answer this controversy by looking at temporal effects. These differences might be due to inhibition of return (Posner &amp; Cohen, 1984).  If that is the case, you would expect to see a timeline where there is a facilitation effect followed by interference. Results of the study show no effect of time, however there were strong item effects. Most sentences consistently showed either a facilitation or inhabitation effect across all times. This suggests that these effects are modulated by the items that are used.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Significant disparities in healthcare among African-Americans are still prevalent in the U.S. with black patients having a higher incidence of common chronic diseases (heart disease, cancer and strokes), die at a higher rate, and lose more years of life as a result of the conditions. One area where the healthcare gap is particularly prevalent is clinical trial participation, with 1% of trial participants identifying as black despite a comprehensive meta-analysis including 70,000 subjects indicating that minority patients are just as willing to participate in medical trials as non-Hispanic White patients. Mistrust of the medical community and a long history of malpractice in experiments on minorities (i.e. Tuskegee Syphilis experiments, Vertus Hardiman case, and the Henrietta Lacks cases for example) could easily be used as justification of this mistrust, however several studies have shown that while African Americans are aware of the past abuse, awareness of those events does not significantly affect attitude toward participation. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A structural model utilizing Ajzen and Fishbein’s Theory of Planned Behavior was used in an attempt to explain the inconsistency between the positive attitudes of minority patients regarding participation in clinical trials and the distinct lack of actual participation. The model included measures of attitude, social norms, control and difficulty as functions of behavioral intention to participate in clinical trials and multiple-group structural equation modeling analysis of survey data from 117 black and 457 white participants was used to test group differences. Despite strong loadings on intentions by attitude, based on the structural model it cannot be concluded that the TPB model predicts intentions to participate well for this sample. None of the other constructs had any meaningful effect on intentions, indicating the TPB model does not work well for this sample. Moreover, due to insignificant loadings by social norms, control, and difficulty, it is impossible to distinguish any differences between groups on the constructs with the exception of attitude, which was not significantly different between groups. This study confirmed previous research that showed similar attitudes toward participating in clinical trials by black and white participants and did not find any evidence for including other constructs in future recruiting efforts.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Nonmainstream American English, or dialect, among children may have important implications for reading research and practice.  The purpose of this dissertation study was to examine dialect use in various language contexts and to investigate potential relations between dialect and reading outcomes among elementary students.  First, a meta-analysis of recent empirical research examining quantitative relations among dialect use and reading, spelling, and writing outcomes is presented.  In summary, the meta-analysis revealed a negative and moderate relationship between dialect production and literacy.  Next, the study analyzed and compared dialect production across an oral language task and specifically between two different written language samples, one elicited by a narrative prompt and the second by an expository prompt, among 250 second and third grade students.  The study also examined dialect use in the oral narrative task and the two writing samples in relation to concurrent and longitudinal reading outcomes.  Finally, the study examined the dialect-reading relationship for students diagnosed with speech, language, and learning disabilities in comparison to their typically developing peers.  The study found that overall, most students used features of dialect in their oral language samples and that students generally used several features of dialect in their written language samples as well.  However, the frequency of dialect use was greater in the written narrative sample than in the written expository samples.  In addition, dialect use, particularly in the oral and written narrative, was predictive of reading outcomes in the same year and two years later.  Moderator analyses for students with speech, language, and learning disabilities indicated that relationships between dialect use and reading did not differ for students identified with these particular disabilities.  However, students with these disabilities who also use dialect may be at increased risk for reading difficulties.  Implications for practice and future research are provided.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Though there are many feature selection methods for learning, they might not scale well to very large datasets, such as those generated in computer vision data. Furthermore, it can be beneficial to capture and model the variability inherent to data such as face detection where a plethora of face poses (i.e. parameters) are possible. We propose a parameter sensitive learning method that can learn effectively on datasets that can be prohibitively large. Our contributions are the following. First, we propose an efficient feature selection algorithm that optimizes a differentiable loss with sparsity constraints. We note that any differentiable loss can be used and will vary depending on the application. The iterative algorithm alternates parameter updates with tightening the sparsity constraints by gradually removing variables based on the coefficient magnitudes and a schedule. Second, we show how to train a single parameter sensitive classifier that models the wide range of class variability. The sole classifier is important since this reduces the amount of data necessary for training compared to methods where multiple classifiers are trained for each parameter value. Third, we show how to use nonlinear univariate response functions to obtain a nonlinear decision boundary with feature selection; an important characteristic since the separation of classes in real world datasets is very challenging. Fourth, we show it is possible to mine hard negatives with feature selection, though it is more difficult. This is vital in computer vision data where 10^5 training examples can be generated per image. Fifth, we propose an approach to perform face detection using a 3D model on a number of face keypoints. We modify binary face features from the literature (generated using random forests) to fit into our 3D model framework. Experiments on detecting the face keypoints and on face detection using the proposed 3D models and modified face features show that the feature selection dramatically improve performance and come close to the state of the art on two standard datasets for face detection . We also apply our parameter sensitive learning method with feature selection to detect malicious websites, a dataset with approximately 2.4 million websites and 3.3 million features per website. We outperform other batch algorithms and obtain results close to a high performing online algorithm but using far fewer features.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>What explains why and how America fought the civil war? This thesis argues that industrial modernization can be a useful analytical tool for understanding the causes of the American Civil War. The argument is developed by analyzing the social, political, and military events of the era through the lens of industrialization. This study will show that the American Industrial Revolution lay at the core of the social, political, and military events that shaped this great conflict. Understanding the causes of human events is as critical as understanding their effects. By grasping the root causes of the war, we can better understand how and why it was fought. This analysis of American society, American politics, and the country's military establishment will provide the rich context needed to apprehend the reasons for the American Civil war beyond the dichotomy of slavery and economics.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Eating disorders (EDs) and alcohol use disorders, as well as less severe eating disorder symptoms and alcohol use, are behaviors that can result in severe physical, social, psychological, occupational, and academic consequences; the risk of premature death may also be increased. These behaviors are often seen comorbidly.  When comorbid, negative consequences may be amplified or increased and the outcome, prognosis, and recovery of the disorders may be hindered.  A population particularly at risk of developing eating disorder symptoms as well as alcohol use and misuse, and therefore, potentially experiencing severe negative consequences, is college students.  Understanding the reasons why eating disorder symptoms and alcohol use and misuse occur among college students is vital, as this allows effective intervention and prevention efforts to occur.  The present study strived to provide insight into these reasons.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A particular theory describing the reasons behind this relationship that has received support among college students is the Acquired Preparedness Theory (Fischer &amp; Smith, 2008).  This theory involves the constructs of negative urgency, eating and thinness/dieting expectancies, and alcohol expectancies.  The present study examined these variables among 189 college women and 79 college men gathered through an online and subject pool sample.  The predictor variables of gender and negative urgency were measured by the Demographic Information Survey and UPPS Impulsive Behavior Scale, Urgency subscale (Whiteside &amp; Lynam, 2001), respectively.  The moderator variables of eating and thinness/dieting expectancies and alcohol expectancies were measured by the Eating Expectancy Inventory Eating Leads to Feeling Out of Control subscale (Hohlstein, Smith, &amp; Atlas, 1998), Thinness and Restricting Expectancy Inventory (Hohlstein et al., 1998), and Comprehensive Effects of Alcohol Questionnaire Positive Expectancy factors (Fromme, Stroot, &amp; Kaplan, 1993), respectively.  The criterion variables of ED symptoms, alcohol use, and alcohol-related negative consequences were measured by the Eating Disorder Examination - Questionnaire 6.0 Global Score (Fairburn &amp; Beglin, 2008), Timeline Followback - Alcohol (Sobell &amp; Sobell, 1992), and Brief - Young Adult Alcohol Consequences Questionnaire (Kahler, Strong, &amp; Read, 2005), respectively.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Six hierarchical multiple linear regression analyses, with moderator variables, were used to examine the research questions.  Three analyses were run utilizing a subsample of college women while three analyses were run utilizing a subsample of college men.  Results revealed that mean (i.e., average) and high (i.e., one standard deviation above the mean) levels of eating and thinness/dieting expectancies moderated the relationship between negative urgency and ED symptoms among college women.  Results also revealed that mean and high levels of alcohol expectancies moderated the relationship between negative urgency and alcohol-related negative consequences among college women.  No other significant moderating relationships were found.  Further, eating and thinness/dieting expectancies were associated with ED symptoms among both college women and men.  Alcohol expectancies were associated with alcohol use as well as alcohol-related negative consequences among both college women and college men.  Negative urgency also were associated with ED symptoms and alcohol-related negative consequences among college women and ED symptoms, alcohol use, and alcohol-related negative consequences among college men.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The results of this study provide valuable implications for college administrators, faculty, and staff, as well as for mental health professionals working with college students with negative urgency, ED symptoms, and/or alcohol use.  By identifying and challenging expectancies that are associated with ED symptoms, alcohol use, and alcohol-related negative consequences, these behaviors and consequences may be decreased.  Further, by increasing college students' distress tolerance skills (i.e., increasing one's ability to manage negative urgency), ED symptoms, alcohol use, and alcohol-related negative consequences may also be avoided or decreased.  Of utmost importance, dire and potentially fatal negative consequences of comorbid ED symptoms and alcohol use may be prevented.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>There is an operational need for accurate tropical cyclone (TC) genesis forecasts. Global numerical models are an important genesis guidance tool, but each model has biases. Further, the interpretation of when genesis occurs in a model forecast field can be subjective. Thus, this study seeks to create an automated, objective, statistical-dynamical TC genesis guidance tool for the North Atlantic and eastern North Pacific basins based on output from the CMC, GFS, and UKMET global models. Another goal is to determine how well important genesis processes in global models agree with those theoretically proposed. This research also attempts to identify the characteristics of successful and failed genesis forecasts.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>First, historical global model forecasts of TC genesis over the past decade are verified. Using this genesis forecast archive, univariable logistic regression equations are created to reveal the statistical relationships between relevant variables and genesis probability. These statistical relationships are compared to theoretical relationships between atmospheric variables and TC genesis. Results show several expected and counterintuitive statistical relationships, with some disagreement among the models. Multiple logistic regression equations then are developed to provide probabilistic genesis forecasts. Separate equations are developed for each global model, basin, and forecast window. Additionally, a consensus regression equation is developed. These equations are tested operationally during the 2014 hurricane season. Verification of the independent data indicates generally well-calibrated guidance. Homogeneous comparisons of the consensus regression equation and National Hurricane Center Tropical Weather Outlook genesis probabilities are presented.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Case studies and composite analyses are conducted to gain further insight. Case studies from the following categories are selected: (1) African Easterly Wave genesis over the Main Development Region; (2) genesis from stalled frontal boundaries; (3) genesis via tropical transition; and (4) genesis over the Gulf of Mexico. Hit, miss, and false alarm events are compared. Storm centered composite analyses also are constructed to examine differences in the environments between hit and false alarm forecasts. Separate composites are made for the eastern Main Development Region (where the GFS false alarm rate is greatest) and the remainder of the North Atlantic basin. Statistically significant differences between hit and false alarm cases are found for all variables analyzed with various areal extents.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Results from the case studies and composite analyses will help guide new predictors to test for inclusion into the multiple logistic regression equations. Additionally, the case study of Sean (2011) suggests that changes to the TC identification algorithm are needed to better detect subtropical to tropical transition. Real-time guidance products based on the logistic regression equations are being evaluated by hurricane specialists at the National Hurricane Center. It is possible that the products will be selected for operational implementation pending further testing and evaluation during 2015.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Suicide and depression are serious and growing public health problems.  Despite their substantial global health burden, relatively few interventions have been found to be efficacious at preventing these conditions.  The aims of the current study were to (a) determine whether two brief, cost-effective, and easy-to-disseminate prevention interventions (gratitude and priorities) were efficacious at preventing suicidality and depressive symptoms among individuals at risk for these conditions based on their psychological histories; (b) compare the efficacy of a gratitude intervention to a stringent active control condition (priorities) and an inactive control condition; and (c) address why the two prevention interventions might be efficacious by testing possible mechanisms (e.g., belongingness, sleep quality, optimism, gratitude) through which the interventions operate.  In the current study, participants (N = 192) who were currently asymptomatic but who endorsed a history of suicidality and/or depression were randomly assigned to one of three intervention conditions (gratitude, priorities, control).  These at-risk participants were followed for two months following the intervention period to determine if the interventions were efficacious at preventing future symptoms of suicidality and depression.  Testing the efficacy of these interventions in an at-risk sample is crucial, as it is important to know whether such interventions are efficacious, have no effect, or are potentially harmful to a subgroup of individuals.  Results provided evidence that participants in the gratitude condition experienced a poorer trajectory of depressive symptoms over time, a shorter length of time to suicidal ideation, and equivalent trajectories of life satisfaction and subjective happiness compared to participants in the control condition.  Results also provided evidence that participants in the priorities condition experienced a poorer trajectory of satisfaction with life, and equivalent trajectories of depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and subjective happiness compared to participants in the control condition.  None of the proposed mediators were found to mediate the relationship between condition and outcome.  Overall, results suggest that participating in a gratitude or priorities intervention may not be an efficacious means of improving well-being and preventing suicidality and depressive symptoms among individuals with a history of suicidality and/or depression.   Future research should continue to test the efficacy of positive psychology interventions among vulnerable individuals before techniques and interventions are endorsed to the public via self-help campaigns.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this contribution, we focus on the study of multiphase flow using the phase field approach. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Multiphase flow phenomena are ubiquitous.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Common examples include coupled atmosphere and ocean system (air and water), oil reservoir (water, oil and gas), cloud and fog  (water vapor, water and air).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Multiphase flows also play an important role in many engineering and environmental science applications.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>For two fluids with matched density, the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes system (CHNS) is a well accepted phase field model. We propose a novel second order in time numerical scheme for solving the CHNS system. The scheme is based on a second order convex-splitting for the Cahn-Hilliard equation and pressure-projection for the Navier-Stokes equation. We show that the  scheme is mass-conservative, satisfies a modified energy law and is therefore unconditionally stable. Moreover, we prove that the scheme is unconditionally uniquely solvable at each time step by exploring the monotonicity associated with the scheme.  Thanks to the simple coupling of the scheme, we design an efficient Picard iteration procedure to further decouple the computation of Cahn-Hilliard equation and Navier-Stokes equation. We implement the scheme by the mixed finite element  method. Ample numerical experiments are performed to validate the accuracy and efficiency of the numerical scheme.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In addition, we propose a novel decoupled unconditionally stable numerical scheme for the simulation of two-phase flow in a Hele-Shaw cell which is governed by the Cahn-Hilliard-Hele-Shaw system (CHHS). The temporal discretization of the Cahn-Hilliard equation is based on a convex-splitting of the associated energy functional. Moreover, the capillary forcing term in the Darcy equation is separated from the pressure gradient at the time discrete level by using an operator-splitting strategy. Thus the computation of the nonlinear Cahn-Hilliard equation is completely decoupled from the update of pressure.  Finally, a pressure-stabilization technique is used in the update of pressure so that at each time step one only needs to solve a Poisson equation with constant coefficient.  We show that the scheme is unconditionally stable.  Numerical results are presented to demonstrate  the accuracy and efficiency of our scheme.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The CHNS system and CHHS system are two widely used phase field models for two-phase flow in a single domain (either conduit or Hele-Shaw cell/porous media).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>There are applications such as flows in unconfined karst aquifers, karst oil reservoir, proton membrane exchange fuel cell, where multiphase flows in  conduits and in  porous media must be considered together.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Geometric configurations that contain both conduit (or vug) and porous media are termed karstic geometry.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We present a family of phase field (diffusive interface) models for two phase flow in karstic geometry. These models, the so-called Cahn-Hilliard-Stokes-Darcy system, together with the associated interface boundary conditions are derived by utilizing Onsager's extremum principle.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The models derived enjoy physically important energy laws and are consistent with thermodynamics.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>For the analysis of  the Cahn-Hilliard-Stokes-Darcy system, we show that there exists at least a global in time finite energy solution by the compactness argument. A weak-strong uniqueness result is also established, which says that the strong solution, if exists, is unique in the class of weak solutions.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Finally,  we propose and analyze two unconditionally stable numerical algorithms of first order and second order respectively, for solving the CHSD system. A decoupled numerical procedure for practical implementation of the schemes are also presented. The decoupling is realized through explicit discretization of the velocity in the Cahn-Hilliard equation  and extrapolation in time of the interface boundary conditions. At each time step, one only needs to solve a Cahn-Hilliard type equation in the whole domain, a Darcy equation in porous medium, and a Stokes equation in conduit in a separate and sequential fashion.  Two numerical experiments, boundary driven and buoyancy driven flows,  are performed  to illustrate the effectiveness of our scheme. Both numerical simulations are of physical interest for transport processes of two-phase flow in karst geometry.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study sought to determine the effectiveness of portrait drawing as an art therapy intervention for adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as a way to improve communication and social skills as well as increase an understanding of facial expressions and social cues. Participants consisted of two females with ASD from a center for autism at a major university in the southeast United States. The participants took part in six weekly art therapy sessions where the Face Stimulus Assessment (FSA) was administered as a pre and post test. A modified version of the Formal Elements of Art Therapy Scale (FEATS) was used to score the FSA drawings. Additionally, questionnaires based on the Social Skills Rating System (SSRS) was used to measure the impact of portrait drawing on the participants’ weekly behavior. The sessions incorporated the concept of the ‘Interactive Square’ (Bragge &amp; Fenner, 2009) as an approach to art therapy with the more structured directive of portrait drawing. The participants were asked to create self-portraits before drawing the researcher’s portrait. Next, participants with ASD engaged in portrait drawing with neurotypical peers. Qualitative and quantitative results showed the portrait drawing is an effective technique for adults with ASD. Quantitative and qualitative data are discussed. Artwork is used to illustrate the qualitative data.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Various environments were examined under an etiological scope in an effort to better understand the influence of genes on these environmental contexts for the present study. Using the Bioecological theoretical framework by Bronfenbrenner and Ceci (1994) the environment is explained as nested layers comprised of individuals, environments, systems, or ideals that either directly impact the individual or indirectly impact the individual. This Bioecological model also takes into account a bidirectional relationship between the individual and their environment, in that the individual has the ability to influence the environment and the environment has the potential to influence the individual. The Bioecological model is comprised of five different layers; starting with the most proximal to the individual is the microsystem, moving outward to the mesosystem, the exosystem, the macrosystem, and finally the chronosystem. For the present study the focus was on the microsystem, which is comprised of interpersonal relationships and environments, such as the home, the school, and the neighborhood. From this inner most layer of the Bioecological model, four environments were identified and chosen for further exploration; the home, classroom, school, and neighborhood. Experiences of these environments were assessed using a twin design and child-level reports. The study involved 536 twin pairs (107 female-female MZ pairs, 101male-male MZ pairs, 131 female-female DZ pairs, 98 male-male DZ pairs, and 96 opposite-sex DZ pairs). The sample was representative of the Florida population (73% White, 13% Black, 2% Asian, 8% Mixed, less than 1% Native American or Alaska native, and approximately 4% "Other"; 29% of the sample identified as Hispanic). The twins were aged 9 to 15 (M=11.4, SD=1.4). Structural equation modeling techniques were used to assess univariate genetic and environmental estimates of the environmental measures. The results from this study indicated environmental influences (shared and non-shared) on home chaos, while the experiences of the classroom and school environments appear to indicate genetic, shared, and non-shared environmental influences with some differences depending on the sex of the individual. The neighborhood environment also appears to indicate genetic and environmental influences depending on the sex of the individual. Finding differential influences of genetic and environmental factors on the environments of the microsystem reveal the importance of probing environments for genetic influences, in that samples potentially vary in the degree that certain environments are under genetic influence. In order to properly measure the environment it is important to use environmental measures assessing individual experiences either in addition to or as opposed to family-level assessments.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>After numerous obstacles and the inability to establish a placement in which to conduct my thesis, I decided to reframe my topic in order to explore the challenges of conducting art therapy research as a graduate student. Previous research has also addressed some of the potential complications when conducting research, however, little has discussed the obstacles faced from a graduate student perspective.  Reviewing the history and guidelines that Institutional Review Boards implement, this thesis describes how I followed this process with various ethical review boards, as well as illustrates the difficulties I faced. I particularly use a narrative inquiry to help expand and learn further from the challenges I experienced.  Through analyzing each interaction, I found that while I encountered common research struggles documented in previous studies, I also had unique obstacles stemming from being an art therapy graduate student. In the final part of this thesis I illustrate the frustration I experienced towards this process in an intersubjective response art piece.   This reflection alongside the previous research led me to conclude that art therapists encounter numerous undocumented struggles while attempting to conduct research, but by conducting more studies like this we can better understand how to overcome these for the future.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Across the globe, as many as 5 million women become victims of sexual trafficking at any given time (Hardy, Compton &amp; McPhatter, 2013).  The traumatic experience of sexual trafficking frequently results in severe and complex symptoms of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (Hardy, et. al., 2013). This researcher attempted to explore art therapy as a holistic recovery treatment for these victims. The study utilized clay-based art therapy with a group of women who were previously victims of sexual trafficking. These participants explored different ideas of recovery for six weeks using clay. Qualitative data included researcher observations, session discussions and qualitative interviews, which were reviewed for themes while the Trauma Symptom Checklist was used to supplement the results. The research question asked if clay-based art therapy would lower trauma symptoms, promote community building, increase feelings of empowerment and improve vocational and life skills. Ultimately the research data supported the research question. Following the art therapy trauma symptoms were lowered, a sense of community was built, feelings of empowerment increased, and life skills improved supporting that clay-based art therapy is an effective, and holistic form of treatment for sex trafficking victims.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Little is known about how individuals at elevated risk for suicide engage with mental health care services, including which factors may confer risk for premature treatment attrition. This study aimed: (1) to identify demographic, diagnostic, and personality factors that predict premature treatment dropout among individuals with suicidal ideation; (2) to determine the extent to which severity of suicidal ideation predicts dropout among individuals both with and without suicidal ideation; and (3) to assess whether depressive, cynical, and negativistic personality traits better predict treatment attrition among those with high levels of suicidal symptoms than low levels of suicidal symptoms. Participants included adult outpatients (N=1,166) who sought care at a university-based outpatient psychology clinic. Information regarding participant demographics, suicidal and depressive symptoms, and personality characteristics were obtained via self-report measures. Psychiatric diagnoses were assessed using a semi-structured clinical interview. Participants who terminated treatment at any point prior to the recommendation of their therapist were considered treatment dropouts. Chi-square tests, one-way ANOVAs, logistic regression modeling, and bootstrapped mediation analyses were used to identify correlates and predictors of treatment attrition. Suicidal individuals who dropped out of treatment were more likely to have a depressive disorder, substance use disorder, more comorbid psychiatric diagnoses, lower overall functioning, and more severe depression symptoms. Among suicidal and non-suicidal participants pooled together, higher suicidal symptom severity significantly predicted premature attrition. Additional research is warranted to investigate treatment attrition in a more generalizable sample of individuals with suicidal ideation, as well as to directly probe why these individuals may elect to drop out of treatment.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Passwords are critical for security in many different domains such as social networks, emails, encryption of sensitive data and online banking. Human memorable passwords are thus a key element in the security of such systems. It is important for system administrators to have access to the most powerful and efficient attacks to assess the security of their systems more accurately. The probabilistic context-free grammar technique has been shown to be very effective in password cracking. In this approach, the system is trained on a set of revealed passwords and a probabilistic context-free grammar is constructed. The grammar is then used to generate guesses in highest probability order, which is the optimal off-line attack. The initial approach, although performing much better than other rule-based password crackers, only considered the simple structures of the passwords. This dissertation explores how classes of new patterns (such as keyboard and multi-word) can be learned in the training phase and can be used to substantially improve the effectiveness of the probabilistic password cracking system. Smoothing functions are used to generate new patterns that were not found in the training set, and new measures are developed to compare and improve both training and attack dictionaries. The results on cracking multiple datasets show that we can achieve up to 55% improvement over the previous system. A new technique is also introduced which creates a grammar that can incorporate any available information about a specific target by giving higher probability values to components that carry this information. This grammar can then help in guessing the user’s new password in a timelier manner. Examples of such information can be any old passwords, names of family members or important dates. A new algorithm is described that given two old passwords determines the transformations between them and uses the information in predicting user’s new password. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A password checker is also introduced that analyzes the strength of user chosen passwords by estimating the probability of the passwords being cracked, and helps users in selecting stronger passwords. The system modifies the weak password slightly and suggests a new stronger password to the user. By dynamically updating the grammar we make sure that the guessing entropy increases and the suggested passwords thus remain resistant to various attacks. New results are presented that show how accurate the system is in determining weak and strong passwords. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Another application of the probabilistic context-free grammar technique is also introduced that identifies stored passwords on disks and media. The disk is examined for potential password strings and a set of filtering algorithms are developed that winnow down the space of tokens to a more manageable set. The probabilistic context-free grammar is then used to assign probabilities to the remaining tokens to distinguish strings that are more likely to be passwords. In one of the tests, a set of 2,000 potential passwords winnowed down from 49 million tokens is returned which identifies 60% of the actual passwords.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is part of a unique class of diseases because it is unlike the conventional diseases which are caused by viruses or bacteria. It is a “molecular disease” caused by the aggregation of a small protein (peptide) called β-amyloid (Aβ). Significant genetic, pathological, and biochemical evidence link AD to the aggregation (self-assembly) of the Aβ, especially the 40- or 42-residue isoforms (called Aβ(1-40) and Aβ(1-42) respectively) that are considered to be the most disease relevant. It is known that complex aggregation pathways produce a variety of aggregated Aβ structures, eventually producing amyloid fibrils (filamentous protein nanostructures) that deposit into plaques in the brain. Understanding the molecular structures of Aβ oligomers (aggregates that composed of 2 to roughly 100 molecules) and underlying assembly pathways will advance the fundamental understanding of AD at the molecular level. Furthermore, Aβ aggregation in vivo most likely occurs at peptide concentrations (nanomolar) which are much lower than concentrations required for Aβ aggregation in vitro (micromolar). One possible reason that has been proposed is that aggregation in vivo is catalyzed by interactions between Aβ and surfaces of lipid rafts or cell membranes.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this work, we have utilized solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and molecular modeling to study the molecular structure of 150 kDa Aβ(1-42) oligomers formed by the interaction between sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) micelles and Aβ (1-42) peptide and compared to Aβ(1-42) fibril structures. Finite pulse radio frequency driven recoupling (fpRFDR) solid state NMR experiments on Aβ(1-42) oligomers reveal chemical shifts of labeled residues that are indicative of β-strand secondary structure. Results from 2D dipolar assisted rotational resonance (DARR) experiments indicate intermolecular proximity between I31 aliphatic and F19 aromatic carbons, which is contrary to models of Aβ oligomers proposed previously by other groups. In contrast, Aβ(1-42) fibrils have shown similar secondary and quaternary structures as oligomers.  The most prominent structural differences between Aβ(1-42) oligomers and fibrils were observed through measurements of inter-molecular 13C-13C dipolar couplings observed in PITHIRDS-CT experiments. PITHIRDS-CT data indicate that, unlike fibrils, oligomers are not characterized by in-register parallel β-sheets. A hypothesized model is built based on the structural information we obtained from NMR characterization. We have further reported new solid state NMR constraints which indicate antiparallel intermolecular alignment β-strands within the 150kDa Aβ(1-42) oligomers and this result is consistent with our hypothesized model . Specifically, 150 kDa Aβ(1-42) oligomers with uniform 13C isotopic labels at I32, M35, G37 and V40 exhibit β-strand secondary chemical shifts in 2D fpRFDR NMR spectra, spatial proximities between I32 and V40 as well as M35 and G37 in 2D DARR spectra, and close proximity between M35 Hα and G37 Hα in 2D CHHC spectra. 2D DARR result of oligomer sample prepared with 30% labeled peptide further indicate the I32-V40, M35-G37 contacts are intermolecular. In addition, we employ molecular modeling to compare the newly derived experimental constraints with previously proposed geometries and come up with three candidate molecular models for arrangement of C-terminal region of Aβ(1-42) molecules into oligomers.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Furthermore, we have developed a new technique to study how Aβ aggregation could be influenced by environmental factors such as interaction with different surfaces based on a surface patterning technique called microcontact printing (µCP). This approach allows easy measurement of thickness of the adsorbed layer by transferring the adsorbed layer form the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamp surface to a glass substrate. It also enables characterization of the face of the adsorbed peptide layer in contact with the hydrophobic stamp surface. Characterization of this face is normally not compatible with the conventional surface characterization techniques. Our results have shown that this face exhibits significant higher thioflavin T fluorescence than the face exposed to water, suggesting β-sheet formation induced by the hydrophobic PDMS surface. In addition, we have evaluated the intrinsic stability of the adsorbed layer by printing the layer on a sacrificial layer and have shown that by chemically crosslinking the adsorbed peptide, stable particulate microstructures in water can be obtained. Moreover, co-micropatterning of the different aggregated states of Aβ(1-40) (monomers and fibril fragments) is demonstrated, which may have potential applications for future study of Aβ aggregation or the interaction between different Aβ species.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The structure of executive function (EF) was examined with both 3- and 4-year-old children.  How EF, as well as how working memory (WM) and inhibitory control (IC) components of EF, related to academic and socio-emotional outcomes over time was also examined. Participants were 117 3-year-old children and 120 4-year-old children.  EF was shown to be best represented as one factor with 3-year-old children and as two factors, a WM and an IC factor, with 4-year-old children.  Results indicated that the strengths of relations between EF and academic skills were higher than the strengths of relations between EF and socio-emotional outcomes. With 4-year-old children, the WM component of EF was more highly related to several academic outcomes than was the IC component of EF.  Some support was also found for a relation between IC and oral language skills and between EF--and components of EF--and inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive behaviors.  Prior research has indicated that the structure of EF changes developmentally, but this study demonstrated this shift likely occurs earlier than was previously thought.  It also demonstrated how EF--and the components of EF-- relate to the acquisition of important early academic skills and to inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive behaviors in young children.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This research study sought to test the effectiveness of using art therapy, specifically altered book-making, to decrease traumatic grief symptoms in children and adolescents. The study hypothesized that altered book-making with children and adolescents, who had experienced traumatic loss, would be effective in decreasing traumatic grief symptoms. The six-week/six-session treatment design used a single group pre/post-test, utilizing the UCLA PTSD-RI and an open-ended post-research survey. The population involved in the research were children and adolescents who had experienced the death of a family member through traumatic means, such as homicide or suicide, within the past five years. Four participants began the study, and three participant, completed both pre and post-test. The overall outcome of the study supported the researcher’s hypothesis— participants reported increased understanding of grief responses, emotion identification, and self-reflection. Through altered book-making, participants also reported a decrease in anger, trauma symptoms and dissociation.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>An influx of veterans have enrolled in college since the passage of the Veterans Educational Assistance Act in 2008.  Since then, there have been a number of recommendations about how to provide support for transitioning student veterans; however, there is limited research about the experiences of student veterans with these support services and their adjustment to college.  Therefore, this study’s author investigated the relationship between institutional support, social support, and college adjustment via a cross-sectional survey administered to student veterans nationwide.  The final sample size was 130 student veterans.  Student veterans completed the following instruments: a demographic questionnaire, the Perceived Social Support Scale (Procidano &amp; Heller, 1983), a measure of perceived institutional support, and the Student’s Adjustment to College Questionnaire (Baker &amp; Siryk, 1999).  Regression analyses and ANOVAS were conducted to determine statistical significance and effect sizes amongst the variables of age, gender, combat status, length of enrollment in college, perceived institutional support, perceived social support, and college adjustment.  Results revealed that perceived institutional support significantly predicted college adjustment (R¬2 = .171, p = .00) but that perceived social support did not.  One-way ANOVAs conducted for gender and combat status were not statistically significant in this study.  These results suggest that institutional support (both general and veteran-specific) is important to student veterans’ college adjustment.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Florida has been actively implementing the AASHTO Pontis Bridge Management System (BMS) to support network-level and project-level decision making in the headquarters and district offices. As a concerted effort of the FDOT to improve the quality of asset management information, Pontis is used as a tool to provide decision making recommendations. The credulity and usefulness of this information is also essential for satisfaction of the requirements of the government accounting standards board statement 34 (GASB 34) regarding the reporting of capital assets, and the federal MAP-21 requirements for performance management and development of asset management plans. Anticipating the new MAP-21 requirements, AASHTO in 2013 approved a new bridge element inspection manual (BRM manual), which was published as the AASHTO Manual for Bridge Element Inspection. Like most states, in order to comply with the new MAP-21 requirements, Florida will need to redefine its methods of obtaining bridge inspection data, developing deterioration models, cost models, and other preservation analysis capabilities. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This thesis research seeks to develop data and models based on the bridge inspection process. First, an extensive literature review has been conducted, including but not limited to, the AASHTO Manual for Bridge Element Inspection (2013 edition); reports of state DOT experiences implementing the new inspection process; federal guidance on the collection and use of the new data, such as new NBIS requirements; BrM versions 5.1.2 and 5.2.1 software and documentation; and other relevant materials. Next the research has developed a new set of condition health index models to fit the new bridge element inspection data. A Bridge Health Index (BHI) is a calculated number between 0 and 99 percent that can be used as a rating to represent the overall deteriorated condition of a bridge element. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The report looks at various methodologies of determining the health index (based on relative importance levels or factors) of bridge elements.  Stochastic analysis and element historical data have been used to generate health index of elements through the risk and vulnerability (hazard) information as well as replacement cost data. Also a reliability methodology was considered as a new approach to compute importance weights and health index of bridge components. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This thesis research also reviewed the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) Bridge Field Inspection Guide, including a comparison on element condition state tables from the FDOT manual, with the AASHTO manual and manuals from other state DOTs.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Expert opinions on the importance of bridge elements were elicited and used to compute the health index of the bridge. This BHI has been compared to other methodologies already mentioned. Due to the revised bridge element definitions and meaning of condition states, necessary studies on the use of the AHP method and the Delphi survey analysis have been suggested for future research.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Prior research suggests that neighborhood context has an important role in shaping individuals' perceptions of generalized trust, which is an important ingredient in establishing informal social control.  Since most of the empirical research focuses on the direct effects of neighborhood structural conditions, there is a rather limited understanding of how social processes affect individual levels of trust.  As a result, it remains unclear whether several theoretically relevant social processes mediate the effects of neighborhood compositional features.  The current study uses data from the Project of Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods--Community Survey (PHDCN-CS) to investigate whether social mechanisms, specifically fear and police efficacy, mediate the relationship between several adverse neighborhood conditions on individual-level generalized trust.  The findings show that both fear and police efficacy are salient mechanisms in the neighborhood context and trust relationship.  The theoretical and policy implications of the results are discussed, along with implications and directions for future research in this area.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Moffitt’s (1993) taxonomy of adolescence-limited and life-course-persistent offenders suggests, among other things, that an early onset of antisocial behavior a) increases the likelihood of a life-course persistent offending trajectory and b) is the product of neuropsychological deficits and familial risk factors working in concert.  Over two decades of research has yielded a substantial amount of support for Moffitt’s claims.  Nevertheless, research has yet to significantly expand the repertoire of biosocial processes that might influence the onset of antisocial behavior during childhood.  For instance, only a handful of criminologists have considered the role that infant and early childhood nutrition might play in the development of antisocial behavior.  Moreover, studies employing genetically sensitive methods to examine the link between nutrition and child antisocial behavior are virtually nonexistent.  Scholars have also neglected to consider the socioemotional mediators of the nutrition-externalizing relationship, as well as whether infants and children are differentially sensitive to nutritional intake depending on their level of genetic risk, perinatal risk, and security of attachment.  Finally, researchers have yet to explore the ways in which nutritional factors across infancy and early childhood work together to influence externalizing behavior.  This dissertation seeks to address these gaps in the literature by employing a large, nationally representative sample of twin pairs.  The findings suggest that, even after accounting for the influence of genes and the shared environment, nutritional factors during infancy and early childhood have both direct and indirect effects on externalizing behavior during kindergarten.  Furthermore, some significant interactions between genetic and nutritional factors, as well as nutritional factors across life stages, were detected.  The limitations of the study are noted and recommendations for policy, theory, and future research are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The standard general equilibrium asset pricing models typically make two simplifying assumptions: homogeneous agents and the existence of a rational expectations equilibrium. This context sometimes yields outcomes that are inconsistent with the empirical findings. We hypothesize that allowing agent heterogeneity could assist in replicating the empirical results. However, the inclusion of heterogeneity in models where agents are fully rational proves impossible to solve without severe simplifying assumptions. The reason for this difficulty is that heterogeneous agent models generate an endogenously complicated distribution of wealth across the agents. The state space for each agent's optimization problem includes the complex dynamics of the wealth distribution. There is no general way to characterize the interaction between the distribution of wealth and the macroeconomic aggregates. To address this issue, we implement an agent-based model where the agents have bounded rationality. In our model, we have a complete markets economy with two agents and two assets. The agents are heterogeneous and utility maximizing with constant coefficient of relative risk aversion [CRRA] preferences. How the agents address the stochastic behaviour of the evolution of the wealth distribution is central to our task since aggregate prices depend on this behaviour. An important component of this dissertation involves dealing with the computational difficulty of dynamic heterogeneous-agent models. That is, in order to predict prices, agents need a way to keep track of the evolution of the wealth distribution. We do this by allowing each agent to assume that a price-equivalent representative agent exists and that the representative agent has a constant coefficient of relative risk aversion. In so doing, the agents are able to formulate predictive pricing and demand functions which allow them to predict aggregate prices and make consumption and investment decisions each period. However, the agents' predictions are only approximately correct. Therefore, we introduce a learning mechanism to maintain the required level of accuracy in the agents' price predictions. From this setup, we find that the model, with learning, will converge over time to an approximate expectations equilibrium, provided that the the initial conditions are close enough to the rational expectations equilibrium prices. Two main contributions in our work are: 1) to formulate a new concept of approximate equilibria, and 2) to show how equilibria can be approximated numerically, despite the fact that the true state space at any point in time is mathematically complex. These contributions offer the possibility of characterizing a new class of asset pricing models where agents are heterogeneous and only just slightly limited in their rationality. That is, the partially informed agents in our model are able to forecast and utility-maximize only just as well as economists who face problems of estimating aggregate variables. By using an exogenously assigned adaptive learning rule, we analyse this implementation in a Lucas-type heterogeneous agent model. We focus on the sensitivity of the risk parameter and the convergence of the model to an approximate expectations equilibrium. Also, we study the extent to which adaptive learning is able to explain the empirical findings in an asset pricing model with heterogeneous agents.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to develop, refine, and validate a conceptual model of Group Work Contribution (GWC) explaining how undergraduate students participate in and contribute to group work. In addition, this study intended to investigate how individual characteristics and group work condition relate to group work contribution. Six hundred and forty-nine undergraduate students, who have experienced team/group work at some point during their college years, participated in the study. More than half of the participants were female (366 students, 56.4%). The mean age of the sample was 19.46 and 417 participants (64.3%) were either 18 or 19 years old. Most participants were enrolled as freshmen (261 students, 40.2%) and sophomores (176 students, 27.0%). Participants represented various colleges at the university.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In terms of validation of the GWC model, the results of the analyses supported the ten-factor model: task value, task difficulty, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, openness, perceived necessity of group work, volition, and group work contribution. The GWC model, which was developed based on the literature, fits the data well. In other words, the factors in the GWC model describe students’ group work contribution accurately. Each item for the factor and average variance for each factor had enough variance to explain the model. Structural relationships among the factors in the GWC model indicated that task value and all five personality factors (i.e., extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness) were related to group work contribution. In addition, students’ perceived necessity of group work and volition factors not only were associated with group work involvement, but also worked as mediators in the group work contribution model.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>From the group mean comparisons, how individual characteristics and group work condition relate to group work contribution was investigated. The results from comparisons of group work contribution with individual characteristics (gender, age, school year, and group work preference) indicated that gender and students’ group work preference were the most important factors in determining the level of group work contribution. In other words, students’ group work contribution varies depending on gender (females tend to be stronger contributors) and their group work preference (how much they like to work as a group in general). In addition, the results from comparisons of group work contribution with group work condition (length of group work, group size, and existence of peer evaluation methods) found that only the existence of peer evaluation was indicated as a factor to influence the students’ group work contribution.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>From the findings of this dissertation, instructors and instructional designers may better understand the different factors that relate to students’ group work contribution. For example, they may consider whether the contents of group work goals and objectives are related to the students’ contribution or they can plan to conduct peer assessment; however, they do not have to worry about the length of group work or students’ age when they design a group task, as the data suggests that task value and existence of peer assessment methods factor heavily in students’ group work contribution, while length and age are not as important factors. In addition, the findings of this study may provide meaningful information on how the factors in the GWC model were related to group work contribution. Therefore, the GWC model that was developed and validated in this study may be used as a theoretical foundation for further study.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Software tools designed for disk analysis play a critical role today in digital forensics investigations. However, these digital forensics tools are often difficult to use, usually task specific, and generally require professionally trained users with IT backgrounds. The relevant tools are also often open source requiring additional technical knowledge and proper configuration. This makes it difficult for investigators without some computer science background to easily conduct the needed disk analysis. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this dissertation, we present AUDIT, a novel automated disk investigation toolkit that supports investigations conducted by non-expert (in IT and disk technology) and expert investigators. Our system design and implementation of AUDIT intelligently integrates open source tools and guides non-IT professionals while requiring minimal technical knowledge about the disk structures and file systems of the target disk image. We also present a new hierarchical disk investigation model which leads AUDIT to systematically examine the disk in its totality based on its physical and logical structures. AUDIT's capabilities as an intelligent digital assistant are evaluated through a series of experiments comparing it with a human investigator as well as against standard benchmark disk images.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>During the past 50 years, a decline of the third place has been observed across the United States (Oldenburg, 1999). Third places are those places, other than home or work, that serve as informal gathering places.  People know fewer and fewer of their neighbors due to the fact that there are fewer designated meeting places in which to connect with them. Commercially and virtually staged experiences are also rising in popularity, providing ever fewer localized environments for people to gather (Crick, 2011). Research indicates spaces designed with the influence of the locale lead to positive emotional attachment for those who live within the community. When the “brand” of a third place is established, it can also be suggested that these places should reflect the communities in which they are placed (Rennick, 2003; Johnstone and Conroy, 2008).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The goal of this project was to determine the physical factors of the built environment that are preferred by millennial patrons. In addition, the attributes that contributed to the “brand” of the spaces were identified along with patron’s perceptions of the various brands.  Finally, the likelihood of patronage was assessed. . </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The methodology included an online survey of millennials.  The sample was selected from students enrolled at Florida State University. Respondents were asked questions regarding the physical factors of a space that contribute to a positive coffee shop experience, which physical factors of each space contributed to their perception of the brand, and their perception of four different branded café spaces. Results from the survey indicated that the perceived level of brand of a space (high or low) has an effect on the overall perception of the space (positive or negative) as well as the likelihood of patronage. Short responses indicated that spaces that are preferred by respondents include a variation of functional seating areas that also provide privacy for patrons. Minimizing distractions was also an important factor for respondents. Additional data allowed the researcher to determine specific physical factors that lead to a positive experience for users, as well as those that indicate to patrons the branding within a space. Common physical features that indicate the branding of a space include: wall finishes, wall décor, and furniture arrangements. Data gathered by the researcher was also used to create three different design solutions of cafés with varying levels of branding. The following research can be utilized by designers to help contribute to the sense of place felt by patrons, as well as to indicate a certain level of branding within retail spaces.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Extending the human life span has long been a desire of human beings. It seems the wish has been actualized. However, simply living a long life does not always seem to be a blessing. Older adults report a lower level of psychological well-being and quality of life and even have a higher rate of suicide, compared to the general population. Furthermore, as older adults are likely to experience the death of a loved one, deteriorating health, retirement, and changing relationships with others, older adults have a high risk of depression. Social work has a long history of providing social services to older adults. In particular, social work has provided older adults with a variety of services to enhance their quality of life and mental health status. Because ageism is one form of discrimination that social work has long been concerned with, this study focuses on the relationship between perceived ageism and depressive symptoms among older adults. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between perceived ageism and depressive symptoms among older adults and to investigate the mechanism linking perceived ageism to late-life depression.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Three primary effects were examined: the direct effect of perceived ageism on depressive symptoms in later life, the mediating effects of self-perception of aging and purpose in life on the relationship between perceived ageism and late-life depression, and the moderating effect of perceived ageism on the association between religiosity and depression among older adults. The stress process model was used to provide an overall idea to explain the three types of the effects related to the mechanism of ageism. Cooley’s looking-glass self, Beck’s cognitive theory of depression, and Levy's stress embodiment theory were used to explain the mediating effect of self-perception of aging, and Beck’s cognitive theory of depression was applied again to clarify the mediating effect of purpose in life. The stress buffer theory and the life-span theory of control indicated the moderating effect of perceived ageism on the relationship between religiosity and depression. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Secondary analysis of existing data was conducted using the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) datasets, a longitudinal panel study of the U.S. population ages 50 and over. The sample of this study was 3,991 participants, who were older adults ages 65 and over and whose answers were available for the study analyses. Descriptive and preliminary analyses were performed to roughly examine the relationships between variables. With regard to the direct effect of perceived ageism on depressive symptoms, multiple regression analyses were performed controlling for significant variables. With regard to the mediating effects of self-perception of aging and purpose in life, structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses using structural regression models were conducted. In respect to the moderating effect of perceived ageism on the relationship between religiosity and depression, SEM analyses with multiple groups were performed.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Based on the results of the several different analyses, a direct relationship between perceived ageism and late-life depression was found. That is, older adults who perceive ageism are likely to have a higher level of depressive symptoms than their counterparts. This direct relationship between perceived ageism and late depressive symptoms among older adults, however, was not detected after controlling for self-perception of aging and purpose in life, indicating the full mediation effects of self-perception of aging and purpose in life. That is, older adults who perceive ageism are likely to have negative self-perception of aging, and this negative view of their own aging is likely to increase depressive symptoms. Additionally, older adults who have a negative view of their aging are likely to have a negative view of their future, and this lower purpose in life also increases depressive symptoms. The strength of the effect of religiosity on depression did not differ between the perceived ageism and the not-perceived ageism groups, indicating no moderating effect of perceived ageism on the relationship between religiosity and depression. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study contributes to the existing body of knowledge by providing the information about the relationship between perceived ageism and depression and the mechanism of this relationship. Also, this study re-examined and supported established theories in the context of perceived ageism. Additionally, the current study suggests the necessity of anti-ageism policies and social work services and describes possible ways of providing such social policies and social work services at the micro, mezzo, and macro levels. The results of this study imply that more efforts and resources are necessary to reduce ageism and its negative effect on depression among older adults, and these efforts will eventually contribute to making a more just, better society.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Using the lens of positive thinking is an essential key to improving one’s psychological well-being, especially in the modern workplace. In today’s “flat-world” and fast-paced environment, modern organizations are well-fitted with the perspective of positive organizational behavior (POB) because POB assumes state-like capacities highlighting flexibility for different situations. The sport industry, one of the most competitive workplace arenas (Plunkett, 2008), creates a particularly exceptional environment in which POB needs to be adapted for an improved employee’s work experience and well-being. In transferring the idea of POB to the practice of human resource management, Luthans and Youssef (2004) proposed the concept of psychological capital or simply PsyCap. PsyCap is a high-order construct of self-efficacy, hope, optimism, and resiliency, and is considered as state-like, potentially having a synergistic impact on individual and organizational outcomes. Given the importance of POB and PsyCap in sport organizations, the three-fold purpose of this study is to: (1) provide a conceptual framework of POB in sport (POBS), (2) empirically examine the effects of various influences on PsyCap, and (3) investigate the role of PsyCap in increasing employees’ PWB. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Top management teams of an organization will expect their employees to be efficacious, hopeful, optimistic and resilient, but only a few studies have offered a systematic consideration for antecedents of PsyCap (Avey, 2014). Employees’ PsyCap levels are determined by leaders’ behavior, organizational culture, and individual perspectives and attitudes. Therefore, the conceptual framework of POB in sport (POBS) considers leader, employees, and organizational influences for PsyCap. The ultimate goal of POB is the pursuit of employees’ happiness and well-being beyond higher levels of organizational performance. Thus, POBS emphasizes the inclusion of employees’ PWB to general organizational outcomes.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>By proposing a testable research model, 11 research hypotheses were addressed, including both direct and indirect effects. This reduced model consisted of six main constructs, including authentic leadership, meaningful work, supportive organizational climate, PsyCap, job satisfaction and PWB. To create reliable and valid scales to test the research hypotheses, an initial set of items was developed in a pilot test by collecting data from employees in athletic departments of Division II and III institutions. The three-fold purpose of the main study is to (1) provide further evidence of construct validity of constructs in the research model, (2) test research hypotheses in regard to causal relationships among five constructs, and (3) examine the mediating role of PsyCap between three predictors (i.e., authentic leadership, meaningful work, supportive organizational climate) and PWB. To achieve each aforementioned purpose, the main study targeted employees in athletic departments of Division I institutions and included three stages of data analysis, respectively: (1) evaluation of full measurement model through a CFA, (2) empirical test of research hypotheses through SEM, and (3) examination of indirect effects of PsyCap. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The results from the empirical tests of the hypothesized model indicated that employees’ meaningful work and supportive organizational climate positively influence PsyCap level, leading to higher levels of job satisfaction and PWB. On the other hand, the path from authentic leadership of athletic directors in athletic departments, to employees’ PsyCap was not statistically significant with the sample from the current study. Based on the results of the direct effects, indirect effects regarding PsyCap as a central value were also tested. PsyCap played important roles between antecedents (i.e., left) and outcomes (i.e., right) as either a partial mediator or a full mediator. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The current study provides empirical evidence regarding not only antecedents and outcomes of PsyCap but also mediating role of PsyCap in the context of sport. For practitioners in the sport industry, the current study offers a new perspective of positivity in workplace by conceptualizing a POBS as a roadmap.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The current Internet architecture reveals its chronic limitations against the new paradigms of networking. The advancement of technology has changed the network use from communication to content distribution. Unfortunately, the IP-based network architecture is inadequate to support such a trend because it has been developed from a traditional communication model like one-to-one phone call in which users should know where the others are.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In order to solve this problem, current innovative researches propose a way to place content itself on the center of communication, i.e., Information Centric Networking (ICN) or Content Centric Networking (CCN) [16], so that all the entities on the network can communicate with each other using content name, regardless the location of the content. As a result of these efforts, NDN [29] was proposed as an instance of ICN, and has been actively researched. Additionally, Wang et al. [26] and Hoque et al. [15] suggested OSPFN and NLSR, respectively, as for intra-domain routing protocols in order to support this new generation of networking, but to the best of our knowledge, no inter-domain routing protocol has been proposed yet.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this thesis, we develop an inter-domain routing protocol for ICN, called SIDR, Scalable Inter-Domain Routing protocol, which can support the scalability using domain names of networks. Since our protocol is established based on BGP, it follows the message formats and attributes of the protocol. In addition, it also consists of E-SIDR and I-SIDR, in which E-SIDR distributes the reachability information between ASes, while I-SIDR announces the information inside an AS. However, the security features of ICN enable SIDR to be secure as S-BGP with simpler mechanisms. Additionally, I-SIDR is not suffering from complex routing techniques, such as route reflection or BGP confederation, because of the loop prevention property of the new networking architecture.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>As a result of our simulation, E-SIDR works exactly the same as EBGP during announcements and withdrawals. And also, I-SIDR shows competitive performances compared to IBGP. Even though I-SIDR generates the same or more number of messages, it stabilizes networks within a short space of time as IBGP. Throughout this paper, we will show that how our protocol can support the scalability and how it uses the desirable features of the new network model.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Background: Nighttime eating, particularly before bed, has received considerable media attention in recent years. The common thought was to avoid caloric intake post-dinner and pre-sleep due to worries of weight gain and a negative impact on cardiometabolic health.  It appears that minimizing nighttime caloric intake by providing a structured low calorie option with a high satiating value (e.g., greater protien content) may alter the risk for overcomsumption and long-term weight gain. Indeed, recent work from our laboratory and others have demonstrated that low-calorie, nighttime snacking options consisting primarily of protein may be beneficial. To date, no studies have investigated the impact of casein intake before bed on overnight and next morning fat metabolism in obese men. Purpose: To determine if casein protein (CAS) consumed at night before sleep will alter overnight subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue (SCAAT) lipolysis, and next morning whole-body fat oxidation and appetite in overweight and obese men compared to a non-caloric placebo (PLA). Methods: Twelve overweight and obese men participated in this randomized, cross-over, double-blind and placebo-controlled study. Participants came to the laboratory at baseline and twice during each of the treatment periods with CAS and PLA. Each treatment period consisted of one visit in the evening and another the next morning. Participants consumed CAS or PLA and overnight lipolysis was measured with microdialysis, a minimally invasive method used to monitor SCAAT interstitial glycerol concentrations. The next morning fat oxidation and metabolism (indirect calorimetry), and appetite (visual analog scales for hunger, satiety, and desire to eat) were measured. Results: There were no significant differences in overnight SCAAT interstitial glycerol concentrations (CAS, 175.0 ± 26.5; PLA, 184.8 ± 20.7 μmol/L; p =0.77), fat oxidation (CAS, 0.76 ± 0.01; PLA, 0.76 ± 0.01; p =0.75), metabolic rate (CAS, 2126 ± 111; PLA, 2145 ± 106 kcals/day; p =0.94) or any markers of appetite between CAS and PLA.  However, the participants in the present study were hyperinsulinemic (fasting insulin &gt; 30 μUL), which may have masked any potential differences in the dependent variables. Conclusion: Despite common concern for eating at night before bed, it appears that casein protein had no impact on overnight lipolysis or whole-body fat oxidation and therefore does not appear to have any negative effects compared to a non-caloric placebo in obese men.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to run a pilot test of a prototype device meant to investigate the effects of contingent music volume change on gait performance. The researcher aimed to answer two primary questions in regards to this study: Can adding a contingent factor to standard rhythmic auditory stimulation techniques contribute toward improved gait symmetry? In addition, can the additional contingent music volume factor improve gait accuracy when compared to traditional rhythmic auditory stimulation? In order to answer these questions, the researcher designed a device that recorded footfall data while utilizing a combination of client-preferred music, rhythmic auditory stimulation and contingent music volume change to encourage participants to step in time to a given rhythm. While the device is intended for use in elderly rehabilitation, the researcher utilized college-age students for the pilot test in order to test the device’s functionality, validity, and reliability. Participants for this experiment were current students enrolled in spring classes at the undergraduate and graduate level at Florida State University. A total of 30 students participated in the study. Results showed no significant difference in gait symmetry between groups or over time, but suggested that the device was able to significantly improve gait accuracy within four trials in terms of shortening the offset between an audible rhythm and one’s footsteps. The true degree of this significance remained unclear due to cofounding variables that originated from the device’s software. The research showed a more accurate average for experimental participants across all dependent variables, which was seen as encouraging for future research and clinical trials of the device. A review of the relevant literature, detailed results of the experimental research, and implications for future research and development are discussed within.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Engaging in a period of rest following encoding has been shown to lead to better retention on a subsequent recall test than performing an inter-test task. Brain imaging studies have shown that there is reactivation during post-encoding rest of brain areas that were active during initial encoding, and this process has been attributed to memory consolidation, leading to the improvements in recall. The present study investigated the conscious thoughts that occur during wakeful rest following encoding and how they relate to memory on a delayed recall test. Recall was tested in younger adults across two tests separated by a rest period while verbalizing conscious thoughts or engaging in a visuospatial task while verbalizing thoughts. Experiment 1 demonstrated hypermnesia, an increase in recall over repeated testing, for the rest but not task condition and demonstrated a relationship between recall improvement and the amount of replay during the delay. Experiment 2 aimed to replicate the findings of Experiment 1 and further explored the role of conscious replay in relational processing.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Risk factors (e.g., anxiety sensitivity, subclinical anxiety) associated with the development of anxiety disorders have been identified; however, the development of preventive interventions targeting these risk factors is in the nascent stage. To date, preventive interventions have tended to target specific anxiety disorder symptoms (e.g., panic attacks). Although these interventions are effective at reducing risk for the targeted disorder (e.g., panic disorder), the focus of the intervention is narrow, thereby limiting the dissemination of these interventions. One approach that may broaden the scope of our prevention efforts is the development of a transdiagnostic intervention. Currently, transdiagnostic interventions have only been used in those with diagnosed conditions (e.g., anxiety disorders); however, it stands to reason that a transdiagnostic approach may also be helpful for those at-risk for developing anxiety disorders. The present study reported on the development and use of a brief preventative intervention for those with subclinical or higher levels of anxiety. Participants were randomized into either a transdiagnostic preventative intervention or a health focused control group. Participants consisted of sixty-nine individuals (N = 69) with subclinical or higher levels of anxiety (e.g., social anxiety, worry, panic attacks). Results revealed significant between group differences in the reduction of social anxiety, worry, and levels of impairment with the active intervention group reflecting greater reductions than the control group. Further, results revealed that the change in safety aid utilization was a significant mediator in the association between intervention group and social anxiety and worry at Week 1. Implications of these results and avenues for future research are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The need for actuators that are adaptable for use in a wide array of applications has been the motivation behind actuator development research over the past few years. Recent developments at the Advanced Aero-Propulsion Laboratory (AAPL) at Florida State University have produced a microactuator that uses the unsteadiness of a small-scale impinging jet to produce pulsed, supersonic microjets - this is referred to as the Resonance-Enhanced Microjet (REM) actuator. Prior studies on these actuators at AAPL have been been somewhat limited in that the actuator response has only been characterized through pressure/acoustic measurements and qualitative flow visualizations. Highly-magnified particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements were performed to measure the velocity fields of both a 1 mm underexpanded jet and an REM actuator. The results demonstrate that this type of microactuator is capable of producing pulsed, supersonic microjets that have velocities of approximately 400 m/s that are sustained for significant portions of their cycles (&gt; 60 %). These are the first direct velocity measurements of these flowfields, and they allow for a greater understanding of the flow physics associated with this microactuator. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The previous studies on the REM actuators have shown that the microactuator volume is among the principal parameters in determining the actuator's maximum-amplitude frequency component. In order to use this actuator in a closed-loop, feedback control system, a modified design that incorporates smart materials is studied. The smart materials (specifically piezoelectric ceramic stack actuators) have been implemented into the microactuator to actively change its geometry, thus permitting controllable changes in the microactuator's resonant frequency. The distinct feature of this design is that the smart materials are not used to produce the primary perturbation or flow from the actuator (which has in the past limited the control authority of other designs) but to change its dynamic properties. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Various static and dynamic control inputs to the piezo-stacks illustrate that the actuator's resonant frequency can be modulated by a few hundred Hertz at very fast rates (up to 1 kHz or more). These frequency modulation capabilities allow for off-design frequencies to be present in the actuator's output, thereby increasing its range of potential flow control applications. A series of closed-loop control demonstrations clearly show the ability of this actuator to track and produce outputs at specified frequencies. The robustness of this control technique was also demonstrated. By combining the REM actuator concept with the precision and control authority of smart materials, the new actuator system (known as the SmartREM actuator) is shown to produce supersonic, pulsing microjets whose frequency can be controlled actively in a closed-loop manner. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Three different design possibilities are developed and characterized in this study. An optimal configuration was identified for cavity flow control experiments in both sub- and supersonic freestream conditions (M = 0.4 - 0.7 and M = 1.5). The actuator was designed such that its frequency would lie within the range of the predicted cavity oscillations. The actuator's performance was evaluated in its three modes of operations: pulsed (REM mode), active pulsed (SmartREM mode), and steady. It was found that when the actuator operates in its pulsed modes, the amplitude of the dominant peak is reduced by as much as 6 dB. The high-frequency broadband levels and overall sound pressure levels (OASPLs) are reduced with control as well (by about 3 dB). Operating the actuator in its steady mode at very high pressures provides the most effective results. The dominant peaks were completely eliminated (amplitudes reduced by over 25 dB), and the reductions in the OASPLs exceeded 10 dB.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Workplace environments are continuing to evolve as user needs and work modes change. The wellbeing and success of an organization, and those working within it, is strongly related to its built environment (Becker, 2004). Grounded in research that included the history of workplace design, issues inherent in organizations, and matters associated with individual productivity within the workplace environment, the purpose of this study was to better understand how the built environment can facilitate both collaborative and individual work modes in a creative office environment.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Open office plans are popular in workplace design due to the ability to increase collaboration among employees and the decrease in building costs (Duffy, 2008; Saval, 2014). Recent research, however, has shed light on the apparent distractions and lack of privacy seen in the open office. Additionally, recent research shows that many workers desire an office design that accommodates more opportunities for focused individual work. Collaboration, in fact, is most successful when supported by effective individual work, and workplace environments should be designed to support those modes of work (Gensler, 2013; Hua, Loftness, Heerwagen, &amp; Powell, 2011). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To explore how the spatial characteristics of the creative workplace environment might facilitate collaborative and individual work modes, the researcher conducted a case study at an interior design office followed by a survey of four design firms. The case study utilized a mixed-methods approach including visual documentation, behavioral mapping, and interviews. Photos were taken, and behavioral mapping with field notes were used to document how the employees utilized their spaces, with specific attention to where collaborative and individual work occurred. Next, the researcher interviewed employees on their use of the space and how its design facilitates their collaborative and individual work productivity. The information collected during the interviews told not just how but why the employees used their workspace as they did. Following the case study, a survey was developed to confirm the findings from the case study and to gain further knowledge to answer the research question. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>From the case study, findings indicated that the data supported previous research claims that collaboration and individual work must be supported by workplace design. While collaboration was high among employees and meeting rooms were utilized, the expectation of distraction in the open office space limited the fluidity and frequency of collaboration. Not all collaborative design features were used as intended, and the need to use secluded spaces for individual work was apparent. Those with private offices were not as affected by distractions and privacy issues than those in the open office. The responses to the survey that followed confirmed that the potential for distraction and privacy issues in the open office had the potential to hinder productivity. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study confirmed that fluidity and frequency of collaboration was, at times, deterred in the open office environment, due to the expectation that collaboration would be a distraction to others. Distractions and the absence of privacy in the open office environment led employees to seek secluded spaces in the office, away from their workstations. Private meeting rooms were integral solutions in facilitating both collaborative and individual modes of work, as these spaces could host groups or individuals as required. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The research findings of this case study were used to program and develop a prototype design solution for a hypothetical interior design firm’s workplace. This research and subsequent workplace design solution adds to the body of knowledge, which may inform future design researchers and practitioners on the effective design of workplace environments – to design beyond adequacy.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>In astrophysical hydrodynamical objects, multiple physical processes take place on a wide variety</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>of spatial and temporal scales simultaneously, making direct numerical simulation of such objects</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>dicult computationally. Our work focuses on developing and testing reduced-order models of</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>such physical processes and objects in order to mitigate this diculty. We use the singular value</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>decomposition on snapshot data the systems generated by a high-delity model in order to generate</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>a singular eigenvalue spectrum as well as a orthogonal eigenfunction basis. The original equations</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>of the system are then projected onto this basis via a Galerkin or discontinuous Galerkin projection,</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>giving rise to a system of ordinary dierential equations that serve as the reduced order model.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>These models are then propagated forward in time, and their accuracy and computational cost</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>are compared with our high-delity models. We nd that for the systems of interest (quasi-steady</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The access and sharing of research data have been emphasized by the government, funding agencies, and scholarly communities. The increased access to research data increases the impact, as well as the efficiency and effectiveness, of scientific activities and funding. The access, however, is facilitated not just by appropriate policies but also by the employment of effective infrastructure mechanisms, including enhancing data with effective metadata (Simmhan, Plale, &amp; Gannon, 2005). Identifiers are important metadata that traditionally have been used for entity identification, linking, and referencing in various domains (Altman &amp; King, 2007). To enable effective metadata creation support for research data, it is essential to gain a better understanding of the current uses of identifier systems with research data.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>As many research institutions plan to provide some types of research data services (Tenopir, Birch, &amp; Allard, 2012), it is important to study the current practices of data curation in IRs. In particular to develop effective data management infrastructure configuration templates, it is essential to understand user needs and related activities for data curation in IRs, including different roles played by IR staff and role-specific differences in needs for skills and infrastructure support (Foster, Jennings, &amp; Kesselman, 2004). Furthermore, it is important to investigate both the current practices of identifier use and the requirements for quality and functionalities for identifier schemas in order to design effective metadata support for research data curation in IRs.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Studying the practices of research data curation requires multifaceted contextual analysis (Borgman, Wallis, &amp; Enyedy, 2007). Hence this study, too, required a research design that could help examine and capture various sociotechnical and cultural factors that may affect data curation, including the selection and uses of identifier schemas for data. The study used Activity Theory (Engeström, 1987; Leontiev, 1978) and Information Quality Assessment Framework (Stvilia, Gasser, Twidale, &amp; Smith, 2007) to guide the design of a protocol for semi-structured interviews.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study reports on data collected from fifteen participants from thirteen different universities in the US. The selection of participants was guided by two criteria. To be eligible for participation in the study, participants had to work for an IR that stored and curated research data objects and housed by one of the 108 institutions classified as RU/VH (very high research activity) in the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The study identified data curation activities and contexts (i.e., tools, norms, rules, and division of labor), perceived roles played by IR staff (e.g., data curator, IR manager, and metadata specialist), role-specific sets of activities and skills, and perception of quality identifiers in IRs. The findings of this study can inform the development of best practices and effective infrastructure support for data curation in the context of IRs, as well as teaching data curation in LIS schools.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) is an abundant and dynamic protein modification in eukaryotes, carried out by O-GlcNAc transferases (OGT). Two OGTs from Arabidopsis, SPINDLY (SPY) and SECRET AGENT (SEC), play important roles in plant growth and development. The phenotypes of spy and sec single mutants indicate that OGT affects processes including response to hormones and environmental signals, circadian rhythms, root development, and intercellular transport. Interestingly, the spy sec double mutant caused embryonic lethality, suggesting that OGT activity is essential to plant embryogenesis. However, the function of SPY and SEC in protein O-GlcNAc modification remains largely unknown. In animals, there are hundreds of O-GlcNAc modified cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins, participating in diverse cellular processes such as signaling, metabolism, transcriptional regulation, and cell cycle controls. However, there is little evidence that any protein in planta is O-GlcNAc modified. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In order to determine the roles of SPY and SEC in protein O-GlcNAcylation, I generated transgenic plants with an inducible RNAi construct (hRNA) to knock down either gene in the mutant background for the other gene, which circumvents the embryonic lethality of the spy sec double mutant. High level expression of the RNAi constructs in the SPY hRNA sec and SEC hRNA spy double mutants caused complete arrest of root growth and death to rosette and shoot, which suggested that SPY and SEC are essential for postembryonic growth. Using O-GlcNAc antibodies, I showed that many proteins are O-GlcNAcylated in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. Specifically, I found that RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is modified by O-GlcNAc. In animals, O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation compete for the same residues, serine 5 and serine 7, on C-terminal domain of Pol II. Interestingly, I found that O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation are mutually exclusive on the 5th serine in the conserved YSPTSPS repeat sequence of Pol II. In animals, O-GlcNAc has recently been shown to also occur on histones as part of the epigenetic marks. I also examined whether O-GlcNAc modification affects other histone modifications, such as H3K36me3, H3K27me3, H3K9me3, H3K4me3 and H3K27me2. These results suggest that SPY and SEC have an overlapping role in plant postembryonic development by O-GlcNAcylating Pol II in plants, which competes phosphorylation of Serine 5 on CTD.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is an ongoing epidemic affecting millions of people worldwide, with the majority of those infected living in poverty. Today, multiple treatment options exist for anti-retroviral therapy (ART). However, access to ART for those living in low- to middle-income countries is hampered by the high costs of the medications. In an effort to increase the accessibility of one anti-viral, nevirapine, our group has investigated alternative syntheses in order to lower the production cost.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The majority of the nevirapine production cost is due to the polysubstituted pyridine building block, 2-chloro-3-amino-4-picoline (CAPIC), because the synthesis begins from an expensive ketone. To decrease the cost of the nevirapine process, the synthesis to CAPIC was redesigned to begin from an alkylidene malononitrile prepared from the inexpensive commodity chemicals, acetone and malononitrile. The alkylidene malononitrile is then treated with N,N-dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal (DMF-DMA) to afford an enamine intermediate. This enamine is readily cyclized under Pinner conditions with HCl to afford the polysubstituted 2-chloronicotinonitrile, a pyridine that could then be transformed into CAPIC in two steps. Unfortunately, the new proposed route to CAPIC was the low-yielding due to the dimerization of the alkylidene malononitrile during the enamine formation step. After testing a series of additives, we found that acetic anhydride in substoichiometric quantities enabled the enamine to be synthesized in quantitative yields. The acetic anhydride is presumed to be a unique acetate source that enhances the rate of the enamine formation to prevent the dimerization of alkylidene malononitrile. The method could also be applied to a number of other ylidenemalononitriles to synthesize a variety of mono- and disubstituted 2-halonicotinonitriles in moderate to high yields.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	To further lower the production costs to CAPIC, the newly revised synthesis from acetone to the 2-bromonicotinonitrile intermediate was implemented in a semi-continuous flow synthesis. The flow synthesis consists of first the Knoevenagel condensation between acetone and malononitrile in a basic aluminum oxide packed-bed column followed removal of any residual water by a 3 Å molecular sieve column to afford the alkylidene malononitrile. The alkylidene malononitrile is then met with a stream of DMF-DMA and acetic anhydride to form the enamine. Lastly, the enamine solution produced is added directly to a round-bottom containing acetic acid and HBr to perform the Pinner cyclization to the desired nicotinonitrile. With this process, the nicotinonitrile is produced in 69% overall yield within 2 h as opposed to over 24 h by the batch process. This process inspired our collaborators to develop a streamlined batch synthesis of the nicotinonitrile that will be implemented in an industrial setting. Overall, these improvements in the CAPIC process will enable at least a 75% decrease in the nevirapine production cost.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Upon achieving a lower cost production to CAPIC, we investigated whether the proton in the Pinner cyclization could be replaced with an alternative electrophile to yield more diverse nicotinonitriles. After a deuterium incorporation experiment suggesting the mechanism of the Pinner cyclization would allow the addition of alternative electrophiles, we examined the cyclization with allyl bromide. While the original enamine only produced the desired allyl substituted nicotinonitrile in trace amounts, the ester analog of the enamine enabled a much more facile cyclization. However, the cyclization occurred with the ester to synthesize an allyl substituted α-pyrone. This prompted an investigation of the reactivity of the ester analog with other organohalides to synthesize a variety of α-pyrones. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Lastly, three enamines were demonstrated to undergo a rapid amine exchange followed by a cyclization with primary amines to yield fluorescent products that were determined to be cyclic amidines by X-ray crystallography. A fluorescent “turn-on” effect is observed due to the amidines exhibiting emission intensities as high as 900 times greater than the starting enamines. The rate of cyclization is demonstrated to be substrate-dependent and simple structural variations to the enamine could both change the rate of the amine exchange/cyclization and emission wavelength. We further demonstrate the potential for one enamine to participate in biomolecule labeling applications.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The objective of this research is to elicit and analyze the use of visual response created by art therapists and its implications for their resiliency. As part of the mental health community, art therapists are exposed to trauma histories and traumatic events, their empathetic nature making them susceptible to the negative effects stress, which over time can accumulate and lead to clinician burnout. Although there is ample literature on the detrimental effects of the burnout syndrome on the helping professions, the literature is limited when it comes to art therapists and their distinct needs and resources. The current study used mixed methods to better understand the role of visual response art as it was used by participating art therapists in building and maintaining resilient and restorative self-care practices.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) has been flying on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite since October 28, 2011. A striping phenomenon contained in the global distribution of O (observations) minus B (model simulations) difference was detected in different ATMS channels. In this dissertation, optimal filters are designed for smoothing out the striping noise in warm counts, cold counts, warm load temperatures and scene counts. The optimal filters are developed based on the striping noise free results obtained by a combined method of the principal component analysis (PCA) and the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD). Using the two-point algorithm, antenna temperatures are then calculated with warm counts, cold counts, warm load temperatures and scene counts before and after applying the optimal filters. The patterns and magnitudes of the striping noise removed are very close to that from the PCA/EEMD method. It is further demonstrated that the striping noise is present in the scene counts and must be smoothed out in order to eliminate the striping noise in antenna temperatures. It is also shown that the optimal filters are superior to the conventional boxcar filters in terms of being able to effectively remove the striping noise in the high frequency range but not to alter the lower frequency weather signals. A set of 22 optimal filters on brightness temperature is also designed to remove the striping noise in different channels. Impacts of striping noise mitigation on small-scale weather features are investigated by comparing ATMS cloud liquid water path (LWP) retrieved before and after striping noise mitigation. It is shown that the optimal filters do not affect small-scale cloud features while smoothing out striping noise in brightness temperatures. It is also shown that the striping noise is present in the LWP retrievals if the striping noise in brightness temperatures of ATMS channels 1 and 2 is not removed. The amplitude of the striping noise in LWP is found to be linearly related to the magnitude of striping noise in ATMS brightness temperature observations. Striping noise is a general problem for microwave sensors, and is also identified within observations of a recent FY-3C MWTS. Striping noise within MWTS observation is with a magnitude of 1K, which is much larger than in ATMS. A transfer function is employed to explain the root cause of the striping noise. This transfer function is controlled by instrument parameters such as scan cycle, calibration integration time and scene integration time. Instrument noise is simulated by a white noise series with and without adding flicker noise. Power spectral analysis of this instrument noise is then forced by transfer function to produce the power spectral density of output noise. It is shown that flicker signal is the source of striping noise, and transfer function can modify the striping noise in terms of magnitude and peak frequency.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Self-efficacy is defined as “one’s perceived capabilities for learning or performing actions at designated levels” (Schunk &amp; Mullen, 2012, p. 220), and has been shown to account for up to 25 percent of the variance in academic achievement (Multon et al., 1991; Schunk &amp; Pajares, 2009). The development and influence of self-efficacy on the academic achievement of first-generation college students has received relatively little attention in the literature. Implementing a case study approach, this study intended to understand how self-efficacy has developed and influenced the academic success of high-achieving first-generation college students. Data for this study came from two separate in-depth interviews with 16 high-achieving college seniors enrolled in the honors program at a four-year Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Findings from the study were consistent with the core tenets of self-efficacy. In the study, participants’ self-efficacy development was largely driven by positive mastery/lived experiences before and during college. Vicarious/modeled experiences and social/verbal persuasion also played a role in forming participants’ sense of capability, albeit not as consistently as lived/mastery experiences. In terms of influence, the lived/mastery experiences participants identified were largely positive and more consistently influential than positive or negative vicarious/modeled experiences and/or social/verbal persuasion. Based on findings from the study, implications for practice and directions for future research are offered.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Benjamin Britten wrote five pieces for the viola, the most well-known being the Lachrymae, Op. 48: Reflections on a song of Dowland written in 1950 for the Scottish violist William Primrose.  Britten’s other viola works were composed in 1930-1932 and were written for himself to perform as the violist.  They were not published until after his death and have only recently been available for purchase.  The intent of this treatise is to help make these lesser-known works to be more accessible for instructors in order to teach these pieces to young advancing violists.  For the purpose of this study, advancing violists may be defined as students who generally are in high school or college with well-developed techniques such as vibrato, shifting, spiccato, and bow control.   </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This document includes a short biography of Benjamin Britten along with a pedagogical analysis of the pieces Reflection for Viola and Piano (1930), Elegy for Viola Solo (1930), Two Portrait (1930) No. 2, and There is a Willow Grows Aslant a Brook.  The author studied each piece and worked with a pianist to establish proper tempos and fingerings.  For rhythmically challenging ensemble passages, the author created original exercises for piano and viola to be played together.  The author also has created original exercises for practicing difficult passages and improving techniques such as shifting.  Musical examples, with alternate bowing and fingerings, are also discussed in this study.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This project explores the emergence and development of researched-writing in first-year composition as it is represented in &lt;i&gt;English Journal&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;College English&lt;/i&gt;, and Indiana University Archives circa 1912-1962. By analyzing this corpus according to instructors’ purposes for, problems with, and approaches to researched-writing, this thesis offers a more nuanced perspective on early researched-writing instruction that challenges the dominant current-traditional narrative and considers how this history might be used to inform and shape other historical investigations into classroom genres, as well as current research on and approaches to researched-writing instruction in first-year composition.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Single molecule magnets (SMMs) posses multi-level energy structures with properties that make them attractive candidates for implementation into quantum information technologies. However there are some major hurdles that need to be overcome if these systems are to be used as the fundamental components of an eventual quantum computer. One such hurdle is the relatively short coherence times these systems display which severely limits the amount of time quantum information can remain encoded within them. In this dissertation, recent experiments conducted with the intent of bringing this technology closer to realization are presented.     </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The detailed knowledge of the spin Hamiltonian and mechanisms of decoherence in SMMs are absolutely essential if these systems are to be used in technologies. To that effect, experiments were done on a particularly promising SMM, the complex K₆[V[superscript IV over subscript 15As[superscript III over subscript 6]O₄₂(H₂O)] ⋅ 8H₂O, known as V₁₅. High-field electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements were performed on this system at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory. The resulting spectra allowed for detailed analysis of the V₁₅ spin Hamiltonian which will be presented as well as the most precise values yet reported for the g-factors of this system. Additionally, the line widths of the ESR spectra are studied in depth and found to reveal that fluctuations within the spin-orbit interaction are a mechanism for decoherence in V₁₅. A new model for decoherence is presented that describes very well both the temperature and field orientation dependences of the measured ESR line widths. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Also essential is the ability to control spin-states of SMMs. Presented in this dissertation as well is the demonstration of the coherent manipulation of the multi-state spin system Mn[subperscript 2+] diluted in MgO by means of a two-tone pulse drive. Through the detuning between the excitation and readout radio frequency pulses it is possible to select the number of photons involved in a Rabi oscillation as well as increase the frequency of this nutation. Experimental findings fit well the analytical model developed. This process could lead to the use of multi-level spin systems as tunable solid state qubits.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Finally, if quantum computing technologies are to be commercially realized, an on-chip method to address qubits must be developed. One way to incorporate SMMs to an on-chip device is by way of a coplanar waveguide (CPW) resonator. Efforts to create a resonator of this type to be used to perform low-temperature ESR on-chip will be described. Our work is focused on implementing such on-chip techniques in high magnetic fields, which is desirable for ESR-type of experiments in (quasi-)isotropic spin systems. Considerable attention is given to the coupling of these devices and a geometry is presented for a superconducting CPW resonator that is critically coupled. The effect of the magnetic field on the resonance position and its quality factor is addressed as well. Our devices show robust performance in field upwards of 1 Tesla and their use in performing on-chip ESR measurements seem promising.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation takes as its starting point a recurring problem within the composition classroom: women writers silencing themselves in compliance with patriarchal expectations that frame the good girl role. In the process, these students subordinate, if not entirely erase, their own feminist agency. The disempowerment of women within the writing classroom is especially worrisome given that the NCTE Mission Statement defines one of the main aims of this classroom as helping students use “language to construct personal and public worlds and to achieve full participation in society.” If the composition classroom aims to help students develop and practice rhetorical agency, how can this goal be successfully met when women students are implicitly and explicitly taught to adopt a classroom persona of silence? </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To address the problem of the good girl identity within the composition classroom, I turn to an exploration of feminist agency enacted beyond academia. Women have not – perhaps have never – been completely disempowered or completely silenced. Historically and currently, women have developed innovative and effective ways of performing feminist agency in social spaces beyond the classroom. Accordingly, this dissertation asks, “What strategies for fostering feminist agency in the composition classroom might be derived from the practice of feminist agency deployed outside of the classroom?” To answer this question, I first identify the visual, linguistic, and embodied strategies employed by feminist activists beyond classroom walls. Next, I consider how the activists use these strategies to support enactments of feminist agency within their specific spheres. Finally, I analyze these enactments in order to discern specific strategies we can use for fostering feminist agency within the composition classroom. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation consists of three case study analyses. The first analysis focuses on The Guerrilla Girls, a feminist art activist group. The second examines Here. In My Head, a feminist perzine, and the third considers the feminist music album A Woman’s Reprieve. Within each case study, I conduct first-hand interviews with the participants and textual analyses of the activists’ work. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This analysis of the rhetorical practices of feminist activists has revealed three valuable conclusions regarding feminist agency. 1) Effective feminist agency, understood as action that challenges rather than perpetuates patriarchal ideologies, begins with the personal and circulates beyond the self. 2) Choice, self-determination, action, and audience participation are central tenets to effective enactments of feminist agency. 3) One overarching goal of feminist activists is to promote a more inclusive reality, one that values women and their experiences/perspectives within the public sphere. These conclusions call on us to consider fascinating avenues through which we might foster feminist agency within the composition classroom. Specifically, my study proposes that we can foster feminist agency within the classroom by emphasizing its personal, active, public, and collaborative characteristics, and I offer specific pedagogical means for doing so.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>ABSTRACT</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of argumentation scaffolding on problem-solving outcomes and learner motivation in a Problem-Based Learning course.  Undergraduate students enrolled in a mandatory introductory logic course were randomly assigned to either the experimental (argumentation scaffolding) or control (verbal guidance) condition. Students in each condition were randomly assigned to small groups of five students within the class.  Other than the argumentation scaffolding treatment, the remaining activities were the same for the experimental and control conditions.  Problem-solving outcomes were measured using scores from a pretest and posttest that consisted of five ill-structured questions.  The pretest was administered prior to the study, and the posttest was administered after the treatment on the last day of the study.  Prior to administering the posttest, participants completed a self-reported survey to measure their level of motivation at the end of the study.  Results revealed there was a statistically significant difference in mean problem solving scores – from pretest to posttest – between the experimental and control conditions F(1, 95) = 206.37, p  &lt; .05.  Participants in the argumentation scaffolding condition scored significantly higher (M = 28.36) than students in the verbal guidance condition (M = 21.13) on the posttest. Results also revealed that there was not a significant difference in learner motivation between the experimental and control conditions F(1,95) =  0.01, p &gt; .05.  Participants in the argumentation scaffolding condition (M = 3.37) did not score significantly higher on motivation than students in the verbal guidance condition (M = 3.39).  While the findings suggest argumentation scaffolding is an effective instructional strategy for the development of problem-solving skills, the results suggest no effect on learner motivation. Researchers and educators can apply this information and use it to structure research conditions so that argumentation can have a more positive effect on participants.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Groundwater is a vital natural resource, and our ability to protect and manage this resource efficiently and effectively relies heavily on our ability to perform reliable and accurate computer modeling and simulation of subsurface systems. This frequently raises research questions involving parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification, which are often prohibitively expensive to answer using standard high-dimensional computational models. We have previously demonstrated the ability to replace the high-dimensional models used to solve linear, uncoupled, diffusion-dominated multi-species reactive transport systems with low-dimension approximations using reduced order modeling (ROM) based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). In this work, we seek to apply ROM to more general reactive transport systems, where the reaction terms may be nonlinear, mathematical models may be coupled, and the transport may be advection-dominated. We discuss the use of operator splitting, which is prevalent in the reactive transport field, to simplify the computation of complex systems of reactions in the transport model. We also discuss the use of some stabilization methods which have been developed in the computational science community to treat advection-dominated transport problems. We present a method by which we are able to incorporate stabilization and operator splitting together in the finite element setting. We go on to develop methods for implementing both operator splitting and stabilization in the ROM setting, as well as for incorporating both of them together within the ROM framework. We present numerical results which establish the ability of this new approach to produce accurate approximations with a significant reduction in computational cost, and we demonstrate the application of this method to a more realistic reactive transport problem involving bioremediation.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>An inverse kinematic proton scattering experiment was performed at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) using the GRETINA-S800 detector system in conjunction with the Ursinus College liquid hydrogen target. $\gamma$-ray yields from the experiment were determined using geant4 simulations, generating state population cross sections. These cross sections were used to extract the delta_3 deformation length for the low-lying octupole vibration excitations in Ca-48,49 using the coupled channels analysis code fresco. Particle-core coupling in Ca-49 was studied in comparison to Ca-48 through determination of the neutron and proton deformation lengths. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The total inverse kinematic proton scattering deformation lengths were evaluated for the low-lying octupole vibration excitations in Ca-48,49 to be delta_3(Ca-48, 3^-_1) = 1.0(2)fm, delta_3(Ca-49, 9/2^+_1) = 1.2(1)fm, delta_3 (Ca-49, 9/2^+_1) = 1.5(2)fm, delta_3(Ca-49, 5/2^+_1) = 1.1(1)fm. Proton and neutron deformation lengths for two of these octupole states were also determined to be delta_p(Ca-48, 3^-_1) = 0.9(1)fm, delta_p (Ca-49, 9/2^+_1) = 1.0(1)fm, delta_n(Ca-48, 3^-_1) = 1.1(3)fm, and delta_n(Ca-49, 9/2^+_1) = 1.3(3)fm. Additionally, the ratios of the neutron to proton transition matrix elements were also determined for these two states to be M_n/M_p(Ca-48, 3^-_1) = 1.7(6) and M_n/M_p(Ca-49, 9/2^+_1) = 2.0(5). Statistically, the derived values for these two nuclei are nearly identical.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation is an economic analysis of the private security industry in the United States. In particular, private security's effect on crime, the rise of varied state level private security regulatory institutions, and the consequences of private security occupational licensing requirements will be examined. Empirical methods are used to test hypotheses that private security has an effect on many different types of violent and property crime. Specific regulations of state level private security licensing processes are used as instruments in this empirical test. Evidence from state level data suggests that private security generates positive externalities in the form of general crime deterrence. This evidence provides grounds on which to argue for an inclusion of private security in the economic model of crime. The regulatory process is also empirically analyzed from a public choice and regulatory capture perspective. The incentives of the regulatory bodies made up of industry representatives and/or public police are compared to regulatory institutions that do not include such representation. This evidence suggests that when existing private security guards are in charge of the occupation licensing requirements of their own industry, these requirements tend to be stricter. The impact of these stricter licensing regulations on industrial organization is also examined. Empirical evidence suggests that some licensing requirements influence the distribution of private security firm sizes. In particular, relatively small firms are disproportionately harmed by these requirements. A short introductory chapter will be followed by three analytical chapters dealing with these issues, and finally, by a concluding chapter where the implications of the three analytical chapters are considered together.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Each year, the college student population becomes more diverse (National Center for Education Statistics, 2013), yet the career development field does not have a full understanding of how client factors, such as ethnicity, affect intervention outcomes (Whiston &amp; Rahardja, 2008). This study focused on the career development of first generation college students, a traditionally more diverse subset of the university population who tend to struggle with the career decision&amp;ndash;making process more than their counterparts (Chen &amp; Carroll, 2005; Hartley, 2009). The study&amp;rsquo;s aim was to determine whether completion of an online self&amp;ndash;exploration intervention, the Self&amp;ndash;Directed Search (SDS) Form R Internet version (Holland, Reardon, Latshaw, Rarick, &amp; Schneider, 1999), would increase career decision&amp;ndash;making self&amp;ndash;efficacy and decrease goal instability levels in 100 first generation college students using a true experimental design. Additionally, this study considered whether initial perceived barriers would impact the intervention&amp;rsquo;s effectiveness. Goal instability was measured using the Goal Instability Scale (GIS; Robbins &amp; Patton, 1985), career decision&amp;ndash;making self&amp;ndash;efficacy was measured using the Career Decision&amp;ndash;Making Self&amp;ndash;Efficacy Scale&amp;mdash;Short Form (CDMSE&amp;ndash;SF; Betz, Klein, &amp; Taylor, 1996), and perceived barriers were measured using the Perception of Barriers Scale (POB; Luzzo &amp; McWhirter, 2001).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A two&amp;ndash;way MANOVA omnibus test was used to determine whether the intervention impacted career decision&amp;ndash;making self&amp;ndash;efficacy or goal instability levels, given initial perceived barriers. After completing the intervention, the treatment group showed no statistically significant differences in goal instability or career decision&amp;ndash;making self&amp;ndash;efficacy, given perceived barriers levels, when compared to the control group. However, both groups showed a statistically significant increase in goal instability and statistically significant decrease in career decision&amp;ndash;making self&amp;ndash;efficacy. Because the entire sample showed this change, the change cannot be attributed to the intervention, but rather an external, unknown factor. Possible explanations for this outcome are discussed in detail. Finally, in an exploratory analysis, career decision state showed a significant positive relationship with perceived barriers, meaning that individuals less certain about their career decision had higher levels of perceived barriers. The correlational analysis also revealed a positive relationship between career decision&amp;ndash;making self&amp;ndash;efficacy gain score and goal instability gain score. This relationship implies that as career decision&amp;ndash;making self&amp;ndash;efficacy increases, goal instability decreases, and vice versa.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this project is to explore the representation of gender and power in three selected works by the Peruvian writer Aurora Cáceres. The three specific works selected are her: novel La rosa muerta, travel log Oasis de arte, and autobiography Mi vida con Enrique Gómez Carrillo. They will be analyzed in order to discern how this author has portrayed her  feminine perspective that is simultaneously subversive and hegemonic in regards to societal norms. This in turn will expand the literary epoch of modernismo in order to include a well versed novelist, activist, and essayist  that enriches the feminine perspective.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The Summer Treatment Program for Adolescents (STP-A) is a summer long intensive treatment for adolescents with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) that uses several components of applied behavior analysis.  The participants in this secondary data analysis were adolescents ranging from 10 to 16 years of age entering grades six and nine.  This study assessed changes in observable behavior related to improvement in the self-regulatory behavior, learning strategy usage, and academic achievement of the adolescents (e.g., time spent on-task during study hall, flashcard accuracy, and quiz scores), when controlling for grade level.  The results suggest that the treatment components of the STP-A are helpful in improving the study habits and academic achievement of the participants.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The goal of this study was to fill gaps in the literature on the consistent and significant link between seasonality and suicide, specifically with regard to recent suicide attempts and deaths in the United States. To accurately determine current seasonality trends in attempted suicide in the US a large, representative, and up-to-date sample of emergency department cases was analyzed using 2006-2011 data from the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS) database. Hypothesis 1 stated that there would be significant seasonal differences in attempted suicide and was supported, with spring and fall peaks. Hypothesis 2 stated that there would be significant seasonal differences in deaths by suicide and was supported, but unexpectedly there was only a summer peak in deaths by suicide, but no spring or fall peaks. Hypothesis 3 stated that there would be significant differences in weekday versus weekend suicide attempt rates, and indeed there were more attempts on weekdays versus weekends. Hypothesis 4 stated that there would be significant differences in weekday versus weekend deaths by suicide, but hypothesis 4 was not supported. Hypothesis 5 stated that the magnitude in seasonal year-to-year trends in attempted suicide would decrease over time, and was supported. Hypothesis 6 stated that the magnitude in seasonal year-to-year trends in deaths by suicide would decrease over time, and was partially supported. Hypothesis 7 stated that seasonality differences for attempted suicide would persist in spite of variance explained by a diagnosis of a bipolar or depressive disorder or by income quartile, and was supported. Hypothesis 8 stated that seasonality differences for deaths by suicide would persist in spite of variance explained by a diagnosis of a bipolar or depressive disorder or by income quartile, and was supported. In general, it can be confidently asserted that seasonal effects exist. Much less confidence is given, however, to the various explanations of the mechanisms behind these effects. Further, the magnitude of seasonal effects is small compared to other factors, such as diagnosis.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Despite increasing evidence of the negative consequences of post-event processing (PEP) in social anxiety, there is limited research on interventions for PEP. The present study tested a brief cognitive intervention compared to a brief rest condition among those with varying levels of social anxiety (N = 105). Participants were randomly assigned to either condition after giving an impromptu, videotaped speech. Four days later, they returned to complete a second videotaped impromptu speech. Anxiety, avoidance behaviors, and perceptions of speech performance were assessed multiple times throughout the study. Inconsistent with prediction, condition did not predict later anxiety, avoidance behaviors, or negative perceptions of the speech performance among those with high social anxiety. Also, there was a trend toward social anxiety predicting the mean level of linear change of anxiety in the expected direction. In addition, PEP and an alternative mediator tested (worry) did not account for the relationship between condition and change in anxiety. Those with high social anxiety demonstrated a clinically significant reduction in negative perceptions of performance. Finally, the effectiveness of different strategies to intervene on PEP between the sessions was investigated. Distracting with other thoughts, watching television, and suppressing thoughts were was marginally associated with PEP, after controlling for depression. In contrast, exercising or playing sports, trying to rationalize the thoughts, using the computer, and studying or working were not associated with PEP after controlling for depression.  Findings suggest that a brief cognitive intervention for PEP may have short-term costs and necessitate multiple sessions to demonstrate effectiveness.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Early adulthood is a critical period for the development of alcohol use behavior. Many individuals mature out of drinking in their late 20’s, but some continue to drink heavily, which is associated with problematic use later in life. One factor that may influence the progression into alcohol use is the personality dimension of sociability. Sociability affects the degree of exposure to peer drinking, which is a known risk factor for alcohol use, but also may influence preference for alcohol beyond its relationship with peer drinking. Research suggests that alcohol enhances the pleasure of social experiences, and the personality dimension of sociability may be influence sensitivity to the socially rewarding effects of alcohol. Sociability may confer further risk for heavy alcohol use through its association with approach motivation. Avoidance of negative alcohol-related consequences plays a role in the maturation out of drinking, and individuals who are higher in sociability may be less motivated to avoid negative consequences of alcohol use. The present study examined whether sociability predicted increased levels of alcohol use over time as well as whether sociability interacted with alcohol-related consequences to predict changes in use over time. Archival data from the Minnesota Twin Family Study was used for the present study. Participants (N = 206) were recruited at age 17 and two follow-up assessments were conducted at 3-year intervals. Repeated Measures ANCOVAs were used to examine the effects of sociability, peer alcohol use, and alcohol-related consequences on changes in alcohol use across the three time points. Sociability was not related to changes in alcohol use over time. Interestingly, sociability was negatively associated with alcohol use at the second follow-up assessment. These results highlight the need for further research to clarify the relationship between sociability and alcohol use.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>As the need for psychosocial interventions in mental healthcare in the United States continues to be a relevant issue, music therapists can provide music interventions to address a variety of mental health objectives. The American Music Therapy Association (2013) requires that the use of such interventions must be part of evidence-based practice. As research shows low levels of evidence for psychiatric music therapy overall (Silverman, 2010a), and there are mixed perceptions of music therapy in mental healthcare (Choi, 1997; Silverman, 2006, 2010d) there is a need to continue to increase consistency of music therapy interventions and levels of evidence in music therapy research with mental health populations. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to (a) to identify possible trends in research design, participant population, and music therapy intervention techniques used in music therapy research studies with mental health populations published in The Arts in Psychotherapy, Journal of Music Therapy, and Music Therapy Perspectives the last 15 years (2000-2015), and (b) identify how these trends might apply to future music therapy research and clinical practice. Data about the publication, research design, and therapeutic process of studies (N = 42) were obtained. Data were analyzed and organized into tables, and sums and percentages were calculated. Results saw low levels of articles fitting inclusion criteria with a large percentage of studies being conducted by the same author. The most frequently studied participant populations included those with substance-abuse and addicted disorders (n = 10) and psychiatric inpatients (n = 10). The most frequently studied music therapy intervention techniques were lyric analysis (n = 17), music listening (n = 16), and songwriting (n =15). Potential explanations for findings, limitations, and suggestions for future research and clinical practice are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Studies of Mycenaean architecture describe materials, construction techniques and floor plans with less attention to the human actors occupying it. Spatial analysis offers a way to study those actors by investigating the behavior and social organization of the members of a society through their built environments. A combination of analytical techniques using space syntax and visibility graph analysis reveals Mycenaean society in its architecture. The objective methods of space syntax identify two separate groups of people in Mycenaean spaces: inhabitants and visitors. The arrangement of space in Mycenaean architecture and settlements allows or restricts encounter and interaction between these two groups and reveals the mutually reflexive principles of spatial and social organization.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the configuration of space for the possible encounters between inhabitants and visitors, Mycenaean architecture reflects either a private or a public nature. A private system is arranged for small household groups that are well integrated but segregated from the exterior, especially where residential activities are present. The restricted access and segregation of strangers demonstrates a social organization that aligns with a current interpretation that Mycenaean society practiced exclusionary socio-political strategies with restricted access to wealth and power. The presence of visitors in public buildings means permeable boundaries with the exterior but segregation in the visual field. In public spatial systems, access is restricted as much by visual depth as by multiple gates and doors controlling movement. The behavior of inhabitants and visitors, demonstrated through patterns of movement and visibility, correlates with the arrangement of space and the functions contained within the buildings. Integration of spaces within the walls of buildings, whether private or public, suggests a well integrated social group of inhabitants which may reflect the same social organization conjectured in contemporary chamber tombs.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Settlement spaces appear to follow very similar principles to those revealed in architecture. Settlement space is configured to facilitate the activities that involve local inhabitants with the depth to control the movement of visitors. Spatial analysis confirms that movement is a strong organizing principle in Mycenaean spaces and it is controlled through the visual field. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In revealing Mycenaean social organization as constituted in Mycenaean architecture and settlements, this study offers a way to think about the Mycenaeans themselves. Chapter 1 recounts the scholarship devoted to understanding Mycenaean society through its architecture. I introduce the sample of buildings and settlements analyzed. Chapter 2 explains the theory and methods used. A selection of spatial variables tested through space syntax and visibility graph analysis using a program called Depthmap reveal the nature of the spatial principles which in turn reflect Mycenaean social organization. Chapter 3 describes the spatial system of selected houses from Mycenae and Tiryns and suggests similarities among the structures assigned by Darcque to this group. Houses demonstrate segregation from the exterior but lack internal restrictions on movement and visibility, suggesting a well integrated group of inhabitants. Chapter 4 describes the small sample that includes the palaces at Tiryns and Pylos with the Residence at Gla. These structures have spatial features in common but are clearly differentiated from houses in that there is greater accessibility and the probability for social interaction. The larger size of the palatial spatial systems acts to restrict movement and make that movement difficult. Buildings of Darcque’s intermediate category, described in Chapter 5, do not suggest a coherent and separate group but instead similarities with either houses or palaces. The entire sample is compared in Chapter 6 in which some of the variables confirm similar spatial principles. A statistical analysis of the results confirms asymmetry in the organization of Mycenaean space and establishes the correlation between the size of the system and the quality of movement. In Chapter 7, the four settlements containing the architecture analyzed in Chapters 3, 4 and 5 are subject to the same methods and demonstrate the application of the same spatial principles constituting the same social organization. Chapter 8 provides an opportunity to demonstrate the value and challenges of analyzing archaeological material using select houses from Akrotiri. In this chapter, I also demonstrate how the accumulated data can be used to predict the arrangement of space and to aid in reconstructing fragmentary plans using a selection of buildings from the unexcavated site of Korphos: Kalamianos. Chapter 9 concludes the dissertation summarizing the findings of this study, evaluating the methods used and suggesting directions for future research.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Although spheres and spheroids have been used extensively by researchers as convenient models to approximate "snowflakes" when computing their microwave scattering properties, recent research indicates that the scattering properties of more accurately simulated snowflakes are fundamentally different from the simplified models. To resolve this well-recognized discrepancy, a new snowflake aggregation model is developed in this study and the microwave single-scattering properties of the modeled aggregate snowflakes are characterized for use in radiative transfer modeling and remote sensing algorithm development. Three different aggregate snowflake types (rounded, oblate and prolate) are generated by random aggregation of 6-bullet rosettes constrained by size-density relationships derived from previous field observations. Additionally, they are further constrained to empirically determined aspect ratios (ar) and fractal dimensions (df) of aggregate flakes. Due to random generation, aggregates may have the same size or mass, yet different morphology, allowing for a study into how detailed structure influences an individual flake's scattering properties. Single-scattering properties of the aggregates were investigated using discrete dipole approximation (DDA) at 10 frequencies: 10.65, 13.6, 18.7, 23.8, 35.6, 36.5, 89.0, 94.0, 165.5 and 183.31 GHz. All of these frequencies are currently used in instruments (radar and radiometers) aboard satellites involved in the research of atmospheric ice particles. Results from DDA were compared to those of Mie theory for solid and soft spheres (with a density 10% that of solid ice) and to T-matrix results for solid and soft spheroidal cases with ar values of 0.8 and 0.6 dependent on flake type (rounded, oblate or prolate).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Analyzing modeling results, it is found that above size parameter 0.75, neither solid nor soft sphere and spheroidal approximations accurately represented the DDA results for all aggregate types. The asymmetry parameter and the normalized scattering and backscattering cross-sections of the aggregate groups fell between the soft and solid spherical and spheroidal approximations. This implies that evaluating snow scattering properties using realistic shapes, such as the aggregates created in this study, is necessary in radiative transfer modeling and remote sensing studies. When examining the dependence of the single-scattering properties on each aggregate's detailed structure, morphology seemed of secondary importance. Using normalized standard deviation as a measure of relative uncertainty, it is found that the relative uncertainty in backscattering arising from the different morphologies caused by random aggregation is typically ~17%, 13% and 14% for individual particles and ~20%, 30% and 30% when integrated over size distributions for rounded, oblate and prolate flakes respectively. Relative uncertainties for other single-scattering parameters are less. These analyses indicate that a scattering database can be created to approximate the single-scattering properties of realistic aggregate flakes. A database of such aggregate flakes has been created based upon the research detailed herein, and made available for public use. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this work, it is found that flakes with similar size parameters can scatter differently. Ongoing research indicates that this is due to outer layer morphology of the flake (i.e. the arms of a dendritic snowflake) rather than any interior properties. When the interior of an aggregate flake is scrambled, the scattering results are nearly the same as the unscrambled interior whereas if the outer layer is altered, scattering results differ. Another interesting trend noted is that randomly oriented flakes with differing ar values have noticeably differing backscatter cross-sections and could have significant implications for future research.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>With the latest developments in computer based testing, implementing equating techniques that incorporate automated essay scoring systems such as e-rater are encouraging potential new directions for equating mixed-format tests of writing that include multiple-choice (MC) items and an essay. The inclusion of generic e-rater essay scores into the anchor set was used to adjust for essay prompts’ difficulty. A pseudo-test form study was completed to investigate the impact of using generic e-rater scores to equate mixed-format tests that consist of MC items and a single essay. Equating outcomes for the proposed equating methodology (MC+e-rater scores) as an alternative to the current MC-only anchor-item set approach for the mixed-format tests revealed some promising results. The kappa and observed agreements for pass/fail status determined from the composite scores were very large and similar for all six equating methods comparing the alternate method to the current approach. The findings indicate that MC+e-rater equating outcomes are as strong as the MC-only equating results, and even better for some conditions.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Psychophysiology research pertaining to affective processing has commonly utilized experimental tasks that present pictures of emotional salience in addition to non-emotional content pictures. The most common picture set used in psychophysiological research is the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). Various manipulations of picture presentation have been used in previous studies such as rapid picture viewing, in which pictures are presented at quick rates ranging from 3-12 Hz. Measuring event-related potentials (ERPs) during this type of task enables us to study underlying neural processes involved in the recognition and more elaborative processing of affective information in our environments as well as possible processing deficits in individuals expressing psychopathological symptoms. The current study investigated two commonly measured ERP components - early posterior negativity (EPN) and late positive potential (LPP) - during a rapid picture-viewing task using both standard time domain and frequency-filtered time-domain approaches to isolate distinct subcomponents of activity corresponding to initial stimulus registration and subsequent elaborative-associative processing of affective visual stimuli. Another major focus of this study was to gain more comprehensive insight into the possible modulations in EPN and LPP responses given individual differences in externalizing psychopathology. Results suggested that both unfiltered and filtered EPN and LPP responses were enhanced for affective pictures as compared to neutral pictures. Furthermore, there was enhancement in the EPN response for high externalizing prone individuals; however, there was a significant reduction in the LPP response for high externalizing prone individuals as compared to low externalizing individuals. In summary, results indicate that initial affective processing was intact or enhanced and reactive in manner for high externalizing individuals, but post-perceptual affective processing was significantly reduced.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to determine whether older adults prefer traditional music therapy techniques or iPad assisted music therapy techniques. Participants (N=17) for this study were well-elderly adults contacted through a local Senior Center in the southeastern part of the country. All participants were at least 65 or older, in typical health, and able to give consent for their own participation (being of sound mind). After giving consent, each participant participated in four music therapy sessions, once per week, which included both traditional and iPad assisted techniques. The first session focused on singing and instrument play, the second session focused on movement to music, the third session focused on relaxation, and the fourth session focused on reminiscence. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Directly after each session the participants completed a survey asking them to rate their preferences between traditional and iPad assisted music therapy techniques. Using One-Way ANOVA and Dependent t tests, analysis revealed that participants prefer traditional music therapy during the instrument sing/play and movement sessions, but preferred iPad assisted music therapy during the relaxation and reminiscence sessions. At the conclusion of the study, participants were asked to complete a final a wrap-up survey to document their overall preferences between traditional and iPad assisted music therapy techniques. Results found that participants preferred the iPad assisted music therapy for the overall entire study.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The present study deals with the stratigraphy and petrography of the Upper Cretaceous through Paleocene carbonate sequence obtained from a deep well located in Polk County, Florida. Subsurface stratigraphy was measured and described at one locality from a deep well drilled nearly 8,000 ft (~2,438 m). Based on previous studies and lithologic changes that observed under stereo and petrographic microscope, the studied interval is stratigraphically subdivided into three formations. This study spans a 3400-5700 ft (~1,036-2,193 m) interval encompassing Upper Cretaceous Pine Key and Lawson formations and the Paleocene Cedar Keys Formation. Petrographic investigation of the selected sequence led to identification of lithostratigraphy, depositional environment and diagenetic history of Upper Cretaceous-Paleocene rocks. This study revealed that approximately 1,000 ft (~305 m) of a carbonate-evaporite sequence (mainly dolostone and small portions of limestone) are within the Cedar Keys Formation (3,400-4,400 ft [~1,036-1,341 m]), almost 700 ft (~213 m) white to tan limestone that includes dolomitized portions and small amount of anhydrite belongs to the Lawson Formation (4,400-5,100 ft [~1,341- 1,555 m]), and 600 ft (~183 m) white chalky limestone is from the Pine Key Formation (5,100-5,700 ft [~1,555- 1,737 m]). A number of microfacies were recognized in thin sections representing shallow subtidal to intertidal depositional environments of Lawson Formation and shallow subtidal to supratidal depositional environments of Cedar Keys Formation. Thin section analysis revealed that the Lawson and Cedar Keys formations have a complex diagenetic history that is characterized by several diagenetic features such as micritization, cementation, dissolution, dolomitization, and recrystallization. These complex diagenetic features took place under marine, mixed-marine and fresh water as well as fresh water environments. The Upper Cretaceous Lawson Formation represents a general transgressive to regressive cycle in sea-level</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>while the Cedar Keys Formation indicates more restricted marine environment representing lower sea-levels and multiple transgressive and regressive cycles.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Many nutritionally beneficial plants contain bitter compounds that may cause people to exclude them from their diets. The perception of these compounds has been hypothesized to be modulated by the interaction of salivary proteins, but the effect of these proteins on the response of the taste nerves has yet to be studied. Our study is the first to demonstrate an effect of salivary proteins in diminishing the response of the chorda tympani nerve to quinine. In a follow-up experiment, we demonstrate that these salivary proteins are able to precipitate quinine out of solution, which may interfere with its ability to stimulate the taste receptors. These data suggest a role of salivary proteins in modulating bitter taste perception.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Wind turbines are getting bigger to extract more power from wind. In the past decade, the wind turbines heights increased up to 135 m (Enercon E126, 7.5MW capacity). Many wind turbines are constructed in earthquake prone and high velocity wind regions. The taller wind turbine structures are more susceptible to high loading events such as high intensity earthquake and high velocity wind such as hurricane wind.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Wind turbines are not catered for a particular type of high loading events. The same wind turbine could be installed in earthquake prone regions as well as high velocity wind regions. Though, these high loading events could impart comparable loading magnitude, the nature and the characteristics of these loads are different. The failure of one turbine in the wind farm could disrupt the operation of an entire wind farm. This makes it imperative to evaluate performance of the wind turbine towers under the action of high loading events. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The objective of the present study is to evaluate the performance of the wind turbine tower for earthquake and high velocity wind loading events. The performance was evaluated by probabilistic approach by employing fragility analysis. For earthquake fragility analysis four displacement based limit states: a) global buckling b) yielding c) permanent deformation d) foundation overturning were defined. The wind fragility analysis was performed by defining three limit states: a) global buckling b) yielding, c) foundation overturning. The demand data, as required for fragility analysis, comes from the full scale nonlinear analysis by applying earthquake and wind loads. The capacity data comes from the pushover analysis by applying loads along the different directions.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Few studies in the recent past include creating the simplified wind turbine model, and analyzing the particular type of response. In the present study, a full scale model of a wind turbine tower based on Vestas 1.65 MW was created with details such as door and cable opening at the bottom. The height of the tower was 80 m. The nacelle and rotor were simplified as concentrated mass at the top of the tower. The finite element model comprises of shell and solid elements for main body of the structure, the point mass elements for nacelle and rotor assembly. The turbine model was validated for geometric, engineering and dynamic properties. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The seismic loadings were applied as earthquake accelerations availed from PEER (Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research) center database. The earthquake loads were the time history acceleration records in orthogonal directions. The preliminary analysis performed by applying original earthquake loads did not fail the turbine tower. The earthquake records were scaled by the factor of 2.5 so as to fail the structure. The near and far fault acceleration loadings were applied at the base of the wind turbine tower. The wind loadings were applied as wind fields generated by TURBSIM for various mean wind velocities. The wind loads were applied with the attack angles of 0 and 30 degrees with respect to the rotor axis.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the case of near fault earthquake loading, the maximum magnitude for the response spectral acceleration in the present study was 1.715 g. When the response spectral acceleration reaches to 1.715 g, the exceedance probability for global buckling was found to be 5.7%. The exceedance probability for yielding was found to be 68%. The exceedance probability for permanent deformation was found to be 26.4%, whereas the exceedance probability for foundation overturning was found to be 99.4%. In case of far fault loading, the maximum magnitude of spectral acceleration was 0.57 g. When the response spectral acceleration reaches this value the exceedance probability was found to be 0% for global buckling, 0.4% for yielding, 0.25 % for permanent deformation and 10.8% for foundation overturning limit state. For both the near and far fault loading, the foundation overturning was found to be the most critical limit state. This foundation was not designed for an earthquake prone region. The analysis was performed by improving the foundation by increasing the width from 15 m to 16.56 m. The exceedance probability rendering to failure was found to be reduced significantly. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the case of high velocity wind, the maximum mean wind velocity was 70 m/s. In case of 0 degree wind direction, the exceedance probability for all the three limit states were found to be 0% even when the mean wind velocity reaches to the maximum value of 70 m/s. In case of 30 degree wind direction, when the mean wind velocity reaches to 70 m/s, the exceedance probability for global buckling was found to 0%, the exceedance probability for yielding was found to be 88%, the exceedance probability for foundation overturning was found to be 100%. This foundation also was adopted from a hazard-free region and shown to be susceptible to failure. The exceedance probability leading to the failure was found to be reduced when the foundation was improved by increasing the width from 15 m to 16.56 m.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>For the wind turbine studied in this research, it could be concluded that the foundation overturning is the most critical limit state, and needs a due consideration while designing the wind turbine tower system. In case of earthquake, the near fault earthquake loading is the most detrimental to the stability of the wind turbine structures. The first mode failure governs the safety and satiability of the wind turbine structures. The 30 degree wind direction loading is more critical wind direction compared to 0 degree wind direction loading.  Repeating the analysis for different wind turbine types, capacities and sizes would give more data, and more comprehensive conclusion could be drawn.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to describe the current state of sight-singing pedagogy in choral ensembles at degree-granting institutions in the United States accredited by the National Association of Schools of Music. A survey of collegiate choral conductors was designed and distributed nationwide. In total, 33.3% (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 363) of those invited to participate responded. Substantial data were collected from conductors who indicated they occasionally integrated a sight-singing system into their choral rehearsals for specific purposes (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 137) and those who indicated they frequently used a sight-singing system as a key rehearsal tool (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 114). In addition, interviews with three survey participants were conducted for a more in-depth examination of their unique philosophies and practices.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Survey data revealed that there was no significant difference between the number of choral conductors who did not use or very rarely used a system for music-reading, those who occasionally integrated a sight-singing system into their rehearsals for specific purposes, and those for whom a sight-singing system was a key rehearsal tool that they used frequently. However, among respondents in the latter two categories who did not hold a degree in music education, there was a significant (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = .018) preference for &lt;i&gt;occasional&lt;/i&gt; rather than &lt;i&gt;frequent&lt;/i&gt; use of a sight-singing system. Among those who &lt;i&gt;occasionally&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;frequently&lt;/i&gt; used a system there was a significant preference for movable-Do solfège for major-key tonal solmization (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; .001), movable-Do solfège (tonic is “La”) for minor-key tonal solmization (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = .001), and instrumental counting (“1-e-&amp;-a 2”) for rhythmic solmization (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; .001). Among those who &lt;i&gt;frequently&lt;/i&gt; used a system, the data showed a significant decline in both the number of days per week they provided sight-singing instruction at the beginning of term, at the middle of term, and at the end of term (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; .01) as well as between the number of minutes per rehearsal they provided sight-singing instruction during those three periods of the semester (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; .01). Among those who &lt;i&gt;frequently&lt;/i&gt; used a system, choral literature being prepared for performance was the significant first-choice, selected by 88%, of materials used to teach sight-singing. Among the same participants, 14% individually assessed their students’ sight-singing, 44% sometimes did, and 43% did not.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	For conductors who &lt;i&gt;frequently&lt;/i&gt; used a system, the most important perceived benefit of doing so was enabling their choirs to learn music faster. The attitude statements about which conductors agreed most strongly were that sight-singing ability is an important skill for all collegiate choral singers and that sight-singing ability should be a prerequisite for auditioned collegiate choral ensembles. Conductors who &lt;i&gt;occasionally&lt;/i&gt; used a system agreed significantly more strongly with the latter statement than those who &lt;i&gt;frequently&lt;/i&gt; did (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; .04), while conductors who &lt;i&gt;frequently&lt;/i&gt; used a system agreed significantly more strongly with the statement that students generally enjoy instructional time devoted to sight-singing than those who &lt;i&gt;occasionally&lt;/i&gt; did (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; .001). Music educators felt significantly stronger that empowering their students for lifelong music-making and improving performances were benefits of systematic sight-singing instruction than non-music educators did.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Conductors contacted for interviews emphasized the importance of fostering choral rehearsal cultures in which complete musicianship and musical literacy are valued and provided philosophical and practical reasons for doing so. They outlined possible challenges to instituting choral sight-singing at the collegiate level as well as potential solutions to those difficulties. They also discussed the effects of sight-singing instruction on relationships with music theory and music education faculty.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Assessment and accountability has been a major influence in public education since the introduction of No Child Left Behind and continue to influence teachers and students with the signing of Race to the Top.  In Florida, the value-added model (VAM) is beginning to be implemented into teacher evaluations.  These evaluations take into account student gains on NCLB assessments and formal instructional observations.  However, teachers have had very little say in the implementation of this new law and the Common Core State Standards.  When it comes to teacher understanding of a policy, teacher understanding can play a role in how teachers implement and approach a policy.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This instrumental qualitative study (Stake, 1995) focused on the role of VAM and merit pay play in how teachers view their work in the school and school community.  Using Bandura’s Social Cognitive Theory (1984), Control-Value Theory (Pekrun, 2006), and the emerging model from my preliminary study (Pressley, 2014) I focused on how VAM and merit pay impacts teachers’ motivation to change their instruction.  This study focused on 13 elementary teachers from schools with different grades (one A, two B, and two C) with three teachers from all but one school (C2).  Overall, I found that the teachers had limited knowledge of VAM and had negative feelings about VAM being part of their evaluations.  These feelings were based on the low value and low control teachers felt regarding their student test scores that are used to determine a VAM score.  The teachers did not feel that VAM drove their changes in instruction; however, teachers were still changing instruction.  The changes were made either for higher observation scores, student learning or were district mandated.  When it came to merit pay, ten of the thirteen teachers did not want to give up tenure for merit pay.  The teachers felt there could be mixed impact on the school community because of merit pay depending on the sense of community between teachers within the school or grade level team.  Lastly, even though the teachers had negative feelings regarding VAM the teachers were not against teacher accountability.  Based on these findings, implications for future research and practice are considered.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Intelligent and effective monitoring of power system stability in control centers is one of the key issues in smart grid technology to prevent unwanted power system blackouts. Voltage stability analysis is one of the most important requirements for control center operation in smart grid era. With the advent of Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) or Synchrophasor technology, real time monitoring of voltage stability of power system is now a reality. This work utilizes real-time PMU data to derive a voltage stability index to monitor the voltage stability related contingency situation in power systems. The developed tool uses PMU data to calculate voltage stability index that indicates relative closeness of the instability by producing numerical indices. The IEEE 39 bus, New England power system was modeled and run on a Real-time Digital Simulator that stream PMU data over the Internet using IEEE C37.118 protocol. A Phasor data concentrator (PDC) is setup that receives streaming PMU data and stores them in Microsoft SQL database server. Then the developed voltage stability monitoring (VSM) tool retrieves phasor measurement data from SQL server, performs real-time state estimation of the whole network, calculate voltage stability index, perform real-time ranking of most vulnerable transmission lines, and finally shows all the results in a graphical user interface. All these actions are done in near real-time. Control centers can easily monitor the systems condition by using this tool and can take precautionary actions if needed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This paper will discuss the interaction between renowned Hindu reformer Rammohun Roy, and Christian Unitarians, in the early 19th century.  Roy, while predominately known as a Hindu theologian and social reformer, also demonstrated a strong interest in Unitarian Christianity, and maintained correspondence with many Unitarians throughout his lifetime.  An examination of Roy’s biography, paying special attention to his religious education, and his experiences in Calcutta, his religious writings, his interactions with Christian Unitarians, and his available correspondence will all be used to help explain why Roy was interested in Unitarian Christianity.  Previous attempts to examine this issue, have focused primarily on theology, trying to like Roy’s personal religious or theological influences with his interest in Unitarianism. However by examining Roy’s life, particularly his published correspondence, along with his interaction with Unitarians, this paper will argue that it is ethical and practical concerns, not theological ones, that drove Roy’s interest in Unitarianism, and help explain his reluctance to publicly discuss his personal beliefs about Unitarianism.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>A long-standing debate in the attention literature has been that when something captures our attention, why does it do so?  Some strongly argue that attention is captured only by salient stimuli (bottom-up view); others strongly argue capture is always due to a match between the stimulus and our current goals (top-down view).  Many different paradigms have provided evidence for one view or the other.  If these strong views are correct, capture represents a unitary phenomenon and there should be a high correlation between capture in these paradigms, but if there are different types of capture (top-down, bottom-up) some attention capture effects should be correlated and some should be uncorrelated.   We compared two competing latent factor models (1 factor vs. 2) using tasks purporting to provide evidence in favor of one view or another.  Findings from this study (N = 145) favored capture as a unitary phenomenon, but in general, capture scores were not highly correlated with one another, suggesting that capture may in fact be strongly determined by idiosyncratic task demands and strategies.  Finding should be interpreted with caution, however, as measures of reliability indicated low reliability of tasks measuring capture, especially bottom-up capture.  Implications for low reliability of capture paradigms are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>An essential relationship between science, subjectivity, and music is evident in the work of Joseph Conrad. The origins of this interdependence can be traced back to the Romantic metaphysics of the early nineteenth century, when the aesthetics of absolute music began to defend the primacy of music as an unmotivated, autonomous form of art. Despite the influence of scientific positivism during the second half of the nineteenth century, music continued to enjoy a privileged reputation and is cited by Conrad in the Preface to The Nigger of the "Narcissus" as the highest art. Conrad's interest in music was specifically related to the alternatives that its temporality provided for new narrative forms, and in Heart of Darkness Conrad makes an explicit attempt to create a narrative voice based on the aesthetics of absolute music. This attempt proves problematic, however, and in his late novel Victory Conrad reflects on the tragic contradictions inherent in the relationship between music and the realization of subjective autonomy.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The chemical complexity of crude oil, arguably the most complex mixture in the world, has been addressed over the past decade by ultrahigh resolution FT-ICR MS.  FT-ICR MS has shown to be well suited to complex mixture analysis, and the mass accuracy and resolving power of FT-ICR MS provides the ability to assign unique chemical formulas to observed petroleum compounds.  Although FT-ICR MS has proven a useful technique for petroleum characterization, the complexity of increasingly heavy crude oils challenges even the highest resolution mass spectrometers.  The work presented here utilizes chromatographic separations to enhance the information derived from crude oil analysis by FT-ICR MS.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Organic acids found in crude oils are known to cause corrosion, emulsions, and deposit formations during the production and refining processes.  Aminopropyl silica was used to separation carboxylic acid compounds (i.e., naphthenic acids) from crude oil.  This separation also fractionates acids by molecular weight and provides insight into previously undetected high molecular weight acids.  Tetraprotic carboxylic acids (i.e., ARN acids) were also targeted by aminopropyl silica separation and further targeted by ammonia gas treatment.  The combination of techniques provides a fast and effective measurement for the determination of ARN acids in crude oils.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Oxidation of crude oils after environmental spills has been previously reported.  Unprecedented oxidation of crude oil was recently observed from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.  The weathering process created tens-of-thousands of newly observed oil transformation products.   Previous analysis by FT-ICR MS has catalogued these transformation products, but limited information was determined with regard to oxygen functionalities.  The coupling of liquid chromatography and FT-ICR MS, as well as derivatization techniques, provided insight into crude oil oxidation products collected from the Gulf of Mexico.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Asphaltenes have been referred to as the "bad actors" of petroleum because of their propensity to fall out of solution and form devastating deposits in wells and pipelines.  Additives known as asphaltene inhibitors are often added to oil wells to prevent deposition.  Quantitation of chemical additives is imperative to understanding their efficiency.  Here LC-MS was utilized to determine the concentration of an asphaltene inhibitor additive in crude oil.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Composite textiles have found widespread use and advantages in various industries and applications. The constant demand for high quality products and services requires companies to minimize their manufacturing costs, and delivery time in order to compete in general and niche marketplaces. Advanced manufacturing methods aim to provide economical methods of mold production. Creation of molding and tooling options for advanced composites encompasses a large portion of the fabrication time, making it a costly process and restraining factor. This research discusses a preliminary investigation into the use of soluble polymer compounds and additive manufacturing to fabricate soluble molds. These molds suffer from dimensional errors due to several factors, which have also been characterized. The basic soluble mold of a composite is 3D printed to meet the desired dimensions and geometry of holistic structures or spliced components. The time taken to dissolve the mold depends on the rate of agitation of the solvent. This process is steered towards enabling the implantation of optoelectronic devices within the composite to provide sensing capability for structural health monitoring. The shape deviation of the 3D printed mold is also studied and compared to its original dimensions to optimize the dimensional quality to produce dimensionally accurate parts. Mechanical tests were performed on compact tension (CT) resin samples prepared from these 3D printed molds and revealed crack propagation towards an embedded intact optical fiber.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>A recent study identified that approximately one in four women in the United States has experienced physical violence by an intimate partner during her lifetime, equaling approximately twenty-nine million women (Black, et al., 2011). Victims of domestic violence often are isolated and controlled by their partners and made to feel helpless and imprisoned.  Domestic violence shelters can provide a safe place for women to heal and begin again, and these shelters often have the goal of empowering their residents so that residents can begin to make positive life changes (Gengler, 2012).  Sheilds (1995) has identified three themes that characterize women’s empowerment: </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>•	the development of a strong sense of self; </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>•	the ability to base decisions on that sense of self; and, </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>•	a connection within a larger community. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Many domestic violence shelters have empowerment programs; however, some researchers note that many “empowering” domestic violence shelter programs have an overabundance of rules and restrictions that residents may view as controlling or patronizing (Gengler, 2012; VanNatta, 2010).  Recently, many contemporary domestic violence shelters have begun to move away from this type of environment and replace it with a minimal rules policy (Tautfest, n.d.). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	This interior environment study was driven by the notion held by some researchers that rules and restrictions are often created in response to the built environment, prompted in part by the many challenges of housing multiple people in one location (Tautfest, n.d.).  It is therefore possible that the design of shelter built environments may create unnecessary rules or improperly respond to minimal rules policies that in turn can negatively affect empowerment.  This study sought to understand if domestic violence shelters might be better designed when empowerment is the goal. Interviews with domestic violence shelter staff focused on the current shelter’s minimal rules policy and shelter architectural design in relation to resident empowerment.  Sheilds’ themes of empowerment were used as an underlying framework throughout the study.  Shelter staff members interviewed believed the built environment supported their minimal rules policy.  However, findings suggested the need for defined quiet spaces and structured design solutions that better support the minimal rules policy, particularly in the kitchen area.  Interviews also revealed that the study’s shelter could benefit from more areas that support resident goal setting and decision-making.  The existing built environment supported resident identity formation and community well.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The interviews led to the creation of a proposed design solution for a hypothetical domestic violence shelter as well as design guidelines intended to assist the creation of future shelters.  The guidelines and resulting design focus on resident empowerment and supporting a minimal rules environment by designing to accommodate multiple users and functions.  Some highlights of the design include custom storage and display space in resident bedrooms that encourage personalization and identity formation, large community areas with flexible furniture, and a myriad of quiet spaces that support resident decision-making and goal setting.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This sequential mixed methods study investigated how high school English teachers describe using blogs for their own professional development (PD), reflection, and classroom instruction using the National Council of Teacher of English (NCTE) 21st Century Literacies Framework. The NCTE 21st Century Literacies Framework is a synthesis of 21st Century Skills, New Literacies Theory, Multiliteracies Theory, Literacy as a Social Practice Theory, and Critical Literacy Theory. Participants included high school English teachers who were affiliated with the National Writing Project (NWP). A total of 73 participants from the NWP participated in Tier One of this study, a survey of participant perceptions regarding blogs, professional development, and 21st century literacies, and a total of 8 participants were purposefully selected from survey data to participate in Tier Two, interviews and artifact collection.  Data collected includes a survey, interviews, and artifact collection to explore perceptions of high school English teachers regarding 21st century literacy, professional development, and educational blogging. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Tier One portrayed how the participants described using blogs for professional development and reflective practices, as well as their overall perceptions of 21st century literacies. The results of Tier One suggested that demographically, years of experience did not seem to impact whether or not teachers were actively blogging nor did it impact the perceived value of blogging. In terms of 21st century literacy perceptions, three findings emerged. The first was it seemed that while the majority of teachers selected learning new concepts as the main purpose to use blogs, the implicit learning experience was that of using a 21st century literacy tool, thus engaging participants in 21st century literacy skills. A second finding that emerged was that by choice, teachers were engaged in more synchronous PD materials compared to technology-focused, 21st century literacy materials. A third finding was teachers seemed to be less likely to incorporate 21st century literacy skills when they personally did not engage in 21st century literacy skills. In terms of non-blogging practices, one finding emerged; it seemed non-bloggers did see the potential value of blogging. In terms of professional development, two findings emerged. One finding that emerged was that the more participants engaged in their own independent PD, the more confident they were in asserting that that knowledge was and can be integrated into their classroom. A second finding was a high percentage of participants believed that the use of independent PD seemed to be more effective than mandated PD. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Tier Two data were collected using interview and artifact collection tools and analyzed qualitatively. Themes that emerged from the analysis were: 1.) Relationships, community, and global collaboration, 2.) Ethical responsibilities, 3.) Proficiency and fluency development, 4.) Global information sharing, 5.) Creation, critique, analysis, and evaluation of multimedia texts, and 6.) Challenges. These themes stemmed from the NCTE 21st Century Literacies Framework standards, and added further evidence to the findings from the Tier One data collection.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Both Tier One and Tier Two results revealed that teachers do and should use educational blogs as a classroom resource, a source of reflection, and a collaborative source. Furthermore, educational blogs can be a potential avenue for mandated, not only self-sponsored, professional development. Implications included the impact of blogging on mandated and independent PD, how mandated PD is arranged for teachers, the importance of informing teachers about blogs and blogging practices, the need to learn from the implicit nature of fluency, and the use of technology as a literacy practice, not a tool.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Blocking methods of thresholding have demonstrated many advantages over term-by-term methods in adaptive wavelet estimation.  These blocking methods are resolution-level specific, meaning the coefficients are grouped together only within the same resolution level.  Techniques have not yet been proposed for blocking across multiple resolution levels and do not take into consideration varying shapes of blocks for wavelet coefficients.  Presently, several methods of block thresholding across multiple resolution levels are described.  Various simulation studies analyze the use of these methods among nonparametric functions, including comparisons to other blocking and non-blocking wavelet thresholding methods.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The introduction of a this new technique questions when this method will be advantageous over resolution-level specific methods.  Another simulation study demonstrates a method of statistically selecting when blocking across resolution levels is beneficial over traditional techniques.  Additional analysis will conclude how effective the automated selection method is in both simulation and if put into practice.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>While existing research suggests that caregivers contribute to the onset and maintenance of adolescent substance use, research also posits that caregivers are negatively affected by adolescent substance use. However, caregivers’ experiences of adolescent substance use is the subject of little academic research, and it remains poorly understood. This study offers important empirical insights that address this significant gap in the literature. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study is to understand how caregivers perceive and describe their experience with their adolescent’s substance use. To gain a deeper understanding of the reciprocal relationship between caregivers and adolescent substance use issues, this study uses a phenomenological, qualitative research approach to examine caregivers’ experiences of their adolescent’s substance use issues. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The guiding theoretical framework is family systems theory (FST; Bowen, 1974). Additionally, the study employed a Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) approach by actively involving community members, organizational representatives, and researchers in the research process (Israel, Schulz, Parker, &amp; Becker, 1998). Data were collected through in-depth, qualitative interviews with 20 caregivers of adolescents with substance use issues. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Data analyses resulted in 6 core themes: 1) Discovering and making meaning of the substance use, 2) A complex issue, 3) A systemic issue, 4) Process of treatment, 5) Parental efficacy, and 6) The silver lining. Results illustrate how parents discovered and made meaning of their adolescent’s substance use. Findings explain how adolescent substance use is a complex and systemic issue, often disrupting the entire family system, leaving caregivers questioning their parental efficacy and negotiating the caregiver-child relationship. The results highlight the process of treatment, transformation, and the growth that took place at the individual and family level. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Several implications for future research and clinical practice were identified. The study highlights the need to further examine the reciprocal relationship between caregivers and adolescent substance use. Results can also speak to how family-focused treatment of adolescent substance use may be adapted to meet the needs of this unique population. More specific suggestions for future research and for marriage and family therapists working with families experiencing adolescent substance use issues are provided.</DISS_para>

      <DISS_content>
         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The diurnal variations from a high-resolution regional climate model (Regional Spectral Model; RSM) are analyzed from 6 independent decade long integrations using lateral boundary forcing data separately from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction Reanalysis 2 (NCEPR2), and European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) 40-year Reanalysis (ERA40) and the 20th Century Reanalysis (20CR). With each of these lateral boundary forcing data, the RSM is integrated separately using two convection schemes: the Relaxed Arakawa-Schubert (RAS) and Kain-Fritsch (KF) schemes. The results show that RSM integrations forced with 20CR have the least fidelity in depicting the seasonal cycle and diurnal variability of precipitation and surface temperature over the Southeastern United States (SEUS). The remaining four model simulations show comparable skills. The differences in the diurnal amplitude of rainfall during the summer months of the 20CR forced integration from the corresponding NCEPR2 forced integration, for example, is found to be largely from the transient component of the moisture flux convergence. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the seasonal cycle of precipitation and surface temperature of the other four simulations (not forced by 20CR) were comparable to each other and highest in the summer months. But the RMSE of the diurnal amplitude of precipitation and the timing of its diurnal zenith were largest during winter months and least during summer and fall months in the four model simulations (not forced by 20CR). The diurnal amplitude of surface temperature in comparison showed far less fidelity in all models. The phase of the diurnal maximum of surface temperature however showed significantly better validation with corresponding observations in all of the 6 model simulations</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The impacts of irrigation on SEUS diurnal climate are then investigated. An extreme case is assumed, wherein irrigation is set to 100% of field capacity over the growing season of May through October (IRR100). Irrigation is applied to the root zone layers of 10-40cm and 40-100cm soil layers only.  It is found that in this regime there is a pronounced decrease in monthly averaged temperatures in irrigated regions across all months. In non-irrigated areas a slight warming is simulated. Diurnal maximum temperatures in irrigated areas warm, while diurnal minimum temperatures cool. The daytime warming is attributed to an increase in shortwave flux at the surface owing to diminished low cloud cover. Nighttime cooling results as a consequence of higher net downward ground heat flux. Both diurnal and monthly average precipitations are reduced over irrigated areas at a magnitude and spatial pattern similar to one another. Due to the excess moisture availability, evaporation is seen to increase, but this is balanced by a corresponding reduction in sensible heat flux. Concomitant with additional moisture availability is an increase in both transient and stationary moisture flux convergences. However, despite the increase, there is a large-scale stabilization of the atmosphere stemming from a cold surface and a warmed vertical column.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Three additional regional climate model runs centered on the SEUS assume a crop growing season of May through October and are irrigated at 25%, 50%, 75% (IRR25, IRR50, IRR75, respectively) of the root zone field capacity to assess the sensitivity of the SEUS climate to irrigation. A fifth run, assuming no irrigation (CTL), is used as the basis for comparison. Across all IRR runs, it is found that there is a general reduction in monthly mean precipitation over the irrigated cells relative to CTL, with much of the change occurring in the sub-diurnal scales. This manifests as an increase dry days and reduction in &gt; 1 mm/day rainfall events. IRR25 is seen to have the lowest change in both, while IRR100 is seen to have the greatest change. Area-averaged precipitation over the irrigated cells reveals a strong reduction in precipitation in IRR100 (on the order of 0.4 mm/hr) with a much weaker reduction in IRR25. Vertically integrated moisture convergence is seen to have the most pronounced sensitivity pattern across all runs. Monthly averaged temperatures are reduced over irrigated areas, with the intensity of the reduction increasing as irrigation vigor increases. This is attributed to a systematic change in ground heat flux that transports heat into the subsurface soil layers in the irrigated cells. The precipitation ahead of the transient cold fronts is reduced by irrigation as it passes over the irrigated cells. The intensity of the net precipitation reduction becomes more intense as irrigation vigor increases. Lastly, heat waves in the SEUS are reduced in intensity just over the irrigated cells, though likely increasing in frequency due to lowered temperature thresholds for heat wave definition.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Cracking is a primary distress on flexible pavements in Florida. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the crack resistance of proposed asphalt mixtures on Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) projects. A comprehensive literature review was conducted on the evaluation of reflective cracking of HMA mixtures. Mechanisms of reflective cracking, crack models, and crack resistance evaluation was reviewed based on research studies performed by other researchers. The ability of the overlay test for characterizing the cracking-resistance performance of asphalt mixtures was methodically reviewed. Available information, such as test procedures, results, and findings, were collected and examined. The variability and effects of different factors on the overlay test, such as test setup, opening width, sample thickness, asphalt binder, and Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) materials, were also evaluated. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Cracking performance of common Florida asphalt mixtures were evaluated using laboratory Overlay Test (OT). A test procedure based on Tex-248-F test method was developed to accommodate the Florida test methods on asphalt mixtures. Nine standard mix designs for traffic level C &amp; E, which included SP-12.5, SP-9.5, and SP-4.75 mix designs, were selected to conduct the Overlay Test. Granites, which were from different sources, were used as the aggregate in the mixtures. In addition, the mixtures were prepared using both virgin asphalt binder (PG 67-22) and polymer modified asphalt (PMA) binder (PG 76-22). The effects of material characteristics, polymer modified binder, and RAP on the crack resistance of Florida asphalt mixtures were investigated. Additionally, a lower maximum opening displacement, 0.0125 inch, was tried out on one type of mixture (SP-12.5 with 20% RAP) to determine the significance of displacement rate on the crack resistance of the Florida asphalt mixture. Three replicate samples were tested for each type of mixture. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The test results had a good agreement on the three replicate samples. The coefficients of variation (COV) were less than 20%. It was found that granite from different aggregate source did not have a strong influence on the test results, while the aggregate size did have a significant effect. SP-9.5 mixtures had the best cracking performance compared to SP-12.5 and SP-4.75 mixtures. Considerable effects were found on the asphalt binder and RAP. Crack resistance of Florida asphalt mixtures was significantly improved if PG 76-22 PMA binder was used instead of PG 67-22 virgin asphalt binder. However, the crack resistance was reduced when 20% RAP was included in the mix designs. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Fracture mechanics analysis was conducted on the overlay test results based on the Paris’ Law. Besides of fracture properties A and n, crack indexes A’ and n’, which can be easily obtained from the overlay test load reduction curve, were introduced to evaluate the crack resistance of asphalt mixtures. The correlation relationships between the crack indexes and the fracture properties were developed.  It was found that the asphalt mixtures with greater n’/n values had better crack resistance than the asphalt mixtures with lower n’/n. The computed fracture properties can be compared to the results from the other tests, such as IDT. The laboratory test results can also be compared to the field observations to better predict the cracking performance of asphalt mixtures in the field. Some criteria based on the laboratory test results can be adopted into the design guide to evaluate the cracking performance of the asphalt mixtures.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Quantum computers are predicted to outperform classical computers in certain tasks, such as factoring large numbers and searching databases. The construction of a computer whose operation is based on the principles of quantum mechanics appears extremely challenging. Solid state approaches offer the potential to answer this challenge by tailor-making novel nanomaterials for quantum information processing (QIP). Molecular magnets, which are materials whose energy levels and magnetic quantum states are well defined at the molecular level, have been identified as a class of material with properties that make them attractive for quantum computing purpose.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this dissertation, I explore the possibilities and challenges for molecular magnets to be used in quantum computing architecture. The properties of molecular magnets that are critical for applications in quantum computing, i.e., quantum entanglement and coherence, are comprehensively investigated to probe the feasibility of molecular magnets to be used as quantum bits (qubits). Interactions of qubits with photons are at the core of QIP. Photons can be used to detect and manipulate qubits, after which information can then be transferred over long distances. As a potential candidate for qubits, the interactions between Fe8 single-molecule magnets (SMMs) and cavity photons were studied. An earlier report described that a cavity mode splitting was observed in a spectrum of a cavity filled with a single-crystal of Fe8 SMMs. This splitting was interpreted as a vacuum Rabi splitting (VRS), which is a signature of an entanglement between a large number of SMMs and a cavity photon. However, find that large absorption and dispersion of the magnetic susceptibility are the reasons for this splitting. This finding highlights the fact that an observation of a peak splitting in a cavity transmission spectrum neither represents an unambiguous indication of quantum coherence in a large number of spins, nor a signature of entanglement between the spins and photons.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Furthermore, the potential application of SMMs as qubits requires a quantum mechanical coupling between two or more SMMs to each other or to other components of a device, while maintaining the intrinsic single-molecule properties of each SMMs. I report a study of [MnIII</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>6 O2(O2CMe)6(dpd)3](I3)2, which is a dimer of Mn3 SMMs ([Mn3]2). This study reveals a quantum entanglement of the two Mn3 SMM units in the dimer, both in solid state and, for the first time, in solution phase. The quantum entanglement is brought about by a ferromagnetic coupling between Mn3 units which manifests in the splitting of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra. The demonstration of quantum entanglement between two SMMs in a solution has paved the way to deposit covalently-linked SMMs on surfaces for device studies.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Another requirement for qubits is a long coherence time, which can be achieved by knowing and suppressing decoherence processes. I report a new mechanism to suppress the dechorence  in holmium polyoxometalate (HoPOM) molecular magnets by using clock transitions (CTs). The</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Frequency of a CT is insensitive (at least to first order) to variations in the magnetic field. This insensitivity to the fluctuations of the surrounding magnetic fields causes the spin coherence times at CTs to be longer than those at any other spin transition. In the HoPOM system, the enhancement of coherence times by using CTs for a concentrated sample (i.e., 10% concentration) is equivalent to the enhancement from diluting the sample a hundred times.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>These studies show that there is much potential for encoding qubits within molecular magnets.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Internships have become a vital part of museum training, the premier way to gain field experience, and a service often required of perspective museum professionals (Danilov, 1994). One of the museum field's top organizations AAM (1978) wrote a collection of minimum standards for internship training programs; however a study conducted by Spanard (1983) established those minimum standards were not yet being met. In a field where internships are being used extensively for museum training we do not know what these programs consist of other than through our own individual experiences or anecdotal passages. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The components, intent, and practices of internship coordinators in AAM-accredited academic art museums were collected through a national survey to develop evidence-based literature on the curriculum of internship programs using Van den Akker's Spiderweb Model (2003) and AAM's (1978) internship minimum standards as a model. The majority of museums are not meeting the AAM minimum standards but many are meeting or exceeding curriculum components. This study encourages the museum community to consider its own practices and re-evaluate the current minimum standards set forth by AAM. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Examining current practices in the field has revealed the need for self-evaluation and further development of socialization methods through formalization of internship program curriculum. Including evaluation methods will also provide the museum with evidence they can showcase to their host university and thereby reach their cited purpose: to increase their value, visibility, and perceived worth to the university while also expanding insight into their primary audience (students). &amp;#8195;</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Chemical signals are an important mode of communication and behavior regulation in many mammalian species. Non-volatile signals are sent by one animal and received by a second animal, typically of the same species. They are detected by the vomeronasal organ, which transmits information through the accessory olfactory bulb to the medial amygdala. Within the medial amygdala, non-volatile odors are categorized based on the behavioral relevance to the receiver. Non-relevant biological odors activate only the anterior medial amygdala, whereas relevant biological odors activate both the anterior and posterior medial amygdala. The main intercalated nucleus, which lies adjacent to the medial amygdala, contains inhibitory GABA-ergic neurons, is activated by non-relevant odors, and may be responsible for suppressing posterior medial amygdala response to those odors. Intercalated cell groups are known to be inhibited by dopamine meaning the main intercalated nucleus may be involved in categorization through the effects of dopamine at the D1 receptor. The experiments presented here investigate the roles of the main intercalated nucleus, dopamine, and learning on medial amygdala activity in mice. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Within the main intercalated nucleus different doses of the dopamine agonist (SKF-38393) lead to different activation depending on which odor was presented, however this activation was not correlated with medial amygdala activity. Instead, the dopamine agonist increased medial amygdala activity in a dose dependent, but not odor dependent, manner. Classical conditioning to change an odor’s significance from non-relevant to relevant did not affect medial amygdala activity, although dopamine did blunt the effect of odor learning within the basolateral amygdala. Finally, both the dopamine agonist and antagonist (SCH-23390) disrupted the expected pattern of investigation of a novel non-relevant odor after habituation to a relevant odor.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>These results suggest that dopamine may be involved in main intercalated nucleus activity and investigation of non-relevant odors, but the role of both dopamine and the intercalated nucleus in medial amygdala activation remains unclear.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation focused on the 135th Street branch of the New York Public Library, located in the Harlem neighborhood. It focused on the library under the leadership of Ernestine Rose, who was the head librarian from 1920-1942. During this time, the library became a community center with diverse and vibrant programming, and an important influence on the Harlem Renaissance. This study focuses on a longer time period than has been examined previously, and also introduces theory testing to the document analysis, which is an underused method of historical analysis in Information Studies currently. This study uses the theory of Information Worlds, which contextualizes information behaviors within the social worlds individuals inhabit, and introduces the Change in Historic Institutions model, which provides a framework for describing change events.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>ABSTRACT</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The brick and mortar environment has for many years been the cornerstone of the process to acquire goods. As a cornerstone of the process to acquire goods, the brick and mortar environment has undergone several evolutions each promising and serving as the pinnacle of what brick and mortar environments can be. Within the last two centuries those reincarnations have led to three recognizable forms. The first is the rise of the stand alone department store, a form made iconic by companies such as Macy’s (originally R.H. Macy &amp; Co) and S. H. Kress &amp; Co (simply known as Kress). The stand alone department store then gave way to large big box retailers such as Target, Linens &amp; Things, and Wal-Mart, however many of those department stores have reinvented themselves as the anchor stores of the newest incarnation of the brick and mortar environment, the shopping mall. The indoor mall has served as a platform through which to combine many of the previous forms of brick and mortar environments such as traditional single store fronts with large department stores. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Traditionally brick and mortar stores have only needed to compete with themselves and despite offering a wealth of advantages for consumers, consumers have began to use electronic commerce (e-commerce) as a secondary or primary way to acquire goods. This has been accelerated by the increasing consumer trust in e–commerce only retailers like Amazon or Alibaba. These competition elements have contributed to the total demise of many brick and mortar retailers or the extreme downsizing of some retailer’s number of brick and mortar locations and even the widespread failure of many indoor shopping malls. The purpose of this study was to discover and detail how the careful design of the built environment can yield a viable and effective brick and mortar store design that presents itself as not only a place to complete the consumer process but serves as an indicator of a consumer’s lifestyle.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	To do this, the study was conducted in phases. The first phase was to create a knowledge base that could be used to build upon for a design solution. The first component of the base examined the current state of brick and mortar commerce and e-commerce. Secondly, as the chief competitor to brick and mortar is e-commerce, a platform had to be discovered or created that could successfully deliver those e-commerce elements. The platform was omni-channel retail. The third component of the base was to research the elements this author deemed was necessary to create a successful retail environment.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The second phase was to develop an original research component that provided the author a deeper insight. The original research component was predicated on the framework of the consumer purchase process; information gathering, product acquisition, and product support. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The third phase was to develop a program for design as well as completing the design of the retail store. The retail store was placed in a single storefront space located in a popular indoor mall in Tallahassee, Florida. As this author’s approach was to ensure the brick and mortar environment would be part of the consumer’s lifestyle, the product types chosen were those that are necessary for sports with a strong social component. The space contains products that are essential to the sports of cycling, running, and yoga. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study determined that niche markets provide a home for brick and mortar stores as these markets contain the consumer base that is most likely to use the brick and mortar space beyond a venue in which to complete the consumer process. Consumers often purchase retail items that are an extension or indicator of their lifestyles and it is important that a retail space allow elements of this lifestyle to be expressed. This creates a renewed viability in the retail environment that importantly has no equal in the e-commerce environment.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>With so few Eocene outcrops throughout Florida, it is difficult to study the Eocene-Oligocene boundary between the Ocala and Suwannee Limestone. This study provides a more detailed lithological description of the differences of rocks on either side of that boundary. In this study, core samples from seven wells throughout northern Florida and Southern Georgia were examined across what is believed to be the Gulf Trough. Samples were cut from the core of each well every six inches for approximately 1.5 feet and then every 1 foot for another 3 feet above and below Eocene-Oligocene boundary picks. The samples were then made into thin sections, stained with Alizarin Red S, examined using a petrographic microscope, described by using both Folk's (1959) and Dunham's (1962) carbonate classification schemes, and fossils were identified where possible. From this information, interpretations of the depositional environment were made.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The Ocala Limestone variably consists of biomicritic and pelbiomicritic mudstones, biomicritic packstones, biosparitic grainstones, and dolostones. It consists primarily of white to cream to dark grey and variably fossiliferous limestone. Dolostones are grey to brown and chert is sparse. Fossil assemblages include echinoids, the foraminifera Lepidocyclina sp., Lepidocyclina ocalana, Nummulities sp., and rhodoliths. The Suwannee Limestone wells variably consist of pelmicritic and pelbiomicritic mudstones, pelbiomicritic wackestones, biomicritic packstones, pelbiosparritic grainstones, and dolostones. Dolomite is often grey to brown and chert is common. Fossil assemblages contained in the core from these wells include echinoid fragments and benthic foraminifera such as Lepidocyclina sp. and Nummulities sp. as well as rhodoliths.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	These findings show that there is minimal variation between the Ocala and Suwannee Limestone aside from the disappearance of the benthic foraminifera Lepidocyclina ocalana, suggesting that a change in environmental conditions was not significant at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary. Based on the lithological descriptions and contained fossil assemblages the Ocala and Suwannee Limestones were deposited in shallow marine environments within the photic zone of the middle marine shelf, such as a Wilson Zone 7 (Wilson, 1975).</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Poly-ϵ-caprolactone (PCL) based copolymers have received much attention as drug or growth factor delivery carriers and tissue engineering scaffolds due to their biocompatibility, biodegradability, and tunable biophysical properties.  Copolymers of PCL and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) also have shape memory behaviors and can be made into thermoresponsive shape memory polymers for various biomedical applications such as smart sutures and vascular stents.  However, the influence of biophysical properties of PCL-PDMS-PCL copolymers on stem cell lineage commitment is not well understood.  In this study, PDMS was used as soft segments of varying length to tailor the biophysical properties of PCL-based co-polymers.  While low elastic modulus (&lt;10 kPa) of the tri-block copolymer PCL-PDMS-PCL affected cardiovascular differentiation of embryonic stem cells, the range of 60-100 MPa PCL-PDMS-PCL showed little influence on the differentiation.  Then different size (30-140 μm) of microspheres were fabricated from PCL-PDMS-PCL copolymers and incorporated within embryoid bodies (EBs).  Mesoderm differentiation was induced using bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-4 for cardiovascular differentiation.  Differential expressions of mesoderm progenitor marker KDR and vascular markers CD31 and VE-cadherin were observed for the cells differentiated from EBs incorporated with microspheres of different size, while little difference was observed for cardiac marker α-actinin expression.  Small size of microspheres (30 μm) resulted in higher expression of KDR while medium size of microspheres (94 μm) resulted in higher CD31 and VE-cadherin expression.  This study indicated that the biophysical properties of PCL-based copolymers impacted stem cell lineage commitment, which should be considered for drug delivery and tissue engineering applications.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Prolactin is a fertility hormone produced and released by the anterior pituitary gland. Normal changes in prolactin levels influence fertility and these changes are carefully regulated by neuroendocrine cells in the hypothalamus. Specifically, prolactin surges along with luteinizing hormone to stimulate ovulation and mating behaviors in rodents. Prolactin also follows a twice-daily surge pattern during rodent pregnancy, helping to maintain the pregnancy and prepare the maternal brain for offspring care. Dopamine is the primary regulatory of prolactin and acts through tonic inhibition during non-surge times. High levels of prolactin feedback to stimulate dopamine and thereby reduce prolactin back down to normal, low levels. However, dopamine is not alone in regulating prolactin release.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Early mathematical models from the lab helped to identify some shortcomings in the understanding of prolactin regulation. Based on the existing literature, a model was designed to replicate experimental results. When I came to lab and began reviewing this literature and the model’s assumptions, I began to ask some important questions: Do dopamine levels change dramatically with the prolactin surges? Does the timing signal in the model really act as an inhibitory signal? Does the stimulatory signal act alone to drive surges of prolactin release? What else is out that that feeds into this circuit?</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>These perfectly timed surges of prolactin must somehow be controlled by the brain’s central clock. One clock signal, VIP, has been implicated in indirect prolactin regulation. This neurotransmitter could stimulate prolactin either by inhibiting dopamine or by activating a prolactin simulator. In this dissertation, I show that it may in fact be doing both.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Oxytocin is one potential, and particularly potent, prolactin stimulator that is itself implicated in reproduction and the associated social behaviors.  Released at the posterior pituitary, I hypothesized that plasma oxytocin levels might be predictive of the large prolactin surges observed during times of fertility and pregnancy. However, the data fail to support such a clear direct correlation. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Other hypothalamic factors that have also been proposed to be involved in prolactin regulation include the endogenous opioid dynorphin. One major hypothalamic source of dynorphin are the KNDy neurons that co-secrete kisspeptin, neurokinin B, and dynorphin. All these neurotransmitters have been studied for their roles in luteinizing hormone regulation. Research presented here shows that the KNDy neuron dynorphin, while directly involved in luteinizing hormone surge release,   is not involved in prolactin surge release. In fact, another KNDy product is likely involved in the single, estrogen-induced fertility surge, while another, still unknown, source of dynorphin is involved during the twice-daily prolactin surge pattern.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Overall, this dissertation explores many aspects beyond just dopamine as possible regulatory inputs to the prolactin control circuit.  Our simplified rodent models and the mathematical modeling help to show us the limits of our understanding so we can ask the right questions for the next experiments. This multi-angled approach, employing different physiological states in the animals and discussing possible network scenarios with modelers, gives depth to the research program described in this dissertation. Further work will better elucidate important aspects of fertility regulation that have undoubted implications for human and animal health.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Over 600,000 individuals were released from prison in the U.S. in 2013 (Carson, 2014), and, if recent trends continue, two-thirds of them will be arrested within 3 years (Durose, Cooper, and Snyder, 2014).  Over the last two decades, policy makers at the federal, state, and local levels have been looking for ways to reduce recidivism rates among released prisoners and often emphasize post-release employment as a critical factor for successful reentry.  However, research to date on the relationship between employment and recidivism is surprisingly limited, and findings are mixed.  In addition, most of the research on the employment-recidivism relationship has failed to control for an individual’s propensity to obtain employment.  In other words, when studies have found a negative relationship between employment and recidivism, it is unclear whether differences in recidivism are due to the job itself or to other confounders that make some individuals more likely to be employed.  This study uses data collected for the evaluation of the Serious and Violent Offender Reentry Initiative to examine whether post-release employment decreases the likelihood of recidivism among adult men with extensive criminal histories. Propensity scores are used to control for a variety of possible confounders related to the individuals’ likelihood of obtaining employment.  Post-release employment has a modest negative effect on property crime and a positive effect on public order crime.  Methodological considerations for studying employment among offender populations are also discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Florida’s Department of Corrections (DOC) currently operates the largest state-run faith-based correctional facilities program in the United States. In these facilities, the state sequesters inmates from the larger inmate population and both subsidizes and encourages inmate religiosity as part of its larger efforts to prevent future criminal behavior and to reduce the likelihood of prison recidivism. While almost half of the correctional departments in the United States offer similar faith-based correctional facilities, Florida’s are notable for several reasons. First, Florida’s DOC led the vanguard in the larger movement to create faith-based correctional facilities, as in 1999 it became the second correctional department (after Texas) to create an in-prison faith-based dormitory. The DOC quickly expanded this program to create a total of sixteen faith-based correctional facilities, where it houses roughly five percent of its inmate population. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Florida’s faith-based correctional facilities are also notable because DOC administrators repeatedly modified the program to adhere to the constitutional guidelines that regulate partnerships between religion and government. Contrary to popular discourse regarding the relationship between religion and state, the United States Supreme Court has ruled that America does not have a complete separation of church and state. Instead, over the past seventy years, the Supreme Court repeatedly concluded that the government can fund religion under certain circumstances and conditions. The courts often modified and clarified previous rulings, but the central premise has not changed—government can partner with religion. To adhere to these rulings, Florida’s DOC repeatedly altered its faith-based correctional facilities. What began as an explicitly Protestant in-prison faith-based dormitory evolved into religiously pluralistic correctional facilities open to members of all religions and to inmates with no religious commitments whatsoever. Roughly sixteen years after the DOC created its first faith-based correctional facility, no one has challenged their constitutionality. Even the facilities’ critics tacitly admit that they that appear to adhere to constitutional law. As a result of their due diligence, the administrators of Florida’s DOC provided a model for other correctional departments who want to create similar programs. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Florida’s faith-based correctional facilities are the subject of this dissertation. More specifically, this dissertation explores the various historical factors that convinced the administrators of Florida’s DOC that they should create faith-based correctional facilities. To this end, it situates Florida’s faith-based correctional facilities within the larger contexts of mass incarceration, the impulse to foster religious pluralism, the trend to empower religious social service providers, and neoliberal economics. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This story begins in the wake of the Civil War, when the State of Florida created its first state prison. This prison is important because it solidified government-funded religion as the default form of inmate rehabilitation in Florida’s prisons. Almost 150 years later, that has not changed. Quite the contrary, Protestant religiosity permeates Florida’s DOC, which is arguably the last branch of government to disestablish itself from religion. The dissertation then identifies relevant developments in the twentieth century that combined to create the problem of mass incarceration, which the proponents of faith-based correctional facilities believe only they can solve. In contrast, this dissertation suggests that a common theology underlies both mass incarceration and faith-based correctional facilities.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>ABSTRACT</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of musically adapted social stories in family- and individual-based interventions on decreasing the problematic behaviors of children and adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Participants had a primary diagnosis of ASD. The researcher created an individualized Social Story™ for each participant using the guidelines set forth by Carol Gray in her 10th edition of the New Social Stories Book. Using a technique termed ‘piggybacking,’ social story lyrics were set to the melody of participants’ favorite songs. The 15-minute presentations of the musically adapted social story included listening, instrument play, and iPad sing-along. The song presentation was implemented during the family and individual treatment phases of the study. Families were randomly assigned to one of two alternating treatment designs ABACA or ACABA: (A) baseline, (B) individual-based sessions, and (C) family-based sessions.  The dependent variable for the study was the frequency of the child’s target behavior during each condition of the study.  Results from the 10 participants indicated that musically adapted social stories were effective in reducing the targeted behavior in 9 of the 10 participants. The researcher found that participants varied in their benefit from the individual- verses family-based sessions. Overall results from the study indicated that individual-based sessions proved to be slightly more effective in decreasing targeted behaviors when compared to family-based sessions. Baseline data indicated the order of treatment sessions did not have an effect on the targeted behaviors. Participants were able to generalize appropriate behaviors during the baseline periods that followed both the family- and individual-based treatment conditions, and generalized appropriate behaviors increased during each consecutive baseline period. Survey data revealed family-based sessions were beneficial in helping parents understand how to implement musically adapted social story interventions with their children. These results suggest the use of musically adapted social stories in family- or individual-based treatment sessions are effective interventions for decreasing the problem behaviors of children with ASD, as well as strengthening parents’ understanding of how to use social stories with their children.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The dissertation includes two parts. The first part consists of designing and analyzing high order long-time accurate numerical methods for Stokes-Darcy system. We propose second and third-order efficient and long-time accurate numerical methods, called IMplicit-EXplicit methods (IMEX) for the coupled Stokes-Darcy system. Although the original continuum Stokes-Darcy PDE system is fully coupled, our algorithm is capable of decoupling the system into two sub-systems so that a single Stokes and a single Darcy system can be computed in a parallel fashion without iteration. All the schemes we proposed are proven to be unconditionally stable and long-time stable. The bound on the error is uniform-in-time, which is among the first of this kind for second and third-order methods of Stokes-Darcy system. Error estimates for the second order Backward-Differentiation scheme are proved. The second part concerns the Uncertainty of Quantification (UQ) of the contaminant transport. We compute the convection-diffusion equation with Streamline Upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) method. The quantity of interest is acquired using Monte Carlo and Sparse Grid methods in order to study the sensitivity with respect to the random parameters.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Computational material simulation is becoming more and more important as a branch of material science. Depending on the scale of the systems, there are many simulation methods, i.e. first-principles calculation (or ab-initio), molecular dynamics, mesoscale methods and continuum methods. Among them, first-principles calculation, which involves density functional theory (DFT) and based on quantum mechanics, has become to be a reliable tool in</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>condensed matter physics.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>DFT is a single-electron approximation in solving the many-body problems.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Intrinsically speaking, both DFT and ab-initio belong to the first-principles calculation since the theoretical background of ab-initio is Hartree-Fock (HF) approximation and both are aimed at solving the Schrdinger equation of the many-body system using the self-consistent field (SCF) method and calculating the ground state properties. The difference is that DFT introduces parameters either from experiments or from other molecular dynamic (MD) calculations to approximate the expressions of the exchange-correlation terms. The exchange term is accurately calculated but the correlation term is neglected in HF.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this dissertation, DFT based first-principles calculations were performed for all the novel materials and interesting materials introduced. Specifically, the DFT theory together with the rationale behind related properties (e.g. electronic, optical, defect, thermoelectric, magnetic) are introduced in Chapter 2.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Starting from Chapter 3 to Chapter 5, several representative materials were studied. In particular, a new semiconducting oxytelluride, Ba 2 TeO is studied in Chapter 3. Our calculations indicate a direct semiconducting character with a band gap value of 2.43 eV, which agrees well with the optical experiment (&amp;#8764; 2.93 eV). Moreover, the optical and defects properties of Ba2TeO are also systematically investigated with a view to understanding its potential as an optoelectronic or transparent conducting material. We find relatively modest band masses for both electrons and holes suggesting applications. Optical properties show a infrared-red absorption when doped. This could potentially be useful for combining wavelength filtering and transparent conducting functions. Furthermore, our defect calculations show that Ba 2 TeO is intrinsically p-type conducting</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>under Ba-poor condition. However, the spontaneous formation of the donor defects may constrain the p-type transport properties and would need to be addressed to enable applications.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter 4 mainly devotes to the thermoelectric properties of the famous phase change material, Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 (GST). GST has been used in data storage for more than a decade because of their fast phase switching between metastable crystalline (cubic) and amorphous phases. It also exhibits interesting thermoelectric properties, and we did a systematic study on the two crystalline phases (hexagonal and cubic) and the amorphous phase. We found a high Seebeck coefficient with a broad</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>doping concentrations for both n-type and p-type, at and below room temperatures (300 K) for both the cubic and amorphous phases. This finding will be of crucial interests in further understand the thermoelectric properties experimentally and find device applications in the ultimate goal.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Several magnetic materials that involve lanthanide elements are reported in Chapter 5. First of all, the electronic and magnetic properties of the BaLn 2 O 4 (Ln = La-Lu, Y) family compound are studied. The series has been synthesized for the first time in single crystalline form, using a molten metal flux. They crystallize in the CaV 2 O 4 structure type with primitive orthorhombic symmetry (space group P nma, #62). Our calculations show an insulating character with band gaps ranging from 3 eV to 4.5 eV for the three representative compounds, BaLa 2 O 4 , BaGd 2 O 4 and BaLu 2 O 4 . Moreover, the superexchange magnetism is also studied. Secondly, a strong correlated system with cerium is investigated. As expected, we find a value of 15 states eV &amp;#8722;1 that stems from the Ce 4f orbitals at the Fermi energy which indicates intermetallic heavy fermion behavior. The Fermi surface calculation shows nesting feature which might be useful to further understand the antiferromagnetic magnetism. Thirdly, the DFT calculations of another lanthanide oxide involving transition element, LaMo 16 O 44 , are also presented. This material crystallizes with a complicated crystal structure consists of MoO 6 magnetic clusters. The band structure calculations indicate a spin-polarized half metal feature that comes from different crystallographic sites of Mo since La occurs as trivalent with empty f shell thus no contribution to the magnetic moment. Last but not least, we studied the electronic properties of another newly found oxytellride that having lanthanide, Ba 3 Yb 2 O 5 Te. We find a insulating behavior with a direct band-gap value of 1.9 eV using the DFT+U methodology.</DISS_para>
