            <DISS_para>The application of noise reduction or perfoming denoising on an image is a very important </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>topic in the field of computer vision and computational photography. Many popular state of the art </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>denoising algorithms are trained and evaluated using images with artificial noise. These trained </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>algorithms and their evaluations on  synthetic data may lead to incorrect conclusions about their performances.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this paper we will first introduce a benchmark dataset of uncompressed color images corrupted by natural noise due to</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>low-light conditions, together with spatially and intensity-aligned low noise images of the same scenes. The dataset contains </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>over 100 scenes and more than 500 images,  including both RAW formatted images and 8 bit BMP pixel and intensity aligned images.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para> We will also introduce a method for  estimating the true noise level in each of our images, since even the low noise images contain a small amount of noise. Through this noise estimation method we will construct a convolutional neural network model for automatic noise estimation in single noisy images. Finally, we improve upon a state-of-the-art denoising algorithm Block Matching through 3D filtering (BM3D) by learning a specialized denoising parameter using another developed convolutional neural network.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>There is a vast, and expanding, literature concerning public services contracting. This growing body of scholarship often examines governments’ decisions to outsource service production, as well as the resulting relationships and service outcomes. In the context of local government outsourcing contract management is becoming increasingly important. Holding vendors accountable for service delivery and outcomes is essential in an era of third-party governance. Contract oversight, and monitoring, in particular is highlighted as an essential mechanism. Yet, it is often unclear what monitoring tasks are performed, and who in the contractual relationship is responsible for these tasks. I theorize that, outsourcing high transaction costs services is associated with greater reliance on proxy monitoring when compared to direct government oversight. The characteristics of the outsourced service can create a range of government-vendor relationships, and this is true for monitoring tasks as well. Using data from Florida municipalities I examine the impact of services’ transaction costs on the likelihood public managers rely on proxy monitoring rather than direct government oversight for nine monitoring tasks. I use two-stage Heckman selection estimation to analyze an original dataset of municipal services. The results suggest that, when local governments outsource services that are both asset specific and difficult to measure the reliance on proxy monitoring for some oversight tasks is greater when compared to direct government monitoring.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Ocean turbulence is responsible for stirring and spreading ocean tracers, and contributes to the mean circulation as eddy bolus fluxes. The influence of the eddies on the mean circulation becomes particularly important in regions where mean geostrophic flows are weak, such as the meridional flow across the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. However, high resolution observations of eddies and their influence on the circulation are generally lacking, particularly in the deep ocean that cannot be observed via satellites. The Diapycnal and Isopycnal Mixing Experiment in the Southern Ocean (DIMES) was designed to observe the transport and stirring associated with the eddies in the Southern Ocean, using RAFOS floats and a passive tracer. In the first half of the thesis, the imprint of the eddies on the large scale circulation ($&gt; 100$ km) is assumed to be diffusive, and the corresponding eddy diffusivities are quantified using the long term behavior of the RAFOS floats. The eddy diffusivities are found to be suppressed in the presence of mean flows. These eddy diffusivity estimates from DIMES, along with estimates from a couple of other diffusivity studies, are then used to quantify the eddy bolus fluxes in the Southern Ocean, which were found to vary in response to the bottom bathymetry.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The second part of this work, addresses the flow at the length scales of the submesoscale and mesoscale ($&lt; 100$ km). Here, in addition to the DIMES RAFOS floats, we also used surface drifter observations from an experiment, Grand Lagrangian Deployment (GLAD), conducted in the Gulf of Mexico. The goal was to observe the kinematic stirring properties at these smaller scales, and also to characterize the dynamics of the turbulence that is active by investigating the energy spectrum. At the surface ocean in the Gulf of Mexico, we characterized the scale dependent energy distribution over 5 orders of length scales (10 m - 1000 km) using second order velocity structure functions. Divergent motions were found to be dominant, over non-divergent motions, at length scales smaller than 5km, where the Rossby number was greater than one and the third order velocity structure functions indicated the presence of a forward energy cascade. These methods were also used to explain subsurface turbulence in the Southern Ocean with DIMES RAFOS floats. The RAFOS floats showed that divergent flows are also present in the deep ocean at length scales smaller than 30 km, and become comparable in magnitude to the non-divergent flows near 5 km. The observed dispersion of the floats was used to address the question - is the mixing at small scales due mainly to large scale shear (non-local) or small scale eddies (local)? The associated stirring was found to be local at depth.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study examines the apparent impact of 9/11 on the desirability of Arab and Muslim noncitizens seeking entry into the U.S. Following the September 11th attacks, immigration legislation expanded the definition of terrorism and restricted entry for nonimmigrants from State Sponsors of Terrorism. Though these two pieces of legislation modified the way in which potential terrorists are assessed, the effect of such legislation on noncitizen flows and its influence on countries that resemble the race/ethnic and religious composition of the State Sponsors of Terrorism and the 9/11 hijackers has not been examined. This dissertation examines whether a profound event such as September 11th had definitive consequences on the flow of noncitizens entering the U.S. from other predominantly Arab and/or Muslim countries. Using data from the 1998-2005 Yearbooks of Immigration Statistics, the UN Population Division’s Demographic Yearbooks, the World Development Indicators, and the CIA Factbook, I compare noncitizen flows pre- and post-9/11 (1998-2005) to identify any changes by country-of-origin and analyze whether changes might be correlated with a country’s predominant racial/ethnic and religious composition.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation has five main findings. First, all noncitizen flows experienced a decline in flows after 9/11. Particularly, students and work-based nonimmigrants from State Sponsors of Terrorism and other predominantly Arab/Muslim countries encountered the greatest declines. Second, young, nonimmigrants aged 25-44 from State Sponsors of Terrorism and other predominantly Arab and/or Muslim countries encountered steeper declines after 9/11 than did nonimmigrants of the same age from counties with established ties to the U.S. Third, immigrant flows for most countries rebounded during 2004-2005. Moreover, predominantly non-Arab/Muslim countries encountered significant increases in flows compared to countries with established ties to the U.S., State Sponsors of Terrorism and other predominantly Arab/Muslim countries. Fourth, refugee applications declined considerably after 9/11 for most countries. However, the desire to enter the U.S. has increased slightly but not for all countries. Fifth, given the decreases in student and work-based nonimmigrant flows after 9/11, the results of this dissertation suggest that official immigration legislation is not necessarily needed to influence noncitizen flows from countries viewed as undesirable by governmental institutions and the public. This implies two things. First, legislation restricting nonimmigrants from State Sponsors of Terrorism has spilled over onto countries of similar race/ethnic and religious composition. Second, it would appear the currently applied definition of desirability has more to do with the racial, rather than religious, composition of noncitizens entering the country.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Despite evidence of smaller gaps in recent years, there is still major concern of high student attrition rates in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, particularly in engineering and computer science (Chen, 2013, 2015; NSF, 2013).  The literature has shown that academic achievement is an important predictor for STEM major retention (Whalen &amp; Shelley II, 2010; Geisinger &amp; Raman, 2013).  Furthermore, motivational variables such as students’ intelligence mindset (i.e., basic beliefs of intelligence) and academic goal orientations (i.e., goals students focus on to reach certain achievement outcomes) have been shown to relate to and be predictive of students’ academic achievement (Dweck &amp; Leggett, 1988; Farrington et al., 2012).  Using Dweck’s socio-cognitive approach to motivation, the current study extends the work of growth- and fixed-intelligence mindsets to college engineering students.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Using data from 245 unique student participants from four junior- and senior-level electrical engineering courses, I investigated three issues.  First, I examined and compared the relationships among student engineering majors’ math and science intelligence mindsets and academic goal orientations during the beginning and end of the semester.  I found that there were consistent and significant relationships during both time points among students’ science- and math-growth intelligence mindsets and mastery-approach goals, students’ science- and math-fixed intelligence mindsets and performance-avoidance goals, and students’ science- and math-fixed intelligence mindsets and performance-approach goals. There were also some significant relationships among students’ science- and math-fixed intelligence mindsets and mastery-approach goals at the end of the semester.  There were, however, no significant differences between any of the correlations between students’ intelligence mindsets and goal orientations at the beginning and end of the semester.  Second, I investigated students’ math and science intelligence mindsets across four time points throughout a semester to see if there were any significant differences across time and across the four courses.  I found a significant difference across time for students’ science-growth and math-growth intelligence mindsets, specifically a decrease in scores between time point 2 and time point 4.  Third, I examined the potential predictive relationship of students’ course exam grades on their end-of-semester science- and math-intelligence mindset.  Exam 1 grades significantly predicted students’ end-of-semester math-growth intelligence mindsets.  Results and future research are discussed, as well as implications from these findings.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation is divided into two parts, both of which describe the synthesis of various organic molecules. Much of the work is already published, as noted where appropriate in the chapter headings. The first part of this work covers fragmentation reactions and methodology to generate acyclic and cyclic alkynes. In the first chapter, vinylogous acyl nonaflates are studied with various nucleophiles to trigger fragmentation in order to compare the advantages over vinylogous acyl triflates, as well as preliminary computational analysis of fragmentation mechanism. The second chapter describes the ring-expanding fragmentation that give strained cycloalkynes, which are further studied in strain–promoted azide–alkyne cycloadditions (SPAAC). In chapter three, syntheses of some strained cycloalkynes were investigated with the goal of improving SPAAC reactivity. The second part of this work is a second-generation formal synthesis of palmerolide A. Chapter four covers studies of enantioselective reduction at C7 of C1-C15 fragment of palmerolide A, as well as a revised protecting group strategy. The last chapter provides new synthetic pathways towards an efficient and scalable synthesis of palmerolide A, and the challenges in key step of ring closing metathesis.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>High alkali cements are not used in the state of Florida because of its supposed deleterious effects to concrete. The alkali-silica reaction forms a gel in the voids of the concrete and the increase in internal pressure created by the gel causes the concrete to crack. Other states across the United States have implemented the use of high alkali cements. The purpose of this research was to supply the Florida Department of Transportation an initial investigation of the effects high alkali cement in Class IV concrete. A total of twelve mixes, four control mixes and eight test mixes, were prepared and tested to compare the fresh and hardened properties. Class IV concrete has requirements that it must be met in order to be used in Florida and the goal of this research was to determine if the test mixes met these requirements. As it stands, the high alkali cement did appear to have an effect on the fresh and hardened properties of the concrete. A final conclusion was made that high alkalinity cements could be use but only with supplementary cementitous materials such as fly ash and slag.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Co4Nb2O9 is a quasi two dimensional material that has been known to exhibit magnetoelectric behavior with an antiferromagnetic transition (TN ) at ∼ 27 K. Our findings reveal strong evidence of magnon heat transport below TN through magnetothermal conductivity measurements. Magnetothermal coupling is strongest below 2 K around 0.2 T suggesting presence of the thermal heat-valve effect causing an increase in its thermal conductivity by nearly 4-fold. Independent of field, we not only see the presence of phonon-magnon resonant scattering but also strong phonon- spin coupling; giving rise to an anisotropic thermal conductivity where within the plane of spins conductivity is greater than inter-plane. Thermal measurements were also carried out on Ba3Cr2O8 which has been shown to undergo Bose-Einstein condensation of magnetic excitations.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Through intercalation with copper and palladium atoms between the layers of the transition metal dichalcogenides titanium diselenide (TiSe2), it has previously been shown that where the intrinsic charge density wave’s (CDW) temperature dependent resistivity peak anomaly occurs (Tcdw ∼165 K ) decreases with increased intercalation and/or hydrostatic pressure. To mimic the chemical pressure caused by intercalation, uniaxial physical pressure (both compression and expansion) is used along with the Poisson effect. In the experiment with compressive pressure perpendicular to the layers (c-axis), resistivity data shows a shift in the peak (Tcdw) towards lower temperatures; expected for increasing dimensionality. For uniaxial pressure parallel to the layers, the Poisson effect should separate the layers, providing a separation of the layers similar to that of intercalation. Preliminary results show Tcdw increases initially, and then decreases. A prototype to induce uniaxial tension perpendicular to the layers has recently been developed and preliminary results will be reported.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Electrical transport measurements were also executed for the first time on the first FE(II)- TCNQ spin cross-over (SCO) system ever synthesized. In fact, our material is the first structurally defined magnetically bistable semiconductor to be constructed from TCNQ radical ions. With the aid of spider silk fibers (detailed in further sections), our findings show it is a narrow band-gap semiconductor where its activation energy changes from 110 meV to 10 meV as it crosses the SCO transition temperature to lower temperature.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation explores pseudo-Anosov elements of the mapping class group of an oriented surface from the point of view of fibered face theory. This theory runs dual to the classical way of thought where, rather than fixing a surface $S$ and studying $\text{Mod}(S)$, we study the set of all pseudo-Anosov mapping classes over all oriented surfaces. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Let $S$ be a connected, compact, oriented surface. The mapping class group of $S$, denoted $\text{Mod}(S)$, is the group of orientation preserving homeomorphisms of $S$ which act by the identity on $\partial S$ considered up to isotopy. If no power of a mapping class leaves an essential curve invariant, the mapping class is pseudo-Anosov. In this case, the mapping class preserves an expanding and contracting foliation with expansion factor $\lambda$. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The set of all pseudo-Anosov mapping classes admits a natural partition into flow equivalence classes. Such a class can be described as the surface cross sections transverse to a pseudo-Anosov flow in a hyperbolic fibered three manifold. Using the operation of Murasugi sum, we systematically study the flow equivalence classes that can be expressed as iterated Hopf plumbings on a disk in the $3$-sphere. Such a surface is always a fiber surface for its boundary link. The data on how to attach the Hopf bands is conveniently packaged in a graph and, since the Coxeter element of this graph is, up to sign, the monodromy of the fiber surface, such links are called Coxeter links.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The investigation splits into three main developments. The first result deals with the overall structure of the flow equivalence  classes corresponding to Coxeter links as subspaces of the real vector space $H^1(M;\mathbb{R})$, where $M$ is the link exterior in the $3$-sphere. The second result sheds light on a natural dynamically minimal representative in each class. We then give an algorithm that takes a class as input and outputs a multivariable polynomial which can be used to compute the expansion factor of any element contained in the class.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>By interpreting the mapping tori of the pseudo-Anosov mapping classes as link exteriors in the $3$-sphere, we are able to identify the meridians of the link components with a basis for $H^1(M;\mathbb{Z})$. With a few careful knot theoretic observations, we show that any surface with positive linking number to the original link is a fiber surface. With slightly stronger assumptions on the link, we show that the entire Thurston norm is determined by the norms of spanning surfaces for the individual components.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>It is easy to construct pseudo-Anosov mapping classes with small expansion factor on surfaces with high Euler characteristic. One way this can be achieved is by composing a periodic mapping class with a pseudo-Anosov map that is supported on a small subsurface. Since the flow equivalence class of a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism contains maps supported on surfaces of arbitrarily high Euler characteristic, we consider the function $\lambda^{|\chi(S)|}$. Using properties of this function and the above results, we find a natural minimizing element with respect to this function.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The third result amounts to computing the Teichm\"uller polynomial for the fibered face in question. This can be a difficult process in general. Perhaps the most notable issues are explicitly computing the fixed cohomology and a train-track for a surface automorphism. After finding ways around these problems and others, we give the full algorithm to compute the Teichm\"uller polynomial.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>ABSTRACT </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	This document will compare four American flute methods: Ernest Wagner’s Foundation to Flute Playing, William Kincaid with Claire Polin’s The Art and Practice of Modern Flute Technique volumes 1 through 3, Robert Dick’s The Other Flute 2nd edition, and Patricia George with Phyllis Avidan Louke’s Flute 101: Mastering the Basics, Flute 102: Mastering the Basics, and Flute 103: Mastering the Basics. There are brief biographies of each author, an overview of the structure of each method, and a comparison of the approach to teaching the following topics: posture, breathing, embouchure, tone, technique, and musicality.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>     The purpose of this study is to provide flutists with a clearer perspective of the evolution of American flute pedagogy by comparing selected method books that were all inspired by the teaching of William Kincaid.  This document has comparison tables, which allow students and teachers the ability to quickly review what is available in each method.  The biographical information also provides insight into the personalities and teaching philosophies of each author.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Under what conditions do economic grievances – stemming from broader deprivation of basic necessities – effect the likelihood of urban social unrest? And additionally, under what conditions will a state experience violent escalation leading to civil conflict? This dissertation seeks to bridge the gap in existing literature and provide a fluid theoretical argument explaining the causal story from economic grievances stemming from broader basic necessities deprivation to violent civil conflict. I argue that economic grievances stemming from broader deprivation of basic necessities increases the likelihood of urban social unrest, and this effect is conditioned by the political opportunity structures of a given regime. Secondly, I argue that in regimes that experience mass mobilization of dissent, the likelihood of an escalation to violent civil conflict is contingent on coercive government response. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This scholarly work adds to the existing literature in several ways. First, this dissertation broadens the conceptualization of basic necessities deprivation to include access to potable water, housing security, food prices and food security, and access to affordable fuel. Building on the work of Levitsky and Way (2010) and Varieties in Democracy database project (2016), I forward a more appropriate conceptualization and operalization of regime type – political opportunity structures. Lastly, whereas previous scholarly work has studied nonviolent dissent or violent civil conflict in isolation, this work attempts to analyze these two forms of contentious politics together – as part of a strategic process.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>I utilize a nested research analysis or mixed-methods strategy – the use of both small–N, case study analysis and large–N, cross-sectional statistical analysis – in order to examine the theoretical arguments and expectations. The results from the cross-sectional, large-N empirical analysis suggests that indeed basic needs deprivation – measured as global food prices – increases the likelihood that a given state will experience urban social unrest, and that the effect is dampened in states in which the political opportunity structure is less open. Secondly, the results support my theoretical argument that urban social unrest will escalate to violent civil conflict in regimes that choose to mobilize the security apparatus against dissidents. Moreover, this dissertation adds to previous empirical research by utilizing two differing methodological approaches when examining the two outcome variables in question – urban social unrest and violent civil conflict. In examining urban social unrest, I argue that a moderating model is more appropriate, while when examining the escalation to violent civil conflict a mediating model is better able to examine the causal mechanism at play. To my knowledge, this scholarly work is the first to examine this strategic process utilizing both mediation and moderation.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of live versus recorded music on the nutritional intake of older adults during mealtimes in an assisted living facility. Nutritional health is an important component of maintaining quality-of-life.  Poor nutrition in older adults is due to health conditions, life changes, and other symptoms of aging.   Attention to proper nutrition is too often neglected or absent in the lives of many older adults, especially those in long-term care. Interventions exist to combat malnutrition and its consequences, including sensory stimulation interventions involving recorded music; however, no research has been done examining the impact of live music therapy, which is extensively regarded as more effective than recorded music in other contexts. Participants in this study were residents at two assisted living facilities. The design of the study was ABAC or ACAB, where A was the no-music control, B was recorded music, and C was live music therapy. Food intake was measured using a plate-waste survey. Results indicated that food intake increased with both recorded music and live music; however, a significant increase in food intake was found between the no music and live music conditions. The increase in food intake between the no music and recorded music conditions was not significant. These results have implications for the role of music therapy in improving the food intake of older adults, and thus, their nutritional health as well.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This dissertation seeks to understand the role gender plays or not in the ministry of African American pastors. This project takes a wider approach, asking given the growing numbers of black female preachers in the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church, if, and if so, how the pulpit has welcomed African American, gendered bodies, and more importantly, if, and if so, how pastors have considered or been influenced by their own gendered bodies in this role. To take up this question, this project explores the intentions and behaviors of pastors—both men and women—in the AME Church, in terms of their goals as rhetoricians. Using two lenses, “rhetoric as word,” accounting for the ways in which pastors use words to strategically build community, and “rhetoric as body,” accounting for the ways in which pastors use their bodies to occupy and perform in the pulpit space, this study examines the techniques and methods used in preparing and delivering a sermon, and investigates the role gender may play in these sermonic tasks.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This dissertation contributes to the fields of medical sociology, environmental health, and public health by examining the effects of social stratification on environmental exposures and physical morbidity. Although previous conceptual models suggest that the unequal distribution of environmental exposures may help to explain race/ethnic and socioeconomic differences in physical health, there is little to no empirical evidence to support these processes. Building on previous research, I use data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (2007-2008) to formally assess the following questions: 1) Does exposure to environmental toxins vary according to race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status? 2) Do race/ethnic and socioeconomic differences in environmental exposures help to explain race/ethnic and socioeconomic differences in physical health? The results of this research extend the literature by revealing empirically the unequal exposures to environmental toxins by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status. Specifically, race/ethnic minorities (Blacks and Hispanics) and individuals with lower levels of socioeconomic status are disproportionately exposed to environmental toxins. Although overall toxin exposure and lead were unrelated to self-rated health, cadmium was found to partially mediate race/ethnic and socioeconomic differences in self-rated health.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>It is well known that exposure to severe stress increases the risk for developing mood disorders. Currently, the neurobiological and genetic mechanisms underlying the functional effects of psychological stress are poorly understood. Presenting a major obstacle to the study of psychological stress is the inability of current animal models of stress to distinguish between physical and psychological stressors. A novel paradigm recently developed by Warren et al., is able to tease apart the effects of physical and psychological stress in adult mice by allowing these mice to “witness,” the social defeat of another mouse thus removing confounding variables associated with physical stressors. Using this ‘witness’ model of stress and RNA-Seq technology, the current study aims to study the genetic effects of psychological stress. After, witnessing the social defeat of another mouse, VTA tissue was extracted, sequenced, and analyzed for differential expression. Since genes often work together in complex networks, a pathway and gene ontology (GO) analysis was performed using data from the differential expression analysis. The pathway and GO analyzes revealed a perturbation of the glutamatergic synapse pathway and an enrichment of positive excitatory post-synaptic potential regulation. This is consistent with the excitatory synapse theory of depression. Together these findings demonstrate a dysregulation of the mesolimbic reward pathway at the gene level as a result of psychological stress potentially contributing to depressive like behaviors.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The computer architecture community relies on standard benchmark suites like MiBench, NAS,PARSEC, SPEC CPU2006 (SPEC) R, and SPLASH to study different hardware designs, but such suites are insufficient for evaluating mobile platforms like Android. Even suites that were developed for embedded systems cannot be used to gain an understanding of Android device/system interaction because they do not exercise key components of the software stack.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Although based on a conventional Linux kernel, Android includes native libraries, a virtual machine runtime, and an application framework with multiple components for managing resources.All these interact in complex ways to support Android applications. C programs running on Linux have a relatively simple virtual memory organization, and most memory references come from the application code. In contrast, Android has a much more complex virtual memory organization (due to its multiple APIs and numerous shared libraries), and most memory references come from the Android software stack. The complexity of Android's execution environment provides opportunities for computer architects to better support the execution characteristics, structures, and resource requirements of the Android software stack and opportunities for software developers to optimize their applications for this rich environment. To help the community to exploit these opportunities,we introduce Agave, an open-source benchmark suite designed to expose the complex interactions between components of the Android software stack.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study examines the evolutionary history of the cosmopolitan beaksedge tribe Rhynchosporeae (ca. 386 spp.; Cyperaceae) using phylogenetics. Taxon sampling covers 25 of the 28 taxonomic sections proposed for the tribe. I compare a history inferred for Rhynchosporeae using a single plastid gene (Chapter 2) with one inferred using hundreds of loci (Chapter 4). The latter involves a sequencing methodology I develop with collaborators that can be applied across angiosperms (Chapter 3).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter 2 recognizes that Rhynchosporeae has high levels of endemicity (≥ 44%) in tropical and subtropical American savannas and can provide insights into the diversification of their biotas. Wind pollination, occupation of a savanna habitat, and a C3 photosynthetic pathway are common in the tribe, but showy (presumably insect-pollinated) inflorescences, occupation of forest habitat, and a C4 pathway also occur. I reconstructed a dated phylogenetic hypothesis for 79 taxa, using the trnL/F plastid region, inferring a mean crown-group age of 56 million years. Fitch parsimony infers the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) to have occupied a savanna habitat with eight or more shifts to forest. Features associated with insect pollination—white bracts and spikelets—were shown to evolve six or more times but were not correlated with the shifts to forest habitat where wind pollination is likely to be less effective. I found evolutionary correlations in the pairwise comparisons of bract color versus spikelet color and bract positioning versus bract color. Members with anatomies associated with C4, though anatomically variable, form a clade with a crown age of 19 million years. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In Chapter 3, with collaborators I develop a robust probe design process to identify 499 low-copy nuclear regions and 18 high-copy functional genes for hybrid enrichment. We obtained &gt;90% enrichment success for target regions. Between 159 and 488 orthologs were retained in alignments used for phylogenetic inference at deep and shallow levels across the angiosperms. A sampling strategy focusing on incremental removal of incongruent loci in combination with removal of sites with high rates of change produced 196 alignments for phylogenetic inference. The phylogenetic hypotheses at each sample level represent outcomes under different regions of parameter space. These outcomes were presented using heatmaps that depict bootstrap support at all nodes for those 196 levels of parameter space. This provided a new approach for sensitivity analyses and for testing the robustness of any hypotheses. A randomization methodology for hypotheses testing at specific nodes takes advantage of the heatmap approach. Focusing on the difficult-to-resolve eudicot, monocot, Magnoliid nodes the analysis revealed that the supermatrix approach produced a spuriously confident yet conflicting result in some regions of parameter space. With &gt;97% of the data, supermatrix analyses supported eudicot and Magnoliids as sister. Support switched to strongly support the eudicot and monocot sister relationship at higher levels of data removal. In contrast the coalescent model consistently supported the latter relationship across most of the parameter space. Overall the eudicot and monocot sister relationship is robustly favored. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In Chapter 4, I reexamine beaksedge (tribe Rhynchosporeae ) diversification but employ the anchored hybrid enrichment protocols developed in Chapter 3. A dated phylogenetic hypothesis for 115 taxa in the tribe and 11 outgroup taxa inferred a mean crown-group age for the tribe of 43.2 million years. Ancestral state reconstruction using stochastic mapping infers an open (savanna) habitat for the MRCA. This was the common state along 77% of the total branch lengths. However, there was an average of 22 independent shifts from open habitats into forest understory or edges in its descendants. The common state was the typical seasonally wet savanna soils. The state associated with their occurrence in dry, well drained soils was reconstructed for 4% of the total branch lengths, but there was an average of 11.2 transitions to that state. There were 3.7 transitions to the state where plants typically occur in standing or flowing water. An average of 5.9 transitions from nondescript brown or green inflorescences associated with wind pollination to those associated with insect pollination (white spikelets and/or bracts) were inferred but these were not correlated with the shifts to forest habitat. Members with C4 anatomy formed a clade that diverged from a sister clade containing taxa with C3 photosynthetic anatomies 26 MYA; this is earlier than previously thought. Most of the taxonomic sections described by Shirley Gale and Georg Kükenthal for Rhynchospora and Pleurostachys were not monophyletic. I also briefly discuss the possible significance of detecting a recently described repetitive satellite DNA element known to be associated with the centromeric protein CENH3.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the most common form of dementia. Like many neurological disorders, Alzheimer’s disease has a sex-biased epidemiological profile, affecting approximately twice as many women as men. The cause of this sex difference has yet to be elucidated. To identify molecular correlates of this sex bias, we investigated molecular sex differences in the hippocampus of healthy female and male mice at 1, 2, and 4 months of age. This analysis identifies a host of genes that display sex-biased expression in the developing mouse hippocampus, many of which are heat shock proteins. Using this dataset as a baseline, we investigated molecular pathology in both sexes using the 5XFAD transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. We profiled the transcriptome of the mouse hippocampus during early stages of disease development with RNA-sequencing. To supplement our transcriptomic analysis, we performed a series of liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry analyses of protein abundance. This proteomic investigation was refined by an extensive methods-oriented analysis of sample fractionation. The analysis of 5XFAD transgenic mice reveals pathological differences in transcript abundance as early as 2 months of age, prior to observable plaque deposition. At 4 months of age, we detect wide-spread up regulation of transcripts associated with immune function in diseased animals. Interestingly, our data indicate that female transgenic mice show a stronger disease phenotype than their male counterparts as measured by number of differentially expressed genes. We also find elevated expression of the 5XFAD transgenes in females relative to males, which likely accounts for a portion of sex-biased molecular pathology observed in this dataset. Taken together, our analyses identify both innate molecular sex differences in the rodent brain, as well as molecular correlates of sex-biased disease features. The findings enhance our understanding of neural sex-differences, and present potential candidate biomarkers for pharmacological intervention for Alzheimer’s disease.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This thesis explores the politics of Black Power leader H. Rap Brown through a genealogical materialist lens. I argue that by addressing class and race as inextricably-bound systems of oppression, Brown synthesized competing ideological strains, the existence of which had long divided black radicals. His anti-capitalist, anti-racist vision located the key ingredients of revolutionary ideology in the experiential knowledge of dispossessed people (of whom he considered black Americans to be the vanguard). As chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, he honed his analysis in a heated political environment characterized by factionalism, violence, paranoia, and state repression. Such factors are taken into account as I seek to contextualize and historicize Brown’s views.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to identify and explain the factors that contribute to the implementation of succession planning and management programs (SP&amp;MPs) in academic libraries as a means of addressing the lack of planning for and development of current academic librarians to fill future leadership roles at their libraries through the provision of these programs. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>     Kurt Lewin’s (1947) planned change theory framed the research. The theory guided the understanding of the change process and assisted in identifying the driving forces for and restraining forces against a planned change. Understanding and recognizing the forces that can support or impede a planned change may help leaders foresee challenges and opportunities before following through with the change process that includes unfreezing the current status, moving the group towards the desired change, and then refreezing the change at the preferred level. The study found that the deans’ leadership styles affected their decisions to implement SP&amp;MPs as a planned change at their academic libraries and identified driving forces for and restraining forces against program implementation. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>     The study employed a mixed-method sequential explanatory research design that consisted of online questionnaires using the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire self-rater form (MLQ 5x) followed by structured in-depth interviews. The findings from the analyses of the MLQ 5x standardized scale demonstrate that the leadership styles of the academic library deans made a difference in their decisions to implement SP&amp;MPs as a planned change at their libraries. The findings from the analyses of the in-depth interviews demonstrate that many driving forces for and restraining forces against SP&amp;MP implementation affected the deans’ decisions now and may affect their decisions in the future. The driving forces were divided into main categories and included; constant change, library staff training, deans’ perceptions towards the future and the profession, and the budget. The restraining forces were also divided into main categories and included; not enough budget, staff, time, and interest; and too many changes, institutional politics and policies, and organizational cultures. The findings also suggest that additional familiarization with formal SP&amp;MP structure and components could benefit program implementation. The literature review and the findings from this study led the researcher to create a list of practical tips for SP&amp;MP implementation specifically for academic libraries. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Limitations of this study are attributable to the sample size and the institutions from which the population derived.  The study participants were ten academic library deans from the same public university and college system in a southeastern state in the United States. The focus of this study was limited to academic libraries; it did not include public, school, or special libraries. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Future research is suggested to supplement the limitations of this study and to build upon the interpretations of the findings. The study should be replicated using a broader sample of leaders in key positions at various levels of the organization; then a comparison the findings from both studies could be conducted to gain a wider perspective on the issues. Future research could expand the knowledge of library practitioners about the purpose and benefits of SP&amp;MPs to the profession. Current library leadership institutes should consider the inclusion of SP&amp;MP training for higher-level library administrators to encourage program implementation.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this dissertation, we introduce long-range interactions into one equilibrium model (Ising model) and one non-equilibrium system (Ziff-Gulari-Barshad model), and study their phase diagrams and critical properties. A new approach to do Wang-Landau simulation: macroscopically constrained Wang-Landau, is proposed in connection with the former system.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Our macroscopically constrained Wang-Landau method breaks a multidimensional random walk process in phase space into many separate, one-dimensional random walk processes in the energy space. Each of these random walks is constrained to a different value of the macroscopic order parameters. By knowing the distribution of these constrained variables, we can deduce the multi-variable density of states.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>When the multi-variable density of states for one set of external parameters is obtained, the density of states at any point in the phase diagram can be obtained by simple transformations. After that, all thermodynamic quantities can be obtained.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We apply this method to an antiferromagnetic Ising model with a ferromagnetic long-range interaction. The addition of the long-range interaction induces metastable regions in the phase diagram, and a mean-field class critical point emerges for sufficiently strong long-range interaction. We demonstrate how to use the multi-variable density of states obtained to sketch out the complicated phase diagrams for different values of the long-range interaction. We also give free-energy plots, and plots of the distributions of the order parameters of the system for different special points in these phase diagrams.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The Ziff-Gulari-Barshad (ZGB) model, a simplified description of the oxidation of</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>carbon monoxide (CO) on a catalyst surface, is widely used to study properties of nonequilibrium phase transitions.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Instead of restricting the CO and atomic oxygen (O) to react to form</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>carbon dioxide (CO$_{2}$) only when</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>they are adsorbed in close proximity, we consider a modified model that</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>includes an adjustable probability for adsorbed CO and O atoms located far apart on the lattice to react.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We employ large-scale Monte Carlo simulations</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para> to study the critical properties of this system. We find that the nonequilibrium</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>critical point changes from the two-dimensional Ising universality class to the mean-field universality class</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>upon introducing even a weak long-range reactivity mechanism.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>As a native of Taiwan, Szu-Yu Chen often combines influences from western and eastern culture in her music. In her compositions, the charm of Chinese music shimmers on the surface, while the foundation resonates with European and American influence. Sinfonietta, Szu-Yu’s first orchestral undertaking, is a work that holds true to that ideal.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>While composing Sinfonietta, the influence of Szu-Yu’s childhood exposure to ancient Chinese poetry fueled her imagination, and helped to shape the piece’s overall character. The warrior battling far from home; the wise, but lonely, philosopher; the breathtaking beauty of the lady; and the defiant poet. Each movement is imbued with the essence of these characters, while the structure of the work remains within the boundaries of a traditional symphony.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Four (4) new bridges were constructed by the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) to replace four (4) deteriorated bridges on U.S. Highway 90 between Tallahassee and Quincy, Florida. The new bridges were built using new construction methods which can be designated as Accelerated Bridge Construction (ABC) processes. This research focuses on the bridges' superstructures which were constructed using prefabricated elements from a precast concrete facility. The superstructure elements included precast pretensioned Florida-I Beams (FIB),  precast pretensioned concrete deck panels and precast reinforced (non-prestressed) concrete deck panels.   </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The two (2) westbound bridges were constructed using pretensioned concrete deck panels, whereas the two (2) eastbound bridges were constructed using reinforced concrete deck panels. The bridge panels were connected to the FIBs using a high-strength grout. Closure joints between the panels were filled with cast-in-place concrete. Before this new construction method can be adopted by the FDOT, it is necessary to evaluate the feasibility, construction process, and overall structural integrity of the new bridges. Therefore, load tests took place to evaluate the similarities and differences of the two (2) different types of panels. The testing showed that they both behave similarly to each other, and that composite action between the panels and FIBs was achieved. The test results were also used to compare the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) distribution factors with those calculated from load test data. A portion of the load test focused on how much the barrier affects the overall load distribution, by load testing before and after the barriers were placed on one of the bridges.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The default threshold framework for credit risk modeling developed by Garreau and Kercheval [SIAM Journal on Financial Mathematics, 7:642--673, 2016] enjoys the advantages of both the structural from models and the reduced form models, including excellent analytical tractability. In their paper, the closed form default time distribution of a company is derived when the default threshold is a constant or a deterministic function. As for stochastic default threshold, it is shown that the survival probability can be derived as an expectation. How to specify the stochastic default threshold so that this expectation can be obtained in closed form is however left unanswered. The purpose of this thesis is to fulfill this gap. In this thesis, three credit risk models with stochastic default thresholds are proposed, under each of which the closed form default time distribution is derived. Unlike Garreau and Kercheval's work where the log-return of a company's stock price is assumed to be independent and identically distributed and the interest rate is assumed constant, in our new proposed models the random interest rate and the stochastic volatility of a company's stock price are taken into consideration. While in some cases the defaultable bond price, the credit spread and the CDS premium are derived in closed form under the new proposed models, in others it seems not so easy. The difficulty that stops us from getting closed form formulas is also discussed in this thesis. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Our new models involve the Heston model, which has a closed form characteristic function. We found the common characteristic function formula used in the literature not always applicable for all input variables. In this thesis the safe region of the formula is analyzed completely. A new formula is also derived that can be used to find the characteristic function value in some cases when the common formula is not applicable. An example is given where the common formula fails and one should use the new formula.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The present study investigated the malleability and the roles of both physical pain tolerance and fearlessness about death in acquired capability for suicide utilizing experimental methods involving acetaminophen and a social learning-based reading task. These two interventions were manipulated to test their effects on physical pain tolerance (PPT) and fearlessness about death (FAD), as measured by a pressure Algometer and the Acquired Capability for Suicide Scale – Fearlessness about Death, respectively. 106 Florida State University undergraduate psychology students were divided into four groups as follows: group 1 received acetaminophen and a control reading task; group 2 received acetaminophen and the observational learning reading task; group 3 received the observational learning reading task with no acetaminophen; and group 4 received the control reading task and no acetaminophen. Multivariate analysis of variance was used to test the hypotheses that there would be significant main effects for each intervention and that there would be a significant interaction effect as well. Multivariate results demonstrated that the effect for the interaction between acetaminophen and the reading intervention was not significant (p = .17), that there was a significant main effect for the reading intervention (p &lt; .05) and that there was no effect for acetaminophen (p = .56).</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Developing countries have seen a significant increase in cross-border financial flows and foreign bank presence over the past few decades. Although trade theory and the specific-factors model suggest that financial integration hurts mobile capital in developing countries, extant literature emphasizes the role of mobile capital in pushing for more openness. To reconcile seemingly inconsistent arguments, I propose a more nuanced treatment of financial liberalization. I argue that there are two separate aspects of financial liberalization: capital account liberalization and foreign bank entry. I elaborate on how the costs and benefits of each aspect are distributed between two domestic groups: (1) borrowers and savers and (2) domestic banks. In addition to the preferences of societal groups, I identify the institutional conditions under which governments respond positively to the demand for liberalization. I find strong empirical support for the liberalizing effect of borrowers and savers on capital account liberalization, and this liberalizing effect is conditioned by the government’s time horizon. The finding sheds light on the importance of financial inclusion and government’s time horizon in promoting greater financial integration and more efficient allocation of capital across the globe.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>A mixed-method explanatory sequential design utilizing surveys and interviews conducted at three Florida library systems examines caregivers’ perceptions of emergent literacy programming, how these perceptions compare with the National Research Council’s Features for Quality Programs for children, and what is their motivation for attending these programs. The results from the survey and interview reveal that caregivers’ perceptions of emergent literacy programming align with the National Research Council’s Features for Quality Programs.  The data shows caregivers’ perceptions are very positive toward emergent literacy programming in terms of learning and the environment. Themes emphasized in the interviews on why caregivers are motivated to attend include socialization, getting out of the house, and free access. The results of these surveys and interviews will inform public libraries as to how to design, market, and deliver emergent literacy programming to caregivers with very young children.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Yin Yang 1 (YY1) is a highly conserved, multifunctional zinc finger transcription factor. It has been shown to regulate genes involved in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, cell growth and proliferation, differentiation, and development. YY1 is ubiquitously expressed, leading to the hypothesis that post-translational modifications, specifically phosphorylation, and protein-protein interactions play a crucial role in regulating its various functions. It was therefore important to develop new tools in order to better understand these two regulatory mechanisms. A new system using the BioID approach was established to further understand the interactions of YY1 and identify interactions brought about by phosphorylation of serine 247. This phosphorylation is inhibited by a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, flavopiridol. After further analysis, the phosphorylation of YY1 at serine 247 increased in response to DNA damage induced by etoposide, however, this increase was not inhibited by flavopiridol. This leads to the possibility of two separate pathways responsible for phosphorylating serine 247. A lentiviral expression system was developed in order to further explore the functional role of serine 247. This system is extremely versatile and has the ability to rescue YY1 expression after siRNA knockdown. As a whole, the tools developed here will allow for an in depth understanding of serine 247 phosphorylation and the kinases responsible for this modification. Furthermore, the BioID and the lentiviral expression systems aid in uncovering novel YY1 interactions in normal cellular conditions as well as under DNA damage at both the transcriptional and translational level. This research has the possibility of improving our understanding of chemotherapeutic drugs as well as providing novel drug targets for disease treatment.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In response to the increasing demand for jet noise studies performed at realistic conditions, the Florida Center For Advanced Aero-Propulsion at Florida State University has recently brought online an upgraded Anechoic High-Temperature Jet Facility. The function of this facility is to accurately simulate and characterize the aeroacoustic properties of exhaust from jet engines at realistic temperatures and flow speeds. This new addition is a blow-down facility supplied by a 3500 kPa, 114 cubic meter compressed dry air system and a sudden-expansion ethylene burner that is capable of producing ideally expanded jets up to Mach 2.6 and stagnation temperatures up to 1500 K. The jet exhausts into a fully anechoic chamber which is equipped to acquire acoustic and flow measurements including the temperature and pressure of the jet. The facility is capable of operating under free jet as well as in various impinging jet configurations pertinent to sea- and land-based aircraft, such as the F-35B. Compared to the original facility, the updated rig is capable of longer run times at higher temperatures. In this paper we demonstrate the facility's experimental capabilities and document jet aeroacoustic characteristics at various flow and temperature conditions. The anechoic chamber was characterized using ISO (3745:2003) guidelines and the lower cutoff frequency of the chamber was determined to be 315 Hz. Aeroacoustic properties of jets operating at subsonic conditions and supersonic Mach numbers ranging from 1.2 to 2.1 at temperatures of ~300 K to ~1300 K are documented. Where available, very good agreement was found when the present results were compared with data in the jet noise literature.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>These case studies examined the effect of music reinforced nonnutritive sucking on term infants receiving intravenous lines. Intravenous lines are a common invasive procedure that hospitalized infants endure. Subjects were between the ages of 37 weeks gestational age to 1 year of age. This study includes five case studies involving term infants receiving a standard of care intravenous line in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. The control infants (n=2) received no contact and the experimental infants (n=3) received a music intervention paired with nonnutritive sucking. The music intervention involved the use of the Pacifier Activated Lullaby device, which began 3 minutes prior to the procedure. Dependent variables included heart rate, respiration rate, oxygen saturation level, and behavior state. The dependent variables were averaged for each subject and by intervention, and averages were compared. Subjects with the experimental intervention had lower behavior state scores. The heart rate and oxygen saturation levels appeared less stable for the control infants.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Rossby waves are waves in potential vorticity that propagate along the extratropical tropopause and can be impacted by the advection of low-PV air originating from the subtropics. In this study, the subtropical precipitation influence on the extratropical Rossby wave activity during the Atlantic winter season is investigated for a ten year period. Using both TRMM and TIGGE 12-Hr forecasted precipitation data, heavy precipitation events were identified near the footprints regions of warm conveyor belts in the northern Atlantic, specifically in the Gulf of Mexico and Bermuda region. The extratropical Rossby waves were then analyzed using PV on a 320K surface. By use of wavelet transforms, the amplitude of the Rossby waves were analyzed as a function of wavelength and longitude. The interaction between a single heavy precipitation event and the extratropical Rossby waves was examined for the days preceding and the week following the event. A climatological analysis of heavy precipitation events was conducted on the winter seasons from 2006 - 2015.  Case study and climatological analysis identified the following:</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A ridge in the Northern Atlantic undergoes amplification downstream of the heavy precipitation event in the days following the event.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A southerly flow,likely associated with a warm conveyor belt, connects the region of the heavy precipitation event and the extratropical tropopause. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The interaction was most prominent during the late winter season and during the heaviest of precipitation events.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The teleconnection identified in this study highlights a mechanism by which cloud-scale subtropical precipitation is connected to synoptic scale extratropical dynamics in the Atlantic.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Governments in the developing world continue to struggle to find a solution to the issue of high risk informal settlements. The issue has been addressed with multiple approaches, the most popular of which is relocation. Unfortunately, relocation is more often a failure than a success in the developing context (Jha &amp; Duyne, 2010). The main problem is a lack of understanding of the processes by which human settlements are established. There is evidence of success in relocation projects that include local knowledge in its design and implementation phases; on most cases local knowledge was best collected through various community participatory methods (Berke &amp; Campanella, 2006; Cronin &amp; Guthrie, 2011; Satterthwaite, 2011). There are also new approaches to create solutions for these groups, one of them is reconstruction and upgrade in place. This approach is rather new and few contexts allow for its implementation but it has proven to receive better community approval  (Abbott, 2002; Horwood &amp; Phillips, 2007; Werlin, 1999).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study delves into these complexities of urban poor populations, housing projects, and natural disasters. More specifically, this study discusses the implications of relocating or upgrading urban poor families through the ISF Housing Program of the Philippines and the Dichato Reconstruction Program in Chile. In both cases the analysis is drawn specifically to the role of multiple stakeholder participation and context specific characteristics in the design and implementation of the projects. This study explores the benefits and dilemmas encountered during implementation of relocation and upgrade national programs in two contrasting cases. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Key findings in this research show that there is a complex array of circumstances that guide the observed communities’ decision to locate and struggle to remain on hazardous settlements. In both cases the relocation was initially well received by communities in the aftermath of great disasters. Just recently, after relocation, communities have started to experience important long term effects to the socioeconomic and emotional development that they had enjoyed in their former location. Participation in both cases was much encouraged but timing struggles impeded full implementation of participatory approaches. The takeaway of this study is that disaster stricken communities in vulnerable economic situations need solutions that not only provide safe housing but that also consider other basic needs like economic stability, social interaction and community life. Long term solutions for the urban poor in high risk areas are best crafted together through inclusive participation with the urban poor themselves.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Measurement invariance analysis is important when test scores are used to make a group-wise comparison. Multiple-group IRT modeling is one of the commonly used methods for measurement invariance examination. One essential step in the multiple-group modeling method is the evaluation of overall model-data fit. A family of limited information fit statistics has been recently developed for assessing the overall model-data fit in IRT. Previous studies evaluated the performance of limited information fit statistics using single-group data, and found that these fit statistics performed better than the traditional full information fit statistics when data were sparse. However, no study has investigated the performance of the limited information fit statistics within the multiple-group modeling framework. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study aims to examine the performance of the limited information fit statistic ( ) and  -based corresponding descriptive fit indices in conducting measurement invariance analysis within the multiple-group IRT framework. A Monte Carlo study was conducted to examine sampling distributions of   and  -based descriptive fit indices, and their sensitivities to lack of measurement invariance under various conditions. The manipulated factors included sample sizes, model types, dimensionality, types and numbers of DIF items, and latent trait distributions. Results showed that the  followed an approximately chi-square distribution when the model was correctly specified, as expected. The type I error rates of   were reasonable under large sample sizes (1000/2000). When the model was misspecified, the power of   was a function of sample size and the number of DIF items. For example, the power of   for rejecting the U2PL Scalar Model increased from 29.2% to 99.9% when the number of uniform DIF items increased from one to six, given the sample sizes of 1000/2000. With six uniform DIF items (30% of the studied items), the power of increased from 42.4% to 99.9% when sample sizes changed from 250/500 to 1000/2000. When the difference in  ( ) was used to compared two correctly specified nested models, the sampling distribution of   appeared to be apart from the reference chi-square distribution at both tails, especially under small sample sizes. The type I error rates of the  test became closer to the expectation when sample sizes increased. For example, both Metric and Configural Models were correctly specified when the test included no DIF item. Given the alpha level of .05, the type I error rates of   for the comparsion between the Metric and Configural Model were slightly inflated with n=250/500 (8.72%), and became closer to the alpha level with n=1000/2000 (5.3%). When at least one of the models was misspecified, the power of   increased when the number of DIF items or sample sizes became larger. For example, the Metric Model was misspecified when nonuniform DIF item existed. Given sample sizes of 1000/2000 and alpha level of .05, the power of   for the comparison between the Metric and Configural Model increased from 52.55 % to 99.39% when the number of nonuniform DIF items changes from one to six. With one nonuniform DIF item in the test, the power of   was only 17.05% given the alpha level of .05 and sample sizes of 250/500, but increased to 52.55% given the sample sizes of 1000/2000. The descriptive fit indices and their differences between nested models were also affected by the number of DIF items. When there was no DIF item, all fit indices indicated good model-data fit. The differences of the five fit indices between nested models were all very small (&lt;.008) across different sample sizes. When DIF items existed, the means of descriptive fit indices, and their differences between nested models increased when number of DIF items increased. The finding from this study provided some suggestions about the implementation of the limited information fit statistics/indices in measurement invariance analysis within the multiple-group IRT framework.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Global climate is strongly influenced by fluctuations in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Weathering of silicate rocks consumes CO2, transports cations to the oceans, and thus plays a critical role in both seawater chemistry and climate. A major product of silicate weathering is magnesium, which in the oceans is homogeneous in both concentration and isotopic composition (δ26MgSW = -0.82‰). This homogeneity reflects a balance between continental weathering input by rivers (δ26MgRiver ~ -1.09‰) and groundwaters, and removal by high-temperature hydrothermal oceanic crust alteration (δ26MgSW - δ26MgHT ~ 0.0‰), dolomite formation, and authigenic alumino-silicate clay formation during low-temperature alteration of the oceanic crust. Since the oceanic residence time of Mg is significantly longer than the ocean mixing time, temporal variations in Mg isotopic composition of seawater (δ26MgSW) recorded by marine calcites, such as foraminifera, can reflect a global picture of Cenozoic climate that is driven by an imbalance between the source and sink. A review of previous geochemical proxies and the terrestrial processes of magnesium are discussed in Chapter 1.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In Chapter 2, we present an improved method for trace level Mg measurements in natural carbonates. The method was developed for analysis of planktonic foraminifera samples in order to generate a Mg isotopic record for Cenozoic seawater, however it can also be applied to seawater and other natural samples with a high ionic strength sample matrix. There were three major analytical challenges that needed to be overcome: 1. Maintain a precision of ±0.1‰ with a mass consumption as low as ~10 ng of Mg; 2. Maintain minimal blanks (≤0.1 ng) on Mg and other matrix elements (Na, K, Ca, etc); 3. Purify samples to have complete separation of Mg from matrix elements with 100% recovery. We achieved this through cation-exchange column chromatography and analysis on a Multi-Collector Inductively-Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (Thermo-Scientific “Neptune” MC-ICP-MS). We quantified our precision and accuracy through measurements of CAM1, natural seawater, and the JCP-1 coral reference standard and compared with other published studies. In addition, elemental ratios were determined by Quadrupole-ICP-MS (Q-ICP-MS; Florida State University) or by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES; University of Cambridge) to verify that the sample had been properly chemically cleaned and that it had not undergone diagenesis that would alter the Mg isotope ratios.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In chapter 3, we present data from 66 core-top planktonic foraminifera samples from the Holocene epoch to investigate the use of the Mg isotopic composition of foraminifera as a potential proxy for the Mg isotope record of Cenozoic seawater and to quantify the fractionation between seawater and foraminiferal calcite (Δ26MgForam-Seawater). The average δ26Mg of the planktonic foraminifera in our samples is -4.79 ± 0.83‰ (2σ), which includes 10 species with varying size-fractions from 4 sampling sites. Our study demonstrates that there is limited inter-species variability in δ26Mg. We also observed no differences between the δ26Mg of foraminifera cleaned with and without the reductive cleaning step (hydrazine + citric acid). This suggests that the Mg isotopic composition of the high-Mg calcite bands, which are preferentially dissolved during reductive cleaning, is similar to that of the low-Mg bands. In addition, the discrimination against Mg is higher for foraminiferal calcite formation compared to precipitation of inorganic calcite, suggesting that biomineralization should induce additional fractionation of Mg isotopes.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In chapter 4, we present a new record of planktonic foraminifera (n = 104) spanning the Cenozoic Era (0 to 70 Ma), which shows a ~1‰ decrease in δ26Mg towards present day values. The significance of this decrease is challenged by the high variability in our core-top foraminifera calibration (δ26Mg = -4.63±0.57‰ (n=48, 2σ)). However, box model scenarios demonstrate that such a decrease in δ26Mg could be driven by a decrease in the dolomite formation flux from ~4.0 Tmol/yr to present-day values of 0.84 Tmol/yr.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Traditional Instructional Systems Design (ISD) has focused upon measurable learning, but the emerging emphasis on informal methods of learning, combined with powerful mobile computing devices, is turning the spotlight to mobile performance support (mPS) in lieu of formal instruction.  However, there is thus far little research into how to design effective mPS, what design principles should be brought to bear, how mPS tools should be evaluated, and so on (Martin, Díaz, Martínez-Mediano, Sancristobal, Oliva, Peire, &amp; Castro, 2010; Paino &amp; Rossett, 2008), leaving designers of mPS without evidence-based guidance for their practice.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To capture a picture of methodologies presently being used to design mPS, as well as the perceived effectiveness of those methods, three recent examples of mPS were examined and the individuals responsible for them were interviewed.  The first case was the “Bedsider”, created by the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, a private, nonprofit organization.  The second case was a “Turbulence App”, created by Delta Air Lines, Inc., a publicly traded for-profit organization.  The final case was the “Prescribed Fire Smoke Management Pocket Guide”, or “Smoke App”, created through the collaboration of the U.S. Department of Defense’s Advanced Distributed Learning Initiative and the Southeastern Regional Partnership for Planning And Sustainability.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Each case study focused upon process employed, results, and concerns.  Cross-case analysis examined similarities and differences between the methodologies, as well as apparent importance of the variation.  The individual mPS design approaches were compared with traditional ISD methodology, and the three mPS design models were aggregated into a consensus mPS design model (CDM) and compared with traditional ISD methodology to identify any significant differences.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study sought to answer two major questions and two related secondary questions. The first major question was, what mPS design methodologies are organizations actually using?  The individual design models in use are described in each case study.  The second major question was, how do the methodologies in use compare with traditional instructional design methodology?  Although similar in many ways, there were important divergences, particularly with regard to analysis and evaluation activities.  The answer to the third questions, how the mPS methodologies in actual use are perceived in terms of effectiveness. was unequivocal.  The sponsors of all three cases expressed complete satisfaction with the resulting mPS tools and with the outcomes.  The fourth question was, how might the mPS design methodologies in actual use be improved?  Several interviewees shared notions of what they “would do differently next time”, and the consensus model provided the basis for suggestions for improvement in the front-end and back-end design activities.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The significance of this study lies in the documentation of design procedures presently used to create mPS, and the description of how instructional designers might wish to approach the design of mPS in the future.  This study helped identify and describe models in actual use in three organizations representing for-profit, not-for-profit, and government sectors, and examined the implications of differences between those models and traditional ISD methodology.  This research also makes recommendations for improvement in mPS design practices.  Those who follow this advice may find that they design better mPS applications</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>A wireless sensor network (WSN) consists of a large number of low-cost sensors that can communicate to each other for specific applications. Sensor nodes are spatially distributed in a large region and operated in an autonomous manner. Each sensor node in the network is battery-limited and irreplaceable for most applications. Compared to the existing ad-hoc networks, significant problems have been raised. How to efficiently consume the energy to obtain a long lifetime of the network? How to design routing algorithms to adaptively accommodate the change in energy? How to reconsider the energy-efficiency issue if the renewable energy devices are involved? How to mathematically model these problems and validate solutions by simulations and experiments? We investigate these questions and present our models, designs, algorithms, and results in the dissertation.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Research on WSNs is driven by specific applications but the applications of WSN have been widely divergent in recent years. Environmental monitoring and surveillance is a major application, in which the WSN is implemented to monitor a large geographic area that is usually unexplored or potentially dangerous area, such as forests, rivers, and desert. It is especially challenging when the infrastructure of the environment is unknown. The sensors for this application are irreplaceable and thus the battery life becomes crucially important. Military applications are designed to support communications among soldiers, military vehicles, and headquarters. For example, in a battlefield, the coordination among a groups of soldiers has to be well-established in any complicated situation. An interesting paradigm is animal monitoring, in which small sensors are placed on animals to surveil their habitat. The sensors carried by animals form a mobile ad hoc network to collect and transmit data. The difficulties of this application are that the sensors must be lightweight enough for animals while the topology of the network is always changing. Also, there are other emerging applications like body health monitoring, disaster recovery, and underwater robot-assisted exploration.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this work, we have two major related research topics. One is the energy-efficient design and optimization of the application-specific routing protocols to maximize the network lifetime of a WSN. Another is the optimization and design of the routing protocol for energy harvesting wireless sensor network (EHWSN) by predicting the condition of energy harvesting in the near future.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>For the first topic, the key issue is how to conserve energy to maintain the network connectivity as long as possible, or maximize the lifetime of the network. One common solution is to design a routing algorithm that can cope with the changes of network conditions and dynamically adjust the routing strategy or switch the operation modes to save energy. Many routing metrics have to be considered including transmission distance, residual energy, link capacity, etc. Energy-efficient routing protocols have been well investigated with the goal of maximizing the network lifetime, which is usually defined as the time when the first node dies. Once a node becomes unavailable due to energy depletion, its data transmissions in the network are assumed to fail. In our work, we consider the network remains alive as long as the energy is enough to maintain the flows of the application traffic, which is more reasonable since the network can still function even without those ”dead” nodes. Instead of universally balancing the energy consumption over the entire network, we aim at locally optimizing the energy-efficiency of the target nodes on the application flows. Essentially, it’s an energy trade-off between the target nodes and other irrelevant nodes, in which he former will expend more energy than the latter on the application flows for energy-efficiency. Therefore, the routing algorithm can be designed to save more energy on routes of the specific traffic. We present a novel application-specific and energy-efficient routing algorithm to maximize the lifetime of the application flows in WSNs. Firstly, we formulate the routing problem as a linear programming problem, which can be converted to a max-min fairness problem. Secondly, the lifetime of a flow is evaluated in terms of the link metrics including residual energy, transmission rate, and link distance. Thirdly, a heuristic routing algorithm is proposed to compute the best route that minimizes the cost of application flows. Simulation results have shown that our routing algorithm prolong the lifetime of flows around 10%.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>For the second topic, compared to a conventional WSN, which is strictly limited by its battery supply of the sensor nodes, EHWSN is an environmentally powered network that brings new techniques and challenges to the energy-efficiency topic. By harvesting the ambient or renewable energy feasible to WSN, a tremendous breakthrough can be made to improve the energy-efficiency and the network lifetime. Environment usually has a large variety of the energy sources, such as solar, wind, mechanical, thermal, and biochemical sources. Some major issues have been raised in order to take advantage of energy harvesting. For instance, how to schedule and allocate the energy consumption by predicting the energy availability? How to jointly consider the energy-efficiency</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>and network lifetime? How to design a prediction model for energy harvesting in order to achieve a better performance?</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We find a critical issue in current routing algorithms for EHWSN, in which the calculated routes are frequently alternating because of the uncertainty of the energy availability in the near future. Without knowing the future harvesting condition, the current algorithms calculate the most energy-efficient routes based on the past and current condition. The uncertainty may lead to energy waste and extra network overheads. In our work, we propose to predict the energy harvesting condition in the near future and estimate whether the current optimal routes can be maintained by the harvested energy in a certain time threshold. If yes, we temporarily restrict the data transmission and receiving to reduce the energy cost by using parameters, which are determined by the availability and intensity of the future harvesting. Comprehensive factors are considered to predict the energy condition in near future and help make routing decisions including residual energy, harvest energy, and energy consumption.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We first give an example to illustrate the motivation of our energy prediction-based routing problem. Second, we formulate the problem as a linear optimization problem and convex optimization problem with analytical proof depending on prediction models. Third, we propose a heuristic routing algorithm to maximize the volume of collected data from the network. Fourth, the routing algorithm is implemented and verified by Matlab and OMNET++ simulation. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm can largely improve the energy-efficiency and reduce the network overheads.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In summary, we propose to solve the energy-efficiency issues in both application-specific WSN and EHWSN. For application-specific WSN, the network lifetime is extended by our routing algorithm, which aims at minimizing the energy consumption of the target nodes rather than the entire network nodes. The results shows a 10% improvement on network lifetime. For EHWSN, the network throughput is increased by a predictable energy-efficient routing algorithm, which considering the harvested energy in the near future. The results demonstrate that the both network throughput and lifetime are increased.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Depression affects approximately 7% of adults in the US annually and is one of the most common mental disorders. One striking aspect of this disorder, is that it affects women at about twice the rate as compared to men. Furthermore, women with cardiovascular diseases are more likely to experience depression as compared to male counterparts. Thus, women with cardiovascular complications represent an extremely vulnerable population for mood disorder. Given the disparity in depression prevalence, it is not surprising that women are also more likely to take antidepressant treatments as compared to men. While the dose of the antidepressant prescribed is similar across the board, there is mounting evidence that the efficacy of and sensitivity to these treatments differ between the sexes. However, the majority of preclinical investigations into the effectiveness and biochemical mechanisms of antidepressants have been conducted in male subjects. This is a serious gap in our knowledge, and investigations into the mechanisms underlying differences in depression prevalence and antidepressant response is imperative. As such, this dissertation aimed to identify potential peripheral and neural changes associated with onset of depression in females with cardiovascular disease, and to examine the neural mechanisms underlying the sex differences in sensitivity to antidepressants.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	There is substantial evidence that depression is experienced at a much higher rate in individuals with chronic conditions, such as cardiovascular disease. Within this population, women with cardiovascular diseases represent an extremely vulnerable population for mood disorder, comorbid for these conditions at about twice the rate as compared to men. Despite the well-established comorbidity, the mechanisms linking these disorders remain elusive. The first chapter of this dissertation aimed to identify the expression of core behavioral features of mood disorder in female mice bearing a knock-in sarcomeric mutation, which is exhibited in human hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). We then investigated peripheral physiological indicators of stress in these mice, and discovered significant adrenal gland hypertrophy and a dominant sympathetic nervous system tone. Through the use of magnetic resonance imaging, we found reduced volume in mood-related brain regions in females with HCM. We also observed significant reductions in hippocampal neurotrophic signaling markers in females with HCM as compared to controls. These results suggest that prolonged systemic HCM stress is central to mood disorder expression; possibly through induction of structural and functional brain changes.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	In direct contrast to the negative impact of stress/depression on the structure and function of the brain, many antidepressants reverse these changes and promote neurogenesis. In recent years, ketamine has shown great promise as an antidepressant. A single infusion can exert effects within hours of treatment, and this rapid action is a unique feature of ketamine. Most antidepressants need to be taken for weeks to months to exert therapeutic effects, and often the first medication prescribed is not effective. Ketamine represents a great advancement in the field, especially for individuals suffering from depression and cardiovascular dysfunction. In this population, the use of ketamine could circumvent the potential for negative interactions between cardiac medications and chronic antidepressants. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Since females are more likely to take antidepressants as compared to males, we wanted to examine how the males and females differed in behavioral and neurochemical responses to ketamine. Our group and others have previously reported that female rodents are more sensitive to the antidepressant-like effect of ketamine. There is some evidence that ovarian hormones may promote sensitivity to antidepressants, yet the precise molecular mechanism of females’ heightened sensitivity to ketamine remains unclear. In order to fill these critical gaps in our knowledge, the second chapter of this dissertation aimed to determine the role of endogenous ovarian hormones and their respective receptor subtypes to promote ketamine sensitivity. Behavioral responses to ketamine were examined in males, females in diestrus 1 (D1, low hormone), and females in proestrus (Pro, high hormone) using the forced swim test. Males and D1 females exhibited similar sensitivity, while Pro females responded to doses of ketamine that were subthreshold for effects in male and D1 counterparts. Through the use of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMS), we examined the role of estrogen receptor subtypes (ERα and ERβ) and progesterone receptors (PR) to promote ketamine sensitivity. We found that D1 females treated with ERα and ERβ SERMS responded to ketamine treatment, which suggests that estrogen action at these receptors may enhance ketamine sensitivity. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Another aim of chapter two was to determine if the molecular mechanisms previously shown to mediate ketamine’s antidepressant effects in male rodents also apply to females. Since many of the rapid intracellular signaling cascades initiated by ketamine are also influenced by ovarian hormones (e.g., brain-derived neurotrophic factor), we used Western blot to investigate the expression and activation of their shared targets. We confirmed previous reports in males that ketamine activated a variety of neurotrophic signaling cascades in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, and extended them to include D1 and Pro females. As a first step towards identifying the neural mechanism of Pro females’ sensitivity, we found that these females exhibited activation of Akt and CaMKIIα in response to a dose of ketamine that only they were sensitive to. While these results need to be confirmed in vivo, together they suggest that ovarian hormones increase behavioral sensitivity to ketamine by enhancing ketamine’s effects on PI3K and CaMKIIα signaling within mood-related brain regions. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	These studies examined the expression and molecular mechanisms of mood disorder-like behaviors in a mouse model of cardiovascular dysfunction. We focused on females with HCM, since they represent an especially vulnerable population for mood disorder. We also investigated the hormonal and biochemical contributors to sex differences in sensitivity to ketamine. This work lays a foundation for future investigation of the effectiveness of ketamine to reverse depression-associated features in females with HCM. By targeting the natural flux in ovarian hormones, it may be possible to safely and effectively treat these females with a low dose of ketamine.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>All 28 colleges of the Florida College System (FCS) have made space in their budgets and on their campuses in order to attract upper-division partners, colleges and universities that represent the State University System (SUS), Independent Colleges and Schools of Florida, and other higher education institutions nationwide. Partnership relationships such as the ones negotiated between FCS institutions and upper division schools are defined as academic strategic alliances in higher education literature. Scholars have taken this terminology from business management lexicon wherein organizations respond to a competitive market by joining forces (Das &amp; Teng, 1997). Accordingly, scholars from both fields emphasize the concept of collaboration packed inside the strategic decision of campus leaders to pool their resources partnerships (Adegbesan &amp; Higgins, 2011; Eckel, Hartley, &amp; Affolter-Caine, 2004).    </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study explored both sides of the state college-university partnership dynamic through the eyes of the administrators using themes from Gulati’s (1998) network embeddedness framework. I employed a qualitative research design to determine the influence of alliance initiatives on the social networks involved in their implementation. I used a collective-case study approach employing data triangulation (interviews, documents, and observation) to seek out any emerging themes. I also sought out institutional data to support this study.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A majority of these FCS concurrent-use arrangements have persisted while others have failed. This study contributes to higher education literature by offering a means to expand the scope of previous academic strategic alliance studies. Instead of focusing on partnership dyads, this study explored how host and partner institution administrators operate within a social network embedded at the study sites. I propose fresh perspectives to explain how each member involved within a state college’s university partnership program can assert its own needs while working in concert to define common goals and objectives. My two key findings identified the perception of lack as the primary barrier and effective communication as the most influential aid to partnership creation and maintenance.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Statistical analysis methods are used by neuroscience researchers to obtain meaningful information from functional magnetic resonance imaging data to learn more about mind and brain. Machine learning, more specifically pattern recognition and classification tools are frequently used to find regularities in brain scans of different people and/or different stages of a illnesses to understand how functional and anatomical structure of the brain changes under different circumstances. Studies have confirmed that nicotine dependence have impacts on human behaviors such as emotions and motivations, ability to focus, and recalling information which proves nicotine dependency alters brain networks. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study was conducted to investigate this alterations and to test if they can be used for fMRI data classification. The two sets of data that are used are fMRI brain scans from before and after a nicotine addition treatment on patients. Some of the patients received placebo instead of the real treatment and the goal is to develop a method to be able to classify new patients based on receiving the real treatment or the placebo. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The success of the two classification methods, support vector machine and decision trees on the processed data,  was not significant and they should not be considered as reliable methods for use in medical diagnosis. This might be due to the different challenges that are present in analyzing fMRI data such as feature to instance ratio, signal to noise ratio and redundancy.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The origins of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) remain an unsolved problem of contemporary astrophysics. Decades of research indicate that these supernovae arise from thermonuclear runaway in the degenerate material of white dwarf stars; however, the mechanism of these explosions is unknown. Also, it is unclear what are the  progenitors of these objects. These missing elements are vital components of the initial conditions of supernova explosions, and are essential to understanding these events. A requirement of any successful SN Ia model is that a sufficient portion of the white dwarf plasma must be brought under conditions conducive to explosive burning. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Our aim is to identify the conditions required to trigger detonations in turbulent, carbon-rich degenerate plasma at low densities. We study this problem by modeling the hydrodynamic evolution of a turbulent region filled with a carbon/oxygen mixture at a density, temperature, and Mach number characteristic of conditions found in the 0.8+1.2 solar mass (CO0812) model discussed by Fenn et al. (2016). We probe the ignition conditions for different degrees of compressibility in turbulent driving. We assess the probability of successful detonations based on characteristics of the identified ignition kernels, using Eulerian and Lagrangian statistics of turbulent flow.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We found that material with very short ignition times is abundant in the case that turbulence is driven compressively. This material forms contiguous structures that persist over many ignition time scales, and that we identify as prospective detonation kernels. Detailed analysis of the kernels revealed that their central regions are densely filled with material characterized by short ignition times and contain the minimum mass required for self-sustained detonations to form. It is conceivable that ignition kernels will be formed for lower compressibility in the turbulent driving. However, we found no detonation kernels in models driven 87.5 percent compressively.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We indirectly confirmed the existence of the lower limit of the degree of compressibility of the turbulent drive for the formation of detonation kernels by analyzing simulation results of the He0609 model of Fenn et al. (2016), which produces a detonation in a helium-rich boundary layer. We found that the amount of energy in the compressible component of the kinetic energy in this model corresponds to about 96 percent compressibility in the turbulent drive. The fact that no detonation was found in the original CO0812 model for nominally the same problem conditions suggests that models with carbon-rich boundary layers may require higher resolution in order to adequately represent the mass distributions in terms of ignition times.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Recently, power electronic devices provide excellent features in modern distribution networks such as load regulation and power factor adjustment. On the other hand, these devices exhibit nonlinear characteristics due to the semi-conductor devices along with nonlinear control loops. Additionally, contemporary distribution systems are highly penetrated by renewable energy resources as well as distributed energy storage systems. Therefore, current distribution networks are more prone to the instability issue. In different sets of literature, well-known tools are widely utilized to observe dynamical changes in power systems such as Bode, Nyquist, root locus plot and eigenvalues. These methods are all linear-based tools. Therefore, nonlinear systems have to be linearized prior to utilizing linear-based techniques. The main disadvantage of this process is missing the information related to the nonlinear behavior when the nonlinear model is linearized. As a result, inaccurate information might be extracted regarding to the system dynamics because of the inconsistency between the model and the real system. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this study, a nonlinear technique based on nonlinear time-series analysis is utilized to monitor the dynamical behavior. The main advantage of this method is its capability to consider the system as it is and no linearization is needed. Additionally, it can also be utilized in real-time applications. Technically, time-series data sets are extracted from terminal measurements, which can be voltage, current, or power. By embedding the extracted data into the phase-space construction, the system behavior can be visualized which makes a useful understanding of the system’s dynamical characteristics. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>By utilizing a complexity metric, the complexity of the dynamical behavior of the system can be quantified which helps in detecting deviations from the normal behavior. As the complexity based approach is highly dependent on the data characteristics, selecting optimum parameters associated with the complexity technique is discussed in this study. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Since the quantification of the complexity does not provide any information about the stability directly, the Lyapunov exponents are employed as a nonlinear criterion for the stability evaluation. Lyapunov exponents determine the system’s sensitivity to initial conditions.  . In order to validate the proposed technique, three Solid State Transformers (SST) are considered in a microgrid as the case study. Time series data sets are formed by voltage measurement at the load side of each SST. Both complexity and stability are computed through a real-time processor coordinated with the case study. Results confirm the applicability of the proposed technique in the real-time dynamics monitoring.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Vietnam War is considered to be one of the longest and most controversial conflicts that the United States has ever been engaged in.  Veterans from this war experienced a homecoming that was unlike the fanfare awarded to previous military personnel; instead they faced physical ailments, psychological problems, and a lack of support.  This war not only impacted the men and women who served in the military, but also their families and communities, resulting in the need for effective and targeted treatment strategies.  The purpose of this study was to determine if music-assisted relaxation was effective in altering Vietnam Veterans’ perceptions of relaxation and if this was reflected in the self-assessments and physiological data.  Participants were (N = 10) Vietnam Veterans from a local Vietnam Veterans of America Organization, who participated in a music-assisted relaxation intervention facilitated by a board-certified music therapist.  Respiratory rate was measured before the intervention began and one minute prior to the end of the session.  Participants also completed a posttest questionnaire regarding their perceptions of music and the music therapy experience.  Results were not significant, but all participants indicated that they would be willing to participate in the music-assisted relaxation and/or a similar music therapy intervention again.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Intensity estimation for Poisson processes is a classical problem and has been extensively studied over the past few decades.   However, current methods of intensity estimation assume phase variability or compositional noise, i.e. a nonlinear shift along the time axis, is nonexistent in the data which is an unreasonable assumption for practical observations. The key challenge is that these observations are not "aligned'', and registration procedures are required for successful estimation. As a result, these estimation methods can yield estimators that are inefficient or that under-perform in simulations and applications. This dissertation summarizes two key projects which examine estimation of the intensity of a Poisson process in the presence of phase variability. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The first project proposes  an alignment-based framework for intensity estimation.  First, it is shown that the intensity function is area-preserved with respect to compositional noise. Such a property implies that the time warping is only encoded in the density, or normalized intensity, function.  Then, the intensity function can be decomposed into the product of the estimated total intensity (a scalar value) and the estimated density function.  The estimation of the density relies on a metric which measures the phase difference between two density functions.  An asymptotic study shows that the proposed estimation algorithm provides a consistent estimator for the normalized intensity. The success of the proposed estimation algorithm is illustrated using two simulations and the new framework is applied in a real data set of neural spike trains, showing that the proposed estimation method yields improved classification accuracy over previous methods. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The second project utilizes 2014 Florida data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's State Inpatient Database and State Emergency Department Database (provided to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality by the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration) to examine heart failure emergency department arrival times. Current estimation methods for examining emergency department arrival data ignore the functional nature of the data and implement naive analysis methods. In this dissertation, the arrivals are treated as a Poisson process and the intensity of the process is estimated using existing density estimation and function registration methods. The results of these analyses show the importance of considering the functional nature of emergency department arrival data and the critical role that function registration plays in the intensity estimation of the arrival process.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Option pricing by the Fourier method has been popular for the past decade, many of its applications to L´evy processes has been applied especially for European options. This thesis focuses on exponential convergence Fourier method and its application to discrete monitoring options and Bermudan options. An alternative payoff truncating method is derived to compare the benchmark Hilbert transform. A general error control framework is derived to keep the Fourier method out of an overflow problem. Numerical results verify that the alternative payoff truncating sinc method performs better than the benchmark Hilbert transform method under the error control framework.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this work, several nonlocal problems are studied. Analysis and computation have been done for these problems. Firstly, we consider the time-dependent nonlocal diffusion and wave equations, formulated in the peridynamics setting. Initial and boundary data are given. For nonlocal diffusion equation, the time derivative is approximated using either an explicit Forward Euler, or implicit Backward Euler scheme. For nonlocal wave equation, we get the dispersion relations and use the Newmark method to discretize the equation. We have reformulated the standard time-step stability conditions, in light of the peridynamics formulation. Also we have obtained convergence results. Secondly, we consider the space-time fractional diffusion equation which is used to model anomalous diffusion in physics. Finite difference, finite element and other methods are used to solve it. For finite difference method, the stability of the numerical schemes is well studied. However, for finite element method, we have not found the results for the stability of the  schemes, especially for the explicit scheme. Here we get the stability and convergence results for all schemes with $0\leq \theta \leq 1$: Thirdly, an obstacle problem for a nonlocal operator equation is considered; the operator is a nonlocal integral analogue of the Laplacian operator and, as a special case, reduces to the fractional Laplacian. In the analysis of classical obstacle problems for the Laplacian, the obstacle is taken to be a smooth function. For the nonlocal obstacle problem, obstacles are allowed to have jump discontinuities. We cast the nonlocal obstacle problem as a minimization problem wherein the solution is constrained to lie above the obstacle. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a solution in an appropriate function space. Then, the well posedness and convergence of finite element approximations are demonstrated. The results of numerical experiments are provided that illustrate the theoretical results and the differences between solutions of the nonlocal and local obstacle problems. Then we use sparse grid collocation, reduced basis and simplified reduced basis methods to solve nonlocal diffusion equation with random input data. Regularity of the solution and the convergence results for numerical methods are proved. The efficiency of these methods for solving the problem is investigated. As the radius of the spatial interaction zone changes, the computation cost varies due to the density of the stiffness matrix. This is quite different from local problems. Finally, the 1-d nonlocal diffusion equation is solved by a continuous piecewise-linear collocation method using a uniform mesh. The time derivative is approximated using any of forward Euler, backward Euler, or Crank-Nicolson scheme. By developing a technique to deal with</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>the singular integral, we are able to extend the method so that its validity is extended to include the case $1/2\leq s &lt;1$. We also derive stability conditions and convergence rates.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Tens of thousands of students with psychiatric disabilities are enrolled in postsecondary education (Souma, Rickerson, &amp; Burgstahler, 2012) and approximately one in five postsecondary students experience a mental illness (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMHSA], 2013); yet the field of psychology and rehabilitation psychology does not have a comprehensive understanding of what factors may influence outcomes. This study examined postsecondary students with psychiatric disabilities and potential predictors of quality of life (QOL) and academic achievement. This study’s aim was to determine whether person, disability, and environmental variables, as set forth by the psychosocial model of Vash and Crewe (2004) would predict the QOL and academic achievement of postsecondary students with psychiatric disabilities. Additionally, this study assessed gender differences on specific variables within the context of Vash and Crewe’s (2004) framework. QOL was measured using the WHOQOL-BREF (WHO, 1996), coping was measured using the Coping Strategies Inventory - Short Form (CSI-S; Tobin, 1995), and symptom severity was measured using the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS; Sheehan, 1983). Further information was collected for variable usage within the  demographic question. This included: academic achievement (grade-point average), services utilized at their disability service center, and enrollment status (full-time versus part-time). A linear regression was used to determine if person, disability, and/or environmental variables would predict the QOL and academic achievement. Coping and symptom severity were identified as significant predictors of QOL across all four domains. The number of services utilized was identified as a significant predictor within the domains Physical and Social for QOL. No other predictors were identified for QOL, furthermore, this study did not identify predictors of academic achievement. Next, a MANOVA was conducted to assess for gender differences across QOL, academic achievement, and coping. No significant findings were revealed. Possible explanations for both significant and non-significant findings are discussed in detail.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Simulation software is used in a multitude of industry and academic fields, in an assortment of scopes. One might be interested in gravitation of celestial bodies, or field structures of molecular interactions. The scale to which these simulations can grow demands an equally scalable computational mechanism. Traditional and even accelerated solvers suffer from a lack of general scalability, depending on multiple input aspects and recursive refinement. Monte Carlo solvers offer a highly scalable computational mechanism, as it is not prone to the curse of dimensionality and the error can be driven down simply by taking more samples. In the course of refactoring such a Monte Carlo simulation software artefact, several anomalies were noted in its implementation structure. Through attempts at remediating the undesirable behaviour, a general problem of susceptibility was discovered for the Walk-on-Subdomains family of algorithms.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) provide much of the annual rainfall over central equatorial Africa (CEA) during the March-April-May (MAM) and September-October-November (SON) rainy seasons. The characteristics and propagation of these systems are essential components to rainfall variability in this region. This has economic implications related to agriculture, livestock, and drought monitoring. Understanding MCSs will lead to better regional and global climate models that help predict the effects of the changing hydrologic cycle and heat budget as they relate to MCS activity.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	This study identifies and tracks MCSs for the 33-year period 1983-2015 using GridSat-B1 cloud top temperature (CTT) data. Characteristics of the MCSs (displacement, duration, speed, heading, minimum CTT, and maximum size) are determined for the MAM and SON rainy seasons. Statistical significance testing is performed to determine if there are differences between the seasons as they relate to the variables and MCS counts. Long-term trends are also examined. Differences and trends are analyzed using the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	This study finds statistically significant differences between the rainy seasons domain-wide, but these differences are variable- and latitude-dependent. There is high interannual variability and weak-to-absent trends for nearly all variables in both seasons. The exceptions are the average minimum CTTs, which show less interannual variability and cooling trends. Differences between the seasons are largely due to changes in low-level equivalent potential temperature and large scale circulations. The primary factor for initiation is thought to be thermally-driven gravity waves in the lee of the Great Rift Valley. Low-level vertical wind shear is believed to contribute to the maintenance of MCSs as they propagate, but do not seem to be a major factor for initiation.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This study examined the association between a parent’s socioeconomic status, stress, and emotion regulation abilities (i.e., cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression) and that parent’s emotion-related socialization behaviors (ERSBs) in a sample of 192 primary caregivers using self-report, cross-sectional data. A local and an online (Amazon Mechanical Turk), sample were combined and analyzed. The findings varied slightly by sample. Cognitive reappraisal and a composite variable of SES were significant predictors of supportive ERSB use. Stress and expressive suppression were significant predictors of unsupportive ERSBB use. Exploratory analyses indicated that stress moderated the association between cognitive reappraisal and the use of both supportive and unsupportive ERSBs. Future directions in this area of research are discussed and a multi-generational perspective on emotion-related socialization is suggested.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between Instagram use and body image concerns among female university students and to test whether appearance-related comparisons on Instagram mediated this relationship.  A direct relationship between Instagram use and body image concerns was not found, but appearance-related comparisons on Instagram mediated the relationship.  The results suggest that Instagram negatively affects the body image of users who engage in appearance-related comparisons.  Another purpose of this study was to determine the role of intrasexual competitiveness for mates and to test whether individual differences in competitiveness influenced individual tendencies to engage in appearance-related comparisons on Instagram.  Results showed a significant positive relationship between intrasexual competitiveness for mates and appearance-related comparisons on Instagram.  Furthermore, appearance-related comparisons mediated the relationship between Instagram use and drive for thinness.  Future studies should consider exploring the relationship between intrasexual competitiveness for mates, social media use, and body image concerns using experimental designs.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Wave and wind direction effects on remote sensing measurements of ocean surface emissivity are investigated using a microwave radiometer in high wind conditions with a focus on tropical cyclones.  Surface wind speed, which drives many atmospheric and oceanic phenomena, can be inferred from the ocean surface emissivity measurements through the use of a radiative transfer model and inversion algorithm.  The accuracy of the ocean surface emissivity to wind speed calibration relies on accurate knowledge of the surface variables that are influencing the ocean surface emissivity.  This study will identify an asymmetry in ocean surface emissivity measurements at off-nadir incidence angles that is related to the surface wind direction modifying the distribution of whitewater coverage, which is composed of active whitecaps and residual foam that persists after wave breaking, on the ocean surface in high wind conditions viewed by the radiometer.  It will also be shown that asymmetries are present in ocean surface emissivity measurements from a nadir pointing instrument in hurricanes.  This asymmetry can be related to swell and wind wave propagation directions with respect to the wind direction modifying the stress on the ocean surface, which presumably impacts the wave breaking and thus the whitewater coverage characteristics on the ocean surface.  These results help achieve the study goals: 1) improving the understanding of how wave and wind direction modify ocean surface emissivity in high wind conditions and 2) identifying conditions, particularly in tropical cyclones, where wind direction and sea state modify the ocean surface emissivity and should be considered in order to further improve algorithms for the remote sensing of the surface wind.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this dissertation, I examine how a particular mode of thinking has come about—that is, how an increasingly number of sport management scholars have conceived of sport-based inter-/trans-actions as “consumption” and those who engage with sport thus as “consumers.” The question is important as the academic discipline seems to parallel the sport industry, contracting upon a version of sport that is overwhelmingly competitive, commercialized, professional, highly-spectacularized, and mass-consumed. Despite the isomorphic acceptance of market-based approaches to sport management, the field has rich practical, pedagogical, and theoretical roots in education, health, and recreation from which the present consumer-model stands as a radical departure. To resolve this ostensible contradiction, it is first necessary to understand how the present has come to be; thus, an analytic tool is needed to assay the present state of the field, evaluate its trajectory, and trace its effects.      </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para/>
            <DISS_para>Intellectuals have long debated the merits of sport. Many agree that sport can be beneficial when it is played (cf. Zeigler, 2007). However, when sport is engaged in other ways (i.e., spectating a competition, purchasing sport paraphernalia, or asserting allegiance to a team/player), the societal benefit is a bit more opaque, drawing proponents for its cultural and economic significance and critics who challenge sport’s highly spectacularized form, rampant commercialization, and flattening effect on society, for example. Despite this tension, much of the research published in the leading sport management journals is uncritical, adopting deductive-nomothetic approaches to inquiry that produce generalizable, managerially relevant findings with clear commercial implications (see Frisby, 2005; Newman, 2014; Zeigler, 2007). At the same time, idiographic research from alternate (post-modern) onto-epistemic paradigms has been marginalized, as has scholarly inquiry in the once vibrant educational tradition (ibid).  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Adopting a Foucauldian perspective, I conducted a genealogical analysis of sport management research texts published in four leading journals—Journal of Sport Management (JSM), Sport Management Review (SMR), European Sport Management Quarterly (ESMQ), and Sport Marketing Quarterly (SMQ)—to examine how scholarly discourse has inscribed the field over the last 30 years. I explored how a growing faction of sport management researchers, as expressed in scholarly texts, have come to conceive sport-based engagements as the meaningful consummation of autonomous consumer choice, while also defining what consumer outcomes are possible and acceptable. Ultimately, my aim was to deconstruct the operation of power within the field that exerts itself as a diffuse code of culture governing the production of truth and knowledge. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The epistemological premise for the current research project hinges on two genealogical concerns: 1) how particular versions of the sport consumer and sport consumption are made to appear true and solid; and 2) how, in sport management research discourse, certain ways of thinking about the sport consumer have become dominant over others. In pursuit of these aims, an alternate narrative of sport management research is proposed, one that recounts the historical conditions that have advanced the field towards “tautological inefficaciousness” (Newman, 2014, p. 607). Throughout this work, I demonstrate how a sport consumer knowledge culture has rendered sport engagements and identities in ways that bolster market-based approaches to how “sport” and “management” are theorized and practiced.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This thesis is to identify the underlying structures of multivariate time series and propose a methodology to construct predictive VAR models. Due to the complexity of high dimensions in multivariate time series, forecasting a target series with many predictors in VAR models poses a challenge in statistical learning and modeling. The quadratically increasing dimension of parameter space, which is known as “curse of dimensionality” poses considerable challenges to multivariate time series models. Meanwhile, there are two facts involved in reducing dimensions in multivariate time series: first, some nuisance time series exist and better to be removed, second a target time series is typically driven by few dependent elements constructed from some indices.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To address these challenge and facts, our approach is to reduce both the dimensions of the series and the features involved in each series simultaneously. As a result, the original high dimensional structure can be modeled using a lower dimensional time series, and subsequently the forecasting performance will be improved. The methodology we introduced in this work is called Sparse Feature and Element Selection (SFES). It employs a “L1 + group L1” penalty to conduct group selection and variable selection within each group simultaneously.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Our contributions in this thesis are two-folds. First, the doubly-constrained regularization in SFES is a convex mathematical problem, and we optimize it using a fast but simple-to-implement algorithm. We evaluate this algorithm with a large-scale dataset and theoretically prove that it has guaranteed strict iterative convergence and global optimality. Second, we theoretically present non-asymptotic results based on combined statistical and computational analysis. A sharp oracle inequality is proved to reveal its power in predictive learning.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We compare SFES with the related work of Sparse Group Lasso (SGL) to show that the proposed method is both computationally efficient and theoretically justified. Experiments using simulation data and real-world macroeconomic time series data are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed SFES in practice.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The orthogonal space tempering (OST) scheme is a robust and high-order generalized ensemble sampling method that can make sampling in MD simulation much more efficiently and recover the desired thermodynamic properties of interest in complex biophysical protein behaviors. The OST technique provides a powerful tool to study the protein dynamics and mechanistic details of biophysical and biochemical processes that are difficult to be realized by experimental techniques. Here the orthogonal space tempering technique is applied to explore protein dynamics and interactions of actin monomer and TrmD methyltransferase. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The first system studied is nucleotide dependent dynamics of actin monomer. Nucleotide-dependent dynamics transition of actin has been studied for a decade. However, those models proposed were based on crystal structures of monomer actin that are typically modified with mutation or complexed with blocking agents to prevent polymerization, and thus subject to alteration. Additionally, typically experimental techniques cannot observe the mechanistic transition in a time-dependent manner. Here dynamics of monomer actin with different states of bound nucleotide—ATP, ADP, and apo form of actin—are investigated. Corresponding conformations and nucleotide binding cleft width-dependent free-energy profiles are calculated via all-atom simulations based on OST scheme. Current results suggest G-actin-ATP prefers flat and closed conformation, while G-actin-ADP and G-actin-APO prefers open conformation. Folding and unfolding motion of D-loop in subdomain 2 is observed in both G-actin with ADP and ATP bound simulations. The dynamic conformations of G-actin-ATP are consistent with previous experimental results. Our simulations will provide insights for the nucleotide-dependent mechanistic transitions and native structure of G-actin with ADP bound after the free energy profiles converge.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The second system of interest is the dynamics of TrmD tRNA (m1G37) methyltransferase. m1G37 methylation prevent frameshift errors in translation and is important for bacteria growth. TrmD methyltransferase has been considered as an important drug target. Asymmetric features have been reported in TrmD catalysis and in the TrmD structure with sinefungin and tRNA bound. Yet mechanistic details of TrmD catalysis remains elusive since TrmD with AdoMet and tRNA bound ternary structure has not been resolved. Here free energy calculations based on OST scheme are performed on corresponding conformational changes with perturbation of defined AdoMet dihedral angle on both active and inactive side of TrmD dimer. The conformation of AdoMet ligands and how both sides of TrmD dimer coordinate with each other are investigated. Current results suggest the cooperativity of TrmD dimer is not through AdoMet ligands on both sides but through the positioning of catalytic residues instead.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Another Mg2+ dependent TrmD methylation simulation perturbing the distance between the target guanosine G37 and Mg2+ is performed to study the function of Mg2+ in the catalysis. It is found that G37 base moves out the catalytic binding pocket while Mg2+ approaches the carbonyl group of G37, which suggests Mg2+ is not involved in the transition state during methylation. Further, conserved Mg2+ binding motif (residue 162-179) is found in the disorder linker loop. In the simulation, Mg2+ binding motif interacts with G37 via Mg2+ and water hydrogen bonding network while G37 is moving into the binding site. Those results formulate a new hypothesis that Mg2+ and Mg2+ binding motif helps with flipping and positioning of G37 into the catalytic binding pocket. After simulations complete, converged free energy profiles will test this new hypothesis and disclose the actual mechanism of TrmD methylation catalysis.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Non-covalent molecular interactions are a ubiquitous part of molecular interaction and the driving force behind macromolecules and host-guest binding. However, a more recent non-covalent molecular interaction, the cation-π interaction, has been recognized as another fundamental force behind macromolecules and host-guest binding. Along with this cation-π interaction, anion-π interactions have been demonstrated with an electron deficient aromatic ring and various anions. Naphthalenediimide (NDI) represent a unique class of molecules that exhibit electron deficient aromatic rings suitable for anion-π interactions.  Although the anion-pi interaction has been available for some time, there has been little known about the mechanism by which this interaction occurs. Recently published anion-pi interactions, through the anion-naphthalenediimide interactions, have given insight to the mechanism by which the phenomena occurs. With this recent insight, this research attempts to apply this knowledge to two areas of chemistry, metal-organic frameworks and ion-pair recognition chemistry.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	A metal-organic framework (MOF) is a material defined by its crystallinity and is composed of a metal ion, or metal clusters, connected to a rigid organic molecule, known as the organic linker or ligand. MOFs have gathered significant attention in the recent decade due to their unique properties such as extremely high surface area, ultra-low density, and others. One of the primary uses for MOFs is for gas storage and capture. Despite the many advancements of MOFs, their synthesis still poses challenges. One such challenge is catenation (interpenetration), which is the formation of subunits of MOFs within themselves. This catenation reduces the available space within a MOF. Several ways to prevent catenation have been demonstrated by using bulky ligands or templating agents. Inspired by this work, this research demonstrates how the anion-π, using perchlorate anion and NDI, can be used to direct the assembly of a two dimensional MOF without catenation. In addition, coordination complexes are prepared and give additional insight to the effects of solvents on coordination of ligands to metal. At the same time, more insight is gained from these coordination complexes and the interaction between the complex and anion. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	After displaying how the anion-NDI interaction can be applied to prevent the catenation of MOFs, this research investigates complex NDI ligands for the assembly of complex MOFs. MOFs have expanded into many other areas of chemistry and are no longer thought about for simple gas storage. Drug delivery, catalyst, sensors, and many other areas of chemistry are beginning to utilize MOFs. However, if these areas are to successfully apply MOFs, a simple MOF with little or no complex functionality will not work. Therefore, MOFs displaying complex functionality are needed. With complex MOFs in mind, this research set out to build MOFs displaying complex functionality, for sensing, redox potential, and other applications yet to be discovered. To impart complex functionality upon a MOF, one can use a complex ligand, metal ion, or insert materials into the MOFs. Here, research focus is on the synthesis of complex NDI ligands, by adding functionality to the core of the NDI, which then imparts complex functionality on the MOF or can help with retention of ions so that the MOF can possess functionality, such as a redox potential. This part of the research began with the synthesis bromine core-substitution of NDIs that allow for post-synthetic modification (PSM) of bromo-core-substituted MOFs with a variety of nucleophiles, thereby allowing access to a large variety of complex NDI based MOFs. This work is followed by the synthesis of the complex NDI ligand by functionalizing the core of the NDI with ethoxy functionality.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Although the NDI is identified as viable candidate for the assembly of complex MOFs, another building block, tetrathiafulvalene (TTF), is also identified. TTF is a unique molecule with exceptional redox ability and is often employed as a building block in many supramolecular systems. In the attempt to address complex MOFs, the synthesis of ligands containing the TTF core is demonstrated and future work will allow for assembly of TTF ligand containing MOFs.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Lastly, this research shifts direction back to the anion-NDI interaction in an attempt to apply the interaction to the area of chemistry known as ion-pair recognition. Due to the ubiquitous nature of ionic species in chemistry, biochemistry processes, and in the environment, capturing these ions has gained much attention from the chemistry community. Traditional means of capturing these ionic species involves capturing either the cation or the anion. However, a more recent strategy has been to capture both ionic species at once, using a heteroditopic receptor. The traditional heteroditopic receptor relies on well-known non-covalent interactions for capture. This research attempts to introduce the anion-π interaction, using naphthalenediimide, for the cooperative binding of both ionic species, in which the anion is captured through the anion-π interaction. In addition to cooperative binding using the anion-π interaction, recycling of the receptor is another aspect of this research, which is often an aspect ignored by the field due to the high energy barrier required to overcome. Currently, this research presents successful synthesis of heteroditopic receptors with indication of cooperative binding of both ionic species using the anion-π interaction.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The aim of this dissertation is to fill in the vacant spots in the innovation and diffusion study, which are meaningful but have not had much work done previously. First, most policy diffusion studies have focused on the adoption of a new policy. However, the diffusion of the repeal of an old policy also occurs across organizations and governments. Thus, the first essay in this dissertation, diffusion of the repeal of a state prevailing wage law, contributes to enrich the theoretical development of policy innovation and diffusion from a different angle, and help us learn more about why governments terminate established policies. The economists have provided economic justifications about why state prevailing wage law should be upheld or abolished depending on their stances. However, the empirical result shows that economic justification is not the most persuasive reason. In other words, other factors are also influential in the repeal of prevailing wage law: regional diffusion, political ideology, union power, socio-economic conditions, minimum wage law and so on. This result accords with the arguments of previous policy termination literatures (Cameron, 1977; Deleon, 1987)  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Second, policy innovation and diffusion studies have not seriously considered the role of the judicial branch as one of the important actors in the process of public policy until now, even though it is one of three branches of a modern democratic government. In this dissertation, a systematic examination regarding this issue is attempted to see what impact court rulings have on the diffusion of state adoption of a same sex marriage ban. The result shows that the backlash of gay-friendly court rulings, state public opinion favorable to same sex marriage, Federal DOMA, and supportive institutions for homosexuals in a state are influential factors when a state introduces the first same sex marriage ban regardless of state DOMAs and constitutional amendments. Furthermore, we also find that the backlash of judicial decisions does not always occur by additional multi-state analysis. More specifically, the influence of gay-friendly court rulings has changed from negative to positive in the transition from state Defense of Marriage Acts to state constitutional amendments against same sex marriage. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Third, more effort is needed to reflect the innovative characteristics of policy decision-makers on policy decision making under the theoretical framework of innovation and diffusion studies. The original question of policy innovation and diffusion was about whether a state’s policy innovativeness was a general trait of the policy decision-makers (Walker, 1969). However, policy innovation and diffusion studies have, since the early 1970’s, generally focused on a specific policy over time (with several exceptions, such as Boushey, 2010; Boehmke and Skinner, 2012; Nicholson-Crotty, Sean C., et al., 2014). Thus, the third essay of this dissertation attempts to show how state innovativeness works over multiple adoptions in a specific policy arena: alcohol impaired driving policies. We find that all of the aspects of state innovativeness – general, traffic safety, and organizational - increase the likelihood a state adopts alcohol impaired driving laws more comprehensively. Also, the institutional bandwagon is founded as one of the important factors to increase the comprehensiveness of state adoptions of drunk driving policies.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Liraglutide, a Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, is used as a treatment for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and obesity because it improves glycemia and decreases food intake. Here, we tested whether chronic activation of the GLP-1 receptor system with liraglutide would induce decreases in intake accompanied by changes in proportional food or macronutrient intake similar to those seen following RYGB in rats when a variety of palatable food options are available.  A “cafeteria diet” was used that included: chow, refried beans (low-fat/low-sugar), low-fat yogurt (low-fat/high-sugar), peanut butter (high-fat/low-sugar) and sugar-fat whip (high-fat/high-sugar). Liraglutide (1 mg/kg daily, sc, n=6) induced significant reductions in body weight and total caloric intake compared to saline–injected control rats (n=6). Although access to a cafeteria diet induced increases in caloric intake in both groups relative to chow alone, liraglutide still effectively decreased intake compared with saline-injected rats suggesting that chronic GLP-1 activation competes with the energy density and palatability of available food options in modulating ingestive behavior. Even with the substantial effects on overall intake, liraglutide did not change food choice or relative macronutrient intake when compared to pre-treatment baseline. When drug treatment was discontinued, the liraglutide group increased caloric intake and rapidly gained body weight to match that of the saline group. These results demonstrate that, while liraglutide effectively decreases caloric intake and body weight in rats, it does not cause adjustments in relative macronutrient consumption, suggesting that such changes seen after RYGB are unlikely due to activation of the GLP-1 receptor system alone.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The innovation and accessibility of Internet across the globe has made life easy. For instance, enormous information in the form of digital data (images, audios, videos, pdf, etc.) is available on Internet, which can easily be accessed and used from anywhere. Likewise, people across the world can share information (that may be sensitive or confidential in some cases) via email or through cloud services like Dropbox™ or Google Drive. However, the convenience provided by the Internet has a major drawback. The privately owned data available online, once accessed and downloaded, can be redistributed after making pirated copies. For the end user both original and copied data look alike. This results in a form of copyright violation and causes enormous economic loss to various distributing industries each year. To deal with copyright violation and claiming ownership, digital watermarking is proposed as prominent solution. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In digital image watermarking, some specific information called a watermark is concealed in digital image known as host image in an imperceptible way, and the resulting image is called a watermarked image. A watermarking scheme is considered good if can meet four requirements at the same time. Firstly, the watermark must be embedded in such a way that human eye cannot distinguish between original and watermarked image. Secondly, the watermarking scheme must be robust enough to extract identifiable watermark from an attacked watermarked image. An unauthorized user can apply spatial or geometric attacks on watermarked images to distort the concealed information. Thirdly, only the intended user should be able to extract the watermark. Finally, a watermarking scheme which allows more information to be embedded without degrading the visual quality of watermarked image is desirable. In addition to these four requirements, there are other challenges in the field of digital watermarking. For instance, the watermarking scheme proposed for gray scale host image cannot directly be used for color host image. Similarly, a watermarking scheme which uses gray scale watermark cannot be applied to binary or color watermarks. Moreover, watermarking schemes presented for color host images have to face additional challenges as compared to gray scale watermarking techniques because the three channels red, green and blue of a color image are highly correlated; modifying any one of them distorts the other as a result quality of image is degraded. The existing watermarking techniques fail to meet all the requirements at the same time.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this dissertation, four new watermarking schemes are proposed which can meet the four requirements mentioned above. Scheme 1 proposes the solution for gray scale host images using gray scale watermark, scheme 2 and scheme 3 provide solution for color host images by utilizing binary watermarks. Though both scheme 2 and scheme 3 provide solution for color host images using binary watermark, however their approach is different. For instance, scheme 2 proposes spatial domain watermarking, whereas, scheme 3 presents frequency domain watermarking. Finally, scheme 4 provides solution for color host images using color watermark.   </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A number of experiments were conducted to examine the performance of proposed schemes. For this purpose different types of images were utilized as host images and watermarks. The performance of proposed schemes is evaluated in terms of imperceptibility, robustness, security and capacity. In order to evaluate imperceptibility subjectively, both original and watermarked images are shown, where, user can see the similarity and differences between the two. Peak-signal-to-noise ratio is also utilized to evaluate the imperceptibility of proposed schemes. To check the robustness of proposed schemes, different types of attacks were applied on watermarked images. Afterwards, watermarks extracted from attacked watermarked images are evaluated subjectively by examining the quality of extracted watermarks visually, and objectively using normalized correlation. Moreover, security of proposed watermarking schemes is tested by extracting watermarks using numerous fake secrete keys.  Finally, capacity is measured by calculating the number of bits that can be embedded without degrading the perceptual quality of watermarked images. Additionally, the proposed schemes are compared with state-of-the-art techniques in terms of all requirements. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The dissertation is composed of six chapters. Chapter 1 is introductory, discusses different types of watermarking, their applications, advantages, disadvantages, challenges and requirements. Chapter 2 examines the existing watermarking techniques. Chapter 3 consists of two parts. Part one discusses the weaknesses of present watermarking techniques, and the second part demonstrates how four requirements can be met at the same time. The proposed watermarking schemes for different cases are discussed in Chapter 4. The results, comparison of proposed schemes with state-of-the-art watermarking techniques, and conclusion are drawn in Chapter 5. Finally, the summary, contribution, limitations and future work is discussed in Chapter 6.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to explore how medical and nursing students are exposed to information about music therapy during their training. This study also sought to explore the relationship between student exposure to music therapy and their knowledge about the role of music therapy in the healthcare setting. An adapted survey was designed to meet the needs of the sample population (N=204) which consisted of 6 demographic questions inquiring about participants age, area of study, years or months of study in that area, exposure to music therapy, and years or months of total clinical experience. Twenty-five yes or no questions were asked to determine if participants understood the specific role of music therapists in the medical setting. Responses were separated by participants’ exposure to music therapy (i.e., no exposure, educational exposure, and clinical exposure), and frequency tables were created to highlight relationships between participants’ response and types of exposure. Results indicated that the majority of participants answered over half of the questions in accordance with the appropriate role of a music therapist. Although the majority of the results did not indicate considerable differences in participants’ responses based on types of exposure, there were noticeable differences regarding the role of music therapists amongst exposure groups in terms of entertainment as a goal, music therapists’ role in the health care team, and music therapists’ participation in physical care and preparation/orientation. More research is needed to determine how to best educate health care professionals about the role of music therapy in the medical setting.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The educational system in India is ready for a revamp and community colleges have been identified by policy makers as a vehicle for that change. Although they have existed since the 1990’s, the urgent focus of the Indian government in providing skills to its burgeoning youth population has resulted in a number of community colleges being granted permission to begin functioning as part of existing universities, colleges and polytechnics. The government has special interest in U.S. community college models for its features like open access and industrial partnerships. However, it is not clear whether implementers faced with running the new community colleges have a clear understanding of the borrowed model or whether they are adequately supported. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The literature review indicated that global movements of policy borrowing can be manifested in the adoption of foreign educational models. The literature on policy borrowing offered some popular models with which to interpret these national processes (Phillips &amp; Ochs, 2004; Steiner-Khamsi, 2014). However, they do not seem to account for decision making processes at the strategic actors’ or stakeholder’s level. For now, what is apparent is the stance of the implementer after the decision has been made. Problems with this conception would be that decision - making appears to be rigid, linear, one- time processes. It also ignores the aspect of learning that implementers may find inherent in policy adaptation to suit the contexts. It appears that the current theoretical frameworks overlook the black box of decision making which influence an implementer to manifest resistance, non-decision or support. They suggest that internalization or indigenization are distinct processes removed from implementation (Phillips and Ochs, 2004; Steiner- Khamsi, 2014).  Also, implementers of the policy may experience recontextualizing simultaneously with decisions on the suitability of a feature in the borrowed model. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The literature also seems to overlook nuances in decision making that may result in changing stances. Experts have suggested that globalization trends can help understand how context affects development of the global educational policies (Robertson, 2012; Verger et al 2012). This study adds to the literature on community college development in India with a specific focus on how individual implementers approached translating a foreign educational model, and broadly adds to the literature on policy borrowing in education. The variations in the thought processes of implementers from India looking at community college models in the U.S. were studied using phenomenographical methods. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The study involved 13 participants from all over India yielded five categories of description namely; ‘Conceptualizing community colleges’, ‘Assimilation of the new ideas afforded by the learning opportunity in the U.S’, ‘Discerning similarity or difference in the home country and target country’, ‘Identifying obstacles or constraints in implementation’ and  ‘Finding solutions for implementation of selected ideas’. These findings indicate that 1. Community colleges are still a very fluid notion 2. New ideas are selectively filtered 3. Context plays a great role in determining what is perceived as constraints of implementation and 4. perhaps the most important finding, that stances assumed by participants can change when faced with new insights or through collaboration with peers. Decision (or non-decision) does not appear to be constant. This finding is significant because it would prevent non - decision or rejection of policy that is not properly understood. The study also revealed immense differences in context where the community college scheme is being implemented in India. As such this study provides insights for policy makers to avoid making one size fits all guidelines for implementation.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Instructional design and technology (IDT) professionals work in various environments with numerous job roles. Despite differences in work settings and job functions, there are many well-documented competency standards for all IDT professionals. This study analyzed approximately 400 job announcements and 20 interviews with ID project managers. The purpose of the study was to determine instructional designers’ competency requirements from employers’ prospective in hope to align their needs with the IDT academic programs to prepare the future instructional designers. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Content analysis was used to analyze the job announcements and interviews. Frequencies of competencies in both job announcements and interviews were calculated in this study. The study listed the top 25 most required competencies from job announcements and the top 25 most desired competencies from interviews. The results were clustered into five competency categories: instructional design, instructional technology, communication, management, and other foundational competencies. This current study also listed the different competency requirements for hiring instructional designers in four different industry sectors. In addition, the current study indicated that both entry-level and experienced designers should have skills in the five major competency categories, but experienced instructional designers are required to have higher proficiency, especially in the management and communication and interpersonal categories.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This dissertation seeks to understand physical processes in submerged and dry caves in Florida. First, for submerged caves, we prove the possibility of an upward saline water intrusion due to the Venturi effect occurring in a submerged cave's restrictions, i.e. narrow connections between two otherwise large tunnels. A model is developed to obtain an analytical solution for estimating the saltwater discharge through caves into freshwater aquifers. Additionally, Florida springs are examined, and the saltwater discharges due to the Venturi effect are calculated to be between 0.02 to 0.23 m3/s, which is significant especially for the springs with a mean annual freshwater discharge of less than 10 m3/s.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Second, in an effort to develop a deeper understanding of dry caves, the microclimate of the so-called Dragon's Tooth Cave is examined. The ventilation patterns are analyzed by using in-situ measurements of temperature, CO2, and Radon-222. Estimated cave air renewal times vary from 2.4 days at the Entrance room to 6.6 days at the Dragon's Belly room. Next, a theoretical model is developed that uses outside temperatures to predict ventilation rates. Combined with simple first-order CO2 and Radon-222 mass balances, the model predicts net CO2 and Radon-222 concentrations in the cave, and shows an excellent agreement with the measurements.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Since the welfare reform in 1996, Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) research has been centered on the debate with respect to whether states given more independence to make their own choices after 1996, have engaged in a competitive “race to the bottom” to reduce benefits for needy people. Despite the mixed empirical findings, the race to the bottom (RTB) debate in TANF is still a popular subject due to the states’ adoption of more severe sanctions, more stringent eligibility, and the overall decline in TANF caseloads. While discussing the race to the bottom in TANF, little attention was given to the impact of the Deficit Reduction Act (DRA) of 2005, which caused significant changes in policy related to implementing TANF.  Studies have not been undertaken to determine how states responded to the DRA, not only to meet the tougher requirements but also to serve an increasing number of needy people who were the least likely to be assisted through TANF, were it not for states’ strategic plans (e.g., creating solely state funded programs and creating/extending worker supplement programs). This study seeks to test the impact of states’ policy responses to the DRA on the TANF work participation rates, an official performance indicator of TANF.  In order to empirically test this, a multivariate model is introduced to reveal the differences in TANF performances between states that actively responded to the DRA by adopting programs for more lenient coverage (i.e., worker supplement programs and solely state funded programs) and implementing severe sanctions for noncompliance with work requirements, and those that did not. The dataset is a balanced panel, consisting of fifty states over a 7-year period (2007-2013). The test results show that states implementing worker supplement programs achieve higher TANF performance than states without them. Also, we find that sanction effects may be much larger than we have known given that states sanctioning entire families and/or imposing harsh disqualification on SNAP for failure to comply with TANF work requirements are more likely to show higher performance in TANF work participation rates. Unlike our expectation, states’ generous stance in welfare programs does not affect achieving higher TANF performance.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In recent years, the legalization of medical marijuana in states has been a controversial topic. Despite conflicting with the federal government ban on marijuana use, 28 states and D.C have legalized medical marijuana by the year 2016 and other states are currently considering adopting the law every year. Why do some states adopt medical marijuana laws and others do not? This study lays out an approach that explains what and how the predictors of the adoption of medical marijuana laws affect legalizing medical marijuana in a state, using a mixed methods approach. In the quantitative research, this study examines the diffusion of medical marijuana laws by analyzing policy adoption from a morality and economic development perspective through three policy typologies such as morality policy, economic policy and multidimensional policy. For the qualitative research, this study uses short case studies of three states (California, Colorado, and Illinois) based on news reports to draw out the politics surrounding the issues and reasons why the policies were adopted. This study finds that the morality policy characteristics as policy diffusion factors -- religious groups, citizens’ liberal ideology, and a ballot initiative process -- have a significant effect on the adoption of a medical marijuana law. Economic indicators -- fiscal capacity growth, incarceration, and cost of justice system -- also have a significant effect on the adoption. As internal characteristics, a major proponent group (number of marijuana users) and state regulatory environment (mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses and the size of the regulatory bureaucracy) are important predictors of diffusion.  Overall, this study shows that the diffusion of a medical marijuana law is mainly determined by the citizens’ opinion rather than elected officials’ political ideology or government ‘s fiscal health conditions. Also, we demonstrated that a multidimensional policy model provides a superior explanation for predicting when a state will adopt medical marijuana policy; policy typologies are still a useful framework for clarifying and understanding characteristics of each policy type and its unique politics pattern. These findings contribute to the literature of diffusion, and they have important implications for the diffusion of multidimensional policies that transcend classical typological boundaries. Moreover, in terms of practical implication, this study provides policy makers and American civil society useful information about which factors impact medical marijuana adoption and why.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>“How Do Public Policy Processes Influence Public Fiscal Choices, Tax Politics, and Policy Outcomes?” In order to answer this primary research question, this dissertation investigated the major tax policy issues including TIEAs at the Global level, TELs, and sin tax at the State level. It is based on the motivation that the previous literature showed weak linkages between theories of the policy process and taxation. In addition, since tax policies are highly associated with the policy process, linking policy process to tax policies is essential for future scholarly development. Further, it is will promote understanding dynamics of policy process associated with tax policies in the American states and countries. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>“Dynamics in Transnational Coalitions for Tax Justice” intends to link coalition theory and TIEAs by applying 2-mode network analysis using country level data from 2000 to 2012. According to analysis, major national coalitions shown in TIEAs are evolved from the U.S. British’s Crown Dependencies, Australia, Nordic countries, and Asia and South America. It is highly associated with the pressure from powerful nations and national alliance, terrorism and global financial crisis. In addition, international relations reflect both realism and idealism. Realism reflects the pressure from the U.S. UK and G20 whereas realism involves the coalition formed by Nordic countries actively participate TIEAs to cope with tax havens. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>“Comprehensive Process of Policy Adoption: Tax and Expenditure Limitations (TELs) Agenda Setting and Decision Making” intends to link diffusion framework and policy stage model to tax policies but also comparative politics that how states act on each stage of policy process by applying event history analysis (EHA) using state data from 1970 to 2006.  According to analysis, this study shows that (1) having a direct democracy initiative continuously affects the adoption process of TELs; (2) states will imitate other similar states’ TELs based on size(expenditure) during the agenda setting process; and (3) defeated TELs is induced by anticipatory competition that states behave strategically, and successful passage of TELs are driven by direct democracy, and professionalized legislature rather than regional diffusion factors.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para> “Why do State Governments Rely on Sin Tax?” intends to integrate the typology of mortality politics and rational choice theory to explain determinants for sin tax reliance across states by applying panel data analysis using state data from 1980 to 2015. According to analysis, this study demonstrates that overall sin tax reliance is mainly determined by industrial (economic) and religious forces interaction with political institutions, wealth maximization of state governments, and first reveals the moderating role of political institutions (forces) in incorporating interests as well as incrementalism of state sin tax reliance Both morality politics and rational choice theory adopted in this study better explains the determinants of sin tax reliance across states. Sin tax dependence across states can be seen as political game along with incrementalism rather than paternalism or promoting welfare for citizens.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para> 	 Overall, this dissertation demonstrates that policy process is highly associated with Global and state tax policy. This dissertation proved that tax policy is a political process that it is directly related to “who gets what”, meaning that taxation cannot be detached from political environment. In addition, this dissertation contributes to the scholarship on comparative and global politics, taxation and network by applying policy process theory on taxation. In addition, this dissertation contributes to integrating policy stage model and diffusion framework, morality politics and rational choice theory, and offers the new insights associated with network dynamics. Practically, three papers will provide information regarding each country seeking to make international agreements and maintain its relationship overtime. For state governments, findings from this study also have implications for state governments that intend to adopt tax related policies, and seek to raise revenue or reduce detrimental behaviors as a policy objective.  Future research is recommended to analyze dynamics of coalitions in other policy areas. In addition, it is recommended that integrate policy stage model, diffusion framework in other policy areas, and integrate morality politics and rational choice theory as well as analyze cross effects between sin tax elements.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The movement of precipitation around the Earth has an integral impact on fresh water availability, vegetation, and the occurrence of natural disasters, and therefore human society at large. In the African Sahel, the rainfall is the limiting factor in agriculture and the most variable characteristic of climate both spatially and temporally. In light of recent famine concerns, research on rainfall variability in the Sahel is critical as well as timely. A review of climate and environmental literature provided a perspective and a set of methodologies upon which the research could build. This research emphasizes the role of the regional and global atmospheric circulation in governing the variability of Sahel rainfall. It examines the changing spatiotemporal characteristics of the rainfall regime in the context of the Tropical Easterly Jet (TEJ), the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), and the Tibetan High. Historical data was obtained from the African rain gauge network, NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis 1, and HadISST version 1.1. The results of this study show that the relationship between the TEJ and Sahel rainfall is a casual one, with a stronger TEJ enhancing upper-level divergence to promote broader, more intense vertical ascent. It also showed that diagnostic variables relevant to the general circulation, such as the maximum ascent within the rainbelt, the northward displacement of the AEJ, and the advection of precipitable water over the Sahel have a robust positive relationship with the Sahel rainfall anomaly due to the influence of the TEJ. The results also determined that a significant relationship exists in terms of the high-frequency interannual variability between negative ENSO events and the strengthening of the TEJ, which would similarly lead to anomalously wet years in the Sahel during a negative ENSO anomaly.  This study posits a new framework for understanding rainfall variability in the Sahel due to its focus on the impacts of the atmospheric circulation. Furthermore, it can have important applications to understanding and forecasting droughts and floods in the Sahel, improve the modeling of Sahel climate, and provide a basis for further study of how West Africa and the TEJ fit into the global picture.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Meta-analytic techniques have gained great attention in educational, social and behavioral sciences to synthesize and summarize related study results. Most common tradition is to use primary studies with similar designs (correlational or experimental) in order to draw conclusions for a specific topic.  Sometimes different set of studies – experimental and correlational – are available to researchers focus on similar outcomes. Until now, methods to synthesize the results of studies coming from such different designs have not been introduced.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study was conducted to present a proper meta-analytic technique to include both continuous and treatment predictors in a regression model, and to investigate the accuracy of the parameter estimates when assuming different interdependency conditions among the predictors. Moreover, it was important to address the issue of missing information about predictor intercorrelations. Two- and three-predictor models were examined under the fixed-effects models. The simulation study results in this dissertation showed that syntheses of treatment and correlational studies differ when predictors are assumed to be dependent or independent and meta-analysts should consider modeling the possible dependency when synthesizing primary study results.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Background: Skeletal muscle is highly responsive to exercise training stresses, resulting in specific performance improvements based on the type of training undertaken (66, 119). Among all the variations of exercise training there are two extremes: 1) resistance training (RT), and 2) aerobic training (AT) Concurrent training (CT) is the combination AT and RT. This combination has been shown to have positive effects on body composition through decreases in fat mass (93, 136, 181, 463) and aerobic performance (28, 56, 154, 194, 394, 421, 463). Despite these positive outcomes, there have been multiple works suggesting the  suggests that the combination of these two training modalities hinders increases in strength (28, 181, 223, 420) and power (154, 420) performance and lean mass (223, 238, 404, 420). Notably, CT composed of high intensity interval training (HIIT) and RT has been shown to positively affect aerobic performance without negatively affecting strength performance in recreationally active men (56, 433, 472) and women (433). Interestingly, rhodiola rosea (RR) (34, 102, 371) and cordyceps sinensis (CS) (61) may have potential to enhance performance.  Purpose: To determine the effects of CT, composed of HIIT and RT, and Shroom Tech sport (SUP), a multi-ingredient performance supplement (MIPS) containing RR and CS, on body composition, aerobic and strength performance, cardiometabolic profiles, and hormone concentrations in young recreationally active men. Methods: Recreationally active male volunteers were stratified and matched by age, total strength, relative VO2max, percent body fat, and training years; then assigned to take SUP (n=10) or a placebo (PLA) (n=11). Participants completed a 12-week CT program (4 days per week; 2 days: total body RT; 2 days: HIIT). Supplements (1 capsule (2,378mg) per 23kg) were consumed 45 minutes before each training and testing sessions and at breakfast on non-training days. Body composition, blood draws, and strength, power and aerobic performance were tested at week 0, 7, and 14. Additionally, subjects completed three-day food logs for dietary intake. Data were reported as mean ± SD. Dependent variables were assessed by two-way (group x time) analysis of variance (ANOVA). Significance was accepted at p&lt;0.05. Results: There were no differences between groups in any of the participant characteristics. There were no significant differences in body mass index, fat free mass or percent fat free mass. However, there was a significant effect for time for percent body fat, with both groups exhibiting decreases (SUP: pre 15.5 ± 5.8% v mid 14.8 ± 7.2% v post 14.2 ± 6.6%; PLA: pre 16.2 ± 6.7% v mid 15.3 ± 6.5%  v post 14.3 ± 6.4%, p=0.0065), with no significant differences between groups. Further, there were main group (p= 0.042) and time (p=0.016) effects for fat mass but no group x time interactions (SUP: pre 11.92 ± 5.28kg v mid 11.51 ± 6.22kg v post 11.10 ± 6.96 kg; PLA: pre 12.83 ± 6.55kg v mid 12.23 ± 6.61kg v post 11.32 ± 6.49kg). There were no significant differences in body segment circumferences or lean mass index (LMI). There were no changes in VO2max. Both groups improved bench (SUP: 2.6±3.0%; PLA: 5.4±5.2%) and squat (SUP: 7.2±6.6%; PLA: 8.8±5.4%) strength. There was a main effect for time in (p=0.007) and average power (p=0.004) increased over time regardless of group. Notably, significant differences were observed between groups in average bench (SUP: 28±1reps v PLA: 25±3, p&lt;0.05) and total (bench + squat) (SUP: 61±4reps v PLA: 57±4, p&lt;0.05) training volumes at “moderate” (72.5-77.5%) intensities. Further, SUP also attenuated decreases in average running volume at 100% calculated max speed (CMS) when compared to those at 90% CMS versus PLA (SUP:-41±83secs v PLA:-135±118, p&lt;0.05). There were no group x time interactions in any of the hormone concentrations. Interestingly, SUP did exhibit significant decreases in cortisol levels (pre: 17.6 ± 4.6ug/dl v post: 16.6 ± 4.3ug/dl, p=0.34). There were time effects for systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, LDL, and HDL, with decreases in total cholesterol (SUP: Pre: 152 ± 22mg/dL to Mid: 142 ± 23mg/dl to Post: 147 ± 23mg/dl v PLA: Pre: 154 ± 29mg/dl to Mid: 142 ± 22mg/dl to Post: 143 ± 22mg/dl; p=0.009), LDL (SUP: Pre: 83 ± 26mg/dL to Mid: 74 ± 14mg/dl to Post: 80 ± 26mg/dl v PLA: Pre: 82 ± 24mg/dl to Mid: 70 ± 13mg/dl to Post: 76 ± 18mg/dl; p=0.047) and HDL (SUP: Pre: 48 ± 11mg/dL to Mid: 45 ± 10mg/dl to Post: 44 ± 7mg/dl v PLA: Pre: 60 ± 12mg/dl to Mid: 55 ± 12mg/dl to Post: 54 ± 10mg/dl; p=0.013). Conclusion: Supplementation with SUP 45 minutes prior to exercise enhanced moderate intensity resistance exercise performance and max intensity HIIT performance in recreationally trained men. Additionally, 12 weeks of CT protocol consisting of progressive RT and HIIT improved strength and power performance while decreasing fat mass, however there were no differences between groups. Therefore, use of 2,378mg per 23kg SUP for 12 weeks may be beneficial for recreationally active men.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Isang Yun (1917-1995) and Toshio Hosokawa (b. 1955) are East Asian composers with European musical backgrounds. Yun, a Korean born composer, and Hosokawa, a Japanese born composer, were in a healthy, mentor-student relationship when Hosokawa studied with Yun at Der Hochschule der Künste. They were interested in the traditional court music of each of their motherlands, Korea and Japan. They explored the infusion of that genre with elements of German avant- garde music. Their attempts successfully fascinated European people and they developed great reputations as composers in Europe.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The purpose of this treatise is to offer an analysis and comparison of their piano trios, Trio für Violine, Violoncello und Klavier (1972/75) by Isang Yun and Memory (In Memory of Isang Yun) for violin, violoncello and piano (1996) by Toshio Hosokawa. It is hoped that performers who read this treatise will have a better understanding of the compositional methods and styles found in their music, and perform with fine nuance and a deeper commitment. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	This treatise provides a biographical sketch of Isang Yun, characteristics of Yun’s compositional style, and characteristics of Korean court music in Chapter 1. A biography of Toshio Hosokawa, the characteristics of his compositional style, and characteristics of Japanese court music are presented in Chapter 2. In Chapter 3, the researcher offers an analysis of the two piano trios. Lastly, a brief comparison of the two pieces and a summary are presented in the conclusion.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In aqueous solution, solute conformational transitions are governed by intimate interplays of the fluctuations of solute–solute, solute–water, and water–water interactions. To more effectively sample conformational transitions in aqueous solution, we devised a predictive sampling method: the generalized orthogonal space tempering (gOST) algorithm. Specifically, in the Hamiltonian perturbation part, a solvent-accessible-surface-area-dependent term is introduced to implicitly perturb near-solute water–water fluctuations; more importantly in the orthogonal space response part, the generalized force order parameter is generalized as a two-dimension order parameter set, in which essential solute–solvent and solute–solute components are separately treated. The gOST algorithm is evaluated through a molecular dynamics simulation study on the explicitly solvated deca-alanine peptide. On the basis of a fully automated sampling protocol, the gOST simulation enabled repetitive folding and unfolding of the solvated peptide within a single continuous trajectory and allowed for detailed constructions of deca-alanine folding/unfolding free energy surfaces. In addition, by employing the gOST method we enabled efficient molecular dynamics simulation of repetitive breaking and reforming of salt bridge structures within a minimalist salt-bridge model, the Asp-Arg dipeptide and thereby were able to map its detailed free energy landscape in aqueous solution. Our results reveal the critical role of local solvent structures in modulating salt-bridge partner interactions and imply the importance of water fluctuations on conformational dynamics that involves solvent accessible salt bridge formations.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Based on the gOST method, we have developed a solvation force orthogonal space tempering (SFOST) algorithm, in which several major changes were made from the original gOST method. Due to compensating fluctuations of essential solute-solvent and solute-solute interactions, only essential solute-solvent interactions are perturbed in the SFOST algorithm. Importantly, the above treatment enabled us to incorporate a high order orthogonal space sampling strategy. Specifically, to enlarge fluctuations of essential solute-solvent interactions, a third order treatment was introduced to accelerate the coupled responses caused by fluctuations of essential solute-solvent interactions, which come from synchronous fluctuations of essential solute-solute interactions and solvent-solvent interactions. The SFOST algorithm was evaluated through a molecular dynamics simulation study on the explicitly solvated deca-alanine peptide. More importantly, the SFOST simulation explicitly revealed the compensating fluctuations between the essential solute-solvent interactions and the solvent-solvent interactions, suggesting that solvent cooperative fluctuations intimately interplay with deca-alanine conformational transitions. In addition, the SFOST algorithm was also employed to study ion conduction through gramicidin A (gA). By enlarging fluctuations of the ion-environment interactions, the SFOST simulation enabled several round trips of ion permeation through the channel and allowed detailed construction of free energy surfaces along the conduction. The calculated observables agree very well with experiment. We also found that fluctuations of channel orientations play an essential role in ion conduction. Furthermore, by employing the SFOST algorithm we enabled predictive sampling of the conformational ensemble of the p53 transcriptional activation domain 1 (TAD1). Strikingly, a helical structure resembling the MDM2-bound form was found in our SFOST simulation, indicating the pre-existing nature of the structure. Detailed studies of free energy surfaces revealed that the most popular state is not a fully disordered form but a partially helical state. Upon binding to MDM2, the hydrophobic interactions at the interface shift the conformational equilibrium to favor the total helical structure. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In addition to the predictive sampling methods, we developed a Gaussian kernel Monte Carlo (GKMC) method to smoothly approximate multidimensional free energy surfaces of biomolecular processes. By taking a discrete probability distribution of sampled collective variables as an input, a biased Monte Carlo simulation is performed to efficiently resample the distribution in the collective variable space, leading to a smooth analytical estimate of the free energy surface. The GKMC method is evaluated by resampling data of a generalized orthogonal space tempering simulation of deca-alanine peptide, aiming to construct smooth one-dimensional and two-dimensional free energy surfaces along certain collective variables. As demonstrated in these model studies, the GKMC method can robustly construct smooth multidimensional free energy surfaces with super resolutions, which preserve probability distributions of target molecular processes. Constructing smooth free energy surfaces plays a vital role in interpreting simulation data to understand molecular processes of interest.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study is to promote a greater understanding of Chinese piano education in the 21st Century: why it flourishes, and the specific ways in which piano teachers, students, and parents are nurturing a generation of over 30 million Chinese pianists. In stark contrast to the bankruptcies, lockouts, and strikes that plague music institutions in the United States due to declining ticket sales, an aging audience, cuts in arts funding for public schools, and decreased interest in serious music study among the American youth, China’s current “piano-mania” continues to engage impressively large numbers of young children and parents in classical music.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study seeks to understand this phenomenon from the perspective of those most intimately acquainted with the topic: the teachers, students, and parents. Chapter 1 addresses the problem, purpose, methodology, limitations, and need for the study. Chapter 2 explains the appeal of piano study in present-day China by comparing it to the similar “piano-mania” in the United States during The Gilded Age of 1865-1901. Chapter 3 outlines the author’s lesson observations of piano students who are studying piano in various representative contexts in China, which took place in 2015: a conservatory, an affiliate arts school, and a private studio. Chapter 4 introduces the teachers, their educational backgrounds, teaching backgrounds, and teaching methodologies. Chapter 5 summarizes the strengths and weaknesses in today’s piano education in China and concludes with an evaluation of its implications for teachers and piano students in the West.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Bioecological theory suggests that development, including reading development, occurs through interactions between individuals and proximal environmental contexts (Bronfenbrenner &amp; Ceci, 2004), though neighborhood characteristics are often underrepresented within studies of proximal processes on reading outcomes. The present study sought to further knowledge of the environmental influences on reading comprehension by proposing several hypothesized risk and protective aspects of the neighborhood environment and using a novel combination of techniques to explore their association with FCAT reading.  The results of this exploration indicated that of the proposed neighborhood features, distance to shelters was the sole predictor of FCAT reading scores after accounting for family- and community-level SES.  Additionally, the present study was concerned with examining the proportion of shared environmental influences on FCAT reading which were accounted for by neighborhood characteristics.  Distance to shelters was able to explain a significant proportion of shared environmental influences in this study, marking an additional component of environmental influences on reading.  These results help to develop a more comprehensive model of the etiological influences involved in reading comprehension skills. The findings also serve to inform instructional practices and future intervention research targeted to improving reading comprehension skills.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) isolated from various adult tissues are primary candidates in cell therapy for tissue regeneration.  The pro-regenerative properties of hMSCs are largely attributed to their trophic effects by the release of factors that coordinately modulate the progression of inflammation and enhance the endogenous tissue repair by host progenitor cells.  However, immediately after isolation and upon culture expansion, hMSCs acquire and accumulate genetic and phenotypic changes that significantly alter their phenotypic properties with reduced clonogenic and therapeutic potential.  The culture-induced changes are not only correlated with reduced differentiation and proliferation but also with reduced therapeutic outcome in various disease models.  Thus, preserving hMSC therapeutic potency following in vitro expansion is an important goal in hMSC application.  Once viewed as a mere consequence of the state of a cell, metabolism is now known to play active roles in regulating cellular events that govern stem cell phenotype and functional properties.  The current study is to understand the role of energy metabolism in regulating hMSC cell fate with ultimate goals of developing metabolic strategies to augment hMSCs therapeutic outcome.  To this end, important therapeutic relevant properties of hMSCs including phenotypic heterogeneity, stemness reprogramming, and immune modulation with regards to the energy metabolism and cellular signaling networks that shape them were addressed.  Our studies show that hMSCs have heterogeneity at the level of primary energy metabolism and possess metabolic plasticity to reconfigure their metabolic network in their reacquisition of stem cell primitive properties and immune-modulatory property.  In Chapter 2, metabolomics analysis suggested that hMSC are metabolically heterogeneous and that clonogenic subpopulation of hMSCs enriched in low density culture (100 cells/cm2) possesses a metabolic phenotype that differs from that of hMSCs in high-density (3,000 cells/cm2) in their levels of glycolysis metabolism and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP).  Metabolic inhibition studies revealed that glycolysis and PPP play active roles in maintaining hMSCs clonogenicity by regulating ATP generation, maintaining cellular redox state, and scavenging exogenous reactive oxygen species.  In Chapter 3, we showed that hMSCs possess metabolic plasticity and effectively reconfigure their metabolism during 3D aggregation culture, and that this metabolic reconfiguration plays a central role in their reacquisition of primitive phenotypic properties.  Specifically, aggregate formation of hMSCs remodeled their mitochondrial network with reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, resulting in metabolic reconfiguration with reduced mitochondrial citric acid cycle (TCA cycle) activity, increased aerobic glycolysis, and anaplerotic flux.  The effects of metabolic reconfiguration on stem cell gene expression was recapitulated in the gain- and loss-of-function experiments using small molecule metabolic modulators, confirming its functional role in regulating hMSC stem cell potency.  In chapter 4, we showed that hMSC immuno-activation in response to interferon-γ (IFN-γ) treatment is associated with metabolic reconfiguration towards increased aerobic glycolysis, characterized by increased glucose consumption and upregulated gene expression of glycolysis-related enzymes.  We further demonstrated that both glucose deprivation and glycolysis inhibition were sufficient to abolish the secretion of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), a critical anti-inflammatory cytokine secreted by hMSCs, suggesting the central role of aerobic glycolysis in regulating hMSC immunomodulatory properties.  Together, the results revealed the mechanistic connection between metabolic regulation and hMSC therapeutic phenotype, and demonstrated the regulation of metabolism as a strategy in potentiating hMSCs properties for cell therapy applications.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>“‘Our Bonaparte’: Republicanism, Religion, and Paranoia in New England and the Mid-Atlantic, 1789-1830,” examines how American politicians used the idea of Napoleon Bonaparte to reflect (or distort) contemporary political issues in the New England and Mid-Atlantic areas of the United States. It shows how Napoleon became a standard piece of political imagery to either support or attack specific political beliefs and opinions during the first three decades of the nineteenth century, depending on which political faction was discussing Bonaparte at the time.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Nonlocal models differ from traditional partial differential equation (PDE) models because they contain no spatial derivatives; instead an appropriate integral is used.  Nonlocal models are especially useful in the case where there are issues calculating the spatial derivatives of a PDE model. In many applications (e.g., biological systems, flow through porous media) the observed rate of diffusion is not accurately modeled by the standard diffusion differential operator but rather exhibits so-called anomalous diffusion. Anomalous diffusion can be represented in a PDE model by using a fractional Laplacian operator in space whereas the nonlocal approach only needs to slightly modify its integral formulation to model anomalous diffusion. Anomalous diffusion is one such case where approximating the spatial derivative operator is a difficult problem.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this work, an approach for approximating standard and anomalous nonlocal diffusion problems using a new technique that utilizes radial basis functions (RBFs) is introduced and numerically tested. The typical approach for approximating nonlocal diffusion problems is to use a Galerkin formulation. However, the Galerkin formulation for nonlocal diffusion problems can often be difficult to compute efficiently and accurately especially for problems in multiple dimensions. Thus, we investigate the alternate approach of using quadrature rules generated by RBFs to approximate the nonlocal diffusion problem. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This work will be split into three major parts. The first will introduce RBFs and give some examples of how they are used. This part will motivate our approach for using RBFs on the nonlocal diffusion problem. In the second part, we will derive RBF-generated quadrature rules in one dimension and show they can be used to approximate nonlocal diffusion problems.  The final part will address how the RBF quadrature approach can be extended to higher dimensional problems. Numerical test cases are shown for both the standard and anomalous nonlocal diffusion problems and compared with standard finite element approximations. Preliminary results show that the method introduced is viable for approximating nonlocal diffusion problems and that highly accurate approximations are possible using this approach.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Prefatory Action is an unfinished work existing partially in the realm of hypothetical hearsay, and partially in the drafts of the libretto and musical sketches found after Skryabin’s death. Nearly all of the literature on this piece is cursory, or focuses only on summarizing and reiterating information from his early biographers. This dissertation undertakes an in-depth study of the libretto and sketches, presenting new research on primary sources, and positing interpretations of the work in the context of Skryabin’s theories.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The composer’s philosophies, as described in his private journals, are the product of the diligent study and fusion of studies from contemporary psychology, nineteenth-century philosophy, and Theosophy. Skryabin constructed both an ontology of the nature of consciousness and reality, and proposed strategies for transcending the limited mode of human experience through spiritual and mental unification. Prefatory Action would be both a representation of this unification, and an artistic event that would help educate the human race in order to fully realize it in the future. The Prefatory Action libretto outlines Skryabin’s version of the history of humanity - a cycle of unified, and differentiated consciousnesses - and represents the near future, in which humanity embraces death and abandons corporeal form to mingle their consciousnesses. Contrary to the typical characterization of Skryabin’s ideas, especially those concerning Prefatory Action, as wildly insane, they are actually organized into a fairly consistent and logical system, and they are deeply connected to contemporary occult culture, which would have found many sympathizers in the early twentieth century. The Prefatory Action libretto demonstrates many of the characteristics of modernism, including an emphasis on progress and the future, and the aesthetics of early twentieth-century symbolism and ritualism.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The musical sketches for Prefatory Action contain no obvious connections to the libretto, but they reveal the style of the music intended for the work. Skryabin’s strategies for atonal composition included deriving octatonic and acoustic collections by stacking intervallic patterns, and outlining and progressively developing very brief fragments of music. Small fragments of some of his late, published works appear in the Prefatory Action sketches, helping to flesh out our understanding of both the Prefatory Action style and the compositional process for Skryabin’s late pieces.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This treatise discusses two works by Francis Poulenc and Sergei Prokofiev that became a part of the music culture of France in the 1920s. Sergei Prokofiev's 1924 Quintet, Op. 39 for Oboe, Clarinet, Violin, Viola, and Double Bass, and the subsequent ballet Trapèze, as well as Francis Poulenc's 1926 Trio for Oboe, Bassoon, and Piano, will each be studied. Compositional trends common in France of the 1920s had abandoned the Romanticism of previous decades and new musical ideas were tested and established by composers of this time. Many of those styles were reflections of cultural shifts coming from world political issues leading up to and beyond World War I. The contrasting natures of chromaticism and diatonicism in Prokofiev's Trapèze and heavily neoclassical elements from Poulenc's Trio for Oboe, Bassoon, and Piano will be examined.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This study develops nudging methods of data assimilation that will expand the utility of the forthcoming GOES-R satellite series by including data from the Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) and Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI). We develop a method to help trigger storms where lightning is observed, but no storm in simulated. Another method suppresses spurious simulated storms based on estimates of satellite-derived cloud top height (CTH) that will be improved due to the increased number of infrared channels on the ABI. In lieu of GOES-R data, Earth Networks Total Lightning Network (ENTLN) observations and GOES-13 10.7-micron observations are used in the current research. The assimilation methods are developed and evaluated using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model at convection-permitting scales (3-km horizontal grid spacing). We verify precipitation simulations against NCEP Stage IV hourly precipitation observations by computing fraction skill score (FSS; a neighborhood approach) and frequency bias for three case days. Simulated temperature, winds, humidity, and surface pressure are also verified against METAR surface observations. Our new method of assimilating lightning observations nudges low-level vertical velocity to trigger storms. This method is compared to a previous method that nudges low-level temperature (MU). Both lightning assimilation methods then are combined with the assimilation of CTH. CTH assimilation removes hydrometeors above the CTH estimate and applies an amount of cooling that is proportional to the latent heat of the removed hydrometeors to suppress spurious convection. Without applying CTH assimilation, the MU method produces better precipitation forecasts in terms of FSS than our optimal configuration of the vertical velocity nudging (WNO) method. However, if WNO is applied together with CTH assimilation, WNO produces FSS during the forecast period similar to MU applied with CTH assimilation. MU generally produces stronger storms than WNO that cause more mesoscale subsidence and indirect suppression of spurious storms. Direct suppression during CTH assimilation diminishes the impact of the indirect suppression. CTH assimilation also provides greater convective available potential energy that supports the weaker WNO storms. Regardless of whether CTH assimilation is applied, WNO generally produces superior forecasts of surface fields relative to MU and a control that employs no assimilation. This improvement is 1-6% of root mean square error during a 12-h forecast period subsequent to assimilation. Lightning assimilation (WNO or MU) combined with CTH assimilation typically provides the best precipitation forecasts. These are better than the control during the first 6-12 h of the forecast period for 1-mm and 10-mm precipitation thresholds.

            <DISS_para>The study of adaptive molecular evolution in natural populations has been severely limited by the difficulty of linking genetic variation to phenotypic variation to fitness effects.  Most studies connecting genotype, phenotype, and fitness have used reverse genetic approaches to measure the functional effects of specific mutations in the laboratory because this relationship is difficult to measure in natural populations, particularly for complex traits because of the ``many-to-one" mapping of genotype to phenotype.  Many of the fundamental features of evolving systems, such as evolvability, epistasis, and pleiotropy, however, may be stronger determinants of evolutionary outcomes in natural populations than in the laboratory because artificial selection and breeding schemes are generally more simplistic relative to selection and demographic effects in natural settings.  Snake venoms have emerged as a system for the study of the genetics of adaptation in complex, polygenic traits because of their genetic tractability and role in feeding, digestion, and defense, all of which are directly relevant to fitness.  Because venom gene expression is tissue-specific (i.e., no pleiotropic constraints) and toxin protein abundance directly influences venom efficacy, venoms are not inherently biased toward a particular mutational pathway, enabling a systematic comparison of the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptive evolution.  Venom phenotypes are manifest only upon injection into another animal, and venom functions are directly measurable through various assays, allowing direct tests of adaptive hypotheses in natural prey populations.  In this work, we sought to create a genotype-phenotype-fitness map for the venom system of the eastern diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus adamanteus) and, for the first time, identify the genetic basis of adaptation for a complex, polygenic trait in natural populations.  Crotalus adamanteus is the largest species of rattlesnake and exclusively consumes endotherms.  Crotalus adamanteus is historically native to seven states in the southeastern United States but has recently been extirpated from Louisiana, is endangered in North Carolina, and is currently under consideration for listing as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.  In Chapter 1, we sequenced the venom-gland transcriptome and integrated mass spectrometry data to construct a transcriptome-proteome map for the venom system.  We then used this map to identify significant toxin-gene expression differentiation across the range of C. adamanteus, providing candidate-genes for which to test the functional and evolutionary significance of the identified variation.  In Chapter 2, we used a similar approach and identified significant ontogenetic differentiation in toxin gene expression; further analyses determined that ontogenetic effects explained more variation in toxin expression than geographic effects, although both juvenile and adult expression patterns varied geographically, and time-series experiments in lab-raised individuals demonstrated that geographic and ontogenetic expression differentiation were not environmentally induced but rather under genetic control.  In Chapter 3, we used in vitro functional assays to verify that the expression differences found in the previous two chapters corresponded to differences in venom function.  We found that, overall, the statistical differences in toxin expression outlined in the first two chapters equated to functional differences in toxic activities in a predictable, tractable manner, suggesting that the differences identified in the first two chapters were, in fact, biologically relevant.  In Chapter 4, we used a target-enrichment approach to sequence the exons of all identified toxins in the venom-gland transcriptome as well as several thousand neutral loci to ascertain the relative roles of expression versus coding-sequence changes in a trait not inherently biased towards either mutational pathway.  We found evidence for adaptive changes at both the expression and sequence levels across the entire range, although expression differentiation did appear to be the more frequent molecular mechanism.  But, without functional characterizations of the identified sequence and expression evolution, it was difficult to characterize the relative roles demography, selection, and drift played in generating the identified sequence and expression divergence.  Although Chapter 3 did link expression variation to functional variation, these assays were not conducted in the actual target of venoms, natural prey.  To address these issues, we examined toxin sequence and expression evolution and estimated venom toxicity (i.e., fitness) in sympatric and allopatric natural prey across an island-mainland population pair in Chapter 5 to, for the first time, construct a genotype-phenotype-fitness map for a complex trait in natural populations.  We found that expression differentiation was predominantly, or exclusively, the genetic basis of polygenic adaptation, suggesting that over ecological timescales complex traits may preferentially evolve through mutations affecting expression because more molecular mechanisms exist for altering the amount of protein produced than for altering their functions through their primary sequences.  In Chapter 1, we found significant expression differentiation in both high- and low-abundance proteins across the range and over 1 million years of divergence, and in Chapter 4, we found both sequence and expression differentiation across the same temporal and spatial scales. In Chapter 5, however, we only identified expression differentiation, and found that this expression differentiation was restricted to low-expression proteins because of physiological and selective constraints on high-expression proteins. These differences in the molecular mechanism underlying adaptive evolution were most likely the result of temporal constraints on generating beneficial variation; because more molecular mechanisms exist for altering protein amounts than protein function, the probability of generating a beneficial expression variant is greater than the probability of generating a beneficial point mutation in the coding-region of a specific protein, and these differences in probability would be most pronounced over extremely short timescales.  Given enough time, however, both mutational pathways and proteins expressed at all levels can generate beneficial variation, and these results provide qualitative predictions regarding the process of adaptation for a complex trait.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Over the last decades, the enzyme Glucokinase (GCK) has interested biochemists due to its physiological and kinetic characteristics.  GCK is vital for glucose homeostasis, as it controls the levels of insulin and glycogen synthesis in the human body by catalyzing the phosphorylation of glucose. GCK displays a positive kinetic cooperativity towards glucose despite being a monomeric enzyme with only one binding site for this substrate. Previous crystallography and NMR experiments showed that cooperativity in GCK originates from order-disorder transitions within the enzyme’s intrinsically disordered small domain that happen in the same timescale as catalysis. A very detailed description of protein structure has been gained from both techniques in the presence of glucose. Unfortunately, the dynamic nature of the unbound GCK state prevents these techniques from revealing its structure.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The first two chapters of this dissertation are focused on biochemical and biophysical investigations into the cooperative regulation of GCK. First, we investigated the role of a connecting region between the two protein domains on GCK cooperativity. Using steady state kinetics and equilibrium fluorescence we found the connecting region must possess a minimal length to enable catalytic turnover. Also, we found that the sequence identity of the connecting region is directly linked to GCK cooperativity. Second, a non-natural fluorescent amino acid (fUAA) was site specifically incorporated into a single tryptophan version of GCK to perform Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments. Steady state FRET, lifetime, and FRET-lifetime measurements on wild-type GCK demonstrate that the enzyme in the unliganded-state exists in at least three uniformly distributed conformations originating from a broad conformational ensemble. A slightly more abundant state is postulated to correspond to the “super open” conformation previously observed in the crystal structure of the unliganded GCK. Upon glucose binding, the conformational ensemble is narrowed to two conformations, one of which is dominant and postulated to be the closed conformation of the enzyme. Similar experiments conducted on GCK variants that activate GCK by abolishing cooperativity, support the hypothesis that these variants function via two distinct mechanisms, one (α-type) that produces a shift in the conformational ensemble to resemble the wild-type glucose bound state, while the other (β-type) does not substantially perturb the conformational ensemble.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>GCK is specifically regulated in the liver by the Glucokinase Regulatory Protein (GKRP), which binds and inhibits GCK.  GKRP inhibition is in turn modulated by sugar phosphates; fructose 1-phosphate weakens the GCK-GKRP binding while sugar 6-phosphates (fructose 6-phosphate or sorbitol 6-phospate) strengthen the binding. As an alternative therapeutic approach to treat diabetes, Amgen has optimized a group of piperazines that bind to GKRP and disrupt the GCK-GKRP complex. Interestingly, the binding sites of sugar phosphates and piperazines are 30Å removed from the GCK-GKRP binding interface. In the third part of this dissertation, we aim to understand the mechanism for the ligand-mediated control of the GCK-GKRP interaction. Using mutagenesis, GCK inhibition assays, stopped-flow and fluorescence techniques we were able to propose a model in which GKRP exists in two conformations with different affinities towards GCK, and GKRP ligands modulate the distribution between the two conformations.  The difference in GCK affinity is due to the N-terminus-mediated repositioning of two arginines located at the GCK-GKRP binding interface; in the high-affinity GKRP state, the two arginines are positioned to electrostatically interact with GCK, while in the low-affinity state they are stabilized in different rotameric positions. According to our model, sugar 6-phosphates shifts the GKRP population towards the high-affinity state, while piperazine binding produces the low-affinity state.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The high temperature Ag-Mg-sheathed Bi2Sr2CaCu2Ox (2212) multi-filamentary superconducting round wire shows very promising electromagnetic properties with an isotropic behavior in field, a very high irreversibility field at 4.2 K, and progressive decrease in critical current density (JC) with increasing magnetic field, which make 2212 one of the three main candidates with ReBCO and 2223 tapes, for high field magnets. In addition 2212 wires have the advantage of being made into round conductors with an infinite variety of cross-sections, which is ideal for winding and cabling technology for any type of applications. The strong limitation of 2212 round wire comes from its low JC compared to the other HTS conductors. This limitation is the consequence of the wire manufacture process that traps 30 vol% of gas-filled porosity in the filaments of 2212 powder, which agglomerate during the thermal processing of the wire into filament-size bubbles. The bubbles severely limit the flow of supercurrent along the filaments and generate 2212 leakage. Those issues are drastically stopping the progression of 2212 round wires toward high field magnet applications.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We added the overpressure (OP) process during the heat treatment on 2212 round wires to compress the wire at high temperature with up to 100 atm, and reduce the volume of the filaments porosity. This was a major breakthrough as we increased JC from ~500 A/mm2 to more than 4000 A/mm2 at 4.2 K, 5 T, which made 2212 round wire a very competitive candidate for high field magnets. The OP reduced the porosity volume near zero and significantly increased 2212 connectivity. The densification of 2212 round wires is the key to reach high JC and was studied as a function of time and temperature to optimize the densification process. We found that the wire diameter decreases by 3.8 ± 0.3% after full heat treatment at 50 atm OP and by 3.30 ± 0.07% at 820 °C, below the melting point of 2212 powder. The densification is homogeneous and does not change the filament shape before melting. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We also compared the microstructure and JC of 2212 round wires densified before and densified after melting the 2212 precursor powder. We found that densifying the wire after melting decreases IC by 77 % compared to the usual densification before melting because of filament deformation and filament-size non-superconducting secondary phases w showing that densification before melting is required to densify the filaments homogeneously giving wires with high phase uniformity and high JC.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The standard heat treatment of 2212 round wire was designed and optimized at 1 atm pressure before the filament-size bubbles that limit IC were significantly reduced in size using the OP processing. We studied the OP HT of 2212 round wires with a statistical design of experiment (DOE) with the goal of increasing IC, reducing processing time, and understanding what are the critical parameters in OP processing 2212 round wires. We studied the effect of the maximum temperature (Tmax), the time 2212 is in the melt state (tmelt), the cooling rate to grow 2212 grains (RF), and the post annealing time (tA) cooling from 840 °C to 830 °C on the microstructure and electromagnetic properties of 2212 round wires. The DOE analysis gives strongly predictive equations and shows that RF and tmelt statistically affect IC significantly and must be minimized to increase IC, and that Tmax has a small to no statistical effect on IC for cooling rates RF ≤ 3 ˚C/h. Using the equations we shortened the OP HT time by more than a factor of 2, from 88 h to 41 h for similar IC as the STD OP HT.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The decrease in diameter during the OP HT is an issue for solenoid 2212 magnets. The diameter shrinkage of conductor occurs at high temperature and the winding pack becomes loose and may deform under its own weight, which reduces the predictability of the properties and field homogeneity of the magnet. We introduced a multi-step process to predensify 2212 wires with OP below the melting point of the 2212 precursor powder, before winding the coil, to minimize the wire diameter shrinkage during the OP processing of the solenoid magnet. We report that 2212 wire diameter was decreased by 3.0 % before melting the 2212 powder and the dense wire was wound into coils as small as 10 mm diameter. After OP heat treatment of the coils, no 2212 leakage was observed for coil diameter as small as 20 mm as well as no IC degradation occurred because of wire predensification.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This document provides a reference source for horn players and educators worldwide, creating an awareness of three of Canada’s most prolific contemporary composers of horn repertoire. These composers are identified through research in Canada’s largest libraries for works by Canadian composers. All of the composers who have written at least one original solo work for horn with piano are included in a table that outlines both their total output for solo horn with piano, and horn in small chamber music settings. As the table indicates, the research reveals Michael Conway Baker, Malcolm Forsyth and Elizabeth Raum to be the most prolific in both areas. Together, they have contributed sixty works for horn with nine or fewer instrumentalists. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The document begins with an outline of the resources that have been put into place across Canada to support the creation of Canadian repertoire. All of the three composers make use of these musical resources in the dissemination of their works throughout Canada, contributing to their output of this repertoire. An overview of the three composers and one representative work for each follow the discussion of Canadian resources. A performer’s guide for the music of Baker, Forsyth and Raum provides insight into their works to benefit performers. To this date, the dissemination and performance of works for horn by Canadian composers remains limited outside of Canada.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Compared to the conventional Si semiconductors, SiC technologies can improve PV converter performance such as a higher power density while leading converters to a higher operating temperature, making the cooling system a significant component. The design of cooling system that optimizes both volume and thermal resistance considering power density and heat dissipation is key to state-of-the-art converters. This thesis will cover the systematic thermal analysis and heat sink design for the SiC-based three phase three level T-type converter (3LT^2 C). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In order to minimize the overall volume of a converter system, it is necessary to derive the maximum thermal resistance as an essential input parameter for the detailed improvement design procedure. Due to the positive feedback of thermal between SiC power device total power losses and its junction temperature, this thesis derived an approximated analytical expression of power loss from both electrical domain and thermal domain to obtain the relationship between the maximum tolerable junction temperature and the maximum heat sink thermal resistance. Considering the manufacturing practical limitations, the improvement design focused on fin height and fan selection with respect to minimum cooling system volume. With a list of considered fans, the non-optimized forced-cooling heat sink of 50 kW 50 kHz interleaved T-type converter will be improved and a plate fin heat sink with fans will be designed for a 100kW 3LT^2 C system study. Consider the operation conditions for PV grid-tied converter, heat sink under natural convection design with optimized volume are also presented.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Iconography, in its technical sense as sacred art, is not an act of individual creativity or personal self-expression. The iconographer must follow established forms and conventions in order for the work to function as an icon. Iconographers are not called upon to contribute their own original ideas and innovations to the iconography, but neither are they mere copyists, servile laborers reproducing simulacra. Rather, iconographers must enter into the life of the tradition, and in so doing, by seeking merely to participate, not to disrupt, they enrich it. The icons themselves are representational, but not in a literal visual sense—perspective, space, and time in Orthodox Christian iconography operate according to a logic foreign to Renaissance technique. Iconography seeks to convey profound religious truths through the unlikely media of line, shape, and color. To reflect the truth of the persons and events depicted, icons depict them in a highly stylized and symbolic manner—the significance of the icon’s subject cannot be captured by mere objective representation.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In their own way, symphonies attempt something similar. They have established forms and conventions, a prominent place in a ritualistic social context, and a robust expressive tradition of topics and techniques. Originality is greatly prized, but complete originality, if it were even possible, would be incomprehensible. The best symphonies are those firmly anchored within the symphonic tradition. And at their finest, symphonies, like icons, seek to represent some inarticulable human truth through a completely different medium. Iconography uses paint to challenge our narrow one-dimensional linear view of time; symphonies do the same by using time itself as the canvas.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation is a study in symphonic poetics using Orthodox iconography as its starting-point metaphor. This symphony can be divided into three large sections following a very traditional symphonic logic: an opening sonata form with introduction, a slow middle theme and variations, and an allegro finale in a loose sonata form with coda. Each of these three sections is composed of five movements. Ten of these are associated with icons painted by (or associated with) Theophanes the Greek, a fourteenth-century Byzantine iconographer who worked mostly in Russia. The visual and symbolic connections between these icons help to create a network of associations within the symphony, and these extra-musical influences can be found also in the music.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The poetics of symphonic composition reflected in this work are fundamentally organicist: this work is essentially tonal, and the motivic seeds from which the entire symphony grows appear within the opening few bars—a symmetrical figure that expands into a perfect fifth played first by the violas and horns, and a descending step introduced by the clarinets. I take the position that the essential characteristic of symphonic poetics is to be found in the intersection of melodic/harmonic motion with thematic development, all unfolding according to a profound logic that creates an inner connection between all the work’s motives. The symphony may pass like a river through diverse thematic landscapes, but every point along the way will result naturally from the motion of the unfolding harmonies. Meter, motive, phrase, and tonality are thus essential to symphonic poetics. A symphony is the sounding-together of a thousand pieces effecting a single journey, a thousand texts composed into a single movement—ein Satz. All is motion, and like a river flows into the everlasting sea, so a symphony likewise flows.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Professionals engaged in work continuously confront situations and tasks that require the acquisition of new knowledge and skills. The workplace has been acknowledged as an environment rife with learning opportunities; employees continually construct and apply knowledge within an authentic context (Billet, 1995). Both formal and informal learning contribute to workplace learning (Brockman &amp; Dirkx, 2006; Choi &amp; Jacobs, 2011; Ellinger, 2005). Frequently required, devised, and implemented by organizations, formal training programs involve structured and intentional learning. Informal learning, however, entails individuals seeking and engaging in unstructured, learner-directed, and sometimes spontaneous activities to gain tacit or explicit knowledge and experience (Dennen &amp; Wang, 2002; Jacobs &amp; Park, 2009; Marsick &amp; Volpe, 1999). Although workplace learning consists of both formal and informal learning, the majority of learning that occurs in the workplace is informal, rather than formal (Ellinger, 2005; Lohman, 2000; Marsick &amp; Watkins, 2001). Informal learning is so prevalent in the workplace that the reported ratio of formal to informal learning highly favors informal, sometimes as steeply at 10 to 90 percent (Cross, 2013; Lohman, 2003; Marsick &amp; Watkins, 1990).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Within the workplace, the discipline of instructional design and performance improvement (ID/PI) focuses on supporting professionals’ learning and performance needs. As a result, the majority of organizational resources devoted to learning are allocated to more formal means, such as training and workshops (Ellinger, 2005; Lohman, 2000; Marsick &amp; Watkins, 2001). Given that the majority of learning among employees is more informal than formal in nature, and also that the role of ID/PI practitioners is to ensure support of those employees, an interesting connection between ID/PI and informal workplace learning appears (Klein &amp; Moore, 2016). However, despite the exciting potential of this intersection, the connection between ID/PI practitioners and informal learning has not received much attention from researchers.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Only two empirical studies have intersected the fields of ID/PI and informal learning, and both have done so by addressing the informal workplace learning of ID/PI practitioners. Berg and Chyung (2008) focused on the informal workplace learning of performance improvement professionals, but did not explain why they chose this population or how this group of practitioners may utilize informal learning strategies to support their clients. More recently, Yanchar and Hawkley (2014) explored the informal learning that occurred during design work among an ID/PI team, but again did not explore if the team incorporated informal learning into the services provided to clients.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to investigate the perception of informal learning strategies among ID/PI practitioners on two levels: the practitioner (professionals facilitating informal learning) and the organization (an entity supporting informal learning among employees). Four research questions, aligning with the two levels of inquiry, guided this study:</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>•	The practitioner:</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>o	Research Question 1: What types of informal learning activities do ID/PI practitioners facilitate in their organization?</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>o	Research Question 2: How do ID/PI practitioners facilitate informal learning in their organization?</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>•	The organization:</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>o	Research Question 3: What environmental factors do organizations provide to facilitate informal learning?</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>o	Research Question 4: How do organizations facilitate informal learning among their employees?</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The two-part study consisted of an online survey and follow-up interviews with current ID/PI practitioners. Respondents to the survey included 385 practitioners (37% men, n=143; 64% women, n=241), of which 20 volunteers participated in 1-on-1 interviews.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The results indicated that ID/PI practitioners predominantly engage in informal learning activities in order to facilitate informal learning among others. More specifically, both survey and interview data revealed that practitioners often share knowledge to do so (e.g., read a useful article online and forward the link via email to others). Results also indicated that organizations facilitate informal learning among employees through the internal culture, physical workspace, and resources and tools. For example, regarding the physical workspace, a workplace with open architectural features that encourage employee interaction (shared desks, low cubicle partitions, or common lounge areas) is conducive to informal learning. As proponents of learning, ID/PI practitioners may leverage organizations’ environmental factors to facilitate informal learning among employees, thus increasing performance.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Monitoring the fetal ECG (FECG) gives us important information about the fetal wellbeing. FECG is a complex waveform where each of the P through T complexes provides wealth of information. The objective of this project is to develop the best state-of-art real-time FECG monitoring system using embedded microprocessors. Many researchers from various fields like signal processing, artificial intelligence, and advanced statistics, have applied different techniques to extract FECG from the mixture of MECG and other noises and calculate the FHR, with accuracy as an objective. Most of them are calculation intensive and not real-time. The proposed approach focuses mainly on real time processing, robustness and portability of the system. The work discussed here will provide a novel algorithm to extract FECG from abdominal ECG (AECG) which is mixture of FECG, MECG, and noise, and finding Fetal FHR with less number of dimensions (measurements) with the best signal-to-noise ratio. This approach is tested on different soft-core processors and results are compared with other commercial of-the-shelf (COTS) hardcore solutions, in terms of power, cost, size and speed. In the end FECG was successfully extracted and identified on the basis of BPM and SNR values calculated using this method. It was found that hard-core processor (ARM Cortex A9) has achieved the best real-time performance among all.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>by the defense and law enforcement agencies. The US DoD and some very large</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>private corporations are spending large sums of money for developing intellectual </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>properties that will assist in implementing such systems. Amazon is </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>testing its own drones for delivery whereas Google, Tesla, Ford and Mercedes</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Benz are investing in self driving cars, that can operate in real traffic conditions. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Their goal is to make the vehicles either operate in a </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>standalone mode or in collaboration with other similar vehicles.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This push towards the use of unmanned systems comes with its own set of new</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>problems. Most of these problems would require solutions in real time. This has </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>created a lot of scope for innovative research using these networks and</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>the research problems fall broadly into two categories: the first relates to the</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>development of hardware and robotics, which is concerned with building better </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>hardware to implement such systems. The second category is concerned with the </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>design and implementation of efficient algorithms, that work with the implemented </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>hardware. These algorithms in turn belong to three broad categories, namely:</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>navigation and localization algorithms, algorithms for dynamic topology determination </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>for efficient communication and information exchange, consensus algorithms for </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>multi-sensor data fusion that in turn help in navigation and localization. In</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>this thesis we consider four problems of interest, each of which belongs to one of </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>these categories: first we consider the problem of GPS-denied navigation using signals </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>of opportunity, which belongs to the class of algorithms for navigation and</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>localization. Next we consider two problems from the second category. More precisely </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>we consider the problem of spanners, which are sparse subgraphs of an input graph </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>having nice structural properties. We study two variations of the spanner problem: the </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>first one arises in communication networks and aims to guarantee the communication </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>efficiency of a sparse subgraph of the input and the second one studies construction of </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>spanners having robustness guarantees. Finally, we consider algorithms for truth</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>determination from multiple sources, which is a type of consensus algorithm.</DISS_para>

      <DISS_content>
         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation examines the unique social relationships formed between white Creole characters and their Anglo-English counterparts in Romantic-era women’s fiction. Guided by Adam Smith’s Theory of Moral Sentiments, my dissertation terms these social relationships “negative bonds,” which are defined as affective exchanges of both sympathy and negative feeling. Guilt, disgust, and shame—all negative affects—occur in tandem with sympathy during moments when white Creole characters attempt to assimilate to British culture. Through their eventual failure, white Creole characters engender sympathy and experience negative affects from the Anglo-English characters, creating negative bonds that reinforce racial binaries and national boundaries. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In using Sianne Ngai’s Ugly Feelings to further conceptualize negative bonds, I extend the discussion to include contemporary theories of affective exchanges. While Ngai’s text explores figures who are oppressed by negative affects, my dissertation looks to the oppressors themselves, illuminating the role that affect plays within racialized discourse. Thus, analysis of negative bonds puts pressure upon texts that participate in maintaining social systems that continually exclude women from social equality and political rights. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Negative bonds are most explicitly rendered through interactions with white Creole characters because they exist in geographical (Caribbean/Britain), national (Anglo-English/British-Caribbean), and racial (white/black) liminal spaces. Initially accepted into the ranks of elite social circles, white Creole characters threaten the “purity” of British society and test the limits of inclusionary and abolitionist discourse. While Romantic-era women’s fiction should position white Creole characters to dismantle social, racial, and economic systems of oppression, negative bonds confirm the Anglo-English characters’ superiority through affective exchanges with the “other.” Ultimately, negative bonds solidify the white Creole’s “otherness” and maintain social order by ensuring the reproduction of British social hierarchies.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>A key challenge for modern chemistry is the production of mesoscopic complexity and hierarchical order to ultimately bridge the gap between the molecular world and functional microdevices. As proof of concept, nature shows unambiguously that this approach can be rewarding. In particular, natural biominerals such as nacre, bone, and tooth enamel, consist of ordinary nanoscale components, yet assemble complex polycrystalline materials that are clearly superior to their synthetic counterparts.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this context, an exciting model system for biomimetic crystallization is the assembly of biomorphs by the co-precipitation of silica and metal carbonates. Despite being formed by purely inorganic processes, these structures show “life-like” morphologies such as twisted helices and cardioid leaves. At the nanoscale, silica-carbonate biomorphs consist of crystalline nanorods that assemble hierarchical architectures reminiscent of natural biominerals. In this research work, we improve the level of control over the growth process and quantitatively characterize the biomorph structures beyond simple qualitative observations.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We report the synthesis of silica-carbonate biomorphs in single-phase, gradient-free solutions that differ markedly from the typical solution-gas or gel-solution setups. Our experimental approach reveals novel biomorph structural motifs, reduces transients in the chemical conditions, and expands the upper pH limit for biomorph formation to over 12 where silica is essentially soluble. Moreover, the single-phase approach significantly increases the duration of growth to assemble biomorph networks that extend to several millimeters. These unusually long biomorphs allow the first quantitative measurements of mesoscopic parameters such as the helix wavelength, period, width, and linear as well as tangential growth velocities. We find that the latter quantities are system-specific and tightly conserved during many hours of growth. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We also systematically characterize the biomorph sheets and report the existence of an additional level of self-organization that creates oscillatory height variations along the sheet surface. These topographic features take the form of either concentric rings or disordered, patchy patterns with a wavelength of approximately 6.5 μm that shows no pronounced dependence on the reactant concentrations. These undulations are accompanied by a systematic out-of-plane displacement of the nanorods. Our results are discussed in the context of an earlier hypothesis that predicts pH oscillations near the crystallization front. We further investigate the effect of inorganic dopants that influence the morphological, compositional, and crystallographic properties of biomorphs. In the case of Pb2+ and Ag+ ions, biomorph growth is disrupted by the formation of competing precipitates. Similarly, the addition of Ca2+, Mg2+, and Zn2+ induces the rapid crystallization of witherite or amorphous silica-carbonate aggregates at enhanced growth rates. By comparison, the addition of strontium ions results in the assembly of classic biomorphs such as cardioid sheets and helices. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Another aspect of the project lies at the overlap between geochemistry, paleontology, and astrobiology. To date, these fascinating biomorph microstructures have only been synthesized using model laboratory solutions. We report that mineral self-assembly can be also obtained from natural alkaline silica-rich water deriving from serpentinization. Specifically, we obtain water samples from the Ney springs in California and demonstrate the self-assembly of nanocrystalline biomorphs of barium carbonate and silica, as well as the formation mesocrystals and crystal aggregates of calcium carbonate with complex biomimetic textures. Our results suggest that silica-induced mineral self-assembly could have been a common phenomenon in alkaline environments of the early Earth and Earth-like planets. Moreover, the structural complexity obtained from these simple crystallization reactions in the natural Ney water further blurs the boundaries between geochemical and biological microscale morphologies that not too long ago were perceived as sharp and well-defined.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Interference is a major cause of forgetting. Educational contexts in particular are rife with sources of interference. Avoiding interference in educational contexts is therefore a goal of researchers. Recent research has demonstrated that being reminded can transform proactive interference into proactive facilitation (Wahlheim &amp; Jacoby, 2013). In the current experiments, I aim to extend said research to educationally relevant materials and explore strategies to increase being reminded in order to mitigate interference.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Incarceration is a major problem in the United States. It is a very complex system influenced by politics, ethnicity, poverty, social justice issues, and collective human experiences. Despite it complexities, its understanding by the general public is simplified and sensationalized by the media—prison, its workers, and residents are usually negatively stereotyped and stigmatized. The idea of incarceration only becomes tangible and familiar when a family member or friend that is close to you is directly affected. In this paper I use the qualitative research method—autoethnography—to present a personal narrative about my experiences as a family member affected by incarceration, and as a Master’s Degree art therapy student who has various experiences working with the prison system. My aim is to shed a more subjective light on the prison system as it relates to literature and the media. In this research, I am both participant and researcher—in this thesis, through reflections of my personal narrative, I am able to question the conceptions of the general public and policy makers on the prison system and discuss them from my point of view and what is known from the literature. Through this thesis, I am able to add to the many stories of persons who have been personally affected by the prison system either directly or indirectly. Through the use of autoethnography, I’m afforded the space to discuss the very pressing need for more research in correctional settings that will effectively change the prison system and how an art therapist like myself can begin to create change.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>ABSTRACT</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Critics have long remarked on the differences between the Argonautic epics of Apollonius Rhodius and Valerius Flaccus, and have attempted to understand the latter’s reception of the former. This dissertation calls into question the narrative that Valerius rejected Apollonius' characterization of the hero Jason as defective and sought to recuperate it. Evidence such as each poet’s treatment of his literary predecessors, the semantics of key terms important to the genre and to the heroes themselves, and the political cultures in which the two epics were composed, suggests that in each epic the heroic protagonist Jason is put forth as the best of his peers, the Argonauts, and the one most suited to lead them. The differences between the two Jasons is best explained by a difference in literary trends and political realities between the Ptolemaic Kingdom of the 3rd century BCE and the Flavian Dynasty of the late 1st century CE. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Contrary to scholarly depictions of Jason in Apollonius Rhodius’ Argonautica as a “failed” hero, his characterization is an evolution of Homeric trends in a Ptolemaic Alexandrian context, including Hellenistic literary sensibilities and the ideology of kingship. Similarly, the Jason of Valerius Flaccus’ Argonautica is best understood not as a rejection of Apollonius’ creation, but as an adaptation of it in light of post-Vergilian literary trends and the ideology of the early Flavian Dynasty, which seized power in a civil war. Therefore, both versions of the Argonautica depict Jason in a way that speaks to their respective eras’ understanding of leadership and what constitutes “the best man.”</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This quantitative research study investigated the ESOL (English to Speakers of Other Languages) academic performance of teacher candidates (n=632) at a large educational institution in Florida, USA, who majored in Elementary Education, Early Childhood Education, Exceptional Student Education, and English Education with an ESOL endorsement. Three research questions guided the study. A secondary data analysis was conducted to examine the relationship among the teacher candidates’ ESOL course grades and test scores as well as the academic majors of study.  Investigation of “Knowledge of ESOL” as stated in the Professional Education competencies and skills (i.e., Competency #7) was the goal of this analysis. The results showed that the means of the ESOL PEd Test scores of Elementary Education, Early Childhood Education, Exceptional Student Education, and English Education were respectively 80, 79, 76, and 73 out of 100; while the overall mean across all academic majors was 78. Also, the overall MANOVA investigating the mean differences across academic majors for all variables was significant, and follow-up ANOVAs indicated that teacher candidates’ academic performances were statistically different across the academic majors of study. Tukey statistical tests showed that teacher candidates in the academic major of Elementary Education tended to have higher TSL4080 grades and Exceptional Students Education tended to have lower TSL4080 grades compared to teacher candidates in the other academic majors. With respect to TSL4081 grades, teacher candidates in the academic major of English Education tended to have higher grades than teacher candidates in Elementary Education and Exceptional Students Education. With respect to overall GPAs, teacher candidates in the academic major of Exceptional Students Education tended to have higher overall GPAs compared to teacher candidates in the academic major of Elementary Education and English Education. Finally, with respect to ESOL PEd Test scores, teacher candidates in the academic major of Elementary Education tended to have higher scores than English Education. Last, to determine the extent to which TSL4080 grades, TSL4081 grades, and overall GPAs predict teacher candidates’ ESOL PEd Test scores, an overall regression analysis was conducted. The results showed that the relationship was significant, but small. With respect to the individual predictor variables, the strongest predictor of teacher candidates’ ESOL PEd Test scores was their overall GPAs. The next strongest predictor of teacher candidates’ ESOL PEd Test scores was their TSL4080 grades. Finally, teacher candidates’ TSL4081 grades did not significantly add to the prediction of their ESOL PEd Test scores. Overall, the standardized coefficients of overall GPAs and TSL4080 grades were significant. However, it was found that the standardized coefficient for TSL4081 grades was not significant. Therefore, while overall GPAs and TSL4080 grades predict ESOL PEd Test scores, TSL4081 grades do not predict ESOL PEd Test scores.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Visibility is an important part of highway driving. Weather-related visibility limitations have caused several major pile-ups (crashes) over the years all over the country. These limitations are caused due to, but not limited to, fog and rain. It is vital to be aware of the driving environment and conditions when traveling on interstates and highways at speeds upwards of 70 mph. Crashes caused at these speeds usually result in injuries and sometimes death.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In an effort to minimize/reduce the rate of such incidents, this project intends on automatically detecting driving visibility ranges in real time based on camera systems that already exist on the Florida Highway System. This will be done to alert travelers of driving hazards due to visibility limitations. We plan on doing this by performing analysis on images taken over time to detect the density of fog to determine the visibility distance.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This thesis presents a conceptual development, theoretical design, implementation, and the implementation results to achieve automatic fog detection in day-time and night-time images on a standard scale regardless of the image intensity. (i.e. Day-time and Night-time images have the same scale). Images are considered independently with no reference image to compare with. A review of related work is conducted for fog detection and sharpness measure of images to achieve this goal.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>M2 is an important drug target, this transmembrane protein forms a tetrameric proton channel essential for the life cycle of the Influenza A virus. The recent S31N mutation rendered this protein resistant to the used antiviral drugs, amantadine and rimantadine; while the current vaccines and drugs that target other proteins from Influenza A have shown limited effectiveness. Abundant structural information available for M2 shows that this small transmembrane protein is very sensitive to its environment and the large volume of the data acquired in detergent or in lipids that do not mimic correctly the membrane environment of this protein did much to increase the confusion regarding the proton conductance and drug binding mechanisms. Here, we use well established solid state NMR techniques on samples of M2 incorporated in the native-like environment of liquid crystalline lipid bilayers in order to understand the dynamics of two important sites Val&lt;sub&gt;27&lt;/sub&gt; and Trp&lt;sub&gt;41&lt;/sub&gt; that line the pore of this proton channel. Val&lt;sub&gt;27&lt;/sub&gt; is essential for the action of antiviral drugs on the wild type protein and is also proposed to act as a secondary gate restricting the influx of protons to the interior of the channel pore. The proton conductance happens by the protonation of His&lt;sub&gt;37&lt;/sub&gt; residues that then transfers the proton to water molecules on the interior of the virion particle. Trp&lt;sub&gt;41&lt;/sub&gt;  is the final and important step for proton conductance, while the transfer of protons from the protonated His&lt;sub&gt;37&lt;/sub&gt; to water molecules in the channel core happens on the microsecond timescale the proton conductance is observed on the millisecond timescale. The Trp&lt;sub&gt;41&lt;/sub&gt;  side chain acts as the primary channel gate restricting proton permeation. Here, the dynamics of Val&lt;sub&gt;27&lt;/sub&gt; and Trp&lt;sub&gt;41&lt;/sub&gt;  in several M2 constructs, M2TM (residues 22 to 46), M2CD (residues 22 to 62) and M2FL (residues 1 to 97) was studied incorporating these fragments with sites labeled with either &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H or &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N into DOPC/DOPE bilayers. The NMR spectra of slow tumbling hydrated proteoliposomes reflect a large variety of anisotropic motions that range from the axial rotation of a protein inside the bilayer, to small amplitude motions that occur about torsion angles (librational motions) of the protein backbone. These motions also exist on a wide range of timescales, from nanoseconds to microseconds. Motions on or faster than the timescale of the nuclear interaction anisotropy (10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) will affect the spectral lineshapes of powder patterns; moreover, the frequency breadth of these powder patterns are large enough so that they can be measured with accuracy. By using theoretical lineshape calculations that take into account these anisotropic modes of motion as well as their frequencies, the dynamics of individually labeled sites can be extracted from the spectral envelope of the powder patterns acquired. Initial determination of the global rotational motion of the transmembrane channel M2TM in DOPC/DOPE lipids was performed in order to allow the deconvolution of this motional mode from the local side chain motions of the important sites, Val&lt;sub&gt;27&lt;/sub&gt; and Trp&lt;sub&gt;41&lt;/sub&gt; . For this Ala&lt;sub&gt;29&lt;/sub&gt; was used, it faces the lipid environment, does not participate in helix-helix interactions and does not undergo large amplitude side chain motions. The global rotation motion of M2TM was determined to be on the 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; timescale. Also, it was shown that the global rotational motion was found to be dependent on the protein:lipid content; the reduction of lipid leads to the oligomerization of tetrameric M2TM channels. The oligomerization is proposed to be correlated with the mechanism of budding nascent virus particles for which M2 is also essential. The investigation of the dynamics of Val&lt;sub&gt;27&lt;/sub&gt; in M2TM and M2CD showed that this amino acid side chain has a similar conformation and dynamics in both constructs. This site is undergoing rotameric jumps on the microsecond timescale and most likely the nanosecond constriction of the pore proposed by computational studies stems from oscillations of the backbone structure. The binding of amantadine and the reduction of pH (channel activation) were shown to have similar effects on the dynamics of Val&lt;sub&gt;27&lt;/sub&gt;. Finally, the conformation and dynamics of Trp&lt;sub&gt;41&lt;/sub&gt; of M2TM was shown to be in agreement with the gating mechanism in which the side chain of this site occludes the C-terminal end of the channel preventing protons to reach the viral interior. The dynamics of the Trp&lt;sub&gt;41&lt;/sub&gt;  side chain in M2TM were shown to be very restricted, with an indole ring oscillatory amplitude of ± 5°, also, the dynamics of this site in M2FL was shown to be very similar to the one in M2TM indicating a similar action mechanism.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>To limit the reputational damage inflicted on an organization during crises, crisis communication scholars have spent considerable effort analyzing the appropriate crisis response strategies that coincide with certain crisis situations (Benoit, 1997; Coombs 1995, 2006, 2007; Coombs &amp; Holladay, 2014; Seeger &amp; Ulmer, 2002). Although it is valuable and essential to gain understanding of the implications of post-crisis communication, scholars have also alluded to the importance of pre-crisis preparation and the devising of a pre-crisis plan (Coombs, 2007; Coombs &amp; Holladay, 2001, 2002, 2006; Heath 1997). However, a majority of crisis communication research has focused on post-crisis reactive strategies rather than pre-crisis preparation and prevention (Avery, Lariscy, Kim, &amp; Hocke, 2010). In addition, crisis communication scholars have studied the influence of the organization-public relationship (OPR), a dominant public relations paradigm, on organizations post-crisis reputational assessments (Brown &amp; White, 2011; Coombs, 2000). Nevertheless, no known research has examined the effects of pre-crisis plan exposure on post-crisis evaluations of organizations, specifically the attitudinal measures trust and forgiveness.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>As a result, the current study sought to empirically test the effects of transparently communicating a pre-crisis plan to stakeholders on their levels of organizational trustworthiness and forgiveness. To test this effect, a 2 X 1 between-subject experiment was conducted, in which participants were either exposed to a pre-crisis plan or an alternative plan (i.e. control group). Following a two-day delay, participants were then exposed to a crisis scenario description and corresponding crisis response, as suggested by SCCT. Lastly, dependent measures and demographics were reported. Participants who completed the experiment were rewarded extra credit.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Statistical analysis revealed that while stakeholders who are exposed to a pre-crisis plan do report slightly higher levels of organizational trustworthiness and forgiveness in comparison to those not exposed to a pre-crisis plan, the mean difference between the groups is not significant. However, it is important to report that analysis of scale items did reveal a significant difference between groups on their evaluations of organizational dependability. Thus, several implications and future research opportunities are suggested. Most importantly, this study expanded the OPR research in crisis communication scholarship by alluding to the need for further analysis on pre-crisis communication and its effect on organizational dependability. In addition, by empirically testing the effects of pre-crisis plan exposure, the current study attends to the call for further research in crisis preparation (Avery et al., 2010).</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The effective conservation of threatened and endangered plants requires an understanding of population dynamics and the evaluation of factors that could reduce population growth. I constructed and analyzed a stage structured demographic model for Euphorbia telephioides, a threatened dioecious perennial herb, to determine the current status of three populations, compare projections of population growth using different methods, and determine the effects of pollen limitation in the population dynamics of this species. Dioecious plants are prone to pollen limitation due to their inability to self-pollinate. Studies indicate that pollen limitation reduces seed set in plants due to insufficient quantity or quality of pollen, which can reduce population growth rate due to the decrease in fecundity. I combined experimental tests for pollen limitation with construction and analysis of structured demographic models, to examine how increased levels of pollen limitation would affect population growth rates.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Determining the current status of populations, and simulating the consequences of possible threats, such as pollen limitation, provides a quantitative basis for conservation actions. I compared deterministic and stochastic projections of a stage structured demographic model to examine how environmental variation affects population growth rates, and I examined the effects of parameterizing the model excluding demographic measures of randomly marked individuals in the population growth rates (Lambda). The majority of estimated lambdas and their 95% confidence intervals indicate that these three populations are projected to decline. Lambda estimated excluding randomly marked individuals overestimated population growth because adult plants had 100% survival. I did not find evidence of significant pollen limitation of fruit or seed production, and simulations of increased levels of pollen limitation reduce Lambda at a modest rate between 0.17% to 1.91%. The main advantage of constructing a structured demographic model is that these models allow us to integrate data on different stages of a complex life cycle. In the case of E. telephioides elasticity analysis indicates that increasing stasis of non-flowering plants could lead to increasing population growth rates.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Education policy over the past decade has often focused on increasing participation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. A number of studies indicate that the STEM pipeline “leaks,” as individuals who pursue STEM college majors do not follow through with occupations in these fields. Using data from the Education Longitudinal Study (ELS) of 2002 and from the General Social Surveys (GSS) for 2010, 2012, and 2014, I expand the concept of STEM momentum to explore how momentum builds in high school and carries into postsecondary enrollment and occupations. In addition, with the GSS data, participants are grouped by age to explore any patterns that may emerge in aligning outcomes with shifts in the labor market and in policy. Moreover, the occupations included as STEM and applied STEM are expanded to include occupations in these fields that require any level of education or certification above a high school diploma. I find that math self-efficacy and high school math and science coursework completed matter for building STEM momentum. This momentum carries into postsecondary enrollment and college major selection. The momentum built from math self-efficacy and high school math and science coursework completed carries indirectly into occupation through college major. In terms of labor market and policy shifts, I find that there appears to be increases in participation in STEM fields by females and different racial groups, although, gaps remain. I find that the STEM pipeline not only continues to “leak” for STEM fields, but it also “leaks” for applied STEM fields.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This work explores first and foremost the nature of the Episcopal mission to the colonial Philippines from 1901 to 1918, while it was under the leadership of a missionary bishop named Charles Henry Brent. Missionaries, such as Brent, served an essential role in the American colonial enterprise in the Philippines. The historiography tends to label missionaries as cultural imperialists. Missionaries did not abstain from culturally imperialistic behavior. But,  they also acted at times as protectors of Philippine culture. How could missionaries act both as imperialists and attempt to preserve native culture in the Philippines? Contrary to the theories of some historians, missionaries did not see their actions as contradictory, but as complimentary. The reason for this: ideology. Missionaries defined their  purpose based not on the motives of the Philippine Commission—the American governing body in the islands—but on their own theology. Brent and his mission will be used as a prominent example, a microcosm, to prove this point. The three chapters within focus on ideology and theology as the primary motivators for characters within this narrative.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The first chapter looks at the American people and the U.S. government, tracing the development of racially and religiously motivated feelings toward the Philippines and the Filipinos. The chapter then turns to missionaries and traces both their theological and their ideological reasons for going to the Philippines. Just as with the American people and the American government, racial and religious reasoning urged missionaries to go to the Philippines. While a large part of the missionary justification for proselyting in the Philippines was the existence of a minority of non-Christians in the archipelago, upon arrival in the islands Protestant missionaries primarily focused on the conversion of Roman Catholic Filipinos. This chapter highlights the motivations of the U.S. government and the Philippine Commission, and compares them with those of the Protestant missionaries.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The second chapter turns to Brent's mission. As ideology is essential to this narrative, this chapter is an exploration of his theological and ideological motivations. The chapter underscores Brent's one focus above all others in the Philippines. He wanted to save the non-Christians, especially the Igorots—an animist group in Northern Luzon—from what he referred to as the concomitants of civilization. Believing that civilization was being ushered into the Philippines by the American presence in the islands, Brent felt that non-Christians needed to be protected from the concomitants, or vices, that would inevitably come along with civilization. In essence, he wanted to be their savior from civilization. Brent felt that the Igorots did not need Christianity while in isolation, their religion would suit their needs. But, now that they would no longer be isolated, Christianity was all that could save them from succumbing to vice. When work among the Igorots lost Brent's interest, he transferred these same feelings to the Moros—the Muslim community in the Philippines—determining to help prepare them for Christianization. The two other groups that Brent's mission targeted, the Americans stationed in the islands and the Chinese population in Manila, while important in their own right, received attention from Brent partly because of the influence they had on the Igorots and the Moros. Chapter Two illustrates how Brent's theology and ideology led him to create a unique mission. It focuses on his ecumenism, views on morality and vice, and his belief in responsibility. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The third chapter builds on the foundation laid in Chapter Two. Detailing the four sections of Brent's mission, Chapter Three demonstrates that the theological concern that drove Brent was his desire to save the non-Christian Filipinos from civilization. It illustrates that the policies implemented by Brent in each part of his mission, show a consistent concern for the "heathen" and saving him from vice through his Christianization. The chapter simultaneously proves that these efforts sometimes aligned with those of the Philippine Commission, aiding them in their goals. But, it also is clear that Brent occasionally redirected not only the Philippine Commission, but also the U.S. government, pushing them to help accomplish his agenda. This provides a picture of the relationship between the missionary and the colonial enterprise. It was complex. The missionary often had his own motives, and acted independently. He was also a crucial part of the American presence in the Philippines, making a large contribution to the American operation in the islands.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Learning to read is a major developmental achievement with wide ranging societal, educational, and economic costs associated with low literacy attainment. A robust body of literature has documented the stability and persistence of reading difficulties in early elementary school, underscoring the importance of identifying and intervening with children at risk early in development, before they enter formal education. Current efforts to identify children early in development who will require specialized educational support are missing a significant segment of children, and in turn, the opportunity to intervene early. This study evaluated competing models of the factor structure of emergent literacy skills and examined predictive relations between social communication skills in the second year of life and later emergent literacy skills using structural equation modeling (SEM) within a longitudinal sample of preschool children (4–5 years) with diverse early developmental skills. A similar latent structure of emergent literacy skills was found for children with typical development (TD) and early developmental delay (EDD), yet differences in how specific emergent literacy skills relate to one another were documented between groups, possibly reflecting differences in emergent literacy development between children with TD and EDD. Analyses also documented predictive relations between early social communication and preschool emergent literacy skills, supporting the characterization of literacy development as a continuous developmental process beginning early in life. This study extends the current literature by documenting relations between early social communication skills in the second year of life and later preschool emergent literacy skills using a well-characterized longitudinal sample of young children with diverse early developmental abilities.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The study of baryon resonances provides a deeper understanding of the strong interaction because the dynamics and relevant degrees of freedom hidden within them are reflected by the properties of the excited states of baryons. Higher-lying excited states at and above 1.7 GeV/c^2 are generally predicted to have strong couplings to final states involving a heavier meson, e. g. one of the vector mesons, ρ, ω, φ, as compared to a lighter pseudoscalar meson, e. g. π and η. Decays to the ππN final states via π∆ also become more important through the population of intermediate resonances. We observe that nature invests in mass rather than momentum. The excited states of the nucleon are usually found as broadly overlapping resonances which may decay into a multitude of final states involving mesons and baryons. Polarization observables make it possible to isolate single-resonance contributions from other interference terms. The CLAS g9 (FROST) experiment, as part of the N^∗ spectroscopy program at Jefferson Laboratory, accumulated photoproduction data using circularly- &amp; linearly-polarized photons incident on a transversely-polarized butanol target (g9b experiment) in the photon energy range 0.3 − 2.4 GeV &amp; 0.7 − 2.1 GeV, respectively. In this work, the analysis of reactions and polarization observables which involve two charged pions, either in the fully exclusive reaction γp → p π^+ π^− or in the semi exclusive reaction with a missing neutral pion, γp → p π^+ π^− (π^0 ) will be presented. For the reaction γp → p π^+ π^− , eight polarization observables (I^s, I^c, P_x, P_y, P^s_{x,y}, P^c_{x,y}) have been extracted. The high statistics data rendered it possible to extract these observables in three dimensions. All of them are first-time measurements. The fairly good agreement of I^s and I^c obtained from this analysis with the experimental results from a previous CLAS experiment provides support for the first time measurements. For the reaction γp → pω → p π^+ π^− (π^0 ), five polarization observables (T , Σ, F , H, P ) have been extracted, four of which are first-time measurements at all energies. This analysis thus represents a comprehensive program on vector-meson photoproduction: The ω is observed and studied directly from the data and the polarization observables for the (broad) ρ can be extracted from the double-pion reaction in a partial-wave analysis. The 13 polarization observables extracted in this analysis substantially augment the world database of polarization observables for these reactions and are expected to play a crucial role in identifying the contributing baryon resonances.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Annually, about 3.5 million Americans of all ages, ethnicities, and professions experience homelessness (National Coalition for the Homeless [NCH], 2009c).  About one-third of the total homeless population is comprised of families, and families with children are among the fastest growing segments of the population (NCH, 2009b).  It is reported that homelessness is typically a recurrent experience that results in children’s educational, emotional, and physical needs being neglected as families struggle to obtain stable housing and other basic needs (Nunez, 2000).  	</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>While families in homeless situations – currently homeless, previously homeless, and at-risk of homelessness – face many challenges and issues, one frequent difficulty is the enrollment of their young children in child care or preschool programs.  Although the McKinney-Vento Act stipulates that educational agencies must review and revise laws, regulations, practices, or policies that may act as a barrier to the enrollment, attendance, or success in school of homeless children and youth (National Association for the Education of Homeless Children and Youth [NAEHCY], n.d.a.; United States Department of Education [U.S. DOE], 2002, 2004), it is estimated that only 16-21% of homeless preschoolers are enrolled in child care programs, while the rate of all children nationally is 53% (Nunez 2000; U.S. DOE, 2004).  Clearly, the existence of the McKinney-Vento Act alone is not enough to remove the barriers to enrolling children in homeless situations in child care programs.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Early childhood professionals – center owners/ directors (O/Ds), family advocates (FAs), assistant center directors/center lead teachers (ADs/CLs), lead teachers (LTs), and assistant teachers (ATs) – are also in key positions to ensure that the requirements of the McKinney-Vento Act are consistently applied to assist families in homeless situations access educational opportunities for their young children.  However, very few empirical studies have addressed the ways or the extent to which early childhood professionals (ECPs) are responsive to the needs of children and families in homeless situations.  Thus, the purpose of this qualitative study was to explore how ECPs work with children and families who are in homeless situations.  Specifically, the researcher examined (1) the specialized knowledge ECPs have about children and families in homeless situations and their unique needs; (2) the practices ECPs implement to be responsive to the needs of children and families in homeless situations; and (3) what ECPs believe they need so that they can work more effectively with children and families in homeless situations.  In-depth interview data and supporting documents were collected from a purposeful sample of 14 ECPs employed at six different child care centers.  Then, the data were analyzed using a qualitative thematic approach.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The data revealed that ECPs have specialized knowledge about who is likely to experience homelessness; they understand the adverse impact of homelessness on child development and family well-being; and they recognize the need and importance of providing family-oriented child care services.  The practices ECPs implement to be responsive to the needs of children and families in homeless situations include the three Rs – recruiting families, reducing barriers to enrollment and attendance, and referring families to community agencies; building trusting and supportive relationships; and implementing individualized strategies in the classroom.  In order to work more effectively with children and families in homeless situations, ECPs believe they need public and private funding to make child care programs more accessible; specialized professional development to learn best practices for working with this population; and policy changes to support child success and family stability.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Ethylene 1-alkene copolymers with the same molar mass, same molar mass distribution and very similar average comonomer content of 3.8 +/- 0.4 mol% but different broad interchain comonomer content distribution (CCD), are found to display different extents of melt memory effect on crystallization rate. With decreasing the initial melt temperature, all broadly distributed copolymers show enhanced crystallization followed by a decrease of crystallization rate. However, copolymers with a higher content of molecules in the medium composition range (6-2 mol% comonomer) and a lower content of lightly branched molecules (&lt; 2 mol% comonomer), display the highest effect of memory of a prior crystallization in their high temperature melts. The increase in crystallization peak temperature is up to 4 ºC. The acceleration and further retardation of the crystallization are associated with self-seeds that remain in one-phase or two liquid phases melts respectively. The magnitude of the effect on crystallization is proportional to the number of surviving seeds in the initial melt. Bi-modal distributed ethylene 1-octene random copolymers display strong melt memory above equilibrium melting temperature. All molar mass fractions (MMFs) display strong melt memory due to the broad comonomer content distribution (CCD) of each MMF. Liquid-liquid phase separation shows up only in two MMFs resulting from their broad CCD. Comonomer content fractions (CCFs) of high comonomer content have strong melt memory but do not display LLPS.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>There are numerous examples from history that indicate that leaders can disagree about the impact that certain strategies and weapons systems will have on a conflict.  The conflict literature in general tends to overlook these disagreements, at worst ignoring them as simple irrationalities. This dissertation presents economic factor endowments as a theoretical cause for disagreements of military power, and conducts a series of empirical evaluations for the impact that these disagreements have for conflict outcomes. I propose that heterogeneous beliefs about military power result from differences in access to capital and labor resources, a process I call force capitalization.  I argue that these beliefs affect the public's perception of military power, conflict onset and conflict duration. I use a survey experiment to evaluate my claim that citizens assess military power in accordance with their military's degree of capitalization. Lastly, I find that differences in force capitalization between countries are associated with an increase in the likelihood of war onset and longer lasting wars.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Due to environment concerns and the government incentives, renewable generations are growing rapidly these years. In particular, large-scale photovoltaic (PV) installations are increasing dramatically. However, the limited lifetime of PV converter and high power or energy fluctuation with potential grid stability issue may become barriers to their future expansion. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>For power converter in large-scale PV systems, cascaded multilevel inverter (CMI) integrated with high-frequency-link (HFL) based dc-dc converters (HFL-CMI) has superior advantages over the conventional centralized converter, in terms of modularity and scalability, weight and volume, direct medium-voltage ac access and distributed maximum power point tracking. In CMI converter, large electrolytic dc-link capacitors are usually required to buffer the double-line frequency energy injecting to ac grid. However, the reliability of electrolytic capacitors is very limited and cannot satisfy the 25-year lifetime expectation for PV systems. As a two-stage conversion of HFL-CMI PV system, the front-end dc-dc converter with advanced technologies can help to meet the lifetime goals. In this research, a cascaded current-fed dual-active-bridge (CF-DAB) dc-dc converter is developed to achieve a long lifetime medium-voltage PV system. The CF-DAB converter has favorite features for PV application, e.g. high step-up ratio with galvanic isolation, inherent zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) conditions, wide input voltage capability and multiport interfaces. The operation principle and ZVS conditions of CF-DAB converter are thoroughly analyzed. With the proposed power decoupling control strategy, the converter allows using small dc-link capacitors, therefore the system reliability can be improved by replacing electrolytic capacitors with film capacitors; meanwhile, low-frequency ripple-free maximum power point tracking (MPPT) can be also realized. An optimized operation mode aiming to minimize transformer root-mean-square (rms) current is also derived for high-efficiency operation. A downscaled 5 kW PV system including a CF-DAB module and an inverter module was built in the laboratory to verify the proposed PV converter with its control strategy.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The high power fluctuation of PV and other renewable energy sources has aroused the concerns about their impact on power quality and grid stability, which may hinder their high penetration. Battery energy storage system (BESS) can be a valuable, fast reacting contribution, especially for smoothing the power and energy profile fed to the grids. Due to the inherent dc feature, BESSs operate more efficient when integrated into dc systems instead of ac systems. In general, dc systems are believed to be the future electric systems for better performance, in terms of system complexity and efficiency. While the dc collection concept for PV system is spreading in academia, dc collection grids for offshore wind farms have already been demonstrated in numerous projects. Beside renewable collection, BESSs can also provide energy and stability support for other dc systems, such as onboard medium-voltage dc (MVDC) system where power pulsation or pulsed loads exist. One of the key enabling technology for BESS integration to MVDC system is the dc-dc converter that is suitable for high power medium-voltage BESS. Due to high cost and limited cycle life of batteries, the efficiency and cost are critical for BESS converter. Power density is another critical measure for applications like electric ships. Dc fault rid-though capability is also desired due to the immaturity of high voltage dc circuit breakers. This dissertation proposes current-fed modular DAB (CF-MDAB) dc-dc converters for medium-voltage BESS integration, featuring high efficiency, high power density. The CF-MDAB converters exhibit favorite characteristics of CF-DAB converter including galvanic isolation and soft switching capability. Particularly, with direct dc current controllability, the CF-MDAB BESS converter can achieve dc fault ride-through operation. Other advanced functions such as active filtering and impedance shaping can be also realized to further improve system stability. A downscaled 3-kW CF-MDAB converter was built in the laboratory to verify the proposed BESS converter with its control strategy</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Problem solving skills have been widely used to achieve desired outcomes in everyday life and professional contexts. To solve a complex problem in a real situation, people need to improve causal reasoning and systems thinking. Causal mapping can be used as an instructional method to develop and support students’ causal reasoning and systems thinking by establishing their own mental models. Also, causal maps can be used to assess students’ understanding of complex problems. However, it is required to determine which mapping processes produce more accurate maps dependent upon individual differences in prior knowledge, because students’ causal maps can vary depending on the level of prior knowledge and which mapping processes are used to construct causal maps. Given this issue, the purpose of this study was to identify a) the mapping processes that are dependent on students’ prior knowledge; and b) the mapping processes that can help students produce more accurate causal maps and achieve deeper understanding. In this study, 43 students constructed three different causal maps for three topics, and a total of 127 mapping recordings and causal maps were collected and analyzed using post hoc analysis.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The findings revealed that students with high and medium levels of prior knowledge showed a slight tendency to use the backward approach over the forward approach, whereas students with low levels of prior knowledge showed an equal tendency to use both approaches. Students across all three levels of prior knowledge were more likely to use the breadth-first approach over the depth-first and unidentified approaches. Students that produced higher and lower quality causal maps both showed a slight tendency to use the backward approach over the forward approach and a higher tendency to use the breadth-first approach over the depth-first approach. The ratio of forward vs. backward approaches was negatively and significantly correlated with the quality of causal maps. Therefore, when students mostly used the forward approach, they constructed lower quality causal maps. In addition, the ratio of breadth-first vs. depth-first approaches was positively and significantly correlated with the quality of causal maps. This indicates that when students mostly used the breadth-first approach, the quality of their causal maps increased.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Prior knowledge had a direct negative effect on the ratio of forward/backward approach and the ratio of breadth-first/depth-first approach, however prior knowledge had a direct positive effect on map quality. The ratio of forward/backward approach had a direct negative effect on map quality, and the ratio of breadth-first/depth-first approach had a direct positive effect on map quality.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In conclusion, the main implication of this study is that instructors need to encourage students to jointly use the backward and the breadth-first approaches when working to solve diagnosis-solution problems. And, educational researchers need to design causal mapping software/tools to facilitate the backward and the depth-first approaches so that causal mapping can help students achieve higher levels of understanding controlling for individual differences in prior knowledge and causal reasoning skills, and be used to measure their causal understanding.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Sleep disturbances, including difficulties initiating and/or maintaining sleep, poor sleep quality, and nightmares, are prevalent among individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Sleep disturbances predict more severe presentations of PTSD, including increased PTSD symptoms, and comorbidity with depression, substance use disorders, and suicidality. An emerging parallel line of research has provided evidence for the notion that sleep is critical for emotional responding and the ability to effectively regulate one’s emotions, leading some to hypothesize that emotion dysregulation may account for the link between sleep disturbances and PTSD symptoms. However, there is a lack of empirical research investigating this theory. In addition, there is a dearth of research on how day-to-day variations in sleep may affect emotion dysregulation and PTSD symptoms. Thus, the current study tested the relationship between sleep disturbances, emotion dysregulation, and PTSD symptoms utilizing an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) design. The sample included 30 individuals diagnosed with PTSD who completed a baseline assessment in the laboratory and then participated in a series of brief EMA-based assessments over 8 days. Poor sleep quality predicted daytime elevated PTSD symptoms, while longer sleep onset latency and more frequent nightmares were marginally associated with daytime severity of PTSD symptoms. Furthermore, poor sleep quality and longer sleep onset latency were associated with daytime emotion dysregulation. The relationship between poor sleep quality and longer sleep onset latency and elevated PTSD symptoms was mediated by emotion dysregulation. However, alternative mediation analyses indicated that negative affect outperformed emotion dysregulation as a mediator of the relationship between sleep indices and PTSD symptoms. Results of the current study will be discussed in terms of clinical and theoretical implications for the relationship between sleep and PTSD symptoms.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>A recent drive to explore the fundamental properties of later actinide elements is culminated by this research which targets the structural chemistry and electronic behavior of berkelium in the solid-state.  Experimental evidence collected for materials containing plutonium, americium, curium, and californium have stirred interest in revising models explaining bonding character in the actinides.  Covalency in chemical bonding is linked to the differences in crystalline structure which these elements possess upon reaction under identical experimental conditions.  Moderate half-lives and dangerous decay energies provide obstacles for actinide research in terms of safety and handling, but production of milligram quantities of these elements at HFIR in ORNL overcomes the major concern of sufficient yield in material.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The first four single crystal berkelium materials to exist were developed in solvothermal [Bk(HDPA)3·nH2O], flux {Bk[B6O8(OH)5]}, and hydrothermal synthesis reactions [Bk(IO3)3 and Bk(IO3)4].  In a series of experimental and quantum mechanical techniques, the bonding dynamics of berkelium could be related to its actinide neighbors, curium and californium, as well as its lanthanide isoelectronic analog, terbium.  The results support the introduction of hybridized 5f6d bonding orbitals in the trivalent berkelium materials, something which is absent in corresponding curium and terbium compounds, but present in those with californium.  Quantum mechanical calculations expose this observation and isotypic structure-types between berkelium and californium, and not curium or terbium, corroborate this finding.  However, splitting of the ground state energy by spin-orbit coupling is an order of magnitude smaller in berkelium, like curium, compared to californium.  Therefore, conclusions of berkelium’s bonding nature can be resolved to show structural chemistry akin to californium, but electronic behavior similar to curium.  The first “formally” tetravalent berkelium material, Bk(IO3)4, displayed spectroscopic behavior of trivalent berkelium, a property known as mixed-valency.  These bulk-scale experiments expose the unique fundamental chemistry of berkelium, an endeavor that is difficult to achieve when considering the half-lives of and protection against the decay energies of 249Bk and 249Cf, the daughter of 249Bk.   </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Disruption of typical electronic behavior in the earlier actinides was sought by slow evaporation and solid-state characterization experiments.  A typical reductant used in nuclear separations to maintain PuIV and NpIV and leave UVI, FHA was used as a complexing ligand in crystallization experiments with UVI and PuIV.  Crystallization of UO2(FHA)2 produced red block crystals, where the atypical red color from yellow-green is a result of distortions in the absorption of this material due to weakening of the O=U=O bond by 6.5° from linear.  Pu2(FHA)8 crystallizes as a discrete dimeric complex, with inversion symmetry that may be a key to observing the nuclear moment of plutonium using 239Pu-NMR.  Reversing the role of FHA from reductant to ligand provided evidence of strong π donation in actinide complexes that suggest its application in uranium seawater extraction.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Finally, collaborative work between CEMRC and INE aims at producing a model that explains actinide solubility data in high ionic strength borate media.  Undersaturation experiments with NpV represent the final measurements needed to effectively model its solubility and speciation behavior in high ionic strength brine solutions of similar consistency to that of natural geological repositories.  Preliminary analysis of PuVI in varying borate solutions expose two different species of plutonium borate, a result of the ability for borate to polymerize in aqueous media.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	This dissertation is the collective work of three projects in two different topic areas.  The work is presented in chronological order of experiment and publication.  Chapter four and five review the effects in structure and bonding in UO2(FHA)2 and Pu2(FHA)8 due to the coordination by FHA.  Chapters six and seven expose the fundamental chemistries of berkelium and its qualities in relation with its neighbors in the actinide series.  Speciation and solubility data for NpV and PuVI borate systems are discussed in chapter eight and nine.  Collectively, this work explains unique phenomena in higher valent actinide complexes, the distinct behavior of berkelium in sold-state, and the migration of NpV and PuVI.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The purpose of the study was to examine the relationship between Turkish preservice early childhood teachers’ self-efficacy beliefs and their mentor teachers’ mentoring. The study also examined related factors including the mentor teachers’ modeling, the feedback provided by the mentor teachers, the amount of time mentor teachers devoted to teaching science, and the amount of time spent teaching science by the preservice teachers.  Participating in the study was a sample of 96 Turkish preservice early childhood teachers and their mentor teachers (N=41). The data were collected at two Turkish universities during the time when the preservice teachers were completing their teaching practicum or field-experience. The Pre-Service Science Teaching Efficacy Belief Instrument (STEBI-B) was administered to the preservice teachers to measure their self-efficacy beliefs. A related instrument (STEBI-A) was also administered to the mentor teachers to measure their self-efficacy beliefs. As the preservice teachers were participating in their practical teaching experiences in kindergarten classes in Turkish public schools they completed the Science Experiences Time Tracker Record. This instrument was designed to measure the amount of time spent on science teaching and observing activities by the preservice teachers and mentors. At the conclusion of the field experiences the preservice teachers were administered the Mentoring for Effective Science Teaching (MEST) instrument. This instrument was designed to measure the preservice teachers’ perceptions of their mentoring teachers’ mentoring activities, including modeling and feedback. Correlational analyses were used to measure the relationship between the preservice and mentor teachers’ self-efficacy beliefs.  Correlational analyses were also used to measure the relationships between the preservice teachers’ self-efficacy beliefs and the amount of time they spent teaching science, the amount of time they spent observing science teaching, and their mentor teachers’ modeling and feedback. There was a statistically significant correlation between the mentor and preservice teachers’ self-efficacy beliefs. There was also a statistically significant correlation between the time spent teaching science and the preservice teachers’ self-efficacy.  Also, correlated with the preservice teachers’ self-efficacy beliefs were the measures of mentor teachers’ modeling and feedback. The correlations uncovered in this study suggest that if preservice teachers have an opportunity to see the outcomes of their teaching, and receive constructive feedback from their mentor teachers, they will probably have more confidence in their teaching, and thereby increase their self-efficacy beliefs.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to observe time use and instructional focus in the middle school beginning band and advanced band settings.  The analysis included the systematic recording of teacher behavior and student performance activities for the entire class period observed, as well as consideration of the relationship between teacher behaviors and student performance in specific instructional episodes during the class period.  All timing data was recorded using the SCRIBE (Simple Computer Recording Interface for Behavioral Evaluation) software (Duke &amp; Stammen, 2011).  Participants in included five expert middle school band directors, who were video-recorded teaching a beginning band class and an advanced band class in the same instructional day.  A total of 394.60 minutes (approximately 6 hours and 36 minutes) of rehearsal were observed; a total of 202.21 minutes were observed in the advanced band setting, and 192.39 minutes were observed in the beginning band setting.  The first layer of observation included documentation of the whole class period using six categories: 1) teacher instruction, 2) instrumental modeling, 3) group performance, 4) section performance, 5) individual performance, and 6) student verbal behavior. Time devoted to warm-up and preparatory activities (prior to literature) was also documented in this layer of observation.  The second layer of observation included documentation of the whole class period using three categories:  1) time on the podium, 2) active conducting, and 3) individualized instruction.  The third layer of observation entailed identifying rehearsal frames in which targets were identified and categorized.  Strategies identified as general music instructional strategies were documented in this layer as well.  Results of this study revealed differences in the frequency of observed behaviors between the beginning and advanced band settings, with significantly more episodes of teacher modeling, individualized instruction, and student verbal questions/responses occurring in the beginning band setting.  A significantly greater number of episodes of section performance occurred in the advanced band setting.  Teachers spent more time on the podium and actively conducting the ensemble in the advanced band setting than in the beginning band setting, and more time was used for preparatory activities (prior to literature) in the beginning band setting than in the advanced band setting.  Target categories emphasized in the beginning band setting reflected an emphasis on fundamentals and literacy, whereas the target categories in the advanced band setting reflected greater emphasis on performance-based goal achievement.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>A growing literature exists that examines the efficacy of computerized Interpretation Bias Modification interventions (IBM’s) in altering existing cognitive biases and thereby reducing symptoms associated with various forms of psychopathology (e.g., anxiety, depression, problematic anger). In the present study, a sample of 40 adults with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) were randomly assigned to receive eight sessions of either an IBM targeting hostile interpretation bias (IBM-H) or a healthy video control (HVC) condition.  We found that, compared to those in the HVC group, participants in the IBM-H group reported greater positive interpretation bias and lower hostile interpretation bias at post-treatment. However, there was no difference in depressive interpretation bias between groups at post-treatment. IBM-H also led to higher reported capacity for outward anger control at post-treatment and follow-up compared to HVC.  Additionally, among those without interpersonal violence PTSD at baseline, IBM-H led to lower trait anger at post-treatment than HVC; no effect of condition on trait anger was found for individuals who met for interpersonal violence PTSD.  Surprisingly, an interaction was found such that, at high levels of pre-treatment depression, those in the IBM-H condition reported higher depression scores at follow-up than those in HVC; at low levels of pre-treatment depression, the effect of treatment was trending in the opposite direction. The IBM-H group also perceived their treatment as less credible than the HVC group. For individuals with high expectancy of treatment success, IBM-H led to lower post-treatment depressive symptoms compared to HVC; a trend was found demonstrating the opposite among those with low expectancy of treatment success. Overall, the findings point to boundary conditions for the efficacy of IBM protocols for anger and depression and potential improvements to be made to future IBM protocols. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Superconductivity is a phenomenon characterized by two hallmark properties, zero electrical resistance and the Meissner effect. These properties give great promise to a new generation of resistance free electronics and powerful superconducting magnets. However this possibility is limited by the extremely low critical temperature the superconductors must operate under, typically close to 0K. The recent discovery of high temperature superconductors has brought the critical temperature closer to room temperature than ever before, making the realization of room temperature superconductivity a possibility.  Simulations of superconducting technology and materials will be necessary to usher in the new wave of superconducting electronics. Unfortunately these new materials come with new properties such as effects from multiple electron bands, as is the case for magnesium diboride. Moreover, we must consider that all high temperature superconductors are of a Type II variety, which possess magnetic tubes of flux, known as vortices. These vortices interact with transport currents, creating an electrical resistance through a process known as flux flow. Thankfully this process can be prevented by placing impurities in the superconductor, pinning the vortices, making vortex pinning a necessary aspect of our model. At this time there are no other models or simulations that are aimed at modeling vortex pinning, using impurities, in two-band materials. In this work we modify an existing Ginzburg-Landau model for two-band superconductors and add the ability to model normal inclusions (impurities) with a new approach which is unique to the two-band model. Simulations in an attempt to model the material magnesium diboride are also presented. In particular simulations of vortex pinning and transport currents are shown using the modified model. The qualitative properties of magnesium diboride are used to validate the model and its simulations. One main goal from the computational end of the simulations is to enlarge the domain size to produce more realistic simulations that avoid boundary pinning effects. In this work we also implement the numerical software library Trilinos in order to parallelize the simulation to enlarge the domain size. Decoupling methods are also investigated with a goal of enlarging the domain size as well. The One-Band Ginzburg-Landau model serves as a prototypical problem in this endeavor and the methods shown that enlarge the domain size can be easily implemented in the two-band model.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The dissertation investigates what forms the relationship between collaboration risks and collaborative action takes and what patterns of collaborative action emerge, to what extent of political homophily affects the pattern of networked arrangement, and of what type embeddedness relieves the risk from collective action and what types of embeddedness is effective. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The first essay elaborates the concept of collaboration risk and measures collaboration risk in an emergency management context to investigate the relations between perceived collaboration risks and network structure and to test a hypothesized non-linear form for this relation. Using an Institutional Collective Action (ICA) framework, the study discusses three dimensions of collaborative risk derived from coordination, division, and defection risk and measures these by means of a structured-survey of 69 organizations in the Seoul Metropolitan Area, South Korea. The results of a fractional polynomial regression model show that the perceived level of collaboration risk has an inverse U-curve relation with the number of collaborative ties forged by organizations. These findings imply that organizations’ perceived collaboration risk beyond a threshold point motivates the termination of former ineffective arrangements. At the same time, the collaboration with other participants increases to a specific level of collaboration risk.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The second essay examines the extent to which homophily between political actors, such as elected officials and council members, occurring at the local level, affects patterns of interorganizational collaborations in an emergency response situation. While the current field of emergency management has focused on implementation-oriented arrangements among the key stakeholders, few have systemically investigated the creation and development of interorganizational collaborations led by political actors, especially following catastrophic events. By utilizing Quadric Assignment Procedure logistic regression models with the 2015 Seoul Emergency Management datasets, evidence that political homophily has a positive effect on facilitating interorganizational collaboration regarding emergency management has been found. The analysis reveals that a dyadic tie with political homophily boosts local responders’ forging of ties with other agencies during emergencies. The findings imply that political solidarity, formulated by mayors and council members, can broaden the scope of interorganizational collaboration with other critical actors, such as local agencies and nonprofit organizations, by mitigating institutional collective action problems at the local level.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The third essay investigates the effects of embeddedness, defined as a property of interdependent relations in which organizations are integrated into a network, on the level of collaboration risk emerging from relational uncertainty. A case of emergency management including interorganizational collaboration is used as a lens through which to understand to the role of embeddedness in disaster networks to extend the knowledge of collaboration risk within an institutional collective action framework. Despite efforts to understand the structural effects on network governance, the risk embedded in collaborative arrangements has yet to be systematically explored. By modeling OLS analyses of 69 organizations engaged in emergency management operations in the Seoul metropolitan area, South Korea, I hypothesized and tested the effects of relational and structural embeddedness on the level of collaboration risk that an organization perceives. The results show that both structural and relational embeddedness facilitate organizations to mitigate perceived collaboration risk, implying that reachability secures relief from relational risk and that a commitment relationship binds the participants more tightly.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Head-Toes-Knees-Shoulders task (HTKS; Ponitz, McClelland, Matthews, &amp; Morrison, 2009) is a commonly used measure of executive functioning (EF) designed for use with young children. Consistent with the larger literature demonstrating significant relations between EF skills and important developmental outcomes, substantial associations between the HTKS task and reading comprehension, vocabulary, letter and word identification, phonological awareness, and mathematics skills have consistently been reported. Scores on the HTKS task are also consistently associated with behavioral outcomes and other performance- and report-based measures of EF skills. Although the HTKS task is a useful measure of EF for young children, the original version of the HTKS task has a number of limitations. Included among these limitations are consistently reported ceiling effects toward the end of kindergarten, potential motivational issues with older children, and the possibility of errors in administration and scoring using live administration of the task. Lonigan (2013) developed a computerized version of the HTKS task as a means of addressing potential problems associated with near-ceiling performance and motivational issues. The goal of this study was to examine the construct and convergent validity of the computerized version of the HTKS task with important developmental outcomes, to determine its utility as a measure of EF for use with young children. It was hypothesized that the computerized version of the HTKS task would provide an equivalent, if not better, measure of EF in young children as the original HTKS task. In the current study, 130 preschool-aged children were administered both versions of the HTKS as well as a battery of performance-based EF tasks and measures of pre-literacy and mathematics skills. Parents and teachers completed report-based measures of externalizing behaviors. Findings from this study indicated that the computerized version of the HTKS task offered a valid measure of EF, equivalent to that of the original HTKS task, for use with preschool-aged children. Furthermore, the computerized version of the HTKS task offered the added benefits of standardized administration, more accurate scoring of self-corrected responses, and the capability of response-latency in addition to accuracy scoring.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Electron microscopy is an important technique for observing macromolecular structures, such as DNA and viruses, which would be too small to see under light microscopy. This type of microscopy utilizes electrons as its illumination source, produced by an electron gun, to generate an image of the specimen which is captured by either a charged coupled device (CCD) or direct electron detector (DED) camera. Specimens in electron microscopy can either be stained with heavy atom, embedded in plastic, or embedded in vitrified ice. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) embeds specimens in a vitreous ice layer that resembles the specimen’s natural environment and increases the overall resolution of the specimen. In conjunction with cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), cryo-EM specimens can be tilted on a specimen holder to collect multiple 2D views in order to generate a 3D reconstruction through a weighted back-projection algorithm. The projections are first corrected to counter the effects of contrast transfer function (CTF), which can filter out high resolution information. The resulting tomogram undergoes cycles of image processing steps such as multivariate data analysis, classification, and subvolume averaging to bring out the features of the specimen.            </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>At the borders of the striated muscle sarcomere, there exists an electron dense structure called the Z-Disc. The arrangement of thin filaments in the Z-Disc differs between vertebrates and invertebrates. Z-Discs of vertebrates have a tetragonal lattice that contrasts with the hexagonal lattice seen in the A-Band, which might be caused by arrangement of an elastic protein named Titin from the A-Band to the Z-Disc. The tetragonal lattice in the vertebrate Z-Disc has two structural states, small-square and basket-weave, depending on the contraction state of the muscle. Invertebrate Z-Discs have a hexagonal lattice that contains five connecting densities that form large and small solvent channels. Z-Discs contain many proteins that are important for structural stability and signaling functions. Three Z-Disc proteins that are structurally important in invertebrate Z-Discs are α-actinin, an actin crosslinker, Kettin and Projectin, the latter being components of the elastic connecting filament.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Alternative Z-Disc isolation methods were explored using Wild-type (WT) Drosophila and Sls-RNAi knockdown Drosophila for the possibility of using the specimens for cryo-EM. The insect flight muscle (IFM) was dissected from the thorax of WT Drosophila and the individual myofibrils were obtained through a homogenization and cleaning process. The Z-Discs were isolated from the myofibrils by exposing them to high salt buffers, to remove thick filaments, and gelsolin, to remove thin filaments. The isolated Z-Discs were negatively stained and observed under an electron microscope. The lattice arrangement of the thin filaments could not be seen due to the stain, but this method produced many Z-Discs on the EM grids. Cryo-EM samples of the isolated WT Drosophila Z-Discs could not be obtained due to problems pertaining to the plunge freezing method. Sls-RNAi Drosophila was obtained using the GAL4/UAS method to generate smaller Z-Discs and decrease the width of the myofibrils due to a decrease in the presence of Kettin. The IFM was extracted from the thorax, but the myofibrils were not exposed to high salt buffers and gelsolin. Under negative stain, the myofibrils observed produced Z-Discs about 500 nm in width, which is ideal for cryo-ET conditions. However, a width of 200-300 nm would produce higher resolution images for a 3D reconstruction. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A cryo-EM 3D reconstruction was generated from isolated Lethocerus Z-Discs to confirm the structural features seen in plastic-embedded sections of Apis. Projections for cryo-ET were collected using a DED camera and underwent CTF correction. The tilt series images were coarse-aligned and went through cycles of refinement using an Appion-based database with Protomo. A 3D reconstruction was generated using a weighted back-projection algorithm, filtered to bring out structural features (subvolumes), and then the subvolumes were averaged through single- and multi-reference alignment. The results were visualized in CHIMERA which confirmed the hexagonal lattice arrangement of thin filaments as reported previously in Apis Z-Discs. The location of connecting densities, C1 and C2, were confirmed as forming apices and bases of the large solvent channel, while C3 and C5 were confirmed to be connecting thin filaments of opposite orientation at the tapered end of the small solvent channel. C4 connecting density/three-wheel spoke was seen linking the ends of three thin filaments in the same orientation that form the small solvent channel. C1 and C2 were proposed to contain α-actinin, especially in C2 where an atomic model of F-actin with CH1 domains closely interacted with an atomic model of α-actinin in the C2 density map. The results of this experiment confirmed what was currently known about the invertebrate Z-Disc structure, but the locations of Z-Disc proteins, Kettin and Projectin, are yet to be determined.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>With the development of ionization techniques such as electrospray ionization (ESI) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI), mass spectrometry expands its subject of study from small volatile molecules to non-volatile macromolecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and other biomolecules. Advancement in the mass analyzer in terms of mass resolving power and mass accuracy further enables mass spectrometry to study highly complexed biological samples and therefore becomes an indispensable tool for many biological applications. Among them, structure biology focuses on elucidating the higher order structures of biomacromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids, because the structures of these molecules are usually closely related to their biological functions. When high-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS) is combined with solution phase hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HDX), it becomes a powerful tool for investigating protein structures and conformational changes induced by protein-protein, or protein-ligand interactions. HDX-MS becomes a powerful technique for structural biology and can complement traditional tools such as X-ray crystallography, NMR, and cryo-EM to answer biological questions. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In Chapter 2, back exchange level for our current HDX-MS system is evaluated. Back exchange is the major problem for many HDX-MS systems. This chapter describes the experiments performed to identify the sources of back exchange and to test one possible way to reduce it. Heated metal capillary with different temperatures are tested, and the results show back exchange is not related to the capillary temperature, but rather the length of retention time. A shorter gradient is proposed and tested and exhibit less back exchange. Subzero column temperature is also tested as a possible approach to reduce back exchange. Subzero temperatures -5 C, -8 C, and -9 C are tested, and the results show back exchange level decreases as the temperature decreases. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter 3 describes the investigation on the assembly of the assimilatory NADPH-sulfite reductase (SiR), which is a structurally complex oxidoreductase that catalyzes the six-electron reduction of sulfite to organic sulfide. SiR is composed of two subunits, a flavin-binding flavoprotein (SiRFP) and an iron-containing hemoprotein (SiRHP). By use of hydrogen/deuterium exchange and biochemical analysis, SiR holoenzyme is shown to assemble through the N-terminus of SiRHP and the NADPH-binding domain of SiRFP. A novel form of the hemoprotein that occurs in the absence of its cofactors is also discovered. Apo-SiRHP forms a homotetramer, also dependent on its N-terminus that is unable to assemble with SiRFP. From these results, it is proposed that homo tetramerization of apo-SiRHP serves as a quality control mechanism to prevent the formation of inactive holoenzyme in the case of limiting cellular siroheme.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter 4 describes the investigation conducted on the archaeal MCM helicase for understanding its structural and mechanistic aspects of DNA unwinding. Although interactions of the encircled DNA strand within the central channel provide an accepted mode for translocation, interactions with the excluded strand on the exterior surface have mostly been ignored with regard to DNA unwinding. By applying HDX monitored by FT-ICR, binding sites for ssDNA is revealed, using multiple substrates targeting both the encircled and excluded strand interactions. Interacting residues on both the interior and exterior of SsoMCM are identified. Based on identified contacts, positively charged residues within the external waist region were mutated and shown to generally lower DNA unwinding without negatively affecting the ATP hydrolysis. The combined data globally identifies binding sites for ssDNA during SsoMCM unwinding.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter 5 is focused on AIMP3/P18-LmnA interaction. Recent reports reveal AIMP3 specifically mediates degradation of mature Lamin A (LmnA), a major component of the nuclear envelope matrix. HDX experiments for AIMP3 and LmnA C-terminus are conducted, and the results show that the AIMP3-LmnA interaction involves one of the two putative binding sites and an adjacent novel interface on AIMP3, and LmnA binds AIMP3 via its extreme C-terminus. Together these findings provide a structural insight for understanding the interaction between AIMP3 and LmnA in AIMP3-induced LmnA degradation.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In Chapter 6, lysyl-tRNA synthetase (KRS) binding to the 67-kDa laminin receptor (67LR) is elucidated. 67LR is a membrane protein that promotes cell migration by inducing laminin-dependent degradation of extracellular matrix in cancer metastasis. Lysyl-tRNA synthetase (KRS) is normally associated with gene translation, and a recent study revealed its novel functions associated with 67LR-dependent cell migration and metastasis. In this HDX-based study, the binding surfaces between KRS and 37LRP are identified, and the conformational changes occur during their translocation from cytosol to the cell membrane. These results provide important insights into the KRS-37LRP interaction and pave the way for designing anti-metastasis therapeutics targeting this interaction.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Two compositions, Robert Beaser’s Mountain Songs and Lowell Liebermann’s Sonata for Flute and Guitar, will be analyzed in detail in separate chapters. Other works to be discussed include Joan Tower’s Snow Dreams, Katherine Hoover’s Canyon Echoes, Libby Larsen’s Blue Third Pieces, and George Rochberg’s Muse of Fire. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	American composers have significantly contributed to the body of literature for the flute and guitar. Furthermore, the compositions in this study have contributed to a trend an equal distribution of thematic material between the flute and guitar. Although current research shows this trend began in the late 1980s with the appearance of Astor Piazzolla’s Histoire du Tango for flute and guitar in 1986, this treatise points to pieces written prior to this time. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The primary goal of this study is to bring awareness to late twentieth century American flute and guitar compositions. The pieces highlighted are colorful examples of American composers’ contribution to the rise of the flute and guitar duo in the late twentieth century. Perhaps the most important conclusion, however, is that the flute and guitar duo has, and continues to be, a credible chamber group with a diverse, exciting repertoire for its performers.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>With the increase in incarceration rates starting in the 1980s, scholars are beginning to examine the unintended consequences of incarceration on families. While much attention has been given to effects of parental incarceration on child delinquency and criminal justice system involvement, far less attention has been given to child health outcomes over the life course. This study utilizes the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) and latent growth curve analysis to examine the effects of parental incarceration on specific health related outcomes and overall health in adolescence and young adulthood, taking the gender of the child and the timing of parental incarceration into consideration. Findings suggest that parental incarceration negatively impacts specific health related outcomes, though these effects manifest differently for men and women. Overall, parental incarceration negatively impacts self-rated health, suggesting that while the mechanisms or pathways that parental incarceration works through may differ for men and women, the result is poorer global or overall health for both groups. Timing of parental incarceration is also important, with those experiencing parental incarceration in early childhood (between ages 0 and 5) showing the most consistently negative outcomes.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this study, I examined group differences in performance between video game players (VGPs) and non-video game players (NVGPs) on the complex learning task “Space Fortress”. The primary goal of this investigation was to identify transfer from previous video game experiences and training on differing versions of the target task as well as the significant predictors of increased Space Fortress performance that may explain VGP/NVGP differences. Forty VGPs who reported playing video games for over 10 hours per week and 40 NVGPs who reported fewer than 1 hour of video game play were recruited from a community in the southeastern United States. Twenty of each group were assigned to play the 10 three-minute games of the traditional joystick version of Space Fortress first, and 20 were assigned to play 10 three-minute games of the keyboard version first; followed by 10 three-minute games of the alternate controller type. After receiving game instructions, all players were evaluated on their rule-knowledge before playing Space Fortress. After completing the two 30-minute blocks of Space Fortress, players were given a questionnaire about their video game experiences.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Large differences in attained videogame scores between VGPs and NVGPs were discovered (Cohen’s d = 0.87). There was a reliable 3-way interaction between controller type and task order F (1, 836.55) = 5.13, p &lt; 0.05. The VGP advantage was largest on the keyboard version of the task when they received the keyboard task first, suggesting that gamers could be scaffolding their skills when presented with a familiar controller first. While the VGP advantage was not large at the initial presentation of the task, VGPs improved significantly faster than NVGPs, especially on the keyboard version of the task.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Once these skill differences were identified, I conducted post-hoc analyses to specify the areas of greatest advantages. In addition to an analysis of the game-produced subscores which suggested differences in priorities throughout training, I examined differences in performance on a Space Fortress rules quiz. There were significant differences in performance between VGPs and NVGPs on quiz performance, t (78) = -2.85; p &lt; .01. Regression analyses revealed robust effects of quiz performance on Space Fortress scores, t (73) = 4.39, p &lt; .001, effects that were similar in magnitude of the VGP effects but did not appear to mediate the VGP/NVGP differences on Space Fortress performance.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	There were also large differences between VGPs and NVGPs (Cohen’s ds between 0.86 to 1.91) on the types of video game activities they had engaged in, these differences were found to be unrelated to Space Fortress performance when controlling for other critical factors. I also discuss the potential effects of gender and other variables on Space Fortress performance.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	In conclusion, I found that there are robust differences between VGPs and NVGPs on Space Fortress performance. However, these differences are highly related to the controller used, which controller is trained first, and by shifts in how VGPs prioritized aspects of the game. The transfer differences between conditions, especially for gamers, suggests that there are significant effects of prior experience and knowledge in the acquisition of a new cognitive skill, but these differences are difficult to describe given the large qualitative differences in the types of experiences that VGPs have cultivated. Future studies should analyze verbal reports and other process tracing data to better understand the specific nature of the mediating mechanisms and carefully design experimental manipulations to interfere with the acquired cognitive mechanisms, thus completing the last step in the expert-performance approach, and paving the way for a better understanding of how the approach can be used to better describe early skill acquisition.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Nanomaterials are small structures that have at least one dimension less than ~100 nanometers. Depending on the number of dimensions that are not confined to the nanoscale range, nanomaterials can be classified into 0D, 1D and 2D types. Due to their small sizes, nanoparticles possess exceptional physical and chemical properties which opens a unique possibility for the next generation of strain sensors that are cheap, multifunctional, high sensitivity and reliability. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Over the years, thanks to the development of new nanomaterials and the printing technologies, a number of printing techniques have been developed to fabricate a wide range of electronic devices on diverse substrates. Nanomaterials based thin film devices can be readily patterned and fabricated in a variety of ways, including printing, spraying and laser direct writing. In this work, we review the piezoresistivity of nanomaterials of different categories and study various printing approaches to utilize their excellent properties in the fabrication of scalable and printable thin film strain gauges. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>CNT-AgNP composite thin films were fabricated using a solution based screen printing process. By controlling the concentration ratio of CNTs to AgNPs in the nanocomposites and the supporting substrates, we were able to engineer the crack formation to achieve stable and high sensitivity sensors. The crack formation in the composite films lead to piezoresistive sensors with high GFs up to 221.2. Also, with a simple, low cost, and easy to scale up fabrication process they may find use as an alternative to traditional strain sensors.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>By using computer controlled spray coating system, we can achieve uniform and high quality CNTs thin films for the fabrication of strain sensors and transparent / flexible electrodes. A simple diazonium salt treatment of the pristine SWCNT thin film has been identified to be efficient in greatly enhancing the piezoresistive sensitivity of SWCNT thin film based piezoresistive sensors. The coupled mechanical stretching and Raman band shift characterization provides strong evidence to support this point of view. The same approach should be applicable to other types of carbon based strain sensors for improving their sensitivity. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The direct laser writing (DLW) method has been used for producing flexible piezoresistive sensor and sensor arrays on polyimide film substrates. The effect of CO2 laser irradiation conditions on the morphology, chemical composition and piezoresistivity of the formed graphitic line features were systematically studied to establish the related processing-structure-property relationship. The DLW generated sensors have been demonstrated for their use as strain gauges for structural health monitoring of polymeric composites, and as flexible and wearable sensors of gesture recognition for human-machine interactions. The versatility of the DLW technique demonstrated in this work can be highly valuable in different industrial sectors for developing customized flexible electronics.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In the past 30 years, scholars have explored the role that individual goods played in the organization of Late Bronze Age (LBA) political economies in Greece. The goods that are studied, however, are typically wealth items like perfumed oil. This dissertation presents a new view of Mycenaean economic structures by introducing evidence from cooking ware vessels. Despite their ubiquitous nature, cooking ware vessels are often overlooked by classical archaeologists because they lack the visual appeal that is characteristic of decorated fine ware vessels. Previous scholarship on the topic of Mycenaean cooking wares is rare, though the work of scholars such as Julie Hruby and Bartlomiej Lis have made great strides in aiding our understanding of these vessels. This dissertation serves as a remedy for the scarcity of studies on cooking ware vessels and their significance in interpreting the political economies of Late Helladic (LH) Greece. In particular, I focus on identifying the scope of palatial involvement that existed in the production, distribution, and consumption of Mycenaean cooking pots throughout the Argolid and Corinthia.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In order to investigate the importance of cooking ware vessels in Mycenaean Greece I develop a conceptual framework that implements scientific analyses. This directly challenges the assumption that all cooking ware vessels were utilitarian goods and, therefore, must have been produced by small-scale, independent workshops. To form my model I use theoretical constructs established by Cathy Costin and Michael Galaty. These two scholars closely analyzed the characteristics of different contexts of production, such as independent and attached workshops. My own model considers these hypotheses and builds upon them, using several variables to determine how Mycenaean cooking ware vessels functioned in the political economy. These variables include vessels’ use, the source of clay or rock fragments found within the vessels’ fabrics, and the quantities of cooking vessels found at the site.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Throughout this dissertation I examine the diachronic patterns of production and exchange of cooking ware vessels at five LBA sites in the Argolid and Corinthia: Kalamianos, the East Alley deposit at Korakou, Petsas House at Mycenae, Stiri, and the ``Potter's Shop'' at Zygouries. This includes analyzing the chronological and geographical distribution of specific cooking ware vessel fabrics and identifying specific production techniques. These five sites represent different periods of occupation (short- to long-term), sizes of assemblages (from small, domestic quantities to large stockpiles of ceramics), and types of study (survey and excavation).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Patterns and trends are identified using stylistic, macroscopic, petrographic, and chemical analyses on cooking ware. Stylistic studies of vessels made with this ware type are uncommon, and in this dissertation I seek to develop a typology of shapes to encourage future study of these vessels. Macroscopic analysis considers the aspects of cooking ware that can be recognized with the naked eye, assisting in identifications made in museums and in the field. Petrographic and chemical analyses (specifically Neutron Activation Analysis) were used in order to refine the information assembled through macroscopic study. The results of these analyses are then applied to my theoretical model in order to identify the form of production and exchange of cooking ware vessels, in particular whether a workshop was attached to a palace or elite group and if redistribution was a mode of exchange for these goods. This type of comprehensive, interdisciplinary, and multi-step approach to these vessels is rare among Mycenaean cooking ware vessel studies. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Using the conceptual framework that I developed for this project, I was able to conclude that the fabric, shape, and use of cooking ware vessels are, in fact, important indicators of different economic and political situations in Mycenaean Greece, especially when such vessels are used in elite feasting events. I argue that these vessels were transformed into politically charged goods when they were used in such occasions, which are important events that serve a pivotal role in creating social and political alliances, conveying relationships of indebtedness, and generating wealth, prestige, and power. Through this study it is apparent large quantities of specialized cooking vessels attest to the interest elites had in acquiring these vessels (perhaps through taxation methods, rather than redistribution). These institutions, however, were not concerned with controlling their production. Furthermore, I argue that my model serves as an effective method for reaching these conclusions, emphasizing the potential cooking ware vessels have for identifying the strategies used by elite members of Mycenaean society as they gained and maintained control over their political, economic, and social world.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are considered as a novel candidate for cell therapy due to the differentiation potential, migration ability, and secretion function.  Late stage clinical trials require a large amount of cells that the conventional planar culture is not able to provide.  Bioreactors were developed for better performance on hMSC expansion at a large.  This study demonstrated the potential capacity of two types of bioreactors, microcarrier bioreactor and fibrous-bed bioreactor, for hMSC expansion, based on the cell growth, glucose and lactate consumption, cell distribution, and characterization.  Our result suggested that bioreactors can be used as the ameliorate approach to replace traditional planar culture, especially for large-scale expansion of hMSCs.  In addition to the cell quantity, successful transplantation also requires the high quality.  Thus, our following study attempted to enhance hMSC function in cell therapy via 3D aggregation.  Cell-cell adhesion and cytoskeleton reorganization are primarily responsible for the aggregation process.  In this current study, hMSCs therapeutic enhancement was observed after aggregation for 48 hours.  Moreover, cytoskeleton regulators, including nocodazole, cytochalasin D, LPA, and Y27632, indeed impacted aggregate compaction, but not viability and therapeutic enhancement.  Caspase-dependent therapeutic enhancement in aggregates was proved by the presence of caspase inhibitor that was valid to rescue cell death and reduce enhanced therapeutic function.  To meet the clinical relevant number with enhanced function, scalable production of hMSC aggregates is necessary.  Here, a wave motion system was investigated to manufacture hMSC aggregates with controllable size at large scale.  Seeing that aggregates are formed by cell-cell collision, aggregate size was influenced by the cell seeding density, cultivation time, rocking angle and rocking speed.  Two-variable linear regression recommended that rocking motion-induced shear stress is reversible to the aggregate size.  Also, CFD estimated shear stress in the wave motion system is very low to increase aggregate formation.  Functional enhancement from the wave motion-manufactured hMSC aggregates was confirmed.  Overall, our studies provide the capacity of bioreactors to reach sufficient cell quantity and improve therapeutic function by aggregation in a wave motion system.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this dissertation, we introduce a new approach in building a hybrid nuclear model that combines some existing theoretical models and a \universal" approximator. The goal of such an approach is to obtain new predictions of nuclear masses and charge radii. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We begin our study by investigating nuclear masses based on theoretical and experimental values. Nuclear masses are essential for astrophysical applications, such as r-process nucleosynthesis</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>and neutron-star structure. To overcome the intrinsic limitations of the existing ``state-of-the-art" mass models, a renement is generated based on a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) formalism. A novel BNN approach is applied with the aim of optimizing mass residuals between theory and experiment. A signicant improvement (of about 40%) in the mass predictions of existing models is obtained after BNN renement. Moreover, these improved results are  accompanied by proper statistical errors. By constructing a \world average" of these predictions, we obtained a unied mass model that is used to predict the composition of the outer crust of a neutron star.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In order to get a better description of nuclear structure, a similar procedure is also implemented in the nuclear charge radius. A class of relativistic energy density functionals is used to provide robust predictions for nuclear charge radii. In turn, these predictions are rened through the BNN approach to generate predictions for the charge radii of thousands of nuclei throughout the nuclear chart. The neural networks function is trained using charge radii residuals between theoretical predictions and experimental data. Although the predictions obtained with density functional theory provide a fairly good description of the experiment, our results show signicant improvement</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>(better than 40%) after BNN renement. Despite the improvement and robust predictions, we failed to uncover the underlying physics behind the intriguing behavior of charge radii along the calcium isotopic chain.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Overall, we have successfully demonstrated the ability of the BNN approach to signicantly increase the accuracy of nuclear models in the predictions of nuclear masses and charge radii. Extension to other nuclear observables is a natural next step in asserting the eectiveness of the BNN method in nuclear physics.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Inhibitory control, the ability to resist of modulate impulses, is hypothesized to reflect an individual difference dimension of inhibition-disinhibition with important clinical implications. Poor impulse control (disinhibition) is a hallmark feature of antisocial and substance use disorders and is a risk factor for physical and other mental health problems including self-harm and suicide. Recent initiatives in the field call for a shift away from categorical conceptions of mental health and illness towards processes oriented descriptions with clearer referents to neurobiology. However, a number of roadblocks exist in incorporating measurement of neurobiology in the assessment of clinical problems. The psychoneurometric approach is well suited to address such roadblocks by providing an integrative framework for bridging across different measurement domains in the assessment of mental health phenomena. The current study further advances an integrative (psychoneurometric) assessment of inhibition-disinhibition through the use of carefully selected self-report psychometric scales, behavioral performance measures from laboratory inhibitory control tasks, and indicators of neurophysiological functioning. As predicted, variables from each measurement domain cohered together to form domain-specific factors. Further, a three-factor model with one higher-order factor was fit to the data, with the higher-order psychoneurometric factor reflecting the variance in common among domain-specific inhibition-disinhibition factors. The psychoneurometric operationalization of inhibition-disinhibition effectively predicted impulse control problems (Median r =.27), at levels exceeding behavioral or brain factors (Median rs = -.10 and -.21, respectively). Implications of a new, cross-domain conception of inhibitory control capacity as a referent for research on neurobiological mechanisms and clinical problems associated with poor inhibitory control will be discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The aim of this work is to develop a deeper understanding of the nuances involved in designing and optimizing the performance of gas/liquid plasma reactors for chemical synthesis.  The design of such reactors requires integrating knowledge from a number of scientific disciplines including mechanical engineering (reactor construction), electrical engineering (power network design and electrical diagnostics), physics (plasma formation and diagnostics), chemical engineering, (reactor design, transport phenomena / modeling), and chemistry (chemical analysis).  Due to the complicated nature of such a multidisciplinary study, complete analysis of a single reactor system is difficult and rarely performed with accuracy, especially for a variety of operating conditions.  In this work, a novel continuously flowing liquid film plasma reactor was developed and fully characterized under the above criteria for a range of operating conditions in order to better understand which variables most significantly impact the generation of hydrogen peroxide from pure water and argon gas.  This work shows that increases in the energy yield for hydrogen peroxide with pulsed plasma discharge is possible by variation of the plasma properties to reduce the amount of “wasted” energy which does not contribute to desired chemical reactions.  In addition, increases in the production rate of hydrogen peroxide without a loss in energy yield is shown to be possible by increasing the pulse frequency while simultaneously decreasing the gas phase residence time.  The high concentration of hydroxyl radicals produced by this system was also used to partially oxidize simple organic compounds into higher value products.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Interfacing inorganic nanoparticles with biological systems to develop a variety of novel imaging, sensing and diagnostic tools has generated great interest and much activity over the past two decades. However, the effectiveness of this approach hinges on the ability to prepare water dispersible nanoparticles, with compact size and long term colloidal stability in biological environments, and the development of controlled conjugation to various biomolecules. The primary focus of this dissertation is the design and synthesis, characterization and use of a series of new multidentate and multifunctional coordinating polymers as ligands that render various inorganic nanocrystals water soluble, with emphasis on: i) how to improve the colloidal stability, ii) how to design compact coating, iii) how to engineer the nanoparticle surface with tunable functionalities to achieve  bioconjugation, and iv) how to develop the resulting nanoprobes into biological sensing and imaging. This dissertation is organized as follows:</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>       In Chapter 1 we introduce the basic physical properties of quantum dots (QDs), gold nanocrystals and magnetic nanocrystals along with brief description of their syntheses. We then provide an overview of surface functionalization strategies and recent progress in the ligand chemistry, followed by highlights of a few conjugation approaches applied to nanoparticles in biology. We then discuss modulation of the optical and spectroscopic properties of QDs via energy and charge transfer interactions. We conclude by presenting a few related examples on the incorporation of QD-conjugates into sensor design and intracellular imaging.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>       In Chapter 2, we report the design of a series of multifunctional polymers as ligands for surface engineering of QDs and facilitating their use in bioconjugation. This Chapter includes three sections: </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>•	First, we introduce a novel PEGylated polymer that combines the synergies of metal-chelation promoted by lipoic acid and imidazole groups, as effective coating for the surface functionalization of QDs; one of the goals was to address the problems associated with thiol oxidation and weak imidazole affinity. We detail the ligand synthesis via the highly efficient, one-step nucleophilic addition reaction between a central poly(isobutylene-alt-maleic anhydride) chain (as a scaffold) and several distinct but complementary amine-presenting functionalities. We then demonstrate the use of in situ phase transfer of hydrophobic QDs into water mediated by a mild photoligation strategy under borohydride-free conditions. Ligation with these polymers provides QDs with excellent colloidal stability over a wide range of conditions; this improves on what has been reached using coating with ligands presenting lower coordination of thiol only or imidazole only. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>•	Second, to minimize the hydrodynamic radius of the QDs without sacrificing aqueous solubility, a set of polymer ligands appended with zwitterion and imidazole motifs have been synthesized applied for the surface engineering of QDs. By using zwitterion as the hydrophilic block, this design provides QDs with a thin coating and very compact overall dimension; this has, for example, allowed the self-assembly of QDs with polyhistidine-tagged proteins via metal−histidine coordination. We further show that the assembled QD-dopamine conjugates can be used to detect iron ions and amino acid cysteine through charge-transfer interactions. Finally, we demonstrate that QDs ligand exchanged with folic acid-functionalized ligand are capable of targeting cancerous cells. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>•	Third, modulation of the nanoparticle’s interaction with biological systems requires access to an effective conjugation of these materials with bioactive targets in a controlled manner. To fulfill this goal, we have developed several zwitterion-based multifunctional ligands presenting tunable functional groups, including carboxyl, amine, azide and biotin. This has allowed conjugation of the QDs to biomolecules via bio-orthogonal coupling chemistries, including (1) amine-isothiocyanate reaction; (2) biotin-streptavidin self-assembly; (3) copper-free click chemistry. The resulted QD-bioconjugates have been tested in sensor design and for cell imaging. We also find that the efficiency of polyhistidine-mediated metal coordination is not only determined by the ligand lateral extension but also greatly influenced by the nature of metal coordination on the QDs.     </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In Chapter 3, we have applied the various multi-coordinating and multi-reactive polymers, in particular, those presenting lipoic acid and PEG for the functionalization of gold nanoparticles and nanorods. Gold nanocrystals coated with this polymer exhibit excellent long-term colloidal stability over a broad range of conditions, and furthermore prevent the formation of protein corona. This was verified using dynamic light scattering measurements combined with agarose gel electrophoresis. The diffusion properties of polymer-coated nanocrystals were further characterized using dynamic light scattering; this has yielded valuable information on the nature of the interparticle interactions in biological media.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>       In Chapter 4, an additional set of modular ligands were synthesized and applied for the surface modification of iron oxide nanoparticles. These ligands feature several dopamines for tight binding on iron oxide nanoparticle surface, a short PEG for water solubility and reactive groups (amine, carboxyl, azide and thiol) for bioconjugation. Nanoparticles functionalized with these polymers show extended stability in biologically relevant conditions and little to no cytotoxicity. We demonstrate that covalent attachment of dye enables producing luminescent probe for cell imaging. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>       A summary of the major contributions assembled in this dissertation along with a discussion of the future outlook is provided in Chapter 5.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>My dissertation is an attempt to produce an edition of the Latin text that may approximate what was available in early Medieval England. I have collated five manuscripts from that time period in England so as to determine the type of text that might have been used as a basis to translate Gregory's Dialogues into Old English. Someone utilizing my text may be able to evaluate where the Old English translation of Gregory's Dialogues differs from the standard critical Latin text (de Vogue's) and seek to determine which recension of the Latin text of the Dialogues might have produced those results.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>With art programs becoming more prominent in medical environments, this research seeks to investigate the way art materials are being used and perceived in these settings. Through observation of one pediatric unit and information collected from parents and nurses at this location, this qualitative evaluation aims to promote the ways in which art practices are benefiting children within hospital environments, while also considering the effect art materials may have on health professionals’ ability to perform primary medical responsibilities. Through an analysis of the data collected through observation and surveys, this research proposes the need for four guidelines for the use of art materials in pediatric medical settings: 1) giving children options rather than beginning with specific directives, 2) providing options for the location of the use of art materials, 3) investing in traditional art materials rather than digital for this population, and 4) creating plans to inform patients of their opportunities to participate in art. These principles consider the combined needs of the patients, families, structure of the hospital, and nurses to inform the development of future art practices within pediatric medical settings.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Electrophoresis as an analytical technique has made considerable contributions to the separations and analysis of macromolecules in biology-related research. Pluronic gels, which are composed of orderly packed spherical micelles assembled by tri-block copolymers, have been developed as novel sieving media to separate oligonucleotides, duplex DNA molecules and proteins, providing ease of manipulations due to their thermo-reversibility and higher resolution in comparison with other polymer gels. Electrophoretic mobility of short double-stranded DNA molecules in pluronic F127 is reported to have a non-monotonic dependence on DNA length, which is not observed in other polymer-based sieving media or explained by any well-developed theories. In this dissertation, the unusual DNA-length dependence of electrophoretic mobility is experimentally investigated in several different pluronic gels, and the DNA dynamics in pluronic liquid crystals is systematically studied by coarse-grained Brownian dynamics simulations. The crystal structures and micelle dimensions of pluronics P105, P123 and F127 are characterized by atomic force microscopy, small-angle x-ray scattering, small-angle neutron scattering and dynamic light scattering. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis is performed and the electrophoretic mobility of DNA molecules in the size range of 20-500 bp is measured in pluronics P105, P123 and F127. The unusual DNA length-dependent mobility is consistently obtained in three pluronic gels, where the mobility of very short DNA molecules increases with increasing DNA length, and the mobility of long DNA molecules monotonically decreases with DNA length. Superposed on the rising and falling trends are the subtle oscillations of mobility with DNA length in the intermediate regime. Brownian dynamics simulations are implemented to numerically calculate the DNA mobility in pluronic lattices, by including the short-ranged intra-molecular hydrodynamic interactions, and modeling the interactions between DNA molecules and pluronic micelles via a repulsive force and entanglement effect. The rise, fall and oscillations of mobility with DNA length, as obtained in experimental measurements, are reproduced by the Brownian dynamics simulations, and essential physics that dominates the unusual features of mobility is extracted from the simulations. In addition, electric field-dependent mobility of DNA molecules in pluronic lattices is studied by Brownian dynamics simulations, and the conceptual connection between high-field simulations along specific field directions and low-field experiments in bulk gels is established, and the Brownian dynamic simulations are proven to be an appropriate approach to interpret the DNA electrophoretic dynamics in pluronic matrices. Moreover, electrophoretic mobility of duplex DNA flanked by single-stranded overhangs is measured in pluronic gels, and it is shown that the mobility of DNA with overhangs is higher than the corresponding blunt-ended DNA molecules. Brownian dynamics simulations are carried out, and the enhancement of mobility for DNA with overhangs is captured by the simulations. By integrating numerical simulations with experimental measurements, the fundamental physical quantities and interactions that manipulate the DNA electrophoretic migration in pluronic liquid crystals are revealed. Understanding the unusual DNA length-dependent mobility in pluronic gels potentially provides profound insights in designing and optimizing high-performance sieving matrices for size-based separation purposes.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Digit span backward (DSB) is conventionally reified as a measure of working memory and is a commonly used measure in clinical research and practice. Extant literature in cognitive psychology has called into question its merit as a measure of working memory and instead suggests that DSB is a measure of short-term memory. Differentiating between short-term and working memory is critical given the unique relations of each system with academic and functional outcomes, as well as recent models implicating working memory in the etiology of disorders such as ADHD. This study is the first to examine the construct validity of DSB as a measure of working memory in a well-defined sample of 34 children with ADHD ages 8-13 (M=10.41, SD=1.38, 11 girls, 80% Caucasian). Bootstrapped, bias-corrected correlations indicated that traditionally-scored DSB was not significantly related with criterion measures of working memory (rrange = -.03 to .22). However, partial-credit scoring of DSB resulted in significantly higher correlations with our criterion variables (rrange = .29 to .47), particularly at high list-lengths (6, 7, or 8 to-be-recalled digits) that may have overwhelmed the short-term memory system (rrange = .28 to .58). The use of DSB as a measure of working memory has implications for both research and clinical practice.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The temporal order in which segments of the genome are duplicated is referred to as the replication timing (RT) program. RT is established in each cell cycle coincident with the repositioning and anchorage of chromosomes in early G1. In general, segments that replicate in early S are organized into transcriptionally permissive chromatin, and segments that replicate in late S are assembled into repressive chromatin. During human embryonic stem cell (hESC) differentiation, segments of the genome undergo changes in RT, which are accompanied by changes in chromatin compartments, and transcriptional activity. Determining the order these changes occur during hESC differentiation required defining cell cycle parameters for hESCs. First, we demonstrate that the fluorescence ubiquitination cell cycle indicator (Fucci) system is incapable of demarcating G1/S cell cycle transitions. Instead, we employed a combination of fluorescent PCNA to monitor S phase progression, cytokinesis to demarcate mitosis, and fluorescent nucleotides to label early and late replicating DNA and track 3D organization. We find that re-localization and anchorage of chromosomes were completed prior to the onset of S phase, even in the context of an abbreviated G1 phase. Furthermore, we find that single hESCs preferentially differentiate from G1. We show changes in RT are remarkably coincident with transcription; although, neither is sufficient for the other to occur. We also show changes in RT accompany cell commitment during the first cell cycle and precede changes in chromatin compartments. Finally, we find that in hESCs, domains that switch from early to late replication interact more frequently with late replicating chromatin, suggesting hESCs may be poised to quickly repress early to late switching domains upon stimulation.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Top-down fabrication is widely used for producing micro to nanometer scale features for biomedical applications. Opposed to bottom-up approach, it is superior to control geometry, structure and composition of the product. Traditional top-down fabrication techniques usually suffer from utility of clean room, harsh processing procedures and high cost. This dissertation is focused on developing a novel top-down fabrication technique based on soft lithography to fabricate functional microdevices and micropatterns for cell-borne drug delivery, biosensing and cell-tracking.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The first chapter overviews the major top-down fabrication methods and their applications in biomedical science, as well as introduces recent advances in cell-borne drug delivery, biosensing and cell-tracking.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The second chapter reports on the development of a novel type of particulate structures called microdevices for cell-borne drug delivery. The microdevices were fabricated by soft lithography with a disklike shape. Each microdevice was composed of a layer of biodegradable thermoplastic. One face of the thermoplastic layer was covalently grafted with a cell-adhesive polyelectrolyte such as poly-L-lysine. This asymmetric structure allowed the microdevices to bind to live cells through bulk mixing without causing cell aggregation. Moreover, the cell−microdevice complexes were largely stable, and the viability and proliferation ability of the cells were not affected by the microdevices over a week. In addition, sustained release of a mock drug from the microdevices was demonstrated. This type of microdevice promises to be clinically useful for sustained intravascular drug delivery.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The third chapter extended the work in the second chapter to fabricate enzyme-laden microdevices for cell-borne enzyme delivery. Enzymes have been used to treat various human diseases and traumas. However, therapeutic utility of free enzymes is impeded by their short circulation time, lack of targeting ability, immunogenicity, and inability to cross biological barriers. Cell-mediated drug delivery approach offers unique capability for overcoming these limitations but the traditional cell-mediated enzyme delivery techniques suffer from drawbacks such as risk of intracellular degradation of and low loading capacity for the payload enzyme. This chapter presents development of a novel cell-mediated enzyme delivery technique featured by the use of micrometer-sized disk-shaped particles termed microdevices. The microdevices are fabricated by layer-by-layer assembly and soft lithography with catalase being used as a model therapeutic enzyme. The amount of catalase in the microdevices can be controlled with number of catalase layers. Catalase in the microdevices is catalytically active and active catalase is slowly released from the microdevices. Moreover, cell-microdevice complexes are produced by attaching the catalase-laden microdevices to the external surface of both K562 cells and mouse embryonic stem cells. This technique is potentially applicable to other enzymes and cells, and promises to be clinically useful.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The fourth chapter describes fabrication of disk-shaped microdevices containing densely packed Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) for Raman labelling of macrophages. Capability to detect or track macrophages in vivo is important for developing macrophage-based therapies. Dispersed carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been used for Raman labelling of cells and a top-down approach has been developed to fabricate disk-shaped microparticles for the same application. The fabrication is featured by the use of spray coating of CNTs to produce the microdevices. Raman detection of a single microdevice at a centimeter-scale working distance and the feasibility of using chemically modified CNTs for multiplexed Raman labelling were demonstrated. Macrophages were stably labelled with the microdevices by simply adding the microdevices to cultivated macrophages. The labelling slightly reduced viability of the macrophages and the labelled macrophages retained their ability to capture foreign particles. Moreover, Raman detection of a single macrophage was demonstrated. This technique promises to be useful for detection or tracking of macrophages in vivo as well as for other biomedical applications.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The fifth chapter presents a simple strategy to construct a micrometer-sized self-referenced fluorescence sensor for detecting Cu2+. The method relies on microcontact printing of bovine serum albumin-stabilized gold nanocluster (BSA-AuNC) and poly(propyl methacrylate) (PPMA) stripes on a glass slide. The PPMA stripes are printed on the BSA-AuNC stripes to form a crossbar array, with its cell unit being composed of four distinct regions: BSA-AuNC, plain glass, PPMA, and BSA-AuNC covered by PPMA. The BSA-AuNC region is fluorescent and its fluorescence intensity is changeable upon contacting with analyte solution. The BSA-AuNC covered by PPMA is also fluorescent but insensitive to the analyte solution due to the presence of PPMA which prevents the analyte solution from contacting the BSA-AuNC. This region can thus be used as an internal reference for sensing. This self-referenced sensor is able to detect Cu2+ in a highly specific and concentration-dependent manner.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Recent years, since a large amount of electrical energy for the industrialization based on the high technology is required, many countries make preparations for replacing the non-renewable energy. Especially, a much considering the environmental problems caused by the fossil fuel and other conventional power generations, renewable energy particularly solar energy is widely used.  Whereas, with the rapid development of IT technologies, PV converter is facing many challenges, such as high efficiency, high power density, and low cost. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In order to improve the power density and efficiency of the PV system, the front-end converter has been proposed locating in the front of the PV inverter, boosting the output voltage of the PV array into a high voltage. Additionally, MPPT could be performed in this stage easily and conveniently. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>As the developing of semiconductor devices, it has been proved that SiC semiconductor device has many advantages over traditional Si device, such as ten times the dielectric breakdown field strength, three times the bandgap, and three times the thermal conductivity. Hence, if SiC device could be applied to the front-end converter of the PV system, the power density, and operating efficiency could be improved a lot. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This thesis is mainly about the design of an interleaved boost converter based on SiC device used for high power level PV system. Chapter 1 is the background about the PV system including PV market and PV system structure. As for the state-of-art of the boost converter in PV application, it is in chapter 2. In this chapter, different front-end topologies have been compared and discussed. In chapter 3, it is about how to design the interleaved boost converter involving the input inductor, DC-link capacitor, and the control strategy. At last, loss breakdown of this boost converter and the efficiency in different power have been presented in chapter4.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The research investigated the effect of aging altered driving posture on injury criteria of the head (HIC15) and chest (peak resultant chest acceleration) in low speed frontal impact. The aging altered driving postures were described in terms of body joint angles. Older drivers exhibited smaller body joint angles meaning older drivers tended to sitting closer to the steering wheels compared to their younger counterparts. A simplified anthropomorphic test dummy, sled rig, and impact pendulum were constructed as the necessary testing apparatus for the low speed frontal impact sled test experiment. A fractional factorial design screened out the significant factors that affect HIC15, and peak resultant chest acceleration. The results showed that for HIC15, torso angle, hip angle, right knee angle, right ankle angle, and seatbelt pillar loop anchor height were the significant factors. For peak resultant chest acceleration torso angle, right knee angle and left ankle angle were significant. Qualitatively, extended torso angles, meaning sitting more laid back,  increased both HIC15 and peak resultant chest acceleration. Left and right side of lower extremities altered HIC15 and peak resultant chest acceleration separately. These findings may help to better understand biomechanical response of older drivers during car accidents and provide useful information regarding safer vehicle design, such as occupant seat and seatbelt in an effort to mitigate injuries.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Most of the data encountered is bounded nonlinear data. The Universe is bounded, planets are sphere like shaped objects, and life growing on Earth comes in various shapes and colors that can hardly be represented as points on a linear space, and even if the object space they sit on is embedded in a Euclidean space, their mean vector can not be represented as a point on that object space, except for the case when such space is convex. To address this misgiving, since the mean vector is the minimizer of the expected square distance, following Fr\'echet (1948), on a compact metric space, one may consider both minimizers and maximizers of the expected square distance to a given point on the object space as mean, respectively {\bf anti-mean} of a given random point. Of all distances on a object space, one considers here the chord distance associated with an embedding of the object space, since for such distances one can give a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a unique Fr\'echet mean (respectively Fr\'echet anti-mean). For such distributions these location parameters are called extrinsic mean (respectively extrinsic anti-mean), and the corresponding sample statistics are consistent estimators of their population counterparts. Moreover one derives the limit distribution of such estimators around a mean located at a smooth extrinsic anti-mean. Extrinsic analysis is thus a general framework that allows one to run object data analysis on nonlinear object spaces that can be embedded in a numerical space. In particular one focuses on Veronese-Whitney (VW) means and anti-means of 3D projective shapes of configurations extracted from digital camera images. The 3D data extraction is greatly simplified by an RGB based algorithm followed by the Faugeras-Hartley-Gupta-Chen 3D reconstruction method. In particular one derives two sample tests for face analysis based on projective shapes, and more generally a MANOVA on manifolds method to be used in 3D projective shape analysis. The manifold based approach is also applicable to financial data analysis for exchange rates.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Extensive evidence shows that listeners use global knowledge to generate predictions of upcoming sentences themes; however, there is less investigation on how local context that semantically conflicts with long-standing global knowledge is integrated and applied in real-time sentence comprehension. Three studies used the visual world paradigm to study this question. Experiment 1 replicated previous findings that listeners typically rely on global knowledge to anticipate sentence themes. Experiment 2 suggests that adult listeners rapidly increase the weight of combinatorial evidence from local context and decrease the weight of global knowledge to anticipate the appropriate sentence theme. Experiment 3 shows that 5-8 year-old children do not overcome semantic conflict in time to generate predictions of the sentence theme. These results indicate that in the presence of semantic conflict, adult comprehenders rapidly learned to favor local context over global knowledge, but this ability appears to emerge after a child turns 8 years-old.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This dissertation examines Roman history during the first centuries BCE and CE through the lens of food. Starting at the end with an exegesis of Juvenal’s Satires, I focus on his main gastronomic stereotypes, foods that distinguish people by class. First, I evaluate the bread, the boar, and the turbot as part of Roman culture in order to determine their veracity as stereotypes. Then, by tracing the changing role of these foods from the late Republic through the early Empire, I consider Juvenal’s underlying message in their use. This method has produced some rather compelling conclusions. The successes of the plebs in acquiring and protecting the frumentatio (free grain distribution) define the history of republican politics and imperial administration. Rather than reading panem et circenses (bread and circuses) as a derogatory statement about the lack of political will among the people, I argue that Juvenal is sarcastically acknowledging the people’s victories and their prudence in avoiding frivolous aspirations. Also, the boar was the quintessential meat of Rome, largely thanks to the market subsidy of the frumentatio. Men like Juvenal’s Virro who wish to emulate the extravagant dinners of Roman cuisine but lack the will or ability to treat their guests equally find the monetization of client services a convenient excuse to practice disparity at the cena recta (formal dinner), a trend which reflects the mounting inadequacies of the institution of patronage and the increasing reliance upon currency and markets. Finally, fish metaphors in literature almost always represent excess, and Juvenal’s specific use of the turbot exemplifies the importance of size to Domitian’s, and his court’s, concept of empire. Likewise, the cenatio (dining-hall) at the Domus Flavia reflects the emperor’s appropriation of absolute authority and jurisdiction. This exploration of gastronomic stereotypes in Juvenal validates and encourages the use of food as a historical lens for detecting fundamental changes in politics, economy, society, and empire.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>At the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) at Jefferson National Laboratory (JLab), $\omega$ vector-mesons were photo-produced off a fixed, liquid-hydrogen target during the 2009 run-period via the reaction $\gamma p \rightarrow p \omega$.  The charged final-state particles from the $\omega$~resonance decays were detected by the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS).  With a combination of measurements which involved the use of time and energy-deposit counters as well as reconstructed drift chamber (DC) tracks, the 4-momenta and vertices of the initial- and charged final-state particles were determined.  Subsequent to reconstruction, event selection, kinematic fitting, signal and background separation, and detector efficiency simulation of the data for the three-pion final-state, i.e. $\omega \rightarrow \pi^+~\pi^-~(\pi^0)$, the Florida State University (FSU) Experimental Hadronic Nuclear Group has extracted the differential production cross section.\\</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>\indent With such data and the measured differential cross section in hand, I have conducted a Dalitz plot analysis of the $\omega \rightarrow 3\pi$ decay in close cooperation with the Joint Physics Analysis Center (JPAC) at JLab.  The decay probability density separates into angle-dependent and -independent factors: the Spin Density Distribution (SDD) which is proportional to the differential cross section, and the reduced decay distribution (RDD) which is proportional to the decay width, respectively.  The Spin Density Matrix Elements (SDMEs) for an unpolarized beam were obtained from fitting the SDD.  In addition, fits for two different RDDs, i.e. a Dalitz plot distribution and a JPAC distribution, have been underway.  The former is a truncated polynomial expansion of Lorentz Invariant Dalitz plot variables.  The latter was based on the isobar model of the $\omega$ decay.  Having made use of sub-energy unitarity, this model accounts for both elastic and inelastic 3-body re-scattering effects.  Plus, fitting this model to measured data is a first.  A comparison through fit parameters of each reduced distribution is intended.  Lastly, my results and as well as a discussion of future extensions to this study and the prospects for similar light-meson-decay analyses are concluded at the end of this thesis.\\</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Vortex waves are striking spatial-temporal patterns and observed in diverse systems, such as active galaxies, catalytic reactions, and even biological systems. In the heart, vortex patterns of electrical waves are linked to ventricular arrhythmia. The fast rotating vortices, once created, repetitively excite the cardiac tissues and act as a pacemaker with a high frequency. The resulting heartbeat is much faster than the normal rhythm and termed ventricular tachycardia (VT). If the single vortex is unstable and fragmented, it leads to an often fatal ventricular fibrillation (VF). In this case, the heart does not pump but quivers asynchronously and causes sudden cardiac death, which accounts for 325,000 deaths in the United States each year. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Most excitable media, particularly biological systems, are not homogeneous. For example, in the heart, the heterogeneity can refer to dead tissues, collagen fibers, or blood vessels. Indeed, the inhomogeneity of the media plays a critical role in the behavior of the vortex wave. Many experimental results have shown that the presence of the uncoupling substrates changes the activation pattern of excitation waves. In both chemical media and cardiac tissues, these changes result in abnormal conductance locally and a rise in the susceptibility to vortices. On the contrary, an unexcitable or impermeable heterogeneity can anchor the vortex wave. The anchored nonlinear waves are stabilized and even suppress the turbulence in their surrounding space. To date, the complex relationship between the uncoupling/insulating heterogeneity and the vortex wave has not been elucidated and clearly requires more in-depth studies. A major driving force is computer simulations that have greatly contributed to a deeper understanding of observations and continue to guide the design of new experiments. With even greater technological advances in the future, computer simulations will be  indispensable tools to interpret dynamics of excitable media. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this thesis, I described computer simulations of both chemical and cardiac models in two- as well as three-dimensional spaces to study the dynamics of the vortex waves in presence of heterogeneities. For chemical media, my studies focus on the interaction between the vortex wave and a moving inert heterogeneity. For two-dimensional systems, I designed simulations to investigate the impact of a moving disk with varying velocities on a rigidly rotating wave. Many other factors that may contribute to the dynamics were also discussed, such as the phase of the spiral wave and the radius of the disk. Additionally, I integrated local fluid dynamics into the model to accord with the realistic chemical solution. The results suggested that the Stokes flow generated by the moving disk can be a very weak perturbation to the wave pattern. In three-dimensional simulations, I further explored the dynamics of a scroll wave that was partially pinned to the cylindrical heterogeneity. The scroll wave was thus stretched and deformed. Moreover, for systems with step-like heterogeneities, the simulations predicted that over short distances scroll waves are attracted towards the step and then rapidly commence a steady drift along the step line. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>For my studies of cardiac systems, I primarily modeled a static heterogeneity in a slab of cardiac tissue with a single reentrant wave or turbulence. Important properties of the heterogeneity as well as biological features of the cardiac fibers were considered in my research. For example, I locally changed the conductions within the cylindrical heterogeneity, which represents the tissues damaged by gap junctional uncoupling in the real heart. In addition, the role of an insulating heterogeneity in systems with scroll wave turbulence was also investigated. By anchoring to a thin cylinder, the stabilized wave rotates sufficiently fast to repel the free segments of the turbulent filament tangle, which then annihilate at the system boundaries. Furthermore, the results show that even thicker cylinders can suppress analogous forms of tachycardia by forming pinned multi-armed vortices. In this process, the observed number of wave arms depends on the cylinder radius.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Plasma generated by strong electric field has been studied for almost 100 years. The plasma-liquid system discharge presents new and interesting applications in the fields of environmental science, material processing and analytical chemistry.  Extensive research has focused on exploring the potential application of plasma treatment of organic compounds in wastewater such as phenol, organic dyes, and TCE. The reactor electrode configurations ranges from point to point, point to plate and wire cylinder. Power supplies include DC, AC, pulsed, and microwave. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para> The goals of the present work were to explore the role of oxygen in a water-film plasma reactor for dye degradation and to combine this non-thermal gas-liquid plasma reactor (NTPR) with a bioreactor to treat 50ppm 1,4-dioxane in groundwater. Two types of power supply were used including an automobile ignition coil driven by DC power supply with a function generator and a nanosecond pulser. No significant additional degradation of methylene blue was detected by adding oxygen into the inlet gas compared to the pure argon case although significant ozone was produced and measured in the gas phase. This is explained by the short gas residence time and low rate of mass transfer preventing the generated ozone to transfer from gas phase into liquid phase as well as by the high reaction rate between OH radical and MB in comparison to the ozone reaction rate.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A 50ppm 1,4-dioxane synthetic media was pretreated in the NTPR at five different liquid flowrates (2,5,15,20mL/min). The combined scenario of using plasma treatment at 2ml/min and 1-month microorganism treatment was able to reduce dioxane to below 1μg/L and TOC to below 4 mg C/L.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The current study investigated how college students’ perception of cognitive demands, instrumentality and personality influent their learning strategies generally used for a specific course. A survey package consisting of a Cognitive Demands Questionnaire (Zhou, Phillips, &amp; Turner, 2012), the Instrumentality Questionnaire (Husman &amp; Lens, 1999), the Big-Five Personality Questionnaire  (John,  Donahue &amp; Kentle, 1991), and part of the Motivated Learning Strategies Questionnaire (31 items for measuring cognitive and metacognitive learning strategies ,Pintrich, Smith, Garcia, &amp; McKeachie, 1991)  was administered to 494 participants near the end of the semester when students have already completed most of the course content and assignments. The results revealed that 1) Compared to personality traits and instrumentality, cognitive demands are stronger and more direct predictors for explaining students’ use of learning strategies; 2) Most personality traits associated with impulse control only have indirect influence on learning strategies through the coordination of self-regulation; 3) Self-regulation has a special role of coordinating cognitive demands, instrumentality and personality. The present results shed light on the very important role played by the local context of the specific demand characteristics of the assignments of a given course.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Graphite has good lifetime and rate capability in liquid electrolyte-based batteries and supercapacitors. Meanwhile, the polymer electrolyte have been considered as a promising technology for battery applications for its safety and flexible cell configuration design which satisfy the requirements of stand-by power and electric vehicles(EV). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>It is commonly recognized that graphite and PEO-based polymer electrolyte have poor compatibility due to high interfacial resistance and co-intercalation phenomenon. However, it was reported recently that high molecular weight PEO electrolyte along with material processing approaches to graphite materials result in improved compatibility. Motivated by this finding, it is reasonable to expect that further improvements in battery performance can be gained with block compolymer that has mechanical properties sufficient to maintain electrode structure. Therefore, a high molecular weight block copolymer (polystyrene-b-PEO) was used to replace PEO as polymer electrolyte in this study. In addition, the block copolymer has better mechanical properties that improve both thermal and mechanical stability of the cell or might even partially reduce the complicated engineering techniques apply to the graphite material.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this study, the compatibility of two different graphite materials with block copolymer were investigated by using detailed analysis of electrochemical methods that include galvanostatic cycling (GCPL) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). In particular, EIS was used to examine the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the graphite surface which has significant impact on the cycling performance of the cell. It is concluded that SEI formation in the first few cycles on flake graphite appears to be much more stable than on MCMB leading to better capacity retention. Flake graphite materials have a better compatibility with block copolymer (SEO) comparing to MCMB graphite supported by better cycling performance and electrode-electrolyte interphase property.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Atmospheric water vapor is a potent greenhouse gas, and its variations in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) have important climate impacts. The water vapor budget of tropical cyclones (TCs) and their impact on the UTLS remain understudied. This paper describes high-resolution simulations of TC Ingrid during September 2013 using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to calculate the water vapor budget. Using Ingrid as an example provides a better understanding of water vapor transport into the UTLS by TCs, helping to answer a question posed during NASA’s Studies of Emissions and Atmospheric Composition, Clouds, and Climate Coupling through Regional Surveys (SEAC4RS), specifically whether water vapor transport in TCs hydrates or dehydrates the UTLS.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Our WRF simulations of TC Ingrid closely correspond to the National Hurricane Center’s Best Track data. We also evaluate model results of the water vapor budget with in situ airborne data of Ingrid collected during the SEAC4RS mission. Satellite imagery also is used to validate the simulated structure of Ingrid. We show spatial and temporal changes of UTLS water vapor throughout Ingrid's lifecycle to determine whether and how TCs hydrate or dehydrate the UTLS. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Results show that TCs do transport large quantities of water vapor into the UTLS, and overshooting deep convection is an especially potent transport method. The paper sheds light on mechanisms that inject water vapor into the UTLS and on the widespread horizontal and vertical transports of water vapor within TCs.</DISS_para>
