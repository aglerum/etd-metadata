         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>BACKGROUND: The growth in popularity of women’s soccer has led to an increased interest in the physical, physiological, and technical demands for these athletes. To meet these demands, optimal preparation and recovery are necessary. One growing area of interest in athletic performance is the role that sleep may have in preparation and recovery. However, details about sport-specific benefits of sleep are limited, particularly in female collegiate athletes. Athletes in the collegiate setting may suffer from lack of sleep due to the stresses of academics and athletics. Moreover, measurement of sleep in elite college soccer players using actigraphy does not exist in the literature. PURPOSE: To evaluate the relationship between sleep quantity and quality and soccer-specific performance variables in an elite group of female soccer players. METHODS: Eight NCAA college-aged competitive Division I women’s soccer players (18-23 yrs) participated in the study. Global Positioning Systems (GPS), heart rate monitoring and video analysis technologies were used during matches along with 24-hour actigraphy through the season. Actigraphy was also used to measure sleep quantity and quality. Data were collected for all 26 matches but only four competitive matches were included in the analysis as they met the following requirements: an evening match beginning at 1900 EST, time zones were not traveled across, goal differential was no more than two points (indicating a high level of competition) and for players’ data to be included they must have played at least 45 minutes of the 90-minute match. The night prior to the match was included for the data analyses of sleep quantity and quality. A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was utilized to determine whether the vectors of the means in groups of variables were significant. Paired t-tests were used to analyze if differences in variables of performance existed after the “best” and “worst” nights of sleep for quantity and quality.  Significance was set at p&lt;0.05. RESULTS: Mean sleep quantity and quality for the “best” (575.0 ± 38.4 minutes, 91.9 ± 2.6% of time in bed spent sleeping) and “worst” (416 ± 57.6 minutes, 76.2 ± 12.1% of time in bed spent sleeping) nights were significantly different. The MANOVAs were not significantly different for the physiological and physical variables for quantity and quality of sleep. No differences in performance variables were observed after “best” and “worst” quantity sleep matches. However, differences existed between “best” and “worst” quality of sleep. Percent time spent exercising above 85% of the maximal heart rate (HRmax) was significantly lower after the “best” night of sleep (30.2 ± 13.5 vs. 47.9 ± 24.3%). Heart rate exertion was higher after the “best” night of sleep (518.5 ± 193.1 vs. 387.6 ± 148.9 AU) meaning the athletes were exercising at higher heart rates throughout the match without spending as much time in the anaerobic zone (&gt;85%HRmax). High metabolic load distance (distance running at speeds greater than 19 km/hr and distance accelerating or decelerating quickly (&gt;2 m/s^2) was lower after the “best” quality night (11.8 ± 3.6 vs. 16.3 ± 6.0 yds/min) and the number of decelerations was higher after the “best” quality night (69.7 ± 28.1 vs. 50.6 ± 25.9) indicating less stress on the body. CONCLUSION: Quality of sleep is important for reducing the time spent exercising in the anaerobic zone (&gt;85% HRmax). However the time spent exercising at high heart rates below the ventilatory threshold may be increased after a night of better sleep quality, indicating an increased aerobic capacity during a competitive women’s soccer match.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>When will the domestic audience be responsive to publicly made threats in international disputes by their leaders? Theoretical models and empirical evidence suggest that audience costs can be strategically invoked by leaders to credibly signal their intentions in conflict bargaining situations. However, an emerging literature points out that audience costs depend on individual-level behavioral processes within the domestic political environment. This dissertation further explores the factors that influence whether voters mobilize audience costs when leaders renege on public threats specifically, in regards to two distinct issues. One, when are citizens attentive to foreign disputes that their leaders publicly signal in, and what effect does this have on audience cost mobilization? Two, will citizens automatically punish leaders for reneging in foreign disputes they are attentive to, or will the decision to punish be subject to normal candidate evaluation processes. Using experimental evidence I find strong empirical support for both factors attenuating audience cost generation in foreign crisis disputes. Finally, unlike previous work on audience costs, this dissertation demonstrates that factors outside of a leader’s direct control influences the degree to which they can credibly signal through publicly made threats.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>With the advent of nanotechnology, nanomaterials have drastically improved our lives in a very short span of time. The more we can tap into this resource, the more we can change our lives for better. All the applications of nanomaterials depend on how well we can synthesize the nanoparticles in accordance with our desired shape and size, as they determine the properties and thereby the functionality of the nanomaterials. Therefore in this report, it is focused on how to extract the shape of the nanoparticles from electron microscope images using image segmentation more accurately and more efficiently. By developing automated image segmentation procedure, we can systematically determine the contours of an assortment of nanoparticles from electron microscope images; reducing data examination and interpretation time substantially. As a result, the defects in the nanomaterials can be reduced drastically by providing an automated update to the parameters controlling the production of nanomaterials. The report proposes new image segmentation techniques that specifically work very effectively in extracting nanoparticles from electron microscope images. These techniques are manifested by imparting new features to Sliding Band Filter (SBF) method called Gradient Band Filter (GBF) and by amalgamating GBF with Active Contour Without Edges method, followed by fine tuning of $\mu$ (a positive parameter in Mumford-Shah functional). The incremental improvement in the performance (in terms of computation time, accuracy and false positives) of extracting nanoparticles is therefore portrayed by comparing image segmentation by SBF versus GBF, followed by comparing Active Contour Without Edges versus Active Contour Without Edges with the fusion of Gradient Band Filter (ACGBF). In addition we compare the performance of a new technique called Variance Method to fine tune the value of $\mu$ with fine tuning of $\mu$ based on ground truth, followed by gauging the improvement in the performance of image segmentation by ACGBF with fine tuned value of $\mu$ over ACGBF with an arbitrary value of $\mu$.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study focuses on how instructors at the English Language Institute, ELI, at King Abdulaziz University, Saudi Arabia, perceive the programs of professional development programs and how do they perceive those programs’ value on their teaching. This qualitative study uses an interview protocol to explore participants’ opinions to reach thematic findings. Findings discuss the importance of communication between providers of professional development and beneficiaries. There is also a discussion on the necessity of building professional development programs on instructors’ needs. Findings also show how professional development programs should focus on reform teaching approaches to help EFL instructors. While the ELI strives to make excellent professional development plans, instructors think that the ELI should communicate better with instructors and reach to them with their programs’ offerings. Instructors also think that the ELI should focus on their instructors’ needs to help them in overcoming challenges of daily teaching such as the focus on the progression of students and the need to focus on reform-teaching practices.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this essay we present analysis examining the basic dietary structure and its relationship to mortality in the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) conducted between 1971 and 1975. We used results from 24-hour recalls on 10,483 individuals in this study. All of the indivduals in the analytic sample were followed through 1992 for vital status.  The mean follow-up period for the participants was 16 years. During follow-up 2,042 (48\%) males and 1,754 (27\%) females died. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We first attempted to capture the inherent structure of the dietary data using principal components analyses (PCA).  We performed this estimation separately for each race (white and black) and gender (male and female) and compared the estimated principal components among these four strata. We found that the principal components were similar (but not identical) in the four strata.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>we also related our estimated principal components to mortality using Cox Proportional Hazards (CPH) models and related dietary component to mortality using forward variable selection.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>ABSTRACT</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This quantitative study investigated potential effects of providing explicit phonological instruction on international students’ spelling knowledge, orthographic processing skills, and reading speed and comprehension. In addition, the study compared Arab participants to their non-Arab peers in four particular aspects: gains, interaction, performance and differences between the two groups before and after the treatment. The phonological instruction consisted of five groups of the English sounds, six groups of blends, five phonetic skills, and two decoding skills. The phonological instruction was carried out during the reading class time and delivered for a month. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A total of 53 ESL international students participated in the study. Analyses employed three different grouping criteria: one whole group (n = 53), two main groups: Arab (n = 38) and non-Arab (n = 15), and three main groups: foundation (only Arab n = 4), beginner (Arab n = 27 + non-Arab n = 8) and low intermediate (Arab n = 7 + non-Arab n = 7). All participants took pretests in spelling, pseudowords (nonsense words), and reading speed and comprehension, went through the phonological instruction treatment, and took posttests in the same skills. The spelling and pseudoword pre and posttests were identical across all participants in all proficiency levels. However, reading speed and comprehension pre and posttests were identical in each proficiency level but different across all proficiency levels. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Due to an unexpected change in the study design, all participants were exposed to the phonological instruction treatment and there was no control group. Consequently, the study could not provide a direct evidence for the impact of the phonological instruction treatment on the target skills. Nevertheless, in the first aspect where the study analyzed gain scores of participants in the target skills, findings from this study revealed that all participants (n = 53) scored in the posttests significantly higher than the pretests in both spelling and pseudoword. However, when separating participants into two groups: Arab and non-Arab, findings showed that the Arab group increased significantly in both spelling and pseudoword whereas the non-Arab group increased significantly only in spelling but not in pseudoword. Further, while each group of Arab and non-Arab participants in the beginner level did not significantly increase in reading speed, each group of Arab and non-Arab students in the low intermediate level significantly increased in the posttest. Moreover, each group of Arab and non-Arab participants in both beginner and low intermediate levels did not significantly increase in the comprehension posttests. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the second aspect, the study examined differences in performance between the two groups of participants in the target skills. Findings showed that differences found in the way the two groups changed over time in the gain scores of all target skills were not statistically significant.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the third aspect, the study compared Arab to non-Arab participants based on their gain scores in the target skills. In spelling, findings showed that none of the two groups outperformed the other because both groups significantly increased in spelling. In pseudoword however, findings suggested that Arab participants outperformed their non-Arab peers because only Arab students significantly increased in their pseudoword gains scores. In reading speed, because none of the two groups in the beginner level significantly increased in their gain scores, findings suggested that none of two groups outperformed the other. Similarly, findings suggested that none of the two groups in the low intermediate level outperformed each other because both groups significantly increased in reading speed.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The Arab and non-Arab groups in both the beginner and the low intermediate levels did not significantly increase in the comprehension gain scores, therefore, findings suggested that none of the groups in either proficiency level outperformed the other. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the fourth aspect, the study analyzed differences in the pre-existing knowledge between Arab and non-Arab groups in the target skills according to their mean scores in the pretests. Findings suggested that while spelling background knowledge of the non-Arab group is substantially significantly richer than the spelling background knowledge of the Arab group, the two groups did not significantly differ in their background knowledge in English orthographic conventions. Furthermore, findings exhibited that non-Arab participants in the beginner level were reading with a significantly higher rate in the pretest than their Arab counterparts. On the other hand, findings revealed that there were no significant differences between low intermediate Arab and non-Arab groups in their reading speed prior to the phonological instruction. In comprehension, findings showed that the non-Arab group in both beginner and low intermediate levels scored significantly higher than their Arab peers in the pretest.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The goal of this project is to combine gravity measurements with geologic observations to better understand the “Big Bend” of the San Andreas Fault (SAF) and its role in producing hydrocarbon-bearing structures in the southern Central Valley of California. The SAF is the main plate boundary structure between the Pacific and North American plates and accommodates ≈35 mm/yr of dextral motion. The SAF can be divided into three main parts: the northern, central and southern segments. The boundary between the central and southern segments is the “Big Bend”, which is characterized by an ≈30°, eastward bend. This fault curvature led to the creation of a series of roughly east-west thrust faults and the transverse mountain ranges.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Four high-resolution gravity transects were conducted across locations on either side of the bend. A total of 166 new gravity measurements were collected. Previous studies suggest significantly inclined dip angle for the San Andreas Fault in the Big Bend area. Yet, our models indicate that the San Andreas Fault is near vertical in the Big Bend area. Also gravity cross-section models suggest that flower structures occur on either side of the bend. These structures are dominated by sedimentary rocks in the north and igneous rocks in the south. The two northern transects in the Carrizo plains have an ≈-70 mgal Bouguer anomaly. The SAF has a strike of ≈315° near these transects. The northern transects are characterized by multiple fault strands which cut marine and terrestrial Miocene sedimentary rocks as well as Quaternary alluvial valley deposits. These fault strands are characterized by ≈6 mgal short wavelength variations in the Bouguer gravity anomaly, which correspond to low density fault gouge and fault splays that juxtapose rocks of varying densities. The southern transects cross part of the SAF with a strike of 285°, have a Bouguer anomaly of ≈-50 mgal and are characterized by a broad 15 mgal high.  At this location the rocks on either side of the fault are Proterozoic - Cretaceous metamorphic or/and plutonic rocks. Previous work based on geologic mapping hypothesized the existence of a shallow, low angle Abel Mountain Thrust in which crystalline rocks were thrust over Miocene sedimentary rocks, near Apache Saddle. However, gravity models indicate the crystalline rocks are vertically extensive and form a positive flower structure bounded by high angle faults. Also, based on the thickness of fault adjacent sedimentary cover, the gravity models suggest a minimum exhumation of 5-6 km for crystalline rocks in the south. Assuming exhumation began with the switch from the transtensional San Gabriel Fault to transpressional San Andreas Fault at approximately 5 Ma, this indicates exhumation rates of 1 km/Ma. Overall, the broad gravity highs observed along the southern transects are due to uplift of basement rocks in this area.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Title VII is a federal anti-discrimination in employment statute that was passed as a part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The passage of Title VII of the 1964 Act was the result of years of political wrangling to enact federal legislation to eliminate discrimination in employment.  Leaders of the Civil Rights Movement fought for the Act’s passage in order to improve the economic well-being of African Americans in the United States who were still fighting the effects of overt discrimination.  Title VII made it unlawful for employers to discriminate against American citizens based on race, color, religion, sex or national origin.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>At the time of the Act’s passage, state and local government employees as well as employees of educational institutions were not protected by the Act. It would not be until eight years later that the 1964 Act was amended by the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972 that these individuals would come under the purview of the statute.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>As time went on, Title VII would undergo more changes as the judiciary worked to interpret the law and Congress sought to specifically delineate its intent in passing the statute.  Meanwhile, institutions of higher education across the country would begin its own metamorphosis from the isolated ivory tower of old to a new modern multi-billion dollar business that employs thousands of employees.  This study seeks to understand the university as an employer; specifically, this study wants to understand how Title VII works at institutions of higher education in light of higher-education-specific concepts such as: tenure and academic deference.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Using legal historical methods, the researcher analyzed federal circuit court cases in order to determine whether any special rules, concerns, or considerations arise in the application of Title VII to higher education institutions and whether any changes should be made in how these cases are litigated.  In particular, the researcher studied: failure to promote, denial of tenure, termination, and failure to hire employment decisions in light of the employment environment as well as academic-specific concepts such as academic deference as a special concern of academic freedom as well as tenure.  Further, the phenomenon of the corporatization of higher education is an additional factor under consideration in this study.  Ultimately, this study seeks to understand how Title VII, initially inapplicable to educational institutions, responds to this particular environment.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Optical technology in biophysics has seen significant growth with development of high resolution techniques, like single-molecule FRET, to investigate biological structures under native conditions. Additionally, with the rise in gold nanoparticle use in drug delivery, bioassays, and intracellular tracking, Nanometal surface energy transfer (NSET) applications have also improved since its limited beginnings on 2nm gold nanoparticles. This dissertation aims to further exploit the surface plasmon – organic dye coupling properties by investigating a series of nucleic acid secondary structures with modified gold nanoparticles and fluorophores as structural contact points.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>    Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 introduce the importance of tracking nucleic acid structures by describing their essential roles in biology as well as state-of-the-art techniques to monitor various conformers. In Chapter 3, gold nanoparticle-based aptamer sensors are investigated and manipulated to detect a multi-magnitude range of target concentrations. It is observed that the aptamer’s degree of exposure to the target predictably decreases the limit of detection in optical aptasensors. In sequential Chapters 4-6, a variety of G-quadruplex structures are investigated for their structural characteristics as well as their more global, cooperative relationships. The gold nanoparticle acts as a distant-dependent quencher for these surface-appended, dynamic nucleic acid sequences, in which the intensity of a DNA-functionalized dye distinguishes the specific G- quadruplex structure. In Chapter 7, NSET is pushed to further limits, by adding a distant- dependent contact point to the gold nanoparticle surface in the form of a FRET pair, to build a theorem for an NSET-FRET hybrid system for optical triangulation. The observed quenching of the donor lifetime in the presence of additional decay pathways confirms the efficacy of the NSET-FRET hybrid system and lays the groundwork for a mathematically predictable distance dependence model.</DISS_para>

      <DISS_content>
         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Recent studies have shown that the incorporation of carbon nanotubes (CNT) in to carbon fiber composite parts significantly increase mechanical as well as thermal properties. Polymer nanocomposites are polymer matrix composites that consist of reinforcements that have at least one dimension in the nanometer range. The polymer nanocomposite fabricated parts achieve greater mechanical, thermal, electrical and other properties with a low CNT reinforcement volume fraction. Nanocomposites achieve improved properties because of the higher properties of the nano-reinforcement and the high ratio of surface area to volume (aspect ratio) that provides greater interfacial interaction with the matrix.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The fabrication of nanocomposites is primarily by the liquid composite molding (LCM) processes that can be complex process with many challenges. These challenges include poor CNT dispersion, poor bonding between resin and CNT, and blocking or filtration during the infusion process. The Resin Infusion between Double Flexible Tooling (RIDFT) however offers some advantages over the other LCM processes. The preservation and extended use of the mold can result in higher productivity and profit. In addition, a significantly lower pressure that translates to lower equipment cost, will be required to drive the high viscosity CNT-rich resin through the two-dimensional flow in a RIDFT process compared to the three-dimensional flow in the RTM. The RIDFT process may also be used for out-of-autoclave fabrication of composites from pre-pregs.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The RIDFT process however has a number of fabrication issues militating against its wide use. These include long production cycle time due to the bottle neck associated with the setup time for cleaning the silicone sheet and the high cost of replacement of the flexible silicone membranes of the RIDFT machine. The introduction of Stretchlon Bagging 800 film may reduce the time that is expended on cleaning the silicone sheets and at the same time reduce the damage that is made to the silicone membranes. The goal of this thesis is to evaluate the performance of the Stretchlon bagging technique with the RIDFT process with the aim of significantly reducing the production cycle time as well as the production cost of composites and nanocomposites without adversely affecting the mechanical properties of the fabricated parts.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>xi</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The results show that the use of the Stretchlon bagging film resulted in reduction in the production cycle time of GFRP and CNT_GFRP parts of 32 % and 42 % respectively. It also resulted in production set-up (mold preparation) cost reduction for GFRP and CNT-GFRP parts of 49 % and 72 % respectively. It resulted in increased durability and service life of the silicon mold thereby helping to reduce the production cost. In addition, the use of the Stretchlon bagging film did not adversely affect the mechanical properties of the fabricated GFRP and CNT-GFRP parts. It resulted in an increase of 31.94 % and 12.62 % in the mean UTS of the GFRP and CNT-GFRP respectively. The Stretchlon film however resulted in reduction in the flexural properties of the fabricated GFRP and CNT-GFRP parts by 30.12 % and 18.69 % respectively.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The use of the Stretchlon bagging film enhanced the in-plane properties of the fabricated parts by helping to increase the fiber volume fraction. The lower resin contents in the parts fabricated with the Stretchlon film may have had an adverse effect in the interlaminar properties resulting in lower flexural strengths. Furthermore, thermal analysis confirmed that there was no change in the glass transition (Tg) temperature of the fabricated parts. Parts fabricated with the Stretchlon bagging film also exhibited better surface finish than those fabricated without using the Stretchlon bagging film.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In addition, a new design for the RIDFT with higher pressure capability for better quality parts (higher fiber volume fraction and lower void content) fabrication has been made. The new design also incorporates infrared lamp system for expedited curing of the composite parts in order to reduce the cycle time.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Further work is however needed to optimize the RIDFT-Stretchlon film fabrication process for nanocomposites. A more detailed microscopy study needs to be performed to gain better insights into the reasons for the enhanced fiber volume content and in-plane properties achieved with the use of the Stretchlon film. In addition, the study needs to be repeated with functionalized CNTs to study the effects of functionalized CNTs on the fabricated parts, the silicon mold and the Stretchlon film. There is also the need to fabricate the new RIDFT design and optimize its performance for nanocomposite fabrication.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to observe people’s perception of portrayed emotion in singing, and if emotion intensity influences perception of emotion. Participants, who were undergraduate non-music majors (N = 39), took part in in a music listening study to choose which emotion they heard, and the perceived intensity of the emotion. The participants listened to original music compositions created by the author, referencing previously researched original melodies and using a meaningless, fabricated language used in speech research for the lyrics, recorded by undergraduate music majors. Results indicate that certain emotions, primarily sadness and contempt, are more accurately and readily perceived than other emotions. Other portrayed emotions, joy and love, had a moderately high percent of responses, but were not significantly different than other responses for those portrayals. The intensity of the emotion appears to have a small correlation to the accurate perception of emotion. While further research into emotion portrayal and perception through singing is still needed, the findings suggest that certain modalities of emotion are more easily identified than others. Music therapists working in fields which focus on emotion regulation and perception could use this research to further improve interventions to help patients and clients better to portray their emotions, understand how people interpret emotions differently, and more effective ways to portray emotion.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This work describes the oxidation of organic compounds in an argon/water continuous flow plasma reactor. Water insoluble materials such as alkanes and alkenes, in particular n-pentane to n-octane, 1-hexene, cyclohexane and cyclohexene have been functionalized with different functional groups: hydroxy-group, hydroperoxy-group, oxo-group and double bond. Fragmented alcohols, aldehydes and carboxylic acids have also been observed. A detailed set of radical reactions, for the attack of n-hexane and its derivatives by the hydroxyl radical, have been proposed and are supported by quantum mechanical calculations. Electron impact reactions are considered as complementary pathways. A comprehensive network of reaction pathways has been generated, which proofed to be sufficient to predict correctly the majority of the observed products for starting materials of other chain lengths or related alkenes.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Navy has proposed to use a shipboard power system operating at medium voltage direct current to distribute power for their all-electric ship. The power is generated by electric machines as alternating current and requires power electronic rectifiers to output direct current. Power electronics converters are needed to convert the direct current to alternating current for ship propulsion and service loads. An increase in the use of fast switching power electronics is expected in future ships. The increased voltage rise time on switches is known to produce unwanted high frequencies with corresponding wavelengths of the same order of magnitude as the length of the ship hull. These high frequency transients can cause the ship system to couple with the surrounding ship hull causing adverse effects. The amount of high frequency content and the impact it has on the ship system performance is difficult to calculate with current models. Increased voltage and performance requirements for power electronics has led to advancements in switching frequencies into the 10s to 100s of kilohertz and increased voltage edge rates. The faster switching corresponds to higher frequency responses from the shipboard power system.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Research has shown that high frequency content in electrical power systems is responsible for parasitic coupling and ultimately damage to the equipment. Electric machines, for instance, have increased winding and iron losses, overvoltages at the terminals, and even bearing currents via shaft voltages. The Navy is interested in simulating ship systems to test their electromagnetic compatibility before implementing or committing to a specific design.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>There are numerous techniques used to acquire machine parameters that have been proven to be useful in modeling electric machine behavior. The approaches were considered by the amount of proprietary information needed to acquire accurate results, the complexity of the modeling methods, and the overall time it takes for implementation. A majority of system simulations gravitate towards simple solutions for machine behavior which require assumptions to be made that deviate from the actual machine behavior. Exact inner dimensions, winding layouts, end winding dimensions, insulation thickness, and other information are proprietary and often not accurate representations of the physical machine once built. It is time consuming to obtain an accurate working model when assumptions are made or when detailed computer aided design models are needed to calculate machine response quantities.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The research modeling approach put forth in this paper is not aimed at capturing the steady-state behavior of the machine. It is shown that a detailed understanding of the motor may not be necessary to accurately model the high frequency effects. It is the transient behavior at non-operating frequencies that need to be modeled correctly to develop new models of shipboard power systems for grounding research. The frequency dependent information is most useful to determine frequencies of interest that other modeling techniques are less likely to capture and point out. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Previously suggested measurement techniques have been considered useful in determining parameters of machines but are not always accurately implemented without in-depth knowledge of the motor that may be proprietary. Lumped-parameter models are based on extracting information at transitional frequencies or looking at the slope of a variable over a frequency range. These models tend to be over simplified representations of the component by averaging the parameters for given ranges. In reality a machine's impedance varies with all frequencies. Lumped parameter based models typically over simplify the grounding behavior of the machine by not varying the impedance as a function of frequency. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The technique used in this research is based on scattering parameters, a way of determining the terminal behavior of the machine without the knowledge of the actual inner workings of the machine. The inverse scattering technique uses steady-state stimuli to calculate reflection and transmission coefficients of system components allowing the device to be considered as a black box. This can be understood as electrical snapshots of how the machine would respond when subjected to a range of spectral content. The approach could have a significant impact on the modeling of ground interactions with machines. The machine can now be measured and characterized with no prior knowledge of the machine. The measurements are placed in simulation software in the typical measurement configurations used in other approaches to extract parametric data. It was discovered that these different configuration setups could now be measured in software without the need to physically reconfigure the machine's wiring for each measurement. This modeling approach was coined 'virtual measurement modeling.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To the best of the author's knowledge there are not any known techniques for fast model prototyping of electric machines which cover a broad range of frequencies with high accuracy. This thesis will present a possible solution for consideration in future models developed for grounding studies. This approach outlines a promising technique that can be easily implemented with high accuracy and reproducibility. The technique was derived from inverse scattering theory and was implemented on electric machines for characterizing high frequency behaviors.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Next generation sequencing can rapidly analyze entire genomes in just hours. However, due to the nature of the sequencing process, errors may arise which limit the accuracy of the reads obtained.  Luckily, modern sequencing technologies associate with their reads, a quality score, derived from the sequencing procedures, which represents our confidence in each nucleotide in the sequence.  Currently, these quality scores are used as a criteria for the removal or modification of reads in the data set. These methods result in the loss of information contained in those sequences and rely on parameters that are somewhat arbitrary; this may lead to a biased sample and inaccurate analyses.  I propose an alternative method for incorporating the error of the sequences without discarding poor quality reads by including the error probabilities of the reads in the likelihood calculations used for sequence analysis.  It was found that, despite introducing variability, using the error-informed likelihood method improved analyses compared with those which ignored the error altogether.  While this method will likely result in analyses with less definite results compared with those in which the data was treated with a preprocessing technique, these results will utilize all of the provided data and will be more grounded in reality as we take into account the uncertainty that we have in our sequenced samples.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The historiography of the early American navy and, more definitively, the USS Constitution’s role in American consciousness revolve around the valorous acts associated with the naval engagement between the Constitution and the HMS Guerriere during the War of 1812.  The basis for this mass public appeal was presented, disseminated, and perpetuated by historians, journalists, and popular writers.  Paralleling historical and popular works, the public perception of the Constitution and the prowess of America’s frigate fleet as a whole subsequently rose to dizzying heights after the War of 1812—based on the evidence emanating from a single naval engagement that lasted just over half an hour.  This work seeks to examine how the Constitution ascended to such great military heights when all the odds were against American naval hegemony following the Revolutionary War.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>          By comparing and contrasting naval correspondence, captain’s logs, and ship records associated with America’s original frigate fleet, a better sense of the collective biographies of the six frigates will be achieved; and, in the process, lend greater perspective to the history of the early American Navy.  The methodology of this dissertation is to view the American Navy through the lens of the captains, officers, and crew that served on the Constitution.  While this study looks to add insight into naval development by comparing and contrasting each of the original six American frigates, the USS Constitution is at the center of the investigation.  This is a case study that utilizes the Constitution as a means to view and balance the successes and failures of the early American Navy.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The main objective of this study was to investigate the improvement of the accuracy of small sample equating, which typically occurs in teacher certification/licensure examinations due to a low volume of test takers per test administration, under the Non-Equivalent Groups with Anchor Test (NEAT) design by combining previous and current equating outcomes using a meta-analysis technique.  The proposed meta-analytic score transformation procedure was called “meta-equating” throughout this study.  To conduct meta-equating, the previous and current equating outcomes obtained from the chosen equating methods (ID (Identity Equating), Circle-Arc (CA) and Nominal Weights Mean (NW)) and synthetic functions (SFs) of these methods (CAS and NWS) were used, and then, empirical Bayesian (EB) and meta-equating (META) procedures were implemented to estimate the equating relationship between test forms at the population level.  The SFs were created by giving equal weight   to each of the chosen equating methods and the identity (ID) equating.  Finally, the chosen equating methods, the SFs of each method (e.g., CAS, NWS, etc.), and also the META and EB versions (e.g., NW-EB, CA-META, NWS-META, etc.) were investigated and compared under varying testing conditions.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	These steps involved manipulating some of the factors that influence the accuracy of test score equating.  In particular, the effect of test form difficulty levels, the group-mean ability differences, the number of previous equatings, and the sample size on the accuracy of the equating outcomes were investigated.  The Chained Equipercentile (CE) equating with 6-univariate and 2-bivariate moments log-linear presmoothing was used as the criterion equating function to establish the equating relationship between the new form and the base (reference) form with 50,000 examinees per test form.  To compare the performance of the equating methods, small numbers of examinee samples were randomly drawn from examinee populations with different ability levels in each simulation replication.  Each pairs of the new and base test forms were randomly and independently selected from all available condition specific test form pairs.  Those test forms were then used to obtain previous equating outcomes.  However, purposeful selections of the examinee ability and test form difficulty distributions were made to obtain the current equating outcomes in each simulation replication.  The previous equating outcomes were later used for the implementation of both the META and EB score transformation procedures.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The effect of study factors and their possible interactions on each of the accuracy measures were investigated along the entire-score range and the cut (reduced)-score range using a series of mixed-factorial ANOVA (MFA) procedures.  The performances of the equating methods were also compared based on post-hoc tests.  Results show that the behaviors of the equating methods vary based on the each level of the group ability difference, test form difficult difference, and new group examinee sample size.  Also, the use of both META and EB procedures improved the accuracy of equating results on average.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The META and EB versions of the chosen equating methods therefore might be a solution to equate the test forms that are similar in their psychometric characteristics and also taken by new form examinee samples less than 50.  However, since there are many factors affecting the equating results in reality, one should always expect that equating methods and score transformation procedures, or in more general terms, estimation procedures may function differently, to some degree, depending on conditions in which they are implemented.  Therefore, one should consider the recommendations for the use of the proposed equating methods in this study as a piece of information, not an absolute guideline, for a rule of thumbs for practicing small sample test equating in teacher certification/licensure examinations.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Many researchers have attempted to replicate different embodied language processing effects, with varying degrees of success. We wanted to know what, if any, individual differences might account for the observed variance for these embodied effects. Using the Action-sentence Compatibility Effect (ACE) paradigm from Sell &amp; Kascahk (2012) as our dependent measure, individual differences measures of personality (Big Five Personality Traits, Morizot, 2014) and cognitive abilities (Need for Cognition – Short Form, Cacippo, Petty, and Kao, 1984; Modified Metacomprehension Scale, Mcginnis, Saunders, and Berns, 2007) were first correlated, and then investigated through linear mixed models regression. In both experiments presented, the dependent measure failed to replicate. However, in Experiment 2, we were able to explain the observed variance through a model building approach. From the personality measures, conscientiousness was found to interact with part of the ACE measure. Of the cognitive measures, Need for Cognition was found to significantly interact with the ACE measures, while regulation from the Modified Metacomprehension Scale and conscientiousness from the Big Five interacted with part of the ACE measures. A discussion about the findings follows the presented work.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation focuses on probing the fundamental chemistry of the actinide series, specifically the structure and bonding in complexes of transuranium elements. The actinides consist of the elements from actinium to lawrencium in the periodic table, best known for uranium and plutonium, which were used to develop nuclear weapons and power. Today, nuclear power is used to generate over 17% of the electricity across the world.[1, 2] Although an effective means of generating electricity, the waste generated from nuclear reactors is a major issue with relatively little progress being made to reduce the amount and radiotoxicity of the waste. Overall, this problem stems from the chemical complexity and highly radioactive nature of the actinides. Because of this the actinides are understudied, particularly beyond uranium, and as a result much of the fundamental chemistry is poorly understood. The goal of this work is to prepare coordination complexes that can be used as probes for elucidating changes in structure and bonding across the actinide series.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Over the past couple decades, neutral nitrogen donating ligands have shown to have a greater affinity towards the actinides over the lanthanides.[1] The work discussed in this dissertation has focused on using nitrogen-containing carboxylates to explore periodic trends through the lanthanide and actinide series. The first step of this project was to explore structure and bonding differences between the lanthanide (4f) and actinide (5f) series. The early lanthanides, such as Ce and Nd are often used as surrogates for the actinides because they possess f orbitals and are relatively similar in size to that of their actinide analogs.[3] Depending on the coordinating ligand, the structure and bonding between the 4fs and 5fs can either mimic each other or diverge greatly. In some cases the structure of the actinides and lanthanides are very similar, but the electronic properties are vastly different. In chapters 3 and 4, unique structures and electronic properties of Pu and Ce complexes are explored.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The second portion of this research was to investigate the differences in structure and bonding between of the transplutonium actinides, americium through californium (Am-Cf). Traditionally these later actinides were believed to mimic the lanthanides in both their structure and bonding characteristics, but as we explore the actinides more we find this might not be true. Our approach used a pyridine dicarboxylate derivative to make an isomorphous series of both the trivalent actinides and lanthanides. It was found that the late actinides, starting at Cf, have different electronic properties that are not paralleled by any of the lanthanides or early actinides.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Much to our surprise, it seems that Cf represents a second transition in the actinide series, which is discussed in chapters 5 through 7. Overall, this dissertation focuses on exploring the structure and bonding of the f elements through solid-state chemistry utilizing a variety of characterization techniques.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Within the archives of the Künstlerverein Malkasten (Paintbox Artists' Union) in Düsseldorf, Germany, is a vast corpus of visual art, posters, programs, and books that illuminate the musical life of this artists’ club. The materials reveal that the club not only enjoyed music as entertainment but also depended on it for inspiration in their artwork and as a means of social interaction, not only between members but also between members and the greater Rhineland community, as well. The picture of the society that emerges from these sources is intrinsically connected to music and music-making, informing an understanding of how this highly-regarded institution and brotherhood of artists communed and thrived for over one hundred years.   </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Even prior to the Malkasten’s foundation in 1848, the artists that eventually made up its membership from the Düsseldorfer Malerschule and Kunstakademie Düsseldorf had used musical iconography prominently in their works. Musical imagery appears pervasively throughout the Malkasten’s artistic catalogue, regardless of subject or style. Its nearly ubiquitous presence showcases musical instruments and performers in a variety of contexts, from symbolic allegories to satirical cartoons. These works reflect that music was part of the artists’ overall consciousness and demonstrate the ideological first step into creating interdisciplinary artwork, for which the club became well known. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The lied was the primary genre used by the Malkasten, and many of its artists participated in either writing song texts, often specifically for club performance, or creating imagery to accompany those texts. A typology of song books in nineteenth-century Düsseldorf allows for an examination of the sources used by the Malkasten, offering a glimpse into what types of lieder the artists sang together. This visual/musical literature reached its peak in the most sophisticated lied source used by the club – the Düsseldorfer Lieder-Album (1851) – which featured newly-composed songs with accompanying full-page color lithographs designed by Malkasten artists.        </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Musical performances were a principal activity of the Malkasten throughout the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, including various types of Liederabends, concerts, tableaux vivants, musico-theatrical productions, and pageants. The club hosted these performances and members actively participated in them. While many artists worked to create posters and programs for the events, others wrote librettos or dialogue. Many of the members also performed in the presentations, often as singers in solo or ensemble roles.       </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The imagery, songs, and performances of the Malkasten provide a detailed portrait of the Malkasten and its culture. The artists’ love of music, history, poetry, nature, and the Rhineland all intertwine within these sources; the artwork and the texts reflect their witty sense of humor, ardent patriotism, and sincere fondness for one another. In short, the character and activity of the Malkasten as an organization are represented fully in its musical life.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Authority is a much contested concept often connected to notions of violence and control, and it emanates variably from class, institution, and now—as I argue—from digital convergence, which is the availability and shareability of information across multiple digital platforms at all times. This dissertation considers how digital convergence is responsible for taking what would otherwise be a difference of degree (simply more people sharing more information) and turning it into a difference of kind (people turning information sharing into knowledge making, previously the domain of institutions). Through the tools made available both online and on multiple technological platforms, individual users of the digitally converged network (though primarily users of the Internet) are building their own auctoritas. In the particular case of journalism, this threat primarily stems from individuals and groups of individuals sharing information online that both acts as news and critiques the mainstream media (MSM). Institutions are currently facing such a foundational threat through the platform-wide information availability and shareability of digital convergence and specifically through the topology and design of the network created by it (and which it simultaneously creates). This threat of digital convergence leads to a situation in which individuals and groups of individuals are empowered to create and maintain auctoritas outside the institutional structures that Western culture traditionally leans on for authority and knowledge creation. The individual auctoritas uniquely enabled through digital convergence acts as a valid challenge to the institution’s structure, causing it to respond with proto-authorization and other tactics designed to limit individual auctoritas and maintain institution per se. The Fifth Estate, considered and defined in this dissertation, is a porous border across which the needs of American journalism consumers are met both by journalists and by consumer subjects moving into the journalism role just-in-time. Porousness of the border between production and consumption of cultural knowledge is a threat to an institution whose job traditionally has been considered to be cultural knowledge creation. In many ways, this movement across the porous border between news consumer and producer is neither a new concept nor a new practice. The difference is one of technology and performances. It is through the affordances of a globalized social structure and a global technological connection, as well as ubiquitous access to multiple platforms, that a Fifth Estate can become influential enough to need defining—that is, influential enough to bring American journalism back to its roots in citizen auctoritas. I use three sub-case studies to look at ways the Fifth Estate makes use of tools of digital convergence to cross this porous border and challenge the institutional authority of the Fourth Estate.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this dissertation we have created theoretical models for finite nuclei, nuclear matter, and neutron stars within the framework of relativistic mean field (RMF) theory, and we have used these models to investigate the elusive isovector sector and related physics, in particular, the neutron-skin thickness of heavy nuclei, the nuclear symmetry energy, and the properties of neutron stars.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To build RMF models that incorporate collective excitations in finite nuclei in addition to their ground-state properties, we have extended the non-relativistic sum rule approach to the relativistic domain. This allows an efficient estimate of giant monopole energies. Moreover, we have combined an exact shell-model-like approach with the mean-field calculation to describe pairing correlations in open-shell nuclei. All the ingredients were then put together to establish the calibration scheme. We have also extended the transformation between model parameters and pseudo data of nuclear matter within the RMF context. Performing calibration in this pseudo data space can not only facilitate the searching algorithm but also make the pseudo data genuine model predictions. This calibration scheme is also supplemented by a covariance analysis enabling us to extract the information content of a model, including theoretical uncertainties and correlation coefficients.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A series of RMF models subject to the same isoscalar constraints but one differing isovector assumption were then created using this calibration scheme. By comparing their predictions of the nuclear matter equation of state to both experimental and theoretical constraints, we found that a small neutron skin of about 0.16 fm in Pb208 is favored, indicating that the symmetry energy should be soft. To obtain stronger evidence, we proceeded to examine the evolution of the isotopic chains in both oxygen and calcium. Again, it was found that the model with such small neutron skin and soft symmetry energy can best describe both isotopic chains, and the resultant values of the neutron-skin thickness and the symmetry energy are consistent with most current constraints.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Finally, we addressed the recent tension between dense matter theory and the observation of neutron stars with rather small stellar radii. By employing Lindblom’s algorithm, we were able to derive the underlying equation of state for assumed mass-radius relations having the “common radius” feature followed by recent analyses. We found that, in order to support two-solar-mass neutron stars, the typical stellar radii must be greater than 10.7 km—barely compatible with recent analyses—to prevent the underlying equation of state from violating causality.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The proper role of government at all levels—local, state and federal—has been debated since the birth of the Republic.  This project explores that debate by illustrating how a variety of social and political issues manifested themselves in the real life of New Orleans’ longest serving mayor, Martin Behrman, and the lives of millions of other Americans, in the early twentieth century.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Integral to the story of Martin Behrman’s life is the tale of Storyville—the infamous red-light district—the growth of the beer industry, and World War I.  These matters were bound together in a ball of confusion surrounding the act of congress authorizing the war and its funding.  Specifically, questions poured in from across the nation, asking which parts of American cities sailors could visit, whether or not sailors and soldiers were to be treated equally under the law, and even whether or not a civilian could buy a soldier a cold beer to say “thank you” for his service.  In this way, the politics of beer, sex, and reform exploded across the United States.  In Louisiana, these issues contributed to the defeat of Martin Behrman in the mayoral election of 1920, the weakening of the “Regular” political machine, and the ascent Huey Long, the “Kingfish.”</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Many of the same legal and moral questions that were asked in 1915 are now asked in 2015 as presidential candidates jockey for position in the presidential primaries of both major parties.  How much federal government intrusion into the private lives of citizens is appropriate, given the urgent need to protect the nation from terrorism?  Which civil liberties may be encroached upon and to what extent?  What is government’s role in promoting public health, fair wages, and morality?  What is the appropriate role of the federal government versus states and localities, especially during wartime?  How do we handle the large numbers of immigrants flocking to our shores—from both a policy and rhetorical perspective?  Answers to such questions constituted the political fault lines of the early twentieth century, as they do today.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	This study does not attempt to answer the policy questions above.  Rather, it seeks to add context to debates surrounding them and to demonstrate their durability.  The challenge is how to discuss these complex issues in a concise and cohesive manner.  The author chose the political career of the longest serving mayor in the history of New Orleans to act as the glue that holds the narrative together.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Living wage laws are a common local government policy to mandate higher wages for a subsection of the labor market. Advocates of these policies suggest the higher mandated wage will lead to greater effort contrary to predictions made by reciprocity models. Do workers actually reciprocate effort for a mandated wage increase if the intention is not purely kind? In one chapter, I use a gift exchange game - where effort is not contractible - to examine worker effort response and possible wage spillovers from a living wage law. The main result shows the greatest influence on effort is the wage offered - regardless of the context of any manager wage restriction. Therefore, effort increases as the mandated wage increases from a typical minimum wage to the higher living wage. Additionally, wage spillovers in the living wage environment push unaffected managers to offer higher wages than otherwise offered in a market with only a single minimum wage.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Various theories provide contradictory predictions for the impact of living wage laws on employment. Using a unique and hierarchal dataset with employment data from all Florida business establishments, I analyzes changes at both the market and establishment level where a number of fixed effects can be used to isolate the employment change. Results suggest that there is no to little negative employment change at the market level for areas with a living wage law and a small positive employment effect for establishments with a living wage contract.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Finally, I extend reciprocity models to examine contract design. Theoretically, contracts are typically modeled as a one-time transaction. In practice, contracts are rarely one-shot interactions. Short-term contracts are renewed and long-term contracts are terminated early. Despite the possibility for contract length to be identical, behavioral preferences may encourage better performance and longer relationships depending on the initial agreed contract length. Using experimental contracts, we find that only when contract length can be determined endogenously does performance differ between contract and that reciprocity plays an important role in this labor relationship.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) gives rise to a progressive disease state that results in many adverse and long-term neurological consequences, including deficits in learning and memory, development of major depressive disorder, and increased likelihood of developing neurodegenerative diseases, as well as decreased life expectancy. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have emerged as a promising cytotherapy for TBI and have been previously shown to improve numerous cellular and behavioral outcomes after brain injury including reduction of secondary apoptosis, restriction of immune cell infiltration, and improvements in cognitive deficits such as spatial learning and memory. A number of molecules secreted by MSC have been implicated in their therapeutic mechanism of action. However, no studies have been conducted to examine the how the MSC secretome collectively regulates the injury microenvironment to support the survival of intact brain tissue that would otherwise be subject to secondary injury. The present study, uses high throughput RNA sequencing (RNAseq) of cortical tissue from the TBI penumbra to assess the molecular effects of both TBI and subsequent treatment with intravenously delivered human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC). TBI was found to disrupt expression of approximately one quarter of the rat protein-encoding genome. Remarkably, hMSC treatment was found to normalize 49% of all transcripts regulated by TBI. This study also investigates the therapeutic efficacy of hMSC against negative behavioral outcomes commonly associated with TBI, including depression, which is the most common long-term side effect of TBI in humans. We show for the first time that a stem cell-based therapy is capable of preventing trauma-induced depression. Using novel precision X-ray methods to selectively eliminate endogenous neural stem cells, this study further probes the cellular mechanisms that underlie hMSC efficacy to reveal that some, but not all, therapeutic benefits conferred by hMSC treatment are dependent on active proliferation of endogenous neural progenitor cells in the subventricular zone.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Dadeville Complex is a large klippe located in the Alabama Inner Piedmont of the southern Appalachian orogen lying immediately above rocks of the eastern Blue Ridge and Brevard Zone, in the core of the Tallassee synform. Structural field data outline the overall nature of the Tallassee synform in the Dadeville Complex. The Camp Hill 7.5’ quadrangle contains the two major Dadeville Complex lithostratigraphic sequences, from southeast to northwest: the Ropes Creek Amphibolite, a bimodal metabasalt/metatuff, metadacite at the base, overlain by the Agricola Schist, a metaturbidite consisting of metapelitic, metagreywacke, and minor metabasalt. These sequences are intruded by felsic plutonic rocks, with the Chattasofka Creek Gneiss (granite) intrusive into the Agricola Schist, and the Camp Hill Granite (tonalite) intrusive into the Ropes Creek Amphibolite.  Also intrusive into the Agricola Schist is a mafic complex consisting of the Doss Mountain suite and the Slaughters Gabbro suite. The Doss Mountain suite is characterized by having an abundance of interlayered metaorthopyroxenite and metanorite, and their metamorphosed equivalents. The Slaughters Gabbro suite consists of both olivine and non-olivine bearing gabbro. Within the mafic complex, there are various felsic dikes cutting through metagabbro and amphibolite, which suggest that intrusions of felsic and mafic rocks could have overlapped temporarily. Distinctive major and trace element geochemical signatures of the Chattasofka Creek Gneiss, Camp Hill Granite, Ropes Creek Amphibolite, Doss Mountain suite, and Slaughters Gabbro suite on tectonic discrimination diagrams all suggest formation within a volcanic arc environment.  Preliminary U/Pb dating of detrital zircons in the Agricola Schist and igneous zircons in the Chattasofka Creek Gneiss yield Middle Ordovician ages, with the Agricola Schist also containing a subordinate fraction of Grenville ages. These relationships suggest that the Dadeville Complex arc resulted from subduction of Iapetus lithosphere beneath the distended Laurentian plate, and that the Dadeville Complex could potentially be a key fragment of the missing Taconic arc in the southern Appalachians.  A supplementary file of a detailed geologic map of the Camp Hill 7.5’ quadrangle is included with this document.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The current study examined how GeoGebra contributed to middle grade Algebra I students' conceptual understanding of functions. In order to gain a deeper understanding a case study approach was utilized. Vinner (1983), and Vinner and Dreyfus’ (1989) concept definition and concept image framework was used to analyze the students' function definition. O’Callaghan's (1994) component of translating was used to analyze the students' comparison of different function representations, and his component of modeling and interpreting was used to analyze the students' use of functions to model relationships between quantities.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The following results were derived from the analyses. Having more correct concept images of functions through GeoGebra could also bring about a more correct definition. The dependency upon the concept definition to verify if a given example was a function could not contribute to the concept image. In order to gain correct concept images more integration of technology into algebra instructions was crucial to explore and interact with more function models. GeoGebra was an ideal environment to perform a transition among the representations. All three cases were able to understand how the given real-world problems transformed to GeoGebra simulator and the reverse procedure. The role of instructor was very important to guide and facilitate the learning. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The results indicated that verification and exploration of more functions on GeoGebra contributed to a better conceptual understanding of a function definition. The advantages of GeoGebra were obvious for the translating component. The real-world problem scenario could be better modeled and interpreted via a simulator on GeoGebra and the need for algebraic symbolic manipulations could disappear.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation examines how the implementation of Enlightenment ideas in the French Revolution gave birth to a new secular conception of the state and the invention of a new religion.  I argue that Jean-Jacques Rousseau, representing shared assumptions across the Enlightenment, interpreted religion to be a human construct and thus subject to human intervention.  With the onset of 1789 revolutionaries employed this conception to reorganize the Gallican Church and institute the radical Cults of Reason and the Supreme Being.  When these endeavors failed revolutionaries refocused on two solutions: the secular laws of 1795 and Theophilanthropy.  Revolutionary secularization separated Church and state and confined worship to the private sphere.  Consequently Theophilanthropy acquired an independent status and the Revolution acted as a catalyst for the invention of a new religion based on Enlightenment principles.  This study explores how Theophilanthropy stood at the foundation of French secularization, modern civil religion and subsequent New Religious Movements (NRM).  The historical significance of Theophilanthropy was critical in its own time and bequeathed a legacy that long outlasted the Revolution.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The focus of this dissertation is the study of the magnetic properties of several novel lanthanide and actinide metal complexes, of particular concentration is the use of SQUID magnetochemistry coupled with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). Through these techniques, a deeper understanding of the magnetic behavior of the f elements and their structure-property relationships are realized.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The novel neptunium selenite compounds presented in Chapter 3 are simple systems in which to probe the magnetic susceptibilities of transuranic compounds and a soft ferromagnetic material with strong temperature independent paramagnetic effects was synthesized. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter 4 also concerns neptunium but in this case a comparison between neptunium iodates, which are expected to be nonmagnetic, assuming a formal oxidation state of +5 which yields a singlet ground (S = 1) assuming spin only contributions. The compounds actually display ferromagnetic ordering at approximately 12 K. Of even further interest is the frequency dependence of the magnetic susceptibility which should not be evident in a magnetically ordered system thus signifying the material have spin glass properties or exhibit magnetic frustrations.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The focus of Chapter 5 is the correlations between structure and magnetic properties that are correlated in a large family of heterobimetallic compounds containing lanthanides and copper. The tuning of the magnetic properties can be controlled by careful substitution of lanthanide ions. Of particular interest is the magnetic information revealed via electron paramagnetic resonance which may go unnoticed by bulk magnetization techniques. These measurements clarified the magnetic description of the compounds.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter 6 highlights several other compounds that were found to be magnetically interesting. Particularly interesting is a uranium ion in the +4 oxidation state that exhibits spin frustration. Furthermore, a large family of lanthanide-transition metal ions with tellurium and sulfate anions, where both the lanthanides and transition metal ions are able to be substituted yielded a large diversity of magnetic properties.  Finally, a compound was synthesized that exhibited two crystallographically unique copper atoms which are distinguishable via high field electron paramagnetic resonance and order antiferromagnetically.</DISS_para>

      <DISS_content>
         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Narrative writing samples were collected and analyzed for a total sample size of 826 students (413 twin pairs; 159 monozygotic and 524 dizygotic pairs) from the Florida Twin Project on Behavior and Environment (FTP-BE) database who comprise a subset of the Florida Twin Project on Reading (FTP-R).  Twins’ writing samples were coded using Systematic Analysis of Language Transcript (SALT) conventions to derive measures of syntactic complexity (mean length utterance, clausal density); measures commonly used to assess adolescent writing.  Concurrent measures of reading comprehension and spelling were obtained from the Florida Progress Monitoring and Reporting Network (PMRN).  Using a behavioral-genetic approach, the common and unique genetic, environmental, and non-shared environmental influences on each variable were analyzed using univariate and multivariate Choleskey decomposition models.  Findings suggest that non-shared environmental influences are responsible for much of the variation we see in students’ written syntactic complexity, with minimal influence from genes.  In contrast, reading comprehension and spelling appear to be highly heritable, with some genetic influences overlapping between the two skills. Shared environmental influences were negligible for all literacy constructs other than reading comprehension. The discussion centers on our need to further understand differential methods of writing assessment, with a focus on the use of traditional elicitation contexts for language sampling within writing, similar to writing expectations on state- and national-level achievement assessments.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>To transfer the incredible properties, including ultrahigh tensile strength, Young’s modulus, and electrical conductivity of an individual carbon nanotube (CNT) into composite applications, the constituent nanotubes need to possess adequate alignment, interfacial bonding and a high CNT volume fraction. Direct incorporation of the CNT films, or buckypaper, materials into carbon fiber laminated structures to manufacture hybrid composites is an effective approach to utilize the lightweight, conductive and nanostructured nature of dense CNT networks for multifunctional applications of structural carbon fiber composites. This work studied the microstructure-property relationships of CNT networks when orientation is induced. The mechanical stretching method is shown to be scalable and effective for ultra-high alignment. A manufacturing technique of applying a viscous resin treatment before the stretching procedure is shown to allow up to 80% stretching strain and a resultant alignment fraction of 0.93. The resin acts as an effective load transfer media to substantially enhance the ductility for high stretching strain. The alignment characterization is carried out through Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction methods that reveal the graphitic crystal structure of the film. The load transfer mechanisms and failure modes of aligned CNT composites are explored through high concentration CNT reinforced nanocomposites. Atomic resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis reveals unusual CNT crystal packing and permit the observation of interesting structural features of the CNTs and their assemblages, including collapse, flattened packing, preferred stacking, folding and twisting phenomena, as well as CNT pullouts from bundles and the resin matrix. The intimate surface-to-surface contact areas between aligned and flattened nanotubes, driven by van der Waals interactions, give rise to a high density packing of the flattened CNTs in the nanocomposite, resembling a graphitic crystal material. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed through collaboration to model the packing structure and understand the dependence of density on the relative content of flattened nanotube and void space. Macroscopic modeling predictions illustrate how the alignment and volume fraction of the encompassed CNTs affect the stiffness of the overall composite. CNT thin films were integrated into carbon fiber (CF) prepreg composites to create hybrid composite materials with high CNT content through industry standard autoclave fabrication processing. Resin bleeding along the through-thickness direction was inhibited due to extra-low permeability, nano/micro dual-scale flow characteristics and high resin absorbing capacity of the CNT thin film in hybrid composites. CNT swelling effects and resin starvation phenomena are studied in relation to the amount and orientation of the CNT laminates. The flexural three-point bending results of the random and aligned CNT/CF hybrids exhibit an increased resistance to catastrophic failure even under repeated loading parameters as compared to the CF control samples. The dramatic improvements in both in-plane and through-thickness electrical conductivities demonstrate potential for both structural and multifunctional applications of the resultant hybrid composites.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The identities of the progenitors of type Ia supernova (SN~Ia) has long been</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>under study and remains an unsolved problem of astrophysics. The answer to this question will impact cosmology and subfields such as galactic evolution. To help resolve this issue and determine what systems give rise to SN~Ia, the relationships between progenitor systems, their winds, and their environments are here considered, and a theoretical tool is created to model the consequences. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>I present theoretical semi-analytic models for the interaction of stellar winds </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>with the interstellar medium (ISM).  To investigate a wide range of possible </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>descriptions implemented in the code SPICE (Supernovae Progenitor Interaction Calculator for parameterized Environments, available on request), assuming spherical symmetry and power-law ambient density profiles. It is shown that a wide class of solutions can be found using the Buckingham $\Pi$-theorem. Semi-analytic solutions allow us to test a wide variety of configurations, their dependencies on the wind and environment parameters, and find non-unique </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>solutions within a set of observational constraints. SPICE may be used to model such interactions in different types of Supernovae (SNe), stellar winds, as well as modeling realistic feedback in star formation and large scale galactic evolution simulations.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The specific properties and evolution of the progenitor systems are found to </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>parameters in the SD scenario, the winds create a low density bubble surrounding the progenitor system and a high-density shell. It is also found that accretion disk winds dominate the environment formation. Within a distance of several light-years (ly), the densities are smaller by factors of $10^{2...4}$ compared to the environment. This explains the general lack of observed interaction in late time Supernova (SN) light curves for, at least, several years. The overdensities of the shells are between a factor of 4 to several hundred in case of constant density ISM and environments produced by stellar winds, respectively. The expansion velocity and width of the shell are typically 1-10 \% of both $v_w$ and the contact discontinuity $R_C$ and may produce narrow spectral lines as observed in some SNe~Ia. Typically, narrow circumstellar lines of equivalent width $\approx 100 m\mbox{\normalfont{\AA}}$ are found for uniform ISM typical in Spiral galaxies and $\approx 1 m\mbox{\normalfont{\AA}}$ for wind </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Lane (2001) proposed that the flow from Lost Creek contributed to the discharge of Spring Creek Springs via an unverified conduit system similar to the verified conduit system that contributes flow to Wakulla Spring. In order to investigate this hypothesis two separate dye trace studies were conducted in 2008 and 2009 at Lost Creek swallet. Fluorescent dye was pumped by a peristaltic pump through tubing anchored below the surface of the water (15 meters in 2008 and 27 meters in 2009) directly into the throat of the Lost Creek swallet. Dye tracer sampling was conducted within the study area at select karst windows that had confirmed conduit access 38 meters to 68 meters below land surface. Sampling was also conducted at Wakulla Spring and Spring Creek Springs. Sampling at the karst windows was accomplished via pumps, timers and tubing to ensure that water samples were acquired from water within the conduits. In preparation for the 2009 Lost Creek swallet dye trace an array of water level elevation stations were established at seven selected karst windows along a north-south transect through the study area.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>   The 2008 dye trace confirmed that flow from Lost Creek swallet contributed to discharge at Spring Creek Springs and Wakulla Spring. The velocities for first detection at Spring Creek Springs and Wakulla Spring were 2,235 m/d and 255 m/d respectively. These linear velocities confirmed a conduit connection between Lost Creek swallet, Spring Creek Springs and Wakulla Spring. The 2008 trace also confirmed detections at Revell Sink, a karst window, equidistant between Lost Creek swallet, Wakulla Spring and Spring Creek Springs. The 2009 dye trace confirmed that flow from Lost Creek swallet contributed to the discharge at three separate spring vents in the Spring Creek Springs with linear velocities of 248 m/d to 313 m/d.  In 2009 tracer detections confirmed conduit connections at Revell Sink and Punchbowl Sink (two karst windows) along the water level elevation monitoring transect. The combined results of the 2008 and 2009 tracer tests confirmed that Lost Creek swallet and Spring Creek Springs are an extension of the Leon Sinks – Wakulla Spring cave system. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>   The water level elevation data demonstrated reversals of the hydraulic gradient and reversals of groundwater flow between Wakulla Spring and Spring Creek Springs. Statistical analysis of the water level elevation data at the karst window stations revealed two primary groups of behavior among the karst window stations. The analysis also revealed behavior that supports the conclusion that during negative discharge conditions at Spring Creek Springs the karst windows stations responded as if they were connected to a unified conduit system. Whereas, during positive flow conditions at Spring Creek Springs the karst windows stations revealed water level elevation behavior that indicated there may be two sets of conduits that together form a basin wide unified conduit system.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>John D. Mohler was born October 30, 1929 in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. His earliest teachers include Joseph Leptich, clarinetist of the Lancaster Symphony and Salvadore Colangelo, Principal Clarinetist of the Harrisburg Symphony. After graduating from Litiz High School, Mohler continued his studies at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia studying under the tutelage of Ralph McLane, and served in the United State Marine Band and Orchestra for four years from 1950-1954 in Washington D.C.  He received Bachelor of Music, Master of Music and Doctor of Musical Arts in Clarinet Performance degrees from the University of Michigan under the study of William Stubbins. He served on the woodwind faculty at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, for two years before joining the University of Michigan School of Music faculty as an Assistant Professor of Clarinet and clarinetist in the University Woodwind Quintet in 1962. In addition to his faculty appointment as Professor of Clarinet, he served as the University of Michigan School of Music Wind and Percussion Instruments Department Chair from 1979-1994. In 1979, he received the Harold Haugh Award in Excellence and in 1986 received the University of Michigan School of Music Outstanding Studio Teacher Award. Mohler was also awarded the University of Michigan School of Music Alumni Society Citation of Merit in 1992. The John Mohler Clarinet Scholarship was endowed in 1993 to provide annual scholarships for students majoring in clarinet at the University of Michigan. Mohler retired from the University of Michigan in 1994 and the Regents awarded him Professor Emeritus of Music. In 2003, Mohler was presented the Lifetime Achievement Award from the International Clarinet Association. In 2012, Mohler was honored with the University of Michigan Band Alumni Association Lifetime Achievement Award.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>John Mohler maintains his role as mentor even in retirement and many of his students now hold teaching, performance, and university faculty positions across the country. His ongoing enthusiasm and rapport has affected numerous students and their careers.  He possesses the willingness to share his knowledge and expertise in an in-depth and personal manner. John Mohler’s biographical and teaching doctrine is underrepresented and recorded, and the personal narrative interviews will help to provide an insight into the life and teachings of John Mohler.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Ecosystem engineers can have complex effects on communities through a variety of direct and indirect pathways. Describing these effects is a necessary step in understanding and predicting the effects of engineer species. Red Grouper (Epinephelus morio) manipulate habitats by excavating sediment and detritus from karst solution holes in Florida Bay; they are also predators that consume a variety of crustaceans and benthic fish prey. As both a habitat manipulator and predator, the effects of Red Grouper on communities associated with the habitats they modify will likely be complex and difficult to predict. Here I present the results of observational and experimental work investigating the community and species-level effects of Red Grouper on faunal communities associated with Florida Bay solution holes. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>By measuring solution holes and conducting diver surveys of faunal communities associated with a fixed set of solution holes over time, I was able to show how the communities and the solution holes themselves were different in the presence and absence of Red Grouper. In general, solution holes were deeper, and communities were both more abundant and diverse when Red Grouper were present. However, while many species changed in abundance and occurrence from year-to-year, short term experiments, on the order of weeks, indicated that these effects were primarily driven by a small set of species that interacted strongly with the Red Grouper. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Caribbean Spiny Lobster (Panulirus argus) was a common and abundant member of the solution-hole communities, and were more abundant in solution holes with Red Grouper, despite the fact that Red Grouper are known lobster predators. Investigating the Red Grouper-lobster interaction across lobster ontogeny indicated that Red Grouper positively affected the abundance of large lobsters, but negatively affected the abundance of smaller lobsters. To determine if this result was due to predation or avoidance behavior by juvenile lobsters, I conducted an experiment to test relative predation risk of lobsters adjacent to solution holes with Red Grouper, and another experiment at artificial dens to test lobster avoidance in the presence and absence of Red Grouper. The results of both experiments confirmed the hypothesis that size-selective predation by Red Grouper maintains the observed distribution of lobsters in solution holes, and not avoidance behaviors by lobsters.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The community level analysis also showed a strong positive effect of Red Grouper on the abundance of juvenile coral reef fishes. I hypothesized that this effect was caused by a behaviorally-mediated indirect interaction (BMII) between Red Grouper and juvenile reef fishes via solution-hole associated piscivores. A recent addition to the suite of solution-hole associated piscivores is the Indo-Pacific lionfish (Pterois volitans and P. miles). As resident piscivores with high site fidelity in relatively high abundance in the bay, lionfish served as a focal species to test the BMII hypothesis. Juvenile reef fishes were most abundant at solution holes with Red Grouper present, least abundant in solution holes with lionfish present, and at intermediate abundances when both predators were present. These results confirmed the strong negative effects that lionfish have on native reef fish communities, and also suggest that Red Grouper can ameliorate some of these negative effects through a BMII that results in higher native fish abundance. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Overall, Red Grouper had largely positive effects on the abundance and diversity of the fish and crustacean communities found inside and around solution holes in Florida Bay. The results presented here suggest that Red Grouper have strong effects on a wide range of species which together shape the ecosystems they manipulate.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Prevalence rates of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI; the deliberate destruction of one’s own body tissue in the absence of suicidal intent) are quite high among adolescents and young adults, and appear to be increasing.  Additionally, NSSI-related content is developing a large presence on mainstream social media websites such as YouTube and Twitter, which could encourage or normalize NSSI.  Yet little research has examined the individuals who post and view NSSI content online or what functions this behavior may serve.  A sample of 135 individuals age 18-37 who had self-injured in the past two weeks (71 individuals who posted NSSI content online [Posters] and 64 who did not post NSSI content online [Non-posters]) were recruited though social media websites. Results indicated that individuals post NSSI content online to serve two functions: a social motivation function (SM; for the purpose of social attention and manipulation in order to attain reactions or resources from others or their environment), which was predicted to be more commonly reported, and an emotion, expression, and connection function (EEC; to regulate and express emotions or to connect with others socially), which, inconsistent with the hypothesis, was found to be more commonly endorsed. Contrary to expectation, Posters did not have more psychopathology than Non-posters, and the functions of NSSI were similar across groups. Finally, inconsistent with hypotheses, results indicated that the frequency of posting NSSI content online and time spent looking at NSSI content online was not related to the frequency or duration of NSSI.  Although NSSI-related social media use was not a maintenance factor among adults, future research should examine NSSI-related social media use among adolescents, who may be more strongly influenced by self-injury content on social media.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation details the isolation of marine siderophores by Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC). Siderophores are biologically produced, low molecular weight (400 Da-1000Da), strong iron-binding ligands.  These compounds are thought to form strong complexes with &gt;95% of the dissolved Fe(III) in the oceans and therefore play extremely important roles in the biological uptake and biogeochemical cycling of Fe in the oceans. The challenges with isolating these ligands from seawater is they are present in very low concentrations (nM) in a matrix with a very high ionic strength (~0.7M). The most important considerations for isolating siderophores are selectivity, concentrating, and desalting. In this work, we studied the use of Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC) followed by Solid-Phase Extraction (SPE) to isolate and concentrate marine siderophores from natural seawater samples. The theory behind the IMAC extraction technique is that organic compounds that form complexes with particular metal cations can be isolated and/or separated via their attraction to a cation chelating resin that has been pre-loaded with the metal cation of interest. To recover the organic compounds from the IMAC resin, elution conditions are chosen based on the analyte of interest and involves either ligand competition or stripping the column of the metal at low pH. In the case of Fe-IMAC, the best method to use was a competing ligand, in this case ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), since acid elution would generate an eluate with a very high (&gt;50mM) total dissolved Fe(III) concentration that would interfere with subsequent processing and analysis. By using a high EDTA concentration (50mM) the column could be eluted effectively.  The Fe-binding ligands in the EDTA eluate were further concentrated via extraction on a silica C-18 resin column (SPE) which will concentrate free ligands and ligand metal complexes that are sufficiently hydrophobic. This “purifies” the IMAC eluate by extracting the analytes of interest from the EDTA eluent. After rinsing with water, the organic compounds were eluted from the SPE column with HPLC-grade methanol, thereby converting the sample matrix to methanol which is easy to dry down for further concentration and is easy to analyze using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Method development and method validation measurements were performed using (+)Electrospray Ionization(ESI) Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MS) and (+) ESI-Quattro MS.  Open ocean samples were analyzed using (+)ESI Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron  MS.  In addition to the internal standard (desferrioxamine B), we found evidence for the presence of three known siderophores (ferrioxamine A1/A2, agrobactin, and ferrioxamine X1) in a seawater sample from the central North Atlantic Ocean.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Contemporary pilgrimage activities associated with the Volto Santo may be traced to the origins of the cult, which, as I argue in this dissertation, was established in the late eleventh century.  I propose this new date of the cult’s establishment, as well as its development and promotion in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, based on research in the areas of Lucca’s political, religious, and economic histories, as well as other Lucchese relic cults, the hagiographic and iconographic traditions associated with the Volto Santo, other competing relic cults in Tuscany, and the impact of Lucca’s textile industry. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation provides the first substantial contribution to the art historical contextualization of Il Volto Santo during the latter Middle Ages by investigating the intricate relationships between the religious, political, and economic affairs involving the Volto Santo during the late eleventh through thirteenth centuries.  In addition, it complements the growing scholarship dedicated to pilgrimage studies associated with the Via Francigena.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>A quantum computer is a proposed device which would be capable of initializing, coherently manipulating, and measuring quantum states with sufficient accuracy to carry out new kinds of computations.  In the standard scenario, a quantum computer is built out of quantum bits, or qubits, two-level quantum systems which replace the ordinary classical bits of a classical computer.  Quantum computation is then carried out by applying quantum gates, the quantum equivalent of Boolean logic gates, to these qubits. The most fundamental barrier to building a quantum computer is the inevitable errors which occur when carrying out quantum gates and the loss of quantum coherence of the qubits due to their coupling to the environment (decoherence).  Remarkably, it has been shown that in a quantum computer such errors and decoherence can be actively fought using what is known as quantum error correction. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A closely related proposal for fighting errors and decoherence in a quantum computer is to build the computer out of so-called topologically ordered states of matter.  These are states of matter which allow for the storage and manipulation of quantum states with a built in protection from error and decoherence.  The excitations of these states are non-Abelian anyons, particle-like excitations which satisfy non-Abelian statistics, meaning that when two excitations are interchanged the result is not the usual +1 and -1 associated with identical Bosons or Fermions, but rather a unitary operation which acts on a multidimensional Hilbert space.  It is therefore possible to envision computing with these anyons by braiding their world-lines in 2+1-dimensional spacetime.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this Dissertation we present explicit procedures for a scheme which lives at the intersection of these two approaches.  In this scheme we envision a functioning ``conventional" quantum computer consisting of an array of qubits and the ability to carry out quantum gates on these qubits.  We then give explicit quantum circuits (sequences of quantum gates) which can be used to create and maintain a topologically ordered state with non-Abelian anyon excitations using the ``conventional" qubits of the computer.  Our circuits perform measurements on these qubits which detect ``errors" corresponding to deviations from the topologically ordered ground state of interest.  We also give circuits which can be used to move these errors and eventually fuse them with other errors to eliminate them.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Abstract</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Gas-Solid reactivity was extensively studied throughout the early 20th century and the kinetics of these systems have become well established and well understood. Recently, microwave active materials (conductive or magnetic materials that absorb microwave irradiation) have been shown to produce increased reactivity in a significantly different way when compared to conventional heating. Any of these materials can be used to improve reactivity in industrially relevant gas-solid systems.  Many of these rate enhancements can be measured by using reaction kinetics, and these kinetic rates can be compared to the previously studied, well established, thermal measurements. By understanding the difference between microwaves and conventional heating we may better predict which systems would be ideal candidates for increased reactivity.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Specifically the reaction between steam and carbon has been measured extensively in the past and could be ideal to benefit from microwave irradiation. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>"C + H2O " □ " H2 + CO " </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>At 131 kJ/mol this endothermic reaction uses carbon as its microwave active material. This solid can be any form of carbon (activated carbon, graphite, coal etc.) and it selectively heats in a microwave reactor. This reaction was shown to have a large difference in apparent activation energies and kinetic rates when compared to the thermal rates and energies. By using an Arrhenius plot, the apparent microwave equilibrium constants were calculated at various wattages and shown to be lower when matched against comparable temperature ranges of the conventional thermal reactions. The enthalpy and entropy of the systems were then calculated to give an effective thermodynamic value to describe the energy differences. Not only was the reaction more efficient in the microwave, but the microwave composition of the product gases included less CO2, which would be produced from a water gas shift side reaction. These findings, of a system that produces less side products at lower temperatures, are evidence that microwave gas-solid reactions could provide unique chemistry that should be applied to more industrially relevant systems.     </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Probing the mechanisms of these results was done by using a nitrous oxide and carbon system to observe the compositional difference in reactivity. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>"2C + 2NO2" □ " N2 + 2CO2 " </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The interfacial polarization of the carbon is understood to be the method of heating in a microwave reactor. Electron hole pairs are created as the charges separate and become trapped at grain boundaries across the surface of the material. These electron hole pairs create an active site on the surface that helps facilitate reactivity and sometimes leads to different compositional makeup of product gases. Probing this mechanism was important to help describe which systems would be good candidates to study in further research endeavors.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this dissertation, microwave chemistry is employed to synthesize a variety of different crystalline nanoparticles (NPs). This introduction will describe the structures, properties and applications of the NPs studied within the dissertation, with a main focus being on ligand sensitization for the goal of enhanced luminescence. The use of metal acetylacetonate complexes to make Europium (III) doped Ytrrium (Y2O3) NPs is explored, where the acetylacetonate acts both as a source of oxygen for the synthesis of Y2O3, as well as an organic chromophore acting as an “antenna” for the absorption of light and subsequent excitation transfer to the incorporated Europium (III) (Chapter 2). Other host materials are investigated by method of metal acetylacetonate decomposition to synthesize a variety of different nanospinels, having the general formula AB2X4, with sulfide variants made by decomposition of diethyldithiocarbamate, (Chapter 3). The antenna ligand thenoyltrifluoroacetone (tta), which is known to undergo a Dexter energy transfer (DET) mechanism to efficiently sensitize Europium (III) emission, is used to determine the distance of energy transfer in Europium (III) doped nanospinels by passivating the surface of the nanospinel with a tta (Chapter 4). A variety of ligands are explored in order to optimize the sensitization efficiency in relation to the difference in energy between the singlet and triplet levels of the ligands versus the 5D0 and 5D4 energy levels of Europium (III) and Terbium (III) respectively (Chapter 5).</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This treatise focuses on John Luther Adams’s piece Inuksuit, a percussion composition for nine to ninety-nine percussionists to be performed outdoors. A biographical overview of Adams’s life and inspiration of Inuksuit will be presented, followed by a survey of compositional and performance practices of the work and exploration behind the meaning of this singular piece of music. The origins of Inuksuit, its construction and form, and the elaborate production logistics will be outlined in concert with input from professional percussionists with intimate knowledge of the work, as well as the composer himself.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The ready availability of public-use data from various large national complex surveys has immense potential for the assessment of population characteristics---means, proportions, totals, etcetera. Using a model-based approach, complex surveys can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments and to identify risk factors for important diseases such as cancer. Existing statistical methods based on estimating equations and/or utilizing resampling methods are often not valid with survey data due to design features such as stratification, multistage sampling and unequal selection probabilities. In this paper, we accommodate these design features in the analysis of highly skewed response variables arising from large complex surveys. Specifically, we propose a double-transform-both-sides based estimating equations approach to estimate the median regression parameters of the highly skewed response; the double-transform-both-sides method applies the same transformation twice to both the response and regression function. The usual sandwich variance estimate can be used in our approach, whereas a resampling approach would be needed for a pseudo-likelihood based on minimizing absolute deviations. Furthermore, the double-transform-both-sides estimator is relatively robust to the true underlying distribution,  and has much smaller mean square error than the least absolute deviations estimator. The method is motivated by an analysis of laboratory data on urinary iodine concentration from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Heisenberg Uncertainty principle is a fundamental concept from Quantum Mechanics that also describes the Fourier Transform. Unfortunately, it does not directly apply to the digital signals. However, it can be generalized if we use entropy rather than energy to form an uncertainty relation. This form of uncertainty, called the Hirschman Uncertainty, uses the Shannon Entropy. The Hirschman Uncertainty is defined as the average of the Shannon entropies of the discrete-time signal and its Fourier Transform. The functions that minimize this uncertainty are not the wellknown Gaussians from the Heisenberg theory, but are the picket fence functions first noticed in wavelet denoising. This connection suggests that the Hirschman Uncertainty is fundamental, but not conclusively. Here in this research, we develop two new uncertainty measures that are derived from the Hirschman Uncertainty. We want to use these measures to explore the fundamental nature of the Hirschman Uncertainty.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the first case, we replace the Shannon entropy with the R´enyi entropy and study the impact of varying the R´enyi order on the uncertainty of various digital signals. We call this new uncertainty measure, the Hirschman-R´enyi uncertainty denoted by U^alpha1/2(x). We find that the derived uncertainty measure is invariant to the R´enyi order in case of the picket fence signals and varies in case of other the digital signals like rectagular, cosine, square wave signals to name a few. This new uncertainty measure that utilizes the R´enyi entropy decays with the increase in R´enyi order value. Considering the invariance in uncertainty in case of picket fence signal, we can use either Shannon or R´enyi entropy with any value of R´enyi order to calculate Hirschman Uncertainty.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the second case, we derive an uncertainty measure that replaces the Fourier Transform with the Fractional Fourier Transform. The Hirschman Uncertainty using dFRT denoted by U^a1/ 2(x) is explored with the help of the minimizers of the Hirschman Uncertainty (the picket fence signals) along with the other digital signals. In this case, we find that the degree of rotation in the Fractional Fourier Transform does impact the uncertainty at the integer values of the transfer order. But for the non-interger values of the transfer order, the uncertainty variations are greatly reduced or are minimal.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Finally to help verify our theory, we perform a classical texture recognition experiment. We find that the recognition performance follows directly as our developed Hirschman </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>R´enyi Uncertainty and the Hirschman Uncertainty using dFRT theory suggests. Additionally, it appears that a predictive solution for the proper selection of the R´enyi order and the rotation angle can be developed that could significantly aid in image analysis. Our recognition results are consistent with entropic invariance theory in case of the two uncertainty measures. These results suggests that the Hirschman Uncertainty may be a fundamental characteristic of the digital signals.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>ORF45 of Kaposi’s sarcoma–associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a gamma herpesvirus-specific, immediate-early, and tegument protein.  Our previous studies have revealed its crucial roles in both early and late stages of KSHV infection.  In this study, we surveyed the interactome of ORF45 using a panel of monoclonal antibodies.  In addition to the previously identified extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) and p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) proteins, we found several other co-purified proteins, including prominent ones of ~38 kDa and ~130 kDa.  Mass spectrometry revealed that the 38 kDa protein is viral ORF33 and the 130 kDa protein is cellular USP7 (ubiquitin-specific protease 7).  We mapped the ORF33-binding domain to the highly conserved carboxyl terminal 19-aa of ORF45, and the USP7-binding domain to the reported consensus motif in the central region of ORF45.  Using immunofluorescence staining, we observed colocalization of ORF45 with ORF33 or USP7, in both transfected conditions and KSHV-infected cells.  Moreover, we noticed an ORF45-dependent relocalization of a portion of ORF33/USP7 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.  We found that ORF45 caused an increase in ORF33 protein accumulation, which was abolished if either the ORF33- or USP7-binding domain in ORF45 was deleted.  Furthermore, deletion of the conserved carboxyl terminus of ORF45 in the KSHV genome drastically reduced the level of ORF33 protein in KSHV-infected cells and abolished production of progeny virions.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To determine if the binding of ORF33 is a critical function of C19, we used co-precipitation with point mutants of the C19 region and identified two required residues: tryptophan 403 and tryptophan 405.  We then engineered KSHV genomes containing these mutants and transfected them into iSLK cells.  Similar to the C19 deletion mutant, we found that both binding-deficient mutants exhibited decreased ORF33 accumulation and viral particle production.  Since C19 is sufficient for binding ORF33, we hypothesized that introduction of a C19 analogue could inhibit binding and may lead to a similar decrease in viral particle production.  We used ELISA to measure the binding of ORF33 to ORF45 in the presence of TAT-C19 and found that TAT-C19 inhibited binding in a dose-dependent manner.  To measure the analogue’s effect on viral particle production, we treated KSHV-infected cells with TAT-C19 and found that TAT-C19 inhibited viral particle production in a dose-dependent manner.  In conclusion, binding of ORF33 and ORF45 during the lytic cycle is required for accumulation of the ORF33 and production of viral particles.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In addition to forming a complex with ORF33 and USP7, we also found a strong association of ORF45 to RSK and ERK during the lytic cycle, matching previous reports that ORF45 bound ERK and RSK in a single complex.  During that study, ORF45 was found to form a complex with ERK and RSK and the formation of this complex lead to accumulation of active ERK and RSK.  While the binding site of RSK was mapped to aa 55-70, it was unclear if ERK bound to ORF45 directly or through RSK.  Using ¬in vitro binding analysis, we identified an ERK binding site in aa 16-35.  Using T-Coffee analysis, we compared the sequences of gamma-2 herpesvirus homologues of ORF45 and found two highly conserved phenylalanine residues at aa 32 and 34.  After generating point mutants of each residue to alanine, we measured their effect on the activation of ERK and RSK induced by ORF45 and found that either mutation lead to decreased activation of ERK and RSK.  We are currently evaluating their effect upon the activation of ERK and RSK during the lytic cycle and the production of progeny virions.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>How much warmer is the ocean surface than the atmosphere directly above it? Part 1 of the present study offers a means to quantify this temperature difference using a nonlinear one-dimensional global energy balance coupled ocean–atmosphere model (“Aqua Planet”). The significance of our model, which is of intermediate complexity, is its ability to obtain an analytical solution for the global average temperatures. Preliminary results show that, for the present climate, global mean ocean temperature is 291.1 K whereas surface atmospheric temperature is 287.4 K. Thus, the surface ocean is 3.7 K warmer than the atmosphere above it. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Temporal perturbation of the global mean solution obtained for “Aqua Planet” showed a stable system. Oscillation amplitude of the atmospheric temperature anomaly is greater in magnitude to those found in the ocean. There is a phase shift (a lag in the ocean), which is caused by oceanic thermal inertia. Climate feedbacks due to selected climate parameters such as incoming radiation, cloud cover, and CO2 are discussed. Warming obtained with our model compares with Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) estimations. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Application of our model to local regions illuminates the importance of evaporative cooling in determining derived air-sea temperature offsets, where an increase in the latter increases the systems overall sensitivity to evaporative cooling. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In part 2, we wish to answer the fairly complicated question of whether global warming and an increased freshwater flux cause Northern Hemispheric warming or cooling.  Starting from the assumption of the ocean as the primary source of variability in the Northern hemispheric ocean–atmosphere coupled system, we employed a simple non–linear one–dimensional coupled ocean–atmosphere model similar to the “Aqua Planet” model but with additional advective heat transports. The simplicity of this model allows us to analytically predict the evolution of many dynamical variables of interest such as, the strength of the Atlantic Meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), temperatures of the ocean and atmosphere, mass transports, salinity, and ocean–atmosphere heat fluxes. Model results show that a reduced AMOC transport due to an increased freshwater flux causes cooling in both the atmosphere and ocean in the North Atlantic (NA) deep–water formation region. Cooling in both the ocean and atmosphere can cause a reduction of the ocean–atmosphere temperature difference, which in turn reduces heat fluxes in both the ocean and atmosphere. For present day climate parameters, the calculated critical freshwater flux needed to arrest AMOC is 0.14 Sv. Assuming a constant atmospheric zonal flow, there is both minimal reduction in the AMOC strength, as well as minimal warming of the ocean and atmosphere. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This model provides a conceptual framework for a dynamically sound response of the ocean and atmosphere to AMOC variability as a function of increased freshwater flux. The results are qualitatively consistent with numerous realistic coupled numerical models of varying complexity.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The State of Florida acquires over 300 cutaway buses every year. The increasing popularity of such buses raised concerns about passenger safety and overall crashworthiness of this transportation mode. Dimensions of the cutaway buses and their two-stage manufacturing process made them exempted from safety standards which were developed for smaller passenger cars as well as for large coaches. To fill this gap, cutaway bus manufacturers try to demonstrate the strength of their bus roof structures by using FMVSS 220 standard, which follows conservative quasi-static load tests for school buses in the US. However, more advanced, dynamic based safety standard - Regulation 66, was developed in Europe. It is based on a dynamic rollover test which more closely resembles an actual rollover accident. A cutaway bus is placed on a tilt table 800 mm above a concrete slab. The bus is tilted until it falls and impacts the concrete deck and the deformation of the sidewalls is measured in order to check if there is any intrusion into a so called ‘survival space’. This standard was endorsed by 44 countries through the United Nation resolution. However, the Regulation 66 standard does not specify all the parameters regarding the rollover test. From multiple tests it can be observed that the friction between the vehicle and the concrete slab which is being impacted by the bus has an influence on the outcomes of the experiment and has great contribution to either a positive or negative assessment of the crashworthiness of a tested vehicle.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This Master thesis focuses on the friction parameters between the impacting cutaway bus and a concrete slab used in the Regulation 66 standard. Due to dynamic nature of the experiment, the impact of the bus exerts a high normal force on the concrete slab. Together with an uneven and non-standard geometry of the elements in contact with the concrete deck the standard coefficient of friction found in the literature or obtained using standard tests may not hold. The proper assessment of this coefficient is important since many rollover tests are carried out numerically using Finite Element Methods. The use of numerical analysis reduces the cost of an expensive full scale rollover test. However, it requires verified and validated parameters in order to consider the results trustworthy. The experimental part of this thesis consists of designing and carrying out experiments to evaluate the coefficient of friction for an impacting cutaway bus and a concrete slab. The results from the experiments are incorporated into an explicit computer code LS-DYNA, which is used for numerical analysis of the cutaway buses. The final outcome of this thesis will be validating the coefficient of friction used in the Finite Element Analysis which will lead to improvement of the Finite Element models and will be used to check the influence of the coefficient of friction on vehicle structure deformation (Deformation Index) during rollover accidents.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether Spanish-speaking language minority children develop conceptual knowledge (Cummins, 1981) that is common to their two languages alongside development of proficiency in their first (L1) and second (L2) languages. Seventy-three first and second grade children completed two semantic priming tasks (i.e., a lexical decision task and a preferential looking paradigm) that were designed to examine children’s sensitivity to the semantic relations between words within and across languages. It was hypothesized that within- and cross-language semantic priming effects would occur but that translation priming effects would not occur. Overall, results did not support hypotheses, as consistent semantic priming effects were not observed across the two tasks. However, limited evidence for semantic priming effects within English and from English to Spanish did emerge on the preferential looking paradigm. Substantial evidence for translation priming effects from Spanish-to-English was observed on the preferential looking paradigm. Children’s Spanish vocabulary knowledge moderated translation priming effects on the lexical decision task. Although this pattern of results was not consistent with hypotheses, it was similar to the pattern of relations between bilingual individuals’ L1 and L2 proposed by the revised hierarchical model (Kroll &amp; Stewart, 1994). The results of this study indicated that Spanish-speaking language minority children rely on translation from their non-dominant to their dominant language to access meaning. Additionally, results provided limited evidence that information in the dominant and non-dominant language is activated simultaneously, indicating that children have conceptual knowledge that is common to both their L1 and L2.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>There has been much research done on the reduction, or attenuation, of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), particularly within landfill cover soils, as H2S can cause many issues when exposed to the atmosphere. The objective of this research study was to understand hydrogen sulfide (H2S) attenuation within landfill cover soils, and to use mass balancing to determine how much sulfur was retained within each layer of test pad. Both of these were completed through 403 days of monitoring three 65 feet by 35 feet lysimeter test pads constructed at the Riverbend Landfill. Test Pad 1 was constructed with 18 inches of local soil and an underlying 6 inch gravel layer. Test Pad 2 was constructed with 12 inches of compost, 6 inches of local soil and an underlying 6 inch gravel layer. Test Pad 3 was constructed with 6 inches of local soil and an underlying 6 inch gravel layer. Monitoring on Test Pad 3 was stopped on April 27th, 2015 due to erosion of the 6 inch soil layer, while Test Pads 1 and 2 were monitored until July 20th, 2015. Readings of landfill gas and H2S inflow, and bottom landfill gas and H2S concentrations were taken in each testing pad on a weekly basis. Bottom H2S loading into the soil layer and top H2S emissions from the soil layer were also measured to determine the removal efficiency of H2S. The average H2S removal efficiency of the test pads is 95%, with Test Pad 1 having a removal efficiency of 99%, Test Pad 2 having a removal efficiency of 99%, and Test Pad 3 having a removal efficiency of 82%. Six soil samples and five water samples were taken to measure sulfur concentration within the testing pads. Soil samples were also taken within each of the layers of each testing location within each test pad to determine the soil type and the water content of each soil layer. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Mass balance was calculated by taking the amount of sulfur loaded into the bottom of each testing pad, and subtracting the sum of sulfur loaded into the soil cover, sulfur emitted from the soil cover into the atmosphere, and sulfur removed from the system with water as sulfate. Test Pads 1 and 2 yielded similar results, both retaining about 6000 grams of sulfur within their cover layers, while the results from Test Pad 3 suggest that more sulfur was removed from the system than was originally pushed into the system, which is not possible and suggests errors with either testing methods or the testing pad itself. While the concentrations of sulfur within each test pad layer were measured, there were concerns with their dependability that caused them to not be used to determine the amount of sulfur in each layer.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Governments since World War I have instituted radio broadcasts in foreign countries as a means of informing and influencing local populations, particularly in times of war and other conflicts. Frequently considered propaganda, such broadcasts also have been seen as a tool of public diplomacy, an evolving concept that generally refers to the use of mass communication, foreign exchanges, and other non-traditional diplomatic tools to advance foreign policy goals and cultivate positive international relations. This study concerned a particular case, the U.S. public diplomacy tool Voice of America (VOA) Deewa, a Pashto language radio service for the Tribal areas of Pakistan and Afghanistan. VOA Deewa was an ideal case for examining questions of public diplomacy and propaganda since it operates in a poor, neglected, war-stricken region where Taliban members spread anti-American sentiments and many citizens hold anti-American attitudes, that have been exacerbated by U.S. drone strikes in the region. Though the United States established the VOA Deewa to contain Taliban anti-America propaganda and change the hearts and minds of local citizens, it has been criticized as propaganda. To examine this assertion, and the extent to which VOA Deewa exhibited features of public diplomacy, extensive data were collected from senders, messages, and receivers. Twenty-seven VOA Deewa shows broadcast at the time of 2013 drone strikes were analyzed to determine the extent and nature of drone strike news and other topics. In addition, 11 Deewa staff from Washington D.C. and Pakistan were individually interviewed and focus groups with 78 university students belonging to Tribal regions were conducted, as well as 5 telephone interviews with locals and face-to-face individual interviews with 18 Internally Displaced Persons. Data collection and analysis was triangulated, and all qualitative content/textual analysis was conducted using Nvivo software. The findings indicate that a highly qualified, native Pashtun VOA Deewa staff delivered balanced and objective journalism on a variety of topics (education, health and hygiene, business and finance, social and moral ethics, freedom, democracy) from a U.S. perspective but with a focus on the target region. In addition, the shows frequently highlighted women's, human, and political rights, which are lacking in the Tribal region. Overall, VOA Deewa served as an effective platform for delivering awareness-raising messages, empowering local voices, and connecting locals to locals through on-air call-in programs that increased the sharing of ideas, understanding, and unity. Thus, VOA Deewa was found to serve as a public diplomacy instrument in accord with the VOA charter, and as such, to incorporate characteristics of positive propaganda and strategic communication. Though the findings may be unique to the VOA Deewa case, they contribute to the development of a theoretical framework for public diplomacy and provide a direction for future research.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Over the years a variety of indices have been proposed to summarize regression analyses. Unfortunately the proposed indices are only appropriate when meta-analysts want to understand the role of a single predictor variable in predicting the outcome variable. However, sometimes meta-analysts want to understand the effect of a set of variables on an outcome variable. In this paper, four methods are presented for obtaining a composite effect for two focal predictor variables from a single regression model.  The indices are the average of the standardized regression coefficients (ASC), the average of the standardized regression coefficients using Hedges and Olkin’s (1985) approach (AHO), the sheaf coefficient (SC), and the squared multiple semi-partial correlation coefficient (MSP).  A simulation study was conducted to examine the behavior of the indices and their variance when the number of predictor variables in the model, the sample size, the correlations between the focal predictor variables in the model, and the correlations between the focal and non-focal predictor variables in the model were manipulated.  The results of the study show that the average bias values of the ASC and AHO estimates are small even when the sample size is small.  Furthermore, the ASC and AHO estimates and their estimated variances are more precise than the other indices under all conditions examined. Therefore, when meta-analysts are interested in estimating the effect of a set of predictor variables on an outcome variable from a single regression model, the ASC or AHO procedures are preferred.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The purpose of this pilot study was to investigate the effect of preferred recorded music versus preferred live music provided as procedural support by a music therapist on reducing problem behaviors and increasing positive behaviors exhibited by persons with dementia during bathing procedures. Carrying out bathing procedures with persons who have dementia has been identified as one of the most challenging tasks faced by caregivers. Persons with dementia often exhibit aggressive and hostile behaviors when engaged in bathing procedures with their caregivers. Because of the lack of previous research designed to address these problem behaviors, and the personal nature of bathing procedures, an experimental probe was carried out with five individuals in the later stages of dementia living in a nursing facility. The designated caregivers of these five individuals volunteered their loved ones to serve as participants in this pilot study. Participants were observed for a total of three showers: one with no music, one with recorded preferred music, and one with music therapy with live preferred music. During the three showers, the music therapist and the staff member administering the bath observed the durations of both problem and positive behaviors. Results were mixed among the five participants; though preferred live music was generally more effective than recorded preferred music or no music in reducing problem behaviors and increasing positive behaviors.</DISS_para>

Wet adhesion is brought on by an amino acid from mussel byssal plaques called3,4-dihydroxyphenyl –L-alanine, which has been known to generate strong bonding under wet conditions.  .  The photocrosslinking segment consists of an anthracene based monomer used for mechanical fortification of polymer chains.  The water soluble segment consists of poly(acrylic acid), which has been known to increase water solubility of polymers and increase adhesion strength of adhesives. The terpolymer was designed to easily applicable using biologically friendly solvents including water and ethanol.  Structural design was confirmed by NMR and UV-Vis spectroscopy. Reversible cycloaddition reactions were executed using a handheld UV lamp along with a photoreactor. Molecular weight increases were seen from 4.120 x 104 Da to 7.429 x 104 Da. Lap shear strength testing showed effects of UV exposure through increases in adhesion energy above 450%. Multiple application variables were tested to determine optimal conditions, such as solvent, concentration, and substrate. Currently, optimal conditions show a 1:1 weight ratio of polymer:solvent in water for all surfaces.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have advanced greatly in the recent decades, but are not without their limitations. This work first details the pitfalls of MD simulations, then presents the details of a new, robust method, orthogonal space tempering (OST) which can achieve accurate and efficient sampling in MD simulations as well as accurate recovery of desired thermodynamic quantities. This method is then applied to understanding the mechanistic details and free energy of passive transmembrane permeation of small molecules through a lipid bilayer, as well as bulky and charged species. Furthermore, the method is applied to the studyi of the conformational and dynamical properties of a very important human neuropeptide Y homologue, avian pancreatic peptide.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Deep convection is an important component of atmospheric circulations that affects many aspects of weather and climate.  Therefore, improved understanding and realistic simulations of deep convection are critical to both operational and climate forecasts.  Large-eddy simulations (LESs) often are used with observations to enhance understanding of convective processes.  This study develops and evaluates a nested-LES method using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model.  Our goal is to evaluate the extent to which the WRF nested-LES approach is useful for studying deep convection during a real-world case.  The method was applied on 2 September 2013, a day of continental convection having a robust set of ground and airborne data available for evaluation.  A three domain mesoscale WRF simulation is run first.  Then, the finest mesoscale output (1.35 km grid length) is used to separately drive nested-LES domains with grid lengths of 450 and 150 m.  Results reveal that the nested-LES approach reasonably simulates a broad spectrum of observations, from reflectivity distributions to vertical velocity profiles, during the study period.  However, reducing the grid spacing does not necessarily improve results for our case, with the 450 m simulation outperforming the 150 m version.  We find that simulated updrafts in the 150 m simulation are too narrow to overcome the negative effects of entrainment, thereby generating convection that is weaker than observed.  Increasing the sub-grid mixing length in the 150 m simulation leads to deeper, more realistic convection, but comes at the expense of delaying the onset of the convection.  Overall, results show that both the 450 m and 150 m simulations are influenced considerably by the choice of sub-grid mixing length used in the LES turbulence closure.  Finally, the simulations and observations are used to study the processes forcing strong midlevel cloud-edge downdrafts that were observed on 2 September.  Results suggest that these downdrafts are forced by evaporative cooling due to mixing near cloud edge and by vertical perturbation pressure gradient forces acting to restore mass continuity around neighboring updrafts.  We conclude that the WRF nested-LES approach provides an effective method for studying deep convection for our real-world case.  The method can be used to provide insight into physical processes that are important to understanding observations.  The WRF nested-LES approach could be adapted for other case studies in which high-resolution observations are available for validation.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This dissertation focuses on the development of novel chemical reactions for enhancing the efficiency of synthesis. In particular, we disclose the development of a tandem fragmentation-olefination reaction for the synthesis of 1,6-enynes and its applications to the syntheses of several natural products. The first chapter reviews fragmentation methodologies for the preparation of alkynes, with insights and discussion in historical aspects, mechanisms, stereoelectronics, and tactics. The second chapter starts with a brief background on values of 1,6-enynes leading to various cyclic and polycyclic structures, currently available methods for the preparation of 1,6-enynes, and challenges these methods are facing, especially in preparing neopentyl tethered 1,6-enynes. Then we describe our development of the tandem fragmentation-olefination reaction, which took advantage of tandem process to overcome intermediate instability, providing the final products more efficiently. In chapter 3, this method was applied in the syntheses of several natural products, either to showcase the efficiency of the methodology or to supply material with poential bioactivities. In case of alcyopterosin A, the synthesis was shortened by half when compared with previous approaches. We also have established a divergent approach to both illudalic acid and illudinine. The approach relies on two key transformations: a tandem fragmentation-Knoevenagel condensation and an inversed electron demand intramolecular dehydrogenative Diels-Alder reaction.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Python Package Index (PyPI) is a repository that hosts all the packages ever developed for the Python community. It hosts thousands of packages from different developers and for the Python community, it is the primary source for downloading and installing packages. It also provides a simple web interface to search for these packages. A direct search on PyPI returns hundreds of packages that are not intuitively ordered, thus making it harder to find the right package. Developers consequently resort to mature search engines like Google, Bing or Yahoo which redirect them to the appropriate package homepage at PyPI. Hence, the first task of this thesis is to improve search results for python packages.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Secondly, this thesis also attempts to develop a new search engine that allows Python developers to perform a code search targeting python modules. Currently, the existing search engines classify programming languages such that a developer must select a programming language from a list. As a result every time a developer performs a search operation, he or she has to choose Python out of a plethora of programming languages. This thesis seeks to offer a more reliable and dedicated search engine that caters specifically to the Python community and ensures a more efficient way to search for Python packages and modules.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In the last few decades, the growth of administration costs on higher education campuses surpassed the growth of instructional costs.  The escalating costs of higher education, which are now outpacing general price levels, have raised concern for policy-makers who are challenged to increase access and make higher education affordable but are constrained by budgets.  The recent recession, with wide-spread effect on economy, provided the opportunity to examine cost patterns on higher education during the recession. This research explored different revenue, costs, staff composition, and state-level factors that might be associated with administration costs, and compared these to the association of the same independent variables on instructional costs for three types of public four year institutions.  This research examined the changes in costs during the last recession. Panel data of a cohort of public institutions with non-missing values over a 23 year period of 1988 to 2010 were analyzed within fixed effect regression models. Revenue factors were shown to have positive relationships with administration costs, and other factors had mixed associations. While descriptive trend analysis showed a decrease in administration costs in the short-run, regression analysis incorporating 23 years of data did not show such decline from a long-term perspective.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Disorder can have a vast variety of consequences for the physics of</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>phase transitions. Some transitions remain unchanged in the presence</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>of disorder while others are completely destroyed. In this dissertation</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>we study the effects of quenched disorder on electronic systmens at</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>zero temperature. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>First, we perform variational studies of the interaction-localization</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>problem to describe the interaction-induced renormalizations of the</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>effective (screened) random potential seen by quasiparticles. Here</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>we present results of careful finite-size scaling studies for the</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>conductance of disordered Hubbard chains at half-filling and zero</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>temperature. While our results indicate that quasiparticle wave functions</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>remain exponentially localized even in the presence of moderate to</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>strong repulsive interactions, we show that interactions produce a</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>strong decrease of the characteristic conductance scale g* signaling</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>the crossover to strong localization. This effect, which cannot be</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>captured by a simple renormalization of the disorder strength, instead</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>reflects a peculiar non-Gaussian form of the spatial correlations</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>of the screened disordered potential, a hitherto neglected mechanism</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>to dramatically reduce the impact of Anderson localization (interference)</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>effects. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Second, we formulate a strong-disorder renormalization-group (SDRG)</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>approach to study the beta function of the tight-binding</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>model in one dimension with both diagonal and off-diagonal disorder</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>for states at the band center. We show that the SDRG method, when</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>used to compute transport properties, yields exact results since it</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>is identical to the transfer matrix method. The beta function</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>is shown to be universal when only off-diagonal disorder is present</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>even though single-parameter scaling is known to be violated. A different</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>single-parameter scaling theory is formulated for this particular</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>(particle-hole symmetric) case. Upon breaking particle-hole symmetry</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>(by adding diagonal disorder), the beta function is shown</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>to crossover from the universal behavior of the particle-hole symmetric</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>case to the conventional nonuniversal one in agreement with the two-parameter</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>scaling theory. We finally draw an analogy with the random transverse-field</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Ising chain in the paramagnetic phase. The particle-hole symmetric</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>case corresponds to the critical point of the quantum Ising model,</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>while the generic case corresponds to the Griffiths paramagnetic phase.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Finally, we implement an efficient strong-disorder renormalization-group</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>(SDRG) procedure to study disordered tight-binding models in any dimension</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>and on the Erdos- Renyi random graphs, which represent</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>an appropriate infinite dimensional limit. Our SDRG algorithm is based</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>on a judicious elimination of most (irrelevant) new bonds generated</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>under RG. It yields excellent agreement with exact numerical results</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>for universal properties at the critical point without significant</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>increase of computer time, and confirm that, for Anderson localization,</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>the upper critical dimension duc = infinite. We find excellent convergence</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>of the relevant 1/d expansion down to d = 2, in contrast to the conventional</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>2 + $\varepsilon$ expansion, which has little to say about what happens</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>in any d &gt; 3. We show that the mysterious mirror</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>symmetry of the conductance scaling function is</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>a genuine strong-coupling effect, as speculated in early work. This</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>opens an efficient avenue to explore the critical properties of Anderson</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>transition in the strong-coupling limit in high dimensions.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Manufacturers need to deploy their assembly systems in a timely manner to cope with expedited product development. Design of such responsive assembly systems consists of generation of assembly/subassembly operations and their hierarchies, operation-machine assignment, selections of machine types and quantities, and the material flow among machines. Exploration of all the feasible solutions to the assembly operations and their hierarchical relationships is vital to optimization of system designs.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This research developed a theoretical framework based on a recursive algorithm to automatically generate all feasible and non-redundant assembly hierarchies efficiently, thereby investigating its impact on assembly system designs. Then this research further discussed the potential applications of the recursive framework in system optimization including joint determination of optimal assembly operations, operation-machine assignment, machine types and quantities, and the material flows among machines. The work was also extended to the optimization of assembly systems for the products with complex liaison relations and product families.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation studies external financing costs of industrial firms and real estate investment trusts.  The first chapter examines investors’ reactions to the announcement of seasoned equity offers (SEOs) in the wake of the recent financial crisis.  We document announcement effects that are twice as large as the historical norm, and this effect is driven by accelerated SEOs.  Prior the crisis, accelerated offers were used for smaller offers and by firms with a more elastic demand curve, whereas after the crisis accelerated offers are larger than before and used by firms with less elastic demand curves.  Moreover, accelerated offers are associated with a lack of time for adequate underwriter due diligence, which is especially critical during uncertain economic times.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The second chapter examines whether corporate governance mitigates the negative effects of the exogenous shock to financing and investment for real estate investment trusts (REITs) during the 2007 – 2008 financial crisis.  We find that net debt issuance, real estate asset growth, and total asset growth experienced significant declines after the onset of the crisis, while net equity issuance only declines for firms with the lowest corporate governance scores.  Internal governance measures (e.g. board composition, shareholder rights, and audit quality) alleviate this decline in financing and investment with the effect being more pronounced among financially constrained firms and those that are less cash constrained.  From a valuation perspective, strong internal governance is associated with more favorable investor reactions to the announcements of debt and equity offers in the crisis period.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The third chapter examines differences in the external financing costs of accelerated and fully marketed SEOs in REITs over the period 1990 – 2013.  Using a two-stage endogenous switching regression model that controls for potential self-selection bias, we find that accelerated offers have significantly lower gross spreads and less underpricing than their counterparts, while there does not appear to be a significant difference in the announcement effects of both issuance methods.  In particular, the gross spreads and underpricing of firms that utilize accelerated offers are significantly lower translating to costs savings of roughly $10 million per issue.  The intended use of proceeds does not differentially affect either announcement effects or the level of underpricing, and post-issue stock returns in the subsequent three months are not significantly different by issuance method.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation explores the recollection of historical memory in a number of significant literary and cinematic texts produced during the first thirty years of the Francoist dictatorship. Ironically, the first quarter-century of post-war Spain was referred to as “los años de la paz” [The Peaceful Years] by the propagandistic effort of the regime. However, as my dissertation will show, representative texts of the same period articulate trauma that was still lingering in collective memory. Contrary to the common assumption that the process of recovery of historical memory began after Franco’s death in 1975, I will show that this same process had begun almost immediately after the outcome of the Spanish Civil War in April of 1939. Based on a theoretical framework built on the juxtaposition of Lacanian psychoanalysis and recent trauma theory, I argue that the texts object of my study – including some well-known Francoist canonical works –actually work through the painful and traumatic experiences of the war and the violence imposed by the dictatorship. Because of the unspeakable nature of psychological trauma and the censorial machinery set in place by the repressive instruments of the Francoist regime, the traumatic experience is never explicitly recounted in these narratives. However, I will demonstrate how these experiences are expressed in the body of the text in unconventional and unexpected ways such as the tension between chaos and silence, the representation of hyperbolic violence, speech acts, the representation of space, inter-textual empathy, as well as gaps and disruptions of the narratives. In my dissertation, I will describe a double-process of reinscription and return of the traumatic event whereby these texts are able to begin a process of working through, becoming, in Dominick LaCapra´s famous theorization of the concept, an “ethical agent” of history that create a counter-narrative to the Francoist silence surrounding many traumas of the war and resulting dictatorship.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The cerebral cortex is a thin folded sheet of neural tissue forming the outmost layer of the cerebrum (brain). Several biological hypotheses have suggested dierent mechanisms involved the development of its folding pattern into sulci (inward valleys) and gyri (outward hills). One hypothesis suggests that mechanical tension along cortico-cortical connections is the principal driving force for cortical folding development.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We propose a new mathematical model based on the tension-based hypothesis surrounding the 26th week of gestational age when the human brain cortex noticeably begins to fold. In our model, the deformation of a two-dimensional semi-circular domain is analyzed through the theory of elasticity. The governing coupled partial differential equations are implemented computationally using a finite element formulation. Plausible brain tissue elasticity parameters with reasonable brain domain size</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>parameters were used in our simulation. Gyrication index which is a measure of cortical foldings is employed to compare the degree of folding between the simulation results.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The proposed model provides an approach for studying the connections between two different biological hypotheses by determining the magnitude of the applied tension force from the previous mathematical models of cortical folding which are based on a biochemical hypothesis. It allows our model to explain the mechanisms behind disorders occurring in all stages of development. In addition, the ability to freely set the directions and magnitudes of the applied forces allows to analysis of various abnormal cortical foldings by comparing MR imaging features of human brain cortical disorders. Our simulation results show that the unveiled mechanisms underlying the abnormal cortical folding development are well captured by our proposed model.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This experimental study was intended to examine whether game-based learning (GBL) that encompasses four particular game characteristics (challenges, a storyline, rewards, and the integration of game-play with learning content) in the OpenSimulator-supported virtual reality (VR) learning environment can improve mathematical achievement and motivation for elementary school students toward math learning. In this pre- and post-test experimental comparison study, data were collected from 132 fourth graders through an achievement test, and a Short Instructional Materials Motivational Survey (SIMMS).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The same tasks were provided to the experimental and control groups. Tasks for the experimental group involved the following four game characteristics: (1) challenges, (2) a storyline, (3) rewards, and (4) the integration of game-play with learning content. The control group was given the same tasks and learning environment setting (OpenSimulator-supported VR) that was used for the experimental group. The exception was that the control group tasks did not include the game characteristics: (1) challenges, (2) a storyline, (3) rewards, and (4) the integration of game-play with learning content. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) using a treatment (treatment vs. control) on the achievement indicated a significant effect of GBL in the VR environment on math knowledge test performance. For motivation, the results indicated that there was no significant difference on the post-test scores for the perceived motivational quality of the learning activity (MQLA) between the experimental group and the control group.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this dissertation project I use the case of a local Occupy Wall Street movement to examine tensions in the local adoption of a national movement’s organizational forms and practices. Movements are often thought to be organic phenomena, yet some movements may incorporate much of their organizational framework from preexisting movements. How a local movement incorporates or adopts a preexisting organizational form has implications for movement activities and outcomes. In the case I study—Occupy Tallahassee—the local movement emerged from the national movement, which provided an organizational structure and loose platform for attracting participants. Having drawn from an existing organizational form, however, the local movement did not toil with their own meaning making in developing collective identity or solidarity around how to make collective decisions. Ultimately, the group struggled to unify around shared meanings of democracy, collective identity, and common grievances. I examine this struggle and some of the particular challenges that arise when political entrepreneurs attempt local implementation of a national movement brand without being cognizant of local conditions around which to mobilize or build a platform.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study examined the nature and quality of teacher-student interactions in a third grade science classroom and investigated how interactions and teacher-child relationships relate to the learning of science concepts. The relationships between the three dimensions of teacher-student relationships (Closeness, Conflict, and Dependency) and teacher-student interactions including the dimensions explaining the nature and the quality of teacher-student interactions were examined. The study also determined whether there was a relationship between students’ conceptual understanding of science and all variables of teacher-student interactions and the teacher-student relationships. First, data from the videotape and audiotape recordings were transcribed, coded and analyzed to determine the appropriateness of the proposed interaction-types and their classification into the categories. The twelve teacher-student interaction categories used in this study were able to capture all verbal teacher-student interactions in the classroom. Second, each teacher-student interaction was placed into the respective dimension and group explaining the nature and quality of the interaction. Finally, Pearson Product Moment Correlations were computed to explore the possible relationships between the teacher-student interactions and relationships and students’ conceptual understanding of science. Teacher-student interaction scores were obtained through natural observations of eight- to nine-year-old children. Students were rated by their teachers using the STRS in order to obtain teacher child relationship scores. Similarly, conceptual science understanding scores were obtained through pre- and post-tests delivered at the beginning and end of the science unit.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The findings of the study suggested a strong relationship between teacher’s perception of her relationships with the students and the teacher-student interactions in the classroom. It appears that classroom conversations mostly take place between the teacher and the students whom the teacher perceived to have better relationships. However, it was clear from the observations that positive teacher-student relationships did not necessarily warrant for high quality teacher-student interactions in the classroom. The quality of the teacher-student interactions during the science lessons appeared to be more moderate than high in quality. Students’ improvement in conceptual understanding of science was rather related to the positive classroom environment and the friendly classroom atmosphere created by the teacher and did not significantly correlate with the student’s individual interaction or relationship with the teacher.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Background: Athletes continue to strive for an edge over the competition. In recent years, dietary nitrate supplementation, particularly in the form of beetroot juice, has been shown to improve oxygen cost economy in endurance-focused submaximal intensity exercise and extend the time to exhaustion during maximal intensity exercise. However, scarce literature exists on the effects of nitrate supplementation on sports that focus mainly on strength and power. CrossFit is a sport that relies on strength, power, and endurance, and incorporates high-intensity, Olympic-based lifting and interval training exercises. Purpose: To investigate the effects of six days of dietary nitrate supplementation on strength, power and endurance in CrossFit athletes. Methods: Twelve male CrossFit athletes (age, 23 ± 5 years; CrossFit training &gt; 3 days/week for at least 4 months) participated in this randomized, crossover, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. After familiarization, baseline testing for peak aerobic capacity (VO2peak), anthropometrics, and body composition (BodPod®) was performed. A three-day food log was completed both before and after the completion of the study. The food consumed 24 hours before the first trial was followed for each subsequent trial. Day 1 baseline testing included a blood draw for plasma nitrate and nitrite, as well as strength (Biodex), power (Wingate), and endurance (2K row) tests. Day two consisted of a sport-specific CrossFit circuit known as Grace. After testing, participants consumed either 8 mmol potassium nitrate (N) or 8 mmol of potassium chloride (PL) in pill form for six days. After this period, the participants returned for post-testing, had a 10-day washout period, and then returned for baseline and post-testing consuming the opposite supplement. Repeated measures of analysis of variance and a Student’s T-test (SPSS Version 21, Cary, NC) were used to compare results. Results: There were no significant differences in dietary intake except for fiber (PRE: 22 ± 9 vs POST: 27 ± 11 g, P = 0.03). Plasma nitrate did not significantly change in N (PRE: 146.77 ± 69.48 vs POST: 192.05 ± 69.48 nM, P = 0.07) but did significantly increase in PL (PRE: 140.96 ± 59.98 vs POST: 204.82 ± 64.82 nM, P = 0.02). There were no significant differences for isokinetic strength measurements, but for isometric extension 60° there was a main effect of time (P = 0.03) which equated to a 17.23 ± 13.04 Nm (10.19 ± 36.60 %) increase in force in N and a 10.65 ± 6.42 Nm (6.11 ± 17.36 %) increase in PL. The Wingate power test resulted in a main effect of time, but no group x time effect. However, N increased 58.92 ± 7.11 W (6.62 ± 3.96 %), but PL only increased 6.92 ± 26.01 W (0.77 ± 14.19 %; P = 0.08). No significant differences between groups were measured for the 2000-m rowing test. While not statistically significant, the time to complete the Grace circuit improved on average by -32.35 ± 53.24 sec (-8.94 ± 31.14 %) in N compared to a -10.83 ± 12.68 sec (-3.84 ± 8.94 %) in PL. Conclusion: Consuming dietary nitrate in the potassium nitrate salt form did not statistically improve strength, power, or endurance in male CrossFit athletes. However, while not statistically significant, the improvement in the time to complete the sport specific Grace test using N may be meaningful during competition.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study is to analyze &lt;i&gt;Dragons in the Sky&lt;/i&gt; for horn, percussion and computer-generated tape (1989) by American composer, Mark Schultz (1957-2015). &lt;i&gt;Dragons in the Sky&lt;/i&gt; won the 1990 International Horn Society Composition Contest, and has subsequently been performed over four hundred times worldwide and recorded on three music labels: Summit Records, Hard Cor Music, and Sunset Music Australia. Because of the popularity of &lt;i&gt;Dragons&lt;/i&gt;, a consortium of horn players commissioned Schultz to orchestrate the work for orchestra (1998) and wind ensemble (1999). Despite its fame, there is little information – published or unpublished – on the composer and his works.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>It is the intent of this paper to add to the relatively small body of literature on Mark Schultz and his compositional additions to the horn repertoire. &lt;i&gt;Dragons in the Sky&lt;/i&gt; is a completely octatonic work and employs technology, in the form of computer-generated sounds, unique to the large mainframe supercomputers of the 1970’s and 1980’s. Although this paper was not intended as a historical source, the author includes biographical information on the composer. A performer’s guide to &lt;i&gt;Dragons in the Sky&lt;/i&gt; is included to aid those performing the work. Also, the author has included an annotated bibliography of Schultz’s works for horn and a current discography.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This thesis is a continuous effort contributed to the field of developing a new type of functional porous materials - Nanocarbon Foam (NCF) by crosslinking multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) into networks in three-dimensional (3D). Synthetic routes and characterizations of NCF, and their applications as strain-gauge sensors and electrode materials in lithium-air (Li-air) battery are described.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this research, the first accomplishment is proposing a robust methodology for creating superealstic 3D macroscopic NCF with controlled cellular structure. The key contributions contain: (1) understanding the premise of the design that gives the NCF with desired structure and porosity; (2) designing fabrication protocol for NCFs with controlled densities and macroscopic structure; (3) fabricating varied NCF with tunable porosity and structures, which in turn will endow the NCF with different characteristics. This experimental methodology for systematic and quantitative investigation of the processing-structure relationships provides a means for the fabrication optimization of NCF with desired structures.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Though the mechanical, electronic, and thermal properties of CNTs have been extensively studied, for NCF that is a mixture of pristine and functionalized CNTs, it will not only have the collective behavior of the individual tubes, but will also have properties generated from the interactions between the tubes and engineered components. To understand the structure-properties relationship of NCF, the second accomplishment is studying the properties of obtained NCFs. Density, specific surface area, porosity, compressive behavior, mechanical robustness, electrical and electromechanical properties of NCF have been characterized in details. For comparison, properties originated from cellular structures built of other materials, such as polymeric foam, fiber aerogels, etc., are compared with that of NCF. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Moreover, some engineering applications of NCF have been discussed. With the unique features of NCFs, my proposed future work will focus on understanding porous structure formation and resulted unique properties by the means of scientific modelling. In addition, NCF will be explored as the skeleton for fabricating hybrid systems.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The frontal metamorphic (western Blue Ridge) allochthon in the southern Appalachians in Georgia and Tennessee contains the Neoproterozoic Ocoee Supergroup which records the rifting of Rodinia, overlain by the Lower Cambrian Chilhowee Group, which represents the transition into southeastern Laurentia’s Atlantic-type margin. The Ocoee Supergroup is conventionally subdivided into the Snowbird Group, the Great Smoky Group, and the Walden Creek Group, but tectonic separation of the latter two groups has resulted in indeterminate stratigraphic relationships. In an isolated thrust sheet along the northwestern flank of the Blue Ridge, the Walden Creek Group is disconformably overlain by the Chilhowee Group, documenting a late Neoproterozoic age for the Walden Creek Group.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Recent paleontological discoveries indicate that a thrust sheet overlying the Chilhowee panel described above, and lying structurally beneath the Epperson synclinorium to the southeast, which was formerly designated as Walden Creek Group, is as young as Siluro-Devonian. Along the western and eastern flanks of the Ducktown anticline (Epperson synclinorium and Murphy synclinorium respectively), the Great Smoky Group is stratigraphically overlain by the Lower Cambrian Nantahala-Brasstown Formations (outboard Chilhowee Group equivalents). The Nantahala and Brasstown Formations in the Murphy synclinorium are stratigraphically overlain by the Murphy Marble, which is in turn unconformably overlain by the post-Cambrian Mineral Bluff Group. In the Epperson synclinorium, the Nantahala-Brasstown Formations undifferentiated are overlain by rocks conventionally assigned to the Walden Creek Group, but this unit has no overlying stratigraphic constraints. North of the Ocoee Gorge the Nantahala-Brasstown Formations pinch out and this “Walden Creek Group” lies above the Great Smoky Group. The stratigraphic base of the “Walden Creek Group” in this area has been interpreted as either conformable or unconformable. Along the Hiwassee River, the lower Walden Creek Group contact is marked by basal conglomerates similar to those found in the southern Epperson synclinorium where the “Walden Creek Group” is stratigraphically above the Nantahala-Brasstown Formations.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Therefore, previous work has assigned the Walden Creek Group to apparently different stratigraphic levels with respect to the Chilhowee Group. The Walden Creek Group in the Epperson synclinorium is stratigraphically above sequences (Nantahala/Brasstown) equivalent to the Chilhowee Group, but in most current literature is assigned to a stratigraphic position below that Group. Recent paleontologic discoveries reassign rocks in the adjacent northwest thrust sheet to the post-Cambrian Maggies Mill Formation from their traditional interpretation as part of the upper Walden Creek Group (Sandsuck Formation). Parallels between rocks interpreted as belonging to the Walden Creek Group in the Epperson synclinorium and those in the Maggies Mill Formation include strikingly similar lithologies and metamorphic grade. Mapping and a petrographic study have confirmed the Nantahala-Brasstown Formations assignment within the Epperson synclinorium via comparisons with the Nantahala and Brasstown Formations in the Murphy synclinorium.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Supplementary files include three plate size maps.  The first of the three maps focuses within the Hemp Top, Caney Creek, and Tennga Quadrangles.  The second map focuses in the McFarland Quadrangle along the Hiwassee River.  The third map is a modified regional geologic map showing stratigraphic correlations.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Recent research has demonstrated that social exclusion can increase the motivation to develop new affiliative bonds with others. The primary goal of the paper was to examine the effect that social exclusion would have on gratitude toward a novel person. An additional goal was to test how social acceptance would influence gratitude toward a novel other. Across two studies, social exclusion increased self-reported gratitude for a small gift among people low in a sense of entitlement compared to those in a control condition. Social exclusion also increased perception of the benefactor’s interpersonal warmth among less entitled participants. Perception of the benefactor’s warmth mediated the increase in gratitude among low entitlement participants in both studies. Additionally, socially excluded low entitlement participants were perceived as being more grateful in hand written thank-you notes compared to nonexcluded participants (Study 2). These findings suggest that, upon feeling socially excluded, people low in entitlement had a heightened motivation for social affiliation that led them to overperceive warm intentions in the benefactor. The overperception of warmth is what caused gratitude to increase among socially excluded low entitlement people. Social acceptance increased gratitude compared to control conditions and was not moderated by psychological entitlement. Unexpectedly, social acceptance also increased the perceived value of the benefit. The heightened perception of gift value was found to mediate the increase in gratitude in both studies.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>We investigate various fundamental aspects of the metal insulator transition (MIT) by employing several theoretical approaches. Describing the novel features of interacting electronic systems remains one of the principle challenges to theoretical condensed matter physics. Therefore, any effort to provide a deep insight into understanding the nature of MITs opens a new avenue for development of modern technology.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para/>
            <DISS_para>First, we present a complete analytical and numerical solution</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>of the Typical Medium Theory (TMT) for the metal-insulator transition.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this theory, we self-consistently calculate the typical amplitude</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>of the electron wave-functions, representing the conceptually simplest</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>order-parameter for the Anderson transition. We classify all possible</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>universality classes for the critical behavior, that can be found</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>within such a mean-field approach. This provides insights into how</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>interaction-induced renormalizations of the disorder potential may</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>produce qualitative modifications of critical behavior. We also formulate</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>a simple description of the leading critical behavior of varies quantities,</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>and then obtain an effective Landau theory for Anderson localization. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We also develop an efficient numerical algorithm, ``Cluster Typical Medium Theory'' (CTMT) to capture both non-local effects and localization in disordered electronic systems. Our formalism utilizes </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>the momentum-resolved typical density of states to characterize </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>the localization transition. We apply this approach to the Anderson model of localization in one and two-dimensions. In one dimension, we find that the critical disorder strength scales inversely with the linear cluster size with a power-law, $W_{c} \sim (1/L_{c})^{1/\nu}$; whereas in two dimensions, the critical disorder strength decreases logarithmically with the linear cluster size. Our results are in agreement with the one-parameter scaling theory. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Furthermore, we show how spatial correlations can also be captured analytically within such a self-consistent theory, by utilizing the standard Landau method of allowing for (slow) spatial fluctuations of the order parameter, and performing an appropriate gradient expansion. Our theoretical</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>results provide insight into recent STM experiments, which were used</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>to visualize the spatially fluctuating electronic wave functions near</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>the metal insulator transition in $Ga_{1-x}Mn_{x}As.$ We show that,</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>within our theory, all features of the experiment can be accounted</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>for by considering a model of disorder renormalized by long-range</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Coulomb interactions. This includes the pseudogap formation, the $C(R)\sim\frac{1}{R}$ form of the LDOS autocorrelations function, and the $\zeta\sim\frac{1}{E}$ energy dependence of the correlation length at criticality. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the second part of my Thesis, we show that introducing long-range Coulomb interactions immediately lifts the massive ground state degeneracy induced by geometric frustration for electrons on quarter-filled triangular lattices in the classical limit. Important consequences include the stabilization of a stripe-ordered crystalline (global) ground state, but also the emergence of very many low-lying metastable states with amorphous ``stripe-glass" spatial</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>structures. Melting of the stripe order thus leads to </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>a frustrated Coulomb liquid at intermediate temperatures, showing</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>remarkably slow (viscous) dynamics, with very long relaxation times growing in Arrhenius fashion upon cooling, as typical of strong glass formers. On</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>shorter time scales, the system falls out of equilibrium and displays the</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>aging phenomena characteristic of supercooled liquids above the glass</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>transition. Our results show remarkable similarity with the recent observations of charge-glass behavior in ultra-clean triangular organic materials of the  $\theta$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$ </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>ABSTRACT</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Sponsorship of sport properties accounts for approximately two-thirds of all sponsorship expenditures (“IEG Sponsorship Report,” 2014). The global sponsorship sector increased from $48 billion dollars to $51 billion from 2011 to 2012 (“IEG Sponsorship Report,” 2014). Organizations have increasingly shifted to sponsorship as a marketing communications vehicle in the hopes that the goodwill that consumers feel toward the cause will transfer to their image (Madrigal, 2001). With the same token, many researchers suggest there is a link between social initiatives and an organization’s improved financial performance (e.g., Davis, 1960; Arlow &amp; Gannon. 1982; Ullmann, 1985; McGuire et al., 1988; Waddock &amp; Graves, 1997; Margolis et al., 2003). The main purpose of the proposed research is to better understand stakeholder perceptions of sponsors, specifically perceptions about the sponsors’ CSR activities, and the potential impact of such perceptions on sponsors’ image.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The current study was quantitative in nature; using a quasi-experimental pre- and post –test control group design. The questionnaire was completed by FSU Sport Management students in three different sessions. The instruments for study were paper based questionnaires, which participants filled out between viewing two short video clips. Three different groups were participate in the study at three different times; each group  received a different scenario pertaining to the sponsor’s information and CSR activities; this study consisted of two experimental groups and one control group. All the groups followed the same procedure except the manipulation of the independent variable. Those in Group 2 read about the company’s sponsorship activity, and those in Group 1 read information about the sponsorship activity and the company’s CSR activity, and those in Group 3 read about the company’s information. The measures in this study were adapted from existing literatures. The participants were 98 students. A descriptive analysis was conducted to assess the frequency of age (based on date of birth), gender, race and year in school. I analyzed the data to assess evidence of reliability pertaining to the constructs of interest: attitude toward the sponsor, sponsor’s image, and attitude toward the sport property. Univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test, and the result revealed that there were no significant differences between groups at the pre-test stage for all the dependent variables. While in the post-test there was a significant difference between groups were found regarding on attitude toward the sponsor and sponsor’s image where p &lt; .05. Regarding attitude toward the sport property there was no significance difference both at the pre-test and post-test stages. Overall, group 1 (CSR &amp; sponsorship) had a higher mean score of all dependent variables than group 2 (sponsorship) and group 3 (company information). Group 2 (sponsorship) had a higher mean score of all dependent variables than group 3 (company information).</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>There has been a great deal of research devoted to computer vision related assistive technologies.  Unfortunately, this area of research has not produced many usable solutions. The long cane and the guard dog are still far more useful than most of these devices.  Through the push for advanced mobile and gaming systems, new low-cost solutions have become available for building innovative and creative assistive technologies.  These technologies have been used for sensory substitution projects that attempt to convert vision into either auditory or tactile stimuli.  These projects have reported some degree of measurable success.  Most of these projects focused on converting either image brightness or depth into auditory signals.  This research was devoted to the design and creation of a video game simulator that was capable of performing research and training for these sensory substitution concepts that converts vision into auditory stimuli.  The simulator was used to perform direct comparisons between some of the popular sensory substitution techniques as well as exploring new concepts for conversion.   This research of 42 participants tested different techniques for image simplification and discovered that using depth-to-tone sensory substitution may be more usable than brightness-to-tone simulation.   The study has shown that using 3D game simulators can be used in lieu of building costly prototypes for testing new sensory substitution concepts.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>To improve the design of prostheses surfaces, our research group investigates how biocompatible polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMUs) can be constructed to serve as coatings for biomedical implants, providing a versatile, inexpensive, and potentially efficient solution to create anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, and biologically selective surfaces. More specifically, this dissertation research investigates how individual cells and cell sheets adhere and migrate on PEMUs constructed to have uniform and gradients of modulus and how individual cells and gram negative bacteria, Escherichia coli, adhere to PEMUs constructed to have an anti-adhesive surface chemistry. In this investigation, PAH/PAA PEMUs are shown to be biocompatible compared to the soluble polycation PAH at concentrations above 0.1mM. Soluble PAH concentrations at 1 and 10mM cause irreversible damage to the plasma membrane of smooth muscle, A7r5, and bone, U2OS, cells.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Additionally, adhesive and motile responses of cells are dependent on PEMU surface chemistry. Cells on PEMUs terminated with the polycation PAH relocalize their focal adhesions to their cell periphery and are highly motile compared to cells cultured on PAA terminated PEMUs and uncoated glass coverslips. To investigate effects of PEMU modulus on cell adhesion and motility, PEMUs were made with the polyanion PAA (poly(acrylic acid)) modified with a photosensitive 4-(2-Hydroxyethoxy) benzophenone (PAABp) and the polycation PAH (poly(allylamine hydrochloride)). UV irradiating PAH/ PAABp PEMUs forms covalent bonds between PE layers and consequently increases its Young’s Elastic Modulus, while retaining innate surface chemistry. Individual cells and cell sheets detect differences in PEMU modulus and respond by varying morphology and behavior. These PAH/PAABp PEMUs modulate the adhesion, spreading, and migration of individual cells, specifically smooth muscle , bone, and fibroblast cells. PAABp containing PEMUs were constructed to have either a shallow (~5MPa mm-1) or a steep (~50MPa mm-1) modulus gradient. Only smooth muscle cells durotax along steep modulus gradients toward increasing modulus and orient toward increasing modulus on shallow modulus gradients. In contrast, bone cells discriminately adhere to the stiffest region of both steep and shallow modulus gradients and fibroblasts show no difference in behavior along any region of the gradients. Epithelial sheets, isolated as primary explants of fish epithelial tissue from the scales of fish Poecilia sphenops (Black Molly) and Carassius auratus (Comet Goldfish), orient toward increasing modulus on steep modulus gradient.

            <DISS_para>Surfaces with substantial zwitterionic functionality (possessing a net neutral surface charge due to equal contribution of both positive and negative charges in polymer side groups) have been shown to effectively prevent cell and protein attachment. PEMUs built with PAH (poly(allylamine hydrochloride)) and PAA (poly(acrylic acid)) containing the AEDAPS zwitterionic group 3-(2-(acrylamido)-ethyldimethyl ammonio) propane sulfonate (PAH/PAA-co-AEDAPS PEMUs) and a new benzophenone crosslinker to stiffen the thin film were shown to prevent rat aortic smooth muscle (A7r5) and mouse fibroblast (3T3) cells attachment, but failed to prevent irreversible attachment of biofilm-forming gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, strain ATCC-8739. AEDAPS containing PEMUs are hydrophilic and have increased nanoroughness of ~10nm. ‘Super soaking’ AEDAPS PEMUs incorporates more zwitterions into the PEMU and significantly maximizes the surface presentation of PAA-co-AEDAPS, which promotes early attachment of bacteria, but eventually, causes a gradual decrease in bacteria attachment with increasing incubation time. This investigation provides further insight into the possible application of PEMUs as bioselective thin film coatings, which may have potential for use in biomedical applications.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The study explored the development of a valid assessment tool for job negotiation competencies using the Evidence Centered Design framework. It involved the creation of a competency model, evidence models, and task models that guided the development of a branching simulation tool to quickly diagnose college students’ knowledge and skills in job negotiation. The online tool utilized three scenarios where students play the role of job seekers negotiating with their potential future employers. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study focused on two key behaviors in negotiation – making counteroffers and making reasonable concessions. A preliminary competency model was first developed based on a literature review of negotiation research. This model was then validated by a panel of experts. The experts also validated the evidence model (how to score performance on the simulation) and the task model (what tasks should be performed to elicit evidence of performance). These activities and the experts’ feedback for improving the prototype simulation provided content validity for the tool.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A total of 86 undergraduate and 51 graduate students participated in the study. The students completed an online tutorial, the scenarios in the simulation, a demographics survey, and two other survey instruments that provided alternative measures of negotiation abilities. Their performance on the assessment simulation was determined by their overall competency score and value of the negotiated outcome. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Students were classified as experts or novices based on their negotiation experience and knowledge of negotiation strategies. Results from the study indicated that experts performed better than novices in terms of overall competency and negotiated outcome.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The study also compared the outcomes of the assessment tool with outcomes from the alternative measures of negotiation ability (a survey on preference for competing, collaborating, compromising, and accommodating negotiation strategies and a survey to determine self-confidence in using distributive and integrative negotiation tactics). I hypothesized that students with a high preference for competing and collaborating strategies would also have higher scores from the assessment tool. On the other hand, students who indicated a high preference for accommodating and compromising strategies would have lower scores.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The results from the Preferred Negotiation Strategies survey supported my hypothesis that students who highly prefer accommodating and compromising strategies would have lower scores on overall competency and negotiated outcome. But the mixed findings for competing and collaborating preferences only partially supported my hypotheses.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>I also hypothesized that students who were highly confident in the use of distributive and integrative negotiation tactics would have higher scores on the assessment compared to those who have low self-confidence. The results did not support my hypotheses because there were no significant relationships between confidence and the assessment outcomes.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Finally, the study also found that gender, expertise, and negotiation training have an effect on overall competency score and the negotiated outcome.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation provided a case study on how to develop an assessment tool that diagnoses negotiation competencies using the ECD framework. It also provided evidence of validity for the tool by demonstrating its ability to distinguish different levels of performance by expert and novice negotiators.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>It is well established that estrogens suppress feeding primarily by reducing meal size, and that this is partly mediated by enhancement of the response to satiation signals. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) acts on receptor populations both peripherally and centrally to affect food intake. Most research on the feeding effects of GLP-1 has used exclusively male subjects, and little is known about the effects of GLP-1 in females. We hypothesized that modulation of the central GLP-1 system is one of the mechanisms underlying the effects of estrogens on ingestive behavior. More specifically, we hypothesized that estradiol, a common estrogen, enhances the anorexic response to central GLP-1. To investigate this possibility, bilaterally ovariectomized female rats were placed on a cyclic regimen of either 2 μg β-estradiol-3-benzoate or oil vehicle and implanted with unilateral cannulas targeting the lateral ventricle. We assessed the food intake effects of 0, 1, or 10 μg doses of GLP-1 in oil- or EB-treated rats administered 30 min prior to dark onset on the day following hormone treatment. GLP-1 treatment significantly suppressed food intake in EB-treated rats at both doses compared to vehicle, whereas only the 10 μg dose was effective in oil-treated rats. We then examined whether estrogen status alters the neuronal response to GLP-1 by measuring GLP-1-induced c-Fos expression in several feeding-relevant brain areas. While GLP-1 significantly increased c-Fos expression, there were no significant differences between hormone treatment groups in the brain areas examined. These experiments suggest that modulation of the central GLP-1 system may be one of the mechanisms by which estrogens suppress food intake and support the need for further examination of this effect.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this treatise is to present a survey of the solo guitar works written for Julian Bream and to illuminate their historical significance and lasting importance to the guitar repertoire. For each piece, this treatise provides a brief biographical sketch of each composer, a survey of the relevant literature and, where necessary, a brief theoretical analysis. At the end of each section, a “Performer’s Note” has been included, which details the specific difficulties of performing each piece. Hopefully, this treatise will provide guitarists interested in the pieces written for Julian Bream a reference for performance and study.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>There has been a growing interest in electrochemical storage devices such as batteries, fuel cells and supercapacitors in recent years. This interest is due to our increasing dependence on portable electronic devices and on the high demand for energy storage from the electric transport vehicles and electrical power grid industries. As we transition towards cleaner renewable fuel sources such as solar, wind, tidal, etc. our dependence on energy storage devices will continue to grow. Li- air offers much higher energy density than all other batteries based on electrochemical storage. However, these batteries currently suffer from a number of issues such as a low cyclability and a reduced practical energy density compared to the theoretical energy density. The deposition of lithium peroxide on the surface of the cathode is one of the main causes for the low practical specific capacity of lithium-air batteries with organic electrolyte.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) has been used in the past to extract physical parameters such as chemical diffusion coefficient, effective diffusion coefficient, Faradaic reaction rate, degradation and stability of an electrochemical device. In this dissertation, a physics based analytical model is developed to study the EIS of Li-air batteries, in which the mass transport inside the cathode is limited by oxygen diffusion, during charge and discharge. The model takes into consideration the effects of double layer, Faradaic processes, and oxygen diffusion in the cathode, but neglects the effects of anode, separator, conductivity of the deposit layer, and Li-ion transport. The analytical model predicts that the effects of Faradaic impedance can be hidden by the double layer capacitance. Therefore, the dissertation focuses separately on two cases: 1) then case when the Faradaic process and the double layer capacitance are separate and can be observed as two different semicircles on the Nyquist plot and 2) the case when the Faradaic process is shadowed by the double layer capacitance and shows up as only one large semicircle on the Nyquist plot.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A simple expression is developed to extract physical parameters such as the values of the diffusion coefficient of oxygen and Faradaic reaction rate from experimental impedance spectrum for each of the two cases. The diffusion coefficient can be determined by using the resistances (real impedance intercept on the Nyquist plot) of both the semicircles for the first case and by using the combined resistance for the second case. Once, the effective oxygen diffusion coefficient is estimated, it can be used to estimate the value of the reaction constant. This method of extracting the values of the diffusion coefficient and reaction constant can serve as a tool in identifying an effective electrolyte or cathode material. It can also serve as a noninvasive technique to identify and also quantify the use of the catalyst to improve the reaction kinetics in an electrochemical system.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Finally, finite element simulations are used to validate the analytical models and to study the effects of discharge products on the impedance spectra of Li-air batteries with organic electrolyte. The finite element simulations are based on the theory of concentrated solutions and the complex impedance spectra are computed by linearizing the partial differential equations that describe the mass and charge transport in Li-air batteries. These equations include the oxygen diffusion equation, the Li drift-diffusion equation, and the electron conduction equation. The reaction at the anode and cathode are described by Butler-Volmer kinetics. The total impedance of a Li-air battery increases by more than 200% when the response is measured near the end of the discharge cycle as compared to on a fresh battery. The resistivity of the deposition layer significantly affects the deposition profile and the total impedance. Using electrolytes with high oxygen solubility and concentrated O2 gas at high pressures will reduce the total impedance of Li-air batteries.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Specific mutations in the replacement histone variant H3.3 are known to drive cancers such as glioblastomas, chondroblastomas and large cell tumors of the bone primarily in children and young adults. Several recent studies have suggested that transcriptional defects associated with H3.3 mutations are likely to be involved in tumor formation. However, transcription independent roles of H3.3 and their potential contribution to cancer have not been investigated. Here we report that histone H3.3 (but not the related replication dependent H3.1 or H3.2 variants) is recruited within ~60 seconds to sites of laser induced DNA damage. This recruitment is dependent on acetylation at the N terminus of the protein. A stable depletion of this protein in human cells leads to high levels of endogenous DNA damage and an impaired ability to repair this damage, leading to genomic instability and sensitivity to DNA damaging agents. Flies with reduced levels of H3.3 are also sensitive to damaging agents and accumulate spontaneous damage. H3.3 depletion alters the recruitment of double strand break (DSB) repair factors, with defects in the recruitment of proteins involved in homologous recombination (HR) repair and faster recruitment of some proteins involved in non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). We also find that the cancer associated mutants are defective in localizing to damage sites and their expression leads to an accumulation of high levels of endogenous damage. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Overall, our data from evolutionarily distant species suggest that histone H3.3 plays a crucial role in HR-mediated DNA repair which is conserved across eukaryotes. Hence, based on the strong links between defective DNA repair and cancer, we propose that the DNA repair defects associated with H3.3 mutations are likely to contribute to genomic instability, and thereby to carcinogenesis, independent of the known transcriptional roles of histone H3.3. Based on these findings, we propose a potential therapeutic strategy that combines the use of inhibitors along with a DSB inducing agent to selectively target cells that are defective in HR repair due to H3.3 depletion or mutation. Our promising preliminary data show that this is effective in H3.3 knockdown cells and may also be useful in killing H3.3 cancer mutants. This knowledge helps us to understand the complex details of these deadly mutations and hopefully brings us closer to a treatment.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Recent research supports the multidimensionality of Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), but the structure of ODD symptoms has been inconsistent across studies.  Despite differences, each model has an affective dimension, usually shown to be related to internalizing problems, and at least one behavioral dimension, usually shown to be related to externalizing problems.  While previous work has examined the etiology of overall ODD, little is known about the etiology of ODD dimensions, or the etiologic relationships between ODD dimensions and later psychopathology.  Using archival, longitudinal data from 1255 twin pairs, the current study provides a stringent comparison between competing models of ODD symptom dimensions at age 11, and explores the relationship between the best fitting model and psychopathology assessed via diagnostic interviews at ages 17, 20, and 24.  Next, a genetically informative design was used to determine if dimensions of ODD have common and/or unique genetic and environmental influences.  Finally, significant relationships found between ODD dimensions and later psychopathology were followed-up with etiological models.  Results showed a two-factor model (irritable, headstrong/hurtful) proposed by Rowe, Costello, Angold, Copeland, and Maughan (2010) and a three-factor model (irritable, headstrong, hurtful) proposed by Stringaris and Goodman (2009a) provided the best fit to the data.  However, the hurtful dimension of the three-factor model was not uniquely related to any later psychopathology, and thus did not outperform the more parsimonious two-factor model.  Consistent with hypotheses, the headstrong/hurtful dimension of the two-factor model was correlated with externalizing problems including substance use disorder symptoms and adult antisocial behavior.  The current study did not find the expected relationships between the irritable dimension and later internalizing disorders.  Twin modeling showed the irritable and headstrong/hurtful dimensions had shared and unique genetic influences.  The headstrong/hurtful dimension also had unique shared environmental influences.  Further, the headstrong/hurtful dimension was related to adult disorders through shared genetic influences.  Overall, it can be concluded that symptoms of ODD, especially the headstrong/hurtful dimension, pose a significant risk for adult mental health outcomes, and common genetic influences underlie the covariance between headstrong/hurtful symptoms and later psychopathology.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Controlling particularly reactive substances to achieve desired outcomes is a constant challenge in materials chemistry. Reactants and products consisting of main group and transition metal elements often exhibit extreme sensitivity to their environments. Therefore, it is desirable to develop new methods of synthesis and handling of the starting materials and resulting products in order to extend the chemical space available within this domain of science.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Reactivity must be defined within the context of this dissertation. Herein, ‘reactive’ is exceptional sensitivity to air and moisture leading to degredation of reactants or desired products. Reactivity may also correspond to the explosive or pyrophoric nature of reactants and products inevitably preventing their isolation and handling under ambient conditions.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Several observations which are pertinent to the fundamental understanding of the reactivity of various metalorganic, orgnaometallic, and main group complexes are chronicled within this dissertation. A comparison is provided for two methods (batch and flow) that are typically used to perform and control reactions. Due to the prevalence flow chemistry within my work, emphasis will be placed upon flow-based methods. In chapter 1, a short primer on fluid dynamics relevant to materials chemistry will be provided to compare and contrast batch versus flow chemistry. Examples of flow chemistry applied to organic reactions are given, followed by examples of inorganic chemistry in flow which is much less developed. Finally, the overarching goals of this work are as follows: 1) Present the basics of fluid dynamics to provide a basis for the flow chemical approaches within this work. 2) Provide a discussion of current flow-based methods applied to organic and inorganic synthesis. 3) To detail and study the application of flow chemistry techniques to the synthesis of new and existing metal organic, organometallic, and main group compounds and materials. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In chapter 2, a simplified droplet generator is introduced and utilized to yield hollow silica capsules from a liquid–liquid interfacial polymerization reaction. Further use of this simple droplet generator is examined for preparation of SiO2-TiO2 hybrid capsules along with a cartridge-based method to modify the capsule surface with additional TiO2. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In chapter 3, our growing interest in reactive materals led to the discovery that alkali metal oxides can be trapped and crystallized using diethlyzinc. From this observation, a family of complexes were isolated and characterized. Chapter 3 will also incoporate flow-based synthesis of organozinc complexes. First, the continuous preparation of organozinc halides is established and then coupled directly to Negishi reactions for the production of desirable building blocks for active pharmaceutical ingredients. Second, a catridge-based method for the utilzation of pyrophoric solid reagent Na2(HZnEt2)2 is presented leading to a series of novel organozincates.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In chapter 4, the traditional methods used to synthesize alkali metal polyphosphides are discussed. Our discovery of solution-phase methods which allow facile access to homoatomic polyanions of phosphorus which do not involve harsh reducing alkali metals or the white allotrope of the element is detailed. We then demonstrate a high-throughput continuous-flow approach for rapid generation of gram quantities of these soluble polyphosphide anions.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This treatise examines the importance of the Manual de Vioara, written by Romanian violinists and professors Ionel Geanta and George Manoliu, and its influence for the Romanian violins school during Communist rule. A particular challenge during this time was the political situation of Romania which greatly affected the music scene, inspiring the authors to develop a violin method accessible for beginner violinists. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This paper provides a historical background of Romania’s situation under the Communist rule, and why the development of such method was necessary and benefited the school of violin. While little information has been written regarding the authors, the development of the Romanian violin school, and the impact of the Manual de Vioara, this survey is meant to be used as a guideline for understanding the method’s structure, and its potential. Intended to prepare the beginner student for the intermediate level in his development as a violinist, the four volumes of the Manual de Vioara cover a large variety of violin techniques as well as music history, all presented in detailed, structured lesson plans. Ultimately, this analysis highlights the impact of this method which shaped many generations of violinists in Romania.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Oligocene-Miocene collision between Panama and South America significantly influenced ocean currents, global climate, and species diversification. Intraplate deformation of the Panama Block also played an important role in the evolution of this tectonic system, but is not well understood. A high-resolution gravity survey, coupled with geologic observations, was conducted in north-central Panama to better constrain the processes responsible for the Isthmus’ modern configuration.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Approximately 110 gravity stations were collected from Colón to Nombre de Dios, Panama and merged with existing data. Subsequently, four 2.5-D gravity models were produced to constrain the geometry of the Gatun-Chagres Basin using different sedimentary densities (1.8, 2.0, and 2.2 g/cm3) to produce a realistic range of basin thicknesses. Overall, models with an average basin density of 2.0 g/cm3 are most consistent with offshore seismic profiles and field evidence, suggesting basin thickness is ~3.0-3.5 km. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Previous seismic reflection data and geochemical analyses of Miocene arc volcanic rocks delineate a zone of extension in the Panama Canal Region, and gravity analysis from this study supports this hypothesis. Field evidence of multiple NW-facing normal faults suggests that they separate the basin from uplifted arc basement rocks east of the Canal, resulting in a 60 mGal gravity gradient. Beneath the basin, gravity models indicate ~5-10 km of crustal thinning. 3-D reconstruction of the 2.5-D models show a northward thickening basin and two depocenters that correspond to the Rio Indio and Toro facies of the Chagres Formation. This analysis suggests two directional extension of the Gatun-Chagres Basin; an east-west direction corresponding to the initial formation of the basin, and a modern northwest-southeast direction.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To the northeast, gravity modeling indicates that there is a ~150 m-thick, Cretaceous-Holocene sedimentary basin present from Portobelo to Nombre de Dios. Sedimentary units in the western part of this basin exhibit large-scale open folds, which may indicate a transition from extensional to compressional tectonics east of the Panama Orocline Apex.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The ongoing collision between South America and the Panama Block also fractured the crust creating zones of extension in central Panama. Overall, gravity modeling suggests that low-density sedimentary rocks extend across the Isthmus and south of the Gatun-Chagres Basin. Such results are consistent with the idea that the Panama Canal Region formed a young marine connection between the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>As If We Were Already Free is a novel narrated in the first person by Mackenna Doyle, a 26-year old man in prison for murdering a high school classmate when he was sixteen, a crime of which he admits culpability at the outset of the novel. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>One of the inciting incidents that prompts Mackenna to begin telling this story is the disappearance of his best friend and love interest Eliza, who, until three months before the novel begins, has maintained consistent correspondence with him for ten years. Mackenna spends part of the first chapter, which functions as an extended prologue, trying to figure out why she has disappeared from his life so abruptly and without warning. Mackenna is an apotheosis of the “intellectual solitude” common to a minority of people who end up serving long sentences in the General Population of state penitentiaries. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>There are two timelines and two stories the narrator is telling concurrently: One is the present-day prison timeline, which sets the acute tension of the novel, and the other is the story of his life as a teenager in New York City in the nineties with his two best friends, misfit kids from Staten Island—the soft-spoken, perspicacious albino Colin, and the unfailingly altruistic Eliza. The novel encompasses both gritty realism and satire, interwoven with themes of poverty, injustice, and exiles.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>\begin{abstract}</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In numerous applications involving high dimensional data, certain \textit{subspace} techniques such as principal components analysis (PCA) may be utilized in feature extraction. Often, PCA can reduce the dimensionality while retaining most of the significant information of the original data. This can be beneficial not only for representation of the data more compactly (compression), but also for transforming the data into a more useful form for applications involving feature extraction and classification. Relatively recent developments with PCA extend conventional principal components analysis to newer variants of PCA which appear particularly useful in computer vision and image applications: (1) two dimensional PCA (``2D PCA"), and (2) bidirectional or bilateral two dimensional PCA (``B2DPCA", ``Bi2DPCA", or ``$(2D)^{2}$ PCA"). The latter category includes an iterative version which is an example of \textit{coupled subspace analysis} or ``CSA"; the non-iterative version is known as \textit{projective} Bi2DPCA. In this thesis, these PCA variants are considered as special cases of the more general CSA. Theoretical advantages of 2D PCA and bidirectional PCA over conventional PCA should arise from the fact that significant information about the spatial relationship between image pixels may be discarded in conventional PCA as the image is represented by a large column vector, whereas 2D PCA and bidirectional PCA techniques can preserve more of this information by representing the image as a matrix rather than a long vector.  The problems of small sample size, and curse of dimensionality are also alleviated to some extent, particularly in the cases of B2DPCA and iterated CSA.  Some of these PCA variants have been proposed in various image recognition applications recently, including biometric identification using iris texture, face images, and palm prints, and categorization of wood species based on wood grain texture to name a few examples. So, while much focus has been placed on feature extraction methods such as use of Gabor wavelets or similar techniques for some applications such as iris recognition, some subspace techniques, including some of these PCA variants, have shown promise in conjunction with image preprocessing techniques for removal of uneven background illumination and contrast enhancement.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this thesis, the image application of biometric iris recognition is chosen as the means of evaluating potential advantages of these newer PCA variants, including CSA, in the context of feature extraction and classification. The rich texture information of these images, and the utilization of effective image registration techniques, yields images which are well suited for this purpose.  As the primary focus of this thesis, these PCA variants are evalulated using closed set identification test mode, and are compared using Euclidean distance single nearest neighbor classifier; images are preprocessed using top-hat filtering and contrast limiting adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE). Use of multiple test (probe) images is considered, and the impact on performance is considered also for training image sets with 2, 3, and 4 sample images per class. Concurrently, the application of iris image recognition is addressed in detail. Other applications for which these PCA variants and preprocessing techniques may be beneficial are discussed in the concluding section.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are known to exhibit outstanding mechanical, electrical, thermal, and coupled electromechanical properties. CNTs can be employed towards the design of an innovative strain sensor with enhanced multifunctionality due to their load carrying capability, sensing properties, high thermal stability, and outstanding electrical conductivity. All these features indicate the prospect to use CNTs in a very wide range of applications, for instance, highly sensitive resistance-type strain/force sensors, wearable electronics, flexible microelectronic devices, robotic skins, and in-situ structural health monitoring. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>CNT-based strain sensors can be divided into two different types, the individual CNT- based strain sensors and the ensemble CNT-based strain sensors e.g. CNT/polymer nanocomposites and CNT thin films. In contrast, to individual CNT-based strain sensors with very high gauge factor (GF) e.g. ~3000, the ensemble CNT-based strain sensors exhibit very low GFs e.g. for a SWCNT thin film strain sensor, GF is ~1. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This research discusses the mechanisms and the optimizing principles of a SWCNT thin film piezoresistive sensor, and provide an experimental validation of the numerical/analytical investigations.  The dependence of the piezoresistivity on key parameters like alignment, network density, bundle diameter (effective tunneling area), and SWCNT length is studied. The tunneling effect is significant in SWCNT thin films showing higher degrees of alignment, due to greater inter-tube distances between the SWCNTs as compared to random oriented SWCNT thin films. It can be concluded that SWCNT thin films featuring higher alignment would have a higher GF. On the other hand, the use of sparse network density which comprises of aligned SWCNTs can as well intensify the tunneling effect which can result to a further increase in the GF. In addition, it is well-known that percolation is greatly influenced by the geometry of the nanotubes e.g. bundle diameter and length. A study on the influence of bundle diameter of SWCNTs on the piezoresistivity behavior of mechanically drawn SWCNT thin films showed the best performance with an improved GF of ~10 when compared to the randomly oriented SWCNT thin films with GF of ~1. The non-linear piezoresistivity of the mechanically drawn SWCNT thin films is considered to be the main mechanism behind the high strain sensitivity.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Furthermore, information about the average length and length distribution is very essential when examining the influence of individual nanotube length on the strain sensitivity. With that in mind, we use our previously developed preparative ultracentrifuge method (PUM), and our newly developed gel electrophoresis and simultaneous Raman and photolumiscence spectroscopy (GEP-SRSPL) to characterize the average length and length distribution of SWCNTs respectively.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Lithium ion battery discovered since the 1980s has become pivotal to our energy needs. With the need for a shift to renewable energy and increased use of portable devices, energy storage has become a very important aspect of modern day life and technology.  In the thesis, optimization techniques for solid state calcination of lithium olivine batteries are characterized and analyzed.  A brief introduction into lithium ion battery is discussed, the chemistry and physics of the materials is studied in details. Emphasis is placed on the olivine structure, industrially utilized synthesis method and the performance of olivine lithium ion batteries are also discussed in details.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Olivine structure LiFePO4 (LFP) was synthesized via solid state processes, using Li2CO3, NH4H2PO4 and FeC2O4·H2O and C12H22O11 as precursor materials. The effects of calendaring in terms of charge/discharge capacity, cycle life performance, surface morphology, and ac impedance was analyzed. The resulting LFP electrode was divided in part, Part A was left as is and Part B was calendared. The calendared electrode exhibited lower impedance under electrochemical impedance test. The calendared electrode also exhibited a higher discharge  capacity of about 130 mAh/g at 0.1C compared to the as-is electrode with discharge capacity of about 120mAh/g.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Olivine structure LiMnPO4 (LMP) was also synthesized via solid state processes, using Li2CO3, NH4H2PO4, MnCO3 and C12H22O11 as precursor materials. Comparison of the carbon addition process was done by adding sucrose to the initial precursor mix and carbon black at the later stages of fabrication. The 3 step carbon addition exhibited the highest specific capacity of about 72mAh/g, 1 step carbon addition possessed the least capacity of about 45mAh/g, while the 2 step process had a capacity of about 65mA/g.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>A significant responsibility of officials involved in transportation planning is ensuring people’s accessibility to critical facilities such as multi-modal terminals and emergency shelters. This challenging task depends on the available transportation infrastructure as well as the overall population, traffic, roadway and regional characteristics. Such planning takes on additional complexity when aging populations are considered because any extra time they incur reaching these facilities can be especially confounding in light of their potential health and other safety concerns. As such, there is a need for state/federal transportation plans to have a transportation assessment component that specifically focuses on the accessibility of aging people (‘the aging population’ can be thought of as those people aged 65+ in this study) to critical facilities. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To accomplish this goal, this study first describes a Geographical Information Systems (GIS)-based methodology for measuring the aging population-focused accessibility to multi-modal facilities in Florida. Spatially detailed population block- and county-based accessibility scores are calculated with respect to key intermodal facility types (airports, bus stations, and railway and ferry stations), and visually assessed via GIS maps. Second, a spatial optimization model is presented which focuses on maximizing the accessibility of aging populations to the emergency shelters. For this purpose, a p-median optimization model is proposed in order to minimize the transportation cost (travel time or roadway network distance costs between the origins –centroids of population blocks- and destinations –emergency shelters) in the transportation network, and therefore providing maximum accessibility for aging adults to the emergency shelters. In this context, different transportation costs are used: (a) roadway network distance, (b) free flow travel time, and (c) congested travel time. This model is also extended towards a capacitated p-median model with hubs, which makes it possible to conduct an extensive evaluation of possible intermediate hub locations that can have a significant effect on the accessibility of those shelters. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The knowledge obtained from this accessibility analysis can successfully contribute to the development of more reliable aging population-focused transportation plans, as the analysis points to specific areas where accessibility could be improved as well as those candidate locations that can be serve as additional emergency shelters and intermediate hubs.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Panamanian Isthmus presents an ideal opportunity to study arc magmatism, arc-hotspot interaction, and the effects of the South America-Panama collision. These effects include changing mantle wedge compositions and localized tectonic activities in western Panama. The Bocas del Toro sedimentary basin contains interbedded Miocene volcanic lava flows that range in age from 12 Ma to 8 Ma and sit behind the main body of the arc.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The volcanic rocks of Bocas del Toro consist of trachy-basalt to trachy-andesite with SiO2 content ranging from 45 wt. % to 64 wt. %. The MgO content is relatively low ranging from 0.35 wt. % to 3.43 wt. %, and with moderate depletion in FeOt (3.9 wt. %-8.0 wt. %) and CaO (2.8 wt. %-10 wt. %). However, K2O content is extremely high (2.0 wt. %-5.2 wt. %), and these rocks are among the most alkaline in Panama. In terms of trace element geochemistry, the Bocas del Toro rocks exhibit a distinct, but decreased slab dehydration signature with a low Nb-Ta anomaly, enriched fluid-mobile LILEs and low Ti content. We have grouped Miocene and younger western Panama and eastern Costa Rica volcanic rocks into five groups: main arc tholeiite (~17-11 Ma) and calc-alkaline (~12-8 Ma), Bocas del Toro (~12-8 Ma), backarc alkaline (~8-2 Ma), and adakite (&lt; 2 Ma) groups. In terms of trace element ratios, the Bocas del Toro rocks have relative low Ba/La, and have values that are higher, but approach the Cocos Ridge, that tracks of the Galapagos hot spot. The La/Yb and Th/Yb vs. Ta/Yb also show values that plot between the tholeiite and general calc-alkaline groups. Overall, trace element geochemistry indicates that an enriched OIB-like component mixed into the melts of the mantle wedge.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>With constraints from referenced Pb-Nd-Sr isotopes and the pattern of trace element geochemistry, the data range of the Bocas del Toro samples should be distributed close to the general calc-alkaline and backarc alkaline groups. According to the trace element geochemistry and isotope modeling, the percentage of enriched (OIB / Cocos track) geochemical component mixed into the melts of the mantle wedge, was quantified at 1-3%. Moreover, the pattern indicates that, as arc evolution continued, a progressively greater enriched geochemical components mixed into the wedge melts.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Geochemical modeling allows estimates of the pressure, temperature etc., conditions under which magma formed. The MELTS software was used for major element modeling and show that the Bocas del Toro rocks underwent low-pressure (0.5-1.0 kbars) fractional crystallization, from 1200 ° C to 900° C with 50%-55% fractionation from a starting magma with ~11 wt. % MgO. In addition, trace element models and the ARC BASALT SIMULATOR 3.0 were used to simulate partial melting in the mantle wedge. These models indicate a component of enriched OIB-like mantle. The simulator also shows that the mantle wedge underwent 3.5%-6.0% of melting fraction under dry conditions at pressures of 1.8 Gpa to 1.9 Gpa (~60km) with temperatures of 1150-1350°C. In conclusion, we suggest that the geochemical variations of Bocas del Toro were caused by an influx of an OIB-like component into the mantle wedge by 12 Ma, and that possible effects from crustal extension reduced the overall subduction signature.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Contained in this dissertation is an analysis of the fundamental chemistry of the f-block elements with oxygen donor ligands in ionic liquids. This work focuses heavily on the structures of the crystalline phases that form when lanthanides and actinides react with either phosphonates or borates in an ionothermal flux. It will be demonstrated in this work that this flux method is a valuable means of preparing new materials that would otherwise be unattainable using more conventional hydrothermal or solvothermal flux methods. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The first project in this work focuses on the ionothermal flux synthesis of a series of new uranium phosphonates. Since the hydrothermal and solvothermal flux syntheses of uranium phosphonates had previously been extensively studied, this work provided a valuable proof of concept since there was a large body of reported structures to compare the products of the ionothermal flux reactions against. It was found that the topologies of the resulting crystalline phases were dictated equally by the choice of the ligand (e.g. aryl monophosphonate, alkyldiphosphonate, etc.), the choice of the flux method, and the choice of ionic liquid if an ionothermal flux was used.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	In the second project, a new series of trivalent f-element borates was synthesized using an ionothermal flux. While it was expected that the ionic liquid would act as both the solvent and the template in the synthesis of three-dimensional borate framework materials, what was actually observed was the formation of an isomorphous series of molecular tetranuclear borate cluster compounds. This is further evidence that an ionothermal flux may actually be responsible for limiting the dimensionality of structure topologies rather than facilitating the formation of templated extended networks.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study seeks to make meaning of Black college women’s interpretations of Black womanhood through the lens of urban reality television.  This study highlights the consumption of urban reality television in higher education and works to determine how the confluence of identity development and media influences inform understandings of Black womanhood among Black undergraduate women.  I examined their interpretations of (1) urban reality television, (2) Black womanhood, (3) campus life, (4) their interactions with family and friends, (5) role models, and (6) romantic relationships.  My preliminary findings indicate that while the students frequently consumed these shows for entertainment purposes, their understandings of Black womanhood were largely shaped by family and role models.  Still, parallels existed between the women’s lived experiences and the portrayals of reality on television.  Specifically, the participants determined the attitudes surrounding committed relationships among urban reality cast members reflect hook-up culture on-campus.  Additionally, both the women cast in the shows and the respondents used predominantly White systems (educational system, the media) to acquire social mobility and improve their socioeconomic status.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Grade retention has long been at the center of education debates (Rothstein, 1998). Despite the overwhelming evidence of the negative effect of retention on student’s self-esteem (Holmes &amp; Matthews, 1984), attitude towards school (Jimerson, 2001), and increased likelihood of dropping out of high school (Roderick, 1994; Jimerson, Anderson, &amp; Whipple, 2002), it is still difficult to promote students who do not have a mastery of the curriculum content of their current grade. But it is not just content mastery that is in question, there are other factors that make a student more likely to be retained. Students who are Black, male, and come from a low socioeconomic background (Bali, Anagnostopoulos, &amp; Roberts, 2005; Meisels &amp; Liaw, 1993) have an increased likelihood of being retained. Based on what we know about who is impacted the most by retention and the effects of retention on students, it is important to understand how grade retention policy is understood by those who are tasked with enforcing it.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Two schools in a rural school district in Florida participated in this case study analysis. Twelve elementary school teachers and three school leaders provided a deeper understanding of how they have made sense of their school district’s grade retention policy. The framework developed by Spillane, Reiser, and Reimer’s (2002) informed this study. This framework breaks down sense-making into three categories: individual knowledge and beliefs, collective sense-making, and external pressures. The findings revealed that from the outset participants worked within the framework of external pressures. How participants individually and collectively made sense of grade retention policy was nested in the context of pressures   within and surrounding the policy. Participants reported that prior experiences were an important influence in how they made sense of policy individually. If participants had a personal experience with retention they said this contributed to their understanding of and subsequent reaction to the policy. All participants reported making their decisions about retention in a context and culture of collaboration. Participants collaborated with each other on everything from intervention strategies to making final decisions on who should be retained.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Religiosity has repeatedly been shown to be associated with reduced suicidal behavior. Proposed explanations for this effect have alluded to constructs related to the interpersonal theory of suicide (i.e., Perceived Burdensomeness, Thwarted Belongingness, and Acquired Capability), as well as to two other predictors of suicidal behavior (i.e., Meaning in Life and Hopelessness). This study examined in 424 participants, whether the above-mentioned constructs mediated the negative relationship between religiosity and suicidal behavior in single-mediator path analysis models as well as in a competitive multiple mediator model. Results indicated that Thwarted Belongingness, Acquired Capability, Presence of Meaning in Life, and Hopelessness in combination with religiosity, age, gender, and race predicted 24.9% of the variance in suicidal behavior. The combined indirect effect of the proposed mediating constructs accounted for more than 50% of the total association between religiosity and suicidal behavior, reducing the direct association between religiosity and suicidal behavior to non-significance (i.e., full mediation). In follow-up single-mediator tests, Meaning in Life was the only construct that fully mediated the association between all dimensions of religiosity and suicidal behavior. Hopelessness and Thwarted Belongingness were additional partial mediators. All of the above proposed mediators were predictive of suicidal behavior; however, only Hopelessness and Meaning in Life were associated with all dimensions of religiosity. Thwarted Belongingness was associated with intrinsic religiosity only. For this population, individual constructs (i.e., Meaning in Life and Hopelessness) accounted for the protective association between religiosity and suicidal behavior. Interpersonal constructs (i.e., Thwarted Belongingness and Acquired Capability) were generally not related to religiosity; however Thwarted Belongingness was a contributing partial mediator of intrinsic religiosity.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>IODP Expedition 334 drilled west of the Costa Rican coast just offshore of the Osa Peninsula with Hole U1381A being the focus for this study. The preservation of the calcareous nannofossils at this hole ranges from moderate to good, while the total abundance ranges from very rare to very abundant. The nannofossil assemblages fall into two different zones, NN19 of the Pleistocene and NN5 of the Miocene. There are about 12 million years missing between these two zones. This hiatus is believed to be the result of erosion based on reworked Pliocene specimens in Pleistocene samples. A scheme by de Kaenel (1999) was used to further subdivide Zone NN19, and it was determined that Core 6H fell into de Kaenel’s datum 18. An article by Anthonissen and Ogg (2012) was used to define Zone NN5 and to determine the relative age. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	IODP Expedition 352 drilled west of the Izu-Bonin-Mariana system, just east of the fore-arc of the subduction zone. Hole U1439A is the focus for this study. The preservation of the nannofossils from Cores 5H to 7H ranges from moderate to good while preservation in Cores 9H to 14X ranges from moderate to poor. The latter is due to an increase in diagenesis below the lysocline where some nannofossils begin to dissolve or become overgrown. The total abundance for all of these slides ranges from very rare to very abundant, similar to Expedition 334. These slides fall into seven different zones, CN12a, NN14, CN10b, NN11a, NN7, NN6, NN5, and NN3. Anthonissen and Ogg (2012) was used to define the majority of these zones while Perch-Nielsen (1989) was used for the remainder. The 12 million year hiatus is not observed at this site; only small intermittent gaps between zones were noted.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of silence, story reading, acapella singing, and guitar playing on inducing sleep in preschool-aged children within the first 15 minutes of naptime.  Thirty-five two- and four-year old children from five classrooms at two facilities participated in the study.  Each classroom scheduled afternoon naptime following lunch prior to and during this study.  Participants in all five classrooms had scheduled naptimes for three days under each of the following four conditions: (1) silence, (2) story reading, (3) acapella singing, and (4) guitar playing.  An observation form designed for data collection was used by five observers to record the number of children who had: (1) eyes open and talking, (2) eyes open and moving, (3) eyes open and not moving, (4) eyes closed and talking, (5) eyes closed and moving, (6) eyes closed and not moving at 15-second intervals during the first fifteen minutes of naptime.  Data recorded in the “eyes closed and not moving” section of the observation form was used to determine the number of children asleep under each condition after 15 minutes of naptime.  Results revealed no significant difference in the number of children asleep under the four naptime conditions. The rank order of the most to fewest number of children asleep under the four conditions was: story reading, silence, acapella singing and guitar playing.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This dissertation is concerned with high level imaging analysis. In particular, our focus is on extracting the projective shape information or the similarity shape from digital camera images or Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI). The approach is statistical without making any assumptions about the distributions of the random object under investigation. The data is organized as points on a Hilbert manifold. In the case of projective shapes of finite dimensional configuration of points, we consider testing a one-sample null hypothesis, while in the infinite dimensional case, we considered a neighborhood hypothesis testing methods. For 3D scenes, we retrieve the 3D projective shape, and use the Lie group structure of the projective shape space. We test the equality of two extrinsic means, by introducing the mean projective shape change. For 2D MRI of midsections of Corpus Callosum contours, we use an automatic matching technique that is necessary in pursuing a one-sample neighborhood hypothesis testing for the similarity shapes. We conclude that the mean similarity shape of the Corpus Callosum of average individuals is very far from the shape of Albert Einstein’s, which may explain his geniality. Another application of our Hilbert manifold methodology is</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The general purpose of this research is to determine if there are case-level, individual, and/or social factors that have a differential impact on the federal criminal sentencing of Hispanic non-citizen offenders, compared to white citizens.  Drawing on focal concerns and minority threat theories, hierarchical linear and generalized linear models are estimated to assess case, defendant, and district level effects on the federal sentencing outcomes for a large sample of defendants (N=63,753) convicted in 2008.  The contextual factors of interest include the immigration caseload of the district, minority population sizes, and public attitudes on specific immigration policies.  The results indicate that the average likelihood of incarceration and sentence length significantly varies across these court locations.  While case and defendant-level characteristics have strong direct impacts on these outcomes, the findings also indicate that district characteristics also exert significant direct and indirect effects.  These effects were strongest in the sentence length models.  Notably, the minority compositions for the foreign-born and Hispanic populations have different effects on the average sentence lengths across districts.  Anti-immigration attitudes were also positively related to sentence length.  Overall, this work provides a more nuanced explanation of the federal sentencing disparities that exist for Hispanic non-citizens, which merit greater attention.  It also highlights the need for current sentencing theory and public policy to be further developed in order to adequately address the complex and changing impacts on punishment decisions across place.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 355 drilled two sites (U1456 and U1457) in Laxmi Basin, located in the eastern Arabian Sea. The primary objective of Expedition 355 is to better understand the impact that the Indian (southwest) summer monsoon has on weathering and erosion of the Himalayas and how this in turn affects mountain building. Laxmi Basin is located within the Indus Fan, the second largest submarine fan in the world that has primarily been fed by the Indus River and its associated tributaries since the collision of India and Eurasia in the Paleogene. Thus, the drill sites are ideally situated to record changes in erosion from the Himalayas through time, which requires a robust chronostratigraphic framework.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Analysis of 275 samples for calcareous nannofossil biostratigraphy from Hole U1457C has refined the age model that was produced onboard during Expedition 355. The section is assigned to nannofossil Zones NN11–17 (late Miocene to early Pleistocene). In conjunction with shipboard magnetostratigraphy and planktonic foraminifer biostratigraphy, the age model indicates variable sedimentation rates as well as the presence of an unconformity that spans at least 1.46 m.y. between ~5.5 and 4 Ma. Late Miocene sedimentation was variable at ~27 cm/k.y. before 7.42 Ma, but averaged ~2.4 cm/k.y. between 5.94 and 7.42 Ma. Sedimentation rates increased again from 5.94 to 5.59 Ma to ~20 cm/k.y., when deposition was interrupted for at least 1.46 m.y. until ~4 Ma. After the hiatus and through the Pliocene, sedimentation rates were lower at ~3.6 cm/k.y. until the early Pleistocene when sedimentation rates reached ~8.9 cm/k.y. before slowing to ~3.4 cm/k.y. through 2.39 Ma.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Further work to incorporate additional biostratigraphic and paleomagnetic constraints, should produce a robust chronostratigraphic framework that is necessary to examine the evolution of the Himalayas as well as climate in the late Miocene through Pliocene.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In the uppermost millimeters of shallow submerged coastal sediments, photosynthesis by microalgae and cyanobacteria during daylight hours can cause oxygen supersaturation of sediment porewater, leading to bubble formation. In shallow water depths, the seabed is affected by the pressure maximum beneath the wave crest and pressure minimum beneath the wave trough. While the photosynthetically-generated gas bubbles persist within the surface layer highly permeable sand sediments, they may be exposed to pressure pulsations caused by tides and passing surface gravity waves, because pressure is not significantly attenuated in the upper few centimeters of permeable sediments. The question arises, whether the tens of thousands of millimeter-size bubbles that are produced on sunny days in each square meter of nearshore sands respond to these pressure oscillations and if so, what consequences these responses may have.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The main goals of the research thus were the demonstration of the bubble pulsation within the sediment and the quantification of the pore water flow, associated interfacial solute flux, and sand grain movement caused by the pulsation. The central working hypotheses tested in this research were:</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>1) Millimeter-size photosynthetic gas bubbles buried in the surface layer of submerged permeable coastal sands respond to passing surface gravity waves by volume changes leading to bubble volume pulsation.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>2) This bubble volume pulsation causes pore water flows and thereby exchange across the sediment-water interface and an increase of the net solute flux from the sediment.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>3) The bubble volume pulsation causes sand grain movement and thereby local sediment compaction, alteration of sediment surface topography and vertical transport of substances attached to the sand grains.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>These three working hypotheses were addressed in Thesis chapters 1, 2 and 3, respectively.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In-situ video observations with a buried camera showed that the bubbles (1-3 mm diameter) buried in the surface layer (&lt; 10 cm) of nearshore sand respond to passing waves by volume pulsation and allowed estimation of the oscillating volume change of the bubbles visible in the sediment-cross section. These observations revealed bubble volume oscillation with compressions of 7.4% caused by ~1 meter water waves producing a temporary 10 kPa pressure increase. Laboratory measurements in a custom-built pressure tank confirmed the in-situ</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>observations: Bubbles with 1.24 mm to 2.12 mm diameter (1 mm3 to 5 mm3), embedded in transparent Nafion ™ sand sediment, at 1 m water depth were compressed by 8.7 ± 1.3 % of their volume when exposed to the same pressure increase of 10 kPa as produced by a 1 meter water wave. With an observed abundance of 50,000 bubbles m-2 in sandy Gulf of Mexico sediments, the pulsation of bubbles with 2 mm diameter produced by the passing of thirty 1 m-waves per minute (8.3% compression) could pump 31.3 L m-2 h-1 (or 750 L m-2 d-1) of water across the sediment-water interface.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Once it was established that surface layer bubbles pulsate due to pressure oscillations associated with passing surface gravity waves at a rate consistent with Boyle’s Law, the effect of pulsating bubbles on pore water movement and grain movement was investigated. Fluorescein dye tracer experiments conducted at the same wave frequency (0.5 Hz) and wave height (75-100 cm) showed a linear correlation (R2 = 0.99) between interstitial gas bubble volume and interfacial tracer flux. The pulsation of 200 five-microliter bubbles embedded in the top 2 cm of a 10 cm (L) x 10 (W) x 45 cm (D) wet sediment core (bubbles occupied 0.5% of the volume of the 2 cm thick upper sediment layer) increased interfacial flux initially (first 7 min) by a factor of 17 compared to the control experiment, where tracer transport was limited to molecular diffusion and some tracer release caused by the setup of the experiment. The increase of flux caused by the bubbles is produced by the oscillating water flow across the sediment-water interface that pushes pore water out of the sediment that then is mixed into the overlying water through dispersion and turbulence. At an observed in-situ abundance of 50,000 bubbles m-2, bubble pulsation can be estimated to increase solute transport across the highly-active sediment-water interface by a factor of 30 when compared to molecular diffusion.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Over time, the intermittent movement of sand grains driven by the pulsating bubbles resulted in a tighter packing of the sand, with a decrease in pore space, and an overall downward migration of grains above and around the buried bubbles. Particle Image Velocimetry showed that the cross-sectional area around the bubble, in which grains were moved by its pulsation, decayed exponentially over time. In the natural environment, decompaction of the sediment surface layer by bioturbation and sediment resuspension by bottom currents counteracts the compaction caused by the bubble pulsation, resulting in a continuous cycle of compaction/de-compaction that keeps a substantial fraction of the grains in the surface layer moving. With observed in-situ abundances of 50,000 bubbles m-2 and an average bubble volume of 5 mm3,</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>approximately 5,000 cm3 m-2 or 50% of the grains in the top 1 cm of the sand bed are moved by the pulsation of buried gas bubbles every hour. The movement and net downward migration of surface layer sand grains towards pulsating bubbles has broad implications for sediment physical characteristics, sediment geochemistry and pore water flow.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation examines the religious rhetoric of Ronald Reagan as part of a strategy to rebuild his political base following a disappointing level of support after his first two years in office. In particular, this examination will focus on a triad of speeches given to Christian Evangelicals within ninety days of a re-election Memorandum issued by Reagan Pollster, Dick Wirthlin.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	I will closely examine the texts of Reagan’s early 1983 speeches to the National Religious Broadcasters, National Prayer Breakfast and the National Association of Evangelicals.  In doing so I will show the way that the three speeches worked to convey the President’s agenda in language that was commonly shared not only by those three groups but also by President Reagan. I’ll argue that by using an intensified language of identifying symbols and linguistic nuances, the President was able to speak with a rhetorical urgency that was rooted in both the history of the Evangelical movement and Ronald Reagan’s personal religious experience.  Additionally, I’ll show how Reagan’s ability to linguistically identify with politically conservative Evangelical Christians was how he was able to successfully regain their confidence.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The project will include original archival research from the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and first person interviews with key Evangelical leaders who will assist in helping to better understand the context in which these speeches were given. The primary question asked and answered will be: “What did President Reagan say to rouse the support and attention of Evangelicals as part of a rebuilt coalition for his 1984 reelection?”</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This project seeks to determine how the opening of the Red Sea rift was influenced by pre-existing tectonic features and to place constraints on the structural evolution of the western Saudi Arabia margin.  In detail, we investigate whether or not the Ad Damm Shear Zone (ADSZ) was solely a Neoproterozoic structure or if it has been reactivated during the Cenozoic. The Ad Damm shear zone is a major mylonitic right-lateral structure that bounds the Jeddah terrane to the north from the Asir terrane to the south.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>South of the ADSZ, the Red sea rift exhibits well-developed linear magnetic anomalies, but north of it, they are not present.  On land, the ADSZ bounds a large topographic escarpment perpendicular to the rift margin, with higher elevations to the south.   In addition, recent studies show active seismicity within the Jeddah terrane bounded by the ADSZ. These observations collectively suggest some type of tectonic reactivation.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Four techniques were used to test this hypothesis: field mapping, satellite image processing (ASTER, SPOT-5), microstructural studies, and whole rock geochemistry. Field observations show various meta-plutonic and volcanic rocks that range in age from 800-540 Ma. North of the ADSZ, Jeddah terrane is characterized by heterogeneous magmatism with extensive meta-basalt intruded by silicic plutons of varying size.  South of the ADSZ, Asir terrane is characterized by larger-scale granitic batholiths.  In addition, a large synform, likely a km-scale drag fold, is present along the northern edge of the ADSZ.  Felsic dikes intrude a package of metabasalt and are folded in the synform. A younger generation of Eocene to Miocene basaltic dikes cut the mylonitic shear zone at a high angle. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Petrographic analyses of mylonitic rocks indicate dynamic recrystallization and grain size reduction suggesting high-temperature recrystallization.  Field observations also found a lack of low temperature fault zone rocks (e.g. gouge) except for isolated brittle slickensides. Spider diagram of Jeddah, Asir terranes, and ADSZ rocks are characterized by arc- related signature, which related to the amalgamation of Jeddah and asir terranes and defined ADSZ as Neoproterozoic structure. In contrast, Eocen-Miocene Basaltic dikes and southern basaltic flow are represented by rift- related signature, which is associated with development of Red Sea rift system. However, differences in the crustal characteristics of Asir and Jeddah terranes still influence the ongoing tectonic evolution of the Red sea rift.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study examines the impact of 1998 Revision 7 to Article V of the Florida Constitution (hereafter referred to as Revision 7) in shaping governance of Florida’s courts system.  Revision 7 shifted the major costs of funding the courts from the county level to the state level.  Under our tripartite system of government, the judicial system is dependent on the legislative branch for its funding.   An adequate and stable source of funding is required to govern the courts system, and essentially to execute their constitutional and statutory mandates.  Since the implementation of Revision 7 in Florida, the courts system primarily depends on the Florida Legislature to determine its level of funding.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Very little has been written about state courts, and specifically, state courts administration in public administration literature, so this study has something valuable to contribute to public administration, both theoretical and substantive, through the perspective and experiences of court administrators/leaders.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study is rooted in the case study tradition employed by various disciplines and asks this central question: How has Revision 7 impacted governance in Florida’s courts?  This study was conducted by giving voice to court insiders who experienced the governance structure of Florida’s courts pre- and/or post- Revision 7.  From the data derived through the interview and journaling processes, an overall picture of the experiences of the participants and the meanings that the participants construct of their experiences was drawn.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Nineteen court administrators/leaders participated in the study, and the information gathered from those participants formed the basis for the overall findings of this study.  Based on the results, two main themes regarding the participants’ experiences emerged from the data – politics and collaboration.  Court administrators/leaders need to better understand the budget process and legislative behavior, as well as need to study, embrace, and engage in the political process; and, court administrators/leaders need to stride a better balance between political and judicial forces.  Conclusions based on the data were included, implications were discussed as well as recommendations for further study.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study is to qualitatively explore the art therapist’s perspective of working with victims of disaster and implications of art therapy after a disaster experience.  Empirical research in disaster relief is limited, likely due to the unpredictable nature of disasters and the unique circumstances of each disaster event.  Victims of disaster are at risk for developing symptoms related to acute stress disorder and post traumatic stress disorder related to their disaster experience.  Art therapists have worked alongside other mental health providers to assist and treat victims of disaster within the immediate and delayed response to a disaster.  Literature on art therapy with victims of disaster is heavily weighted on art therapy with children after a disaster, with few studies including adolescents or adults.  This study used a qualitative clinical-ethnographic grounded theory approach to understand what art therapists do and how they work with victims of disaster that aids in healing from these traumatic events.  The findings of this study suggest the participating art therapists valued openness and flexibility in their work, varying their approach based upon the timing of their response (immediate or delayed), consideration for the environment in which they worked, they took on a variety of roles in the disaster response community, and emphasized the practices of self-care as beneficial for their own well-being and for increased quality of care for their clients.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In July 2011, I began to lay the foundation of the Taneycomo Festival Orchestra (TFO) in Branson, Missouri, and we completed our fourth successful concert season in June 2015.  The TFO is a two-week classical music festival in Branson, Missouri that thrives on experimentation—both programmatically and institutionally—and community building through music.  I wanted to create something that is satisfying for musicians and accessible to modern audiences.  This is its mission:</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The Taneycomo Festival Orchestra is a nonprofit organization that provides a free two-week concert series of classical music in Branson, Missouri.  We seek to break the 19th century tradition that attending a symphony concert is a formal and elitist event by providing an accessible and casual series of concerts and educational programs while continuing to preserve these great works of art in our destination city.  Come as you are and enjoy the beautiful music!</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>I embarked on this adventure with little administrative experience.  However, I had a strong background in clarinet performance and music composition, a great network of friends and colleagues, and determination to bring my dream to fruition.  In laying the TFO’s foundation, I completed almost every administrative task on my own.  I filed all of the legal documents (Articles of Incorporation, Employee Identification Number, and 501(c)(3)) successfully and without any legal aid.  In the first year, I also recruited thirty-five musicians to perform in the orchestra and programmed eight concerts (two orchestral, six chamber) for the two-week series. In 2015, we had one hundred musicians and gave fourteen concerts (four orchestral, nine chamber, one big band) over the course of our two-week series.  Our programming is diverse and includes standard repertoire, contemporary repertoire, commissioned repertoire, children’s programming, and jazz.   Our venues are eclectic and include schools, hotels, cafés, bars, shops, churches, and homes.  We save a lot of money while simultaneously engaging the community by placing each of our traveling musicians with host families and providing the orchestra with nightly dinner parties at various community members’ homes.  The Festival continues to grow and is immersed deeper into the community each year.  After our fourth season, community members have remarked that the TFO is no longer a luxury but a necessity.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This paper is a concise guide to music festival creation for performers.  It discusses the path that I took to create the Taneycomo Festival Orchestra and reveals the successes and failures of the process.  I started the Taneycomo Festival Orchestra to make classical music more accessible, enjoyable, and relevant to a modern, rural community.  The events created under these circumstances are often high-quality musical experiences that are fun for audiences.  I also aspired to separate music festival creation from traditional institutional structure.  If a performer takes a similar path and wishes to create such an organization, he or she will have little to no familiarity with the traditional or nontraditional institutional structures.  My unique perspective offers a multidisciplinary approach to music festival foundation.  Most of this paper is structured around a narrative about my experiences in running TFO, but also refers to many valuable resources to aid the beginning arts administrator in the creation and management of a music festival.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The work in this dissertation presents a method for multiplexing fluorescence measurements in both polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and anisotropy. For PCR, two dual color infrared mediation assays were demonstrated on a microfluidic device. Infrared mediated PCR on a microchip allowed a 40 cycle assay, which would require 1 hour on a traditional instrument to be reduced to 35 min due to the decrease volume and increased heating and cooling efficiency. A plasmid, PU19, was amplified in the presence of a DNA intercalating dye, EvaGreen™, and a passive reference dye, ROX, with an efficiency of 96%.  The ROX signal was used to correct for inter-run and inter-chip variations in excitation volume. A melt curve was taken simultaneously with amplification and showed a single peak at 82 °C corresponding to the known melt temperature of the plasmid.  Frequency modulation was used to isolate the fluorescence signals for the EvaGreen™ and the ROX from the large background present due to the tungsten lamp providing infrared light for the heating of the microfluidic device as well as demonstrate the first multi-color infrared quantitative PCR on a microfluidic device.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Frequency modulation was used to demonstrate a multi-analyte anisotropy method inflow on a microfluidic device. An anisotropy immunoassay was developed for the simultaneous detection of insulin and glucagon at physiologically relevant levels. Frequency modulation was used to reduce the number of optics required for multi-fluorophore anisotropy measurements as well as increase the signal to noise in the measurement by 20 fold. The increased signal to noise ratio resulting in an improvement in the limit of detection from 10 nM to 50 pM.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The anisotropy immunoassay assay was expanded to an online format used to measure the secretion of insulin by islets of Langerhans which were housed on the microfluidic device. The microfluidic system was able to stimulate islet with 3mM and 20 mM glucose and measure the resulting secretions. The temporal resolution of the system was less than 5 minutes and the highly automated fashion in which the online assay function should make it amenable to further islet studies as well as other biological systems.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>While an ever-increasing amount of literature exists regarding various aspects of ADHD, the relationship of functional impairments to important life and social skills, as well as professional functionality remains relatively unexplored. The Barkley Functional impairment scale is a recently developed and untested scale, especially with respect to other constructs of college life. While the reported validity is promising for use of evaluating functional impairments in people with ADHD, the validity and utility of the scale should be evaluated in relation to similar constructs to determine overall benefit. By doing so, researchers and other professionals in the field of counseling, rehabilitation, and professional development can address the relationships, and can improve counseling and rehabilitation services people with ADHD. Therefore, a study encompassing the relationships among measures of self-perceived functional impairment, quality of life, college self-efficacy, and career decision state could prove beneficial in understanding how aspects of ADHD affect individuals throughout the college experience. The purpose of this study was to address and to evaluate the strength of these relationships. If the self-perceived functional impairment scores were deemed to be associated with quality of life and college self-efficacy, the use of the BFIS as a diagnostic and prescriptive tool could be supported to improve the effectiveness of counseling and rehabilitation services for college students with ADHD.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Four research questions guided this study. The first question stated, “Is the self-perceived functional impairment related to quality of life?” The second question stated, “Is the self-perceived functional impairment associated with college self-efficacy?” The third question stated, “What is the relationship between perceived level of functional impairment and career decision state as measured by indecision and satisfaction with choice?” The fourth question stated, “What is the relationship between perceived level of functional impairment, college self-efficacy, and career decision state with respect to self-perceived quality of life in students diagnosed with ADHD?” The hypothesis for the first question was, “There is an inverse correlation between self-perceived functional impairment and quality of life in students diagnosed with ADHD.” The hypothesis for the second question was, “There is an inverse correlation between self-perceived functional impairment and college self-efficacy in students diagnosed with ADHD.” The third question had two hypotheses. The first hypothesis for question three was “There is a positive correlation between level of indecision and perceived level of functional impairment.” The second hypothesis for question three was, “There is a positive correlation between degree of dissatisfaction with career choice and perceived level of functional impairment.” The hypothesis for the fourth question was, “Functional impairment, college self-efficacy, and career decision state all will capture significant independent variation in the prediction of quality of life in students diagnosed with ADHD.” The first, second, and third hypotheses were tested using Pearson Product-Moment correlations. The fourth hypothesis was tested by using linear multiple regression.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Data were collected from 150 of 1108 students registered with the Students with Disabilities Resource Center (SDRC) at Florida State University through an email questionnaire. Two emails were sent approximately two weeks apart to obtain participants. Volunteer participants were potentially compensated by having their anonymous identification number submitted to a raffle drawing to receive one of three prizes: a $150 gift card, a $75 gift card, and a $50 gift card. A web-based survey program was utilized, consisting of a background/demographics questionnaire and the Occupational Alternatives Questionnaire (OAQ), the Barkley Functional Impairment Scale-Long Form (BFIS-LF), the World Health Organization Quality of Life-Brief Version (WHOQOL-BREF), and the College Self-Efficacy Inventory (CSEI). This instrument was approved by the Florida State Institutional Review Board (IRB) prior to utilization with participants. Only complete surveys were used in the calculation of results.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Results of the study showed the first hypothesis was accepted that quality of life is moderately and inversely associated with perceived level of functional impairment. The second hypothesis also was accepted. College self-efficacy was inversely, but weakly associated with perceived level of functional impairment. The first part of the third hypothesis was rejected that the level of indecision with career choice was related to perceived level of functional impairment. The second part of this hypothesis was accepted that dissatisfaction with career choices was weakly correlated with perceived level of functional impairment. The fourth hypothesis was confirmed that perceived functional impairment, self-efficacy, and level of dissatisfaction with career choice significantly contributed to the quality of life of students diagnosed with ADHD. Levels of functional impairment and dissatisfaction were inversely correlated with quality of life in the prediction model.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The information gathered yields beneficial information about the use of the BFIS in disability and rehabilitation counseling centers as a tool for addressing perceived functional impairments and related constructs of students diagnosed with ADHD. The correlations found among self-perceived functional impairment, college self-efficacy, the dissatisfaction portion of career decision state, and quality of life of people with ADHD could significantly benefit the manner in which services are provided to people utilizing various disability services on college campuses. Based on these results, the utility of the BFIS was supported as a prescriptive tool and as an instrument for counselors to use to address the relationship between self-perceived functional impairment, college self-efficacy, dissatisfaction with career choice concerns, and quality of life in college students diagnosed with ADHD.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Gene-expression data profile are widely used in all kinds of biomedical studies especially in cancer research. This dissertation work focus on solving the problem of how to combine datasets arising from different studies. Of particular interest is how to remove platform effect alone. The matched sample based cross-platform normalization method we developed are designed to tackle data merging problem in two scenarios: The first is affy-agilent cross-platform normalization which are belong to classic microarray gene expression profile. The second is the integration of microarray data with Next Generation Sequencing genome data. We use several general validation measures to assess and compare with the popular Distance-weighted discrimination method. With the public web-based tool NCI-60 CellMiner and The Cancer Genome Atlas data portal supported, our proposed method outperformed DWD in both cross-platform scenarios. It can be further assessed by the ability of exploring biological features in the studies of cancer type discrimination. We applied our method onto two classification problem: One is Breast cancer tumor/normal status classification on microarray and next generation sequencing datasets; The other is Breast cancer patients chemotherapy response classification on GPL96 and GPL570 microarray datasets. Both problems show the classification power are increased after our matched sample based cross-platform normalization method.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The abolition of slavery during the American Civil War did not end the antislavery ambitions of many liberal Christian reformers. As four million African American slaves transitioned from bondage to freedom, Unitarian and other Christian reformers knew that their work was far from complete. Initially motivated by a desire to establish a new spiritual world on Earth, the reformers in this study immediately realized that freeing African slaves hardly eliminated sin and injustice from the United States. As a result, they parlayed their energies into a new movement to emancipate the soul of the nation. In this continuation of the anti-slavery movement, spiritual abolitionists turned their attention to breaking down sectarianism, fighting orthodoxy, and legitimizing religious heterodoxy in the post-Civil War America. If they could eliminate doctrinal and organizational divisions between the various Christian sects, these reformers believed that they could usher in an era of free thought and religious tolerance; and if they could rid the nation of “spiritual slavery” and establish a “free religion,” they would witness unprecedented freedom and prosperity in the newly reunited nation. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study shows that the reciprocal influence of abolitionism and liberal religion on each other culminated in a vibrant spiritual abolitionist movement aimed at reforming American spiritual life and promoting tolerance, legitimizing heterodox beliefs, and undermining the Protestant consensus that characterized American spiritual life during the antebellum period. Throughout the mid-to-late 1860s the individuals in this study who had cut their teeth as social reformers in the abolitionist movement or had at least been influenced by antislavery thought, used the rhetoric and approach of the antislavery movement to further the goals of liberal religion.  These emerging spiritual abolitionists engaged in an effort to abolish what they termed “spiritual slavery”—a concept that has never had a full-length study devoted to it. Spiritual abolitionists conceived of spiritual slavery as a type of bondage, manifested through religious dogma, orthodoxy, and doctrine, that restricted human freedom. Spiritual abolitionists eschewed the orthodoxy and literalism that proslavery advocates had embraced during the antebellum to legitimate the institution of slavery. Spiritual slavery, like physical slavery, was simply a manifestation of hierarchy and authority that limited human free will and free thought. Spiritual slavery itself had real and concrete negative social repercussions, as it manifested in society in the form of ignorance, cruelty, and the suppression of heterodox beliefs. Spiritual abolitionists believed that without emancipating the human spirit and intellect from spiritual slavery, humanity would continue to be shackled by the chains of slavery. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The Civil War and the abolition of chattel slavery were pivotal in the emergence of spiritual abolitionism. For spiritual abolitionists, the end of the Civil War represented a millennial moment which signaled the coming destruction of all forms of slavery. The end of the war and the defeat of the Confederacy closed a period of human history epitomized by slavery and brutality, and heralded a new epoch characterized by freedom and humaneness. In this view, the period following the war would be one of not just economic and political reconstruction, but of spiritual and intellectual reconstruction. The nation, reunited after the division of political sectionalism, would be further united with a triumph over religious sectarianism and denominationalism and of religious bigotry and intolerance. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In 1865, spiritual abolitionists quickly went to work to achieve the end their new emancipationism. Using the language of abolitionism to further the cause of liberal religion, spiritual abolitionists devoted their energies to building institutions and establishing the framework for reforming American spiritual life. The largest organization dedicated to spiritual abolitionism was the Free Religious Association. The Free Religious Association, envisioned as a spiritual antislavery society, was founded in 1867 by Unitarians, Transcendentalists, and other liberal religionists who had been influenced by abolitionism. But the Free Religious Association was just one way of promoting spiritual and intellectual reform in Reconstruction era America. By connecting spiritual reformers throughout the nation, disseminating knowledge, and establishing a number of periodicals, reformers in this study helped spread spiritual abolitionism and promote religious pluralism and tolerance in postwar America.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to explore adaptation through the manipulation of perceived task difficulty and self-efficacy to challenge the concepts postulated by the two-perception probabilistic concept of the adaptation phenomenon (TPPCA) conceptual framework. The TPPCA considers the sources of perceived task difficulty (δi) and self-efficacy (βv) as the core relationship that influences adaptation. Twenty-four participants were randomized into one of 4-order groups to manipulate the level of difficulty for a handgrip and putting task. Within each task, 3 separate difficulty levels were presented to each participant in a counterbalanced order. The order of tasks and difficulty levels was counterbalanced between each of the 4-order groups. The performers completed both tasks, at each of the 3 difficulty levels, to assess their δi and βv gap effect on motivations, affect, and performances. The perceptual gap between δi and βv envisioned in the TPPCA was partially confirmed in both the handgrip and putting tasks. Specifically, as the task difficulty level increased, βv &lt; δi resulted in increased arousal and decreased pleasantness, along with declined performance. There was no solid support that motivational adaptations were congruent with the TPPCA. The theoretical and practical implications of the study are discussed along with suggestions for future research.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This thesis describes the work performed by the author during PhD studies at FSU. The first two chapters present the summary of the studies done trying to accomplish the first total synthesis of aldingenin B - a natural product first isolated in 2003 While our studies were ongoing, some additional information on the structure of the natural product emerged, therefore our studies and their relationship with the literature available up to 2015 are discussed in detail.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapters 3 through 6 represent the main topic of the thesis. They focus on the studies directed towards the development of the efficient synthesis of ent-progesterone - a potential drug candidate for the treatment of traumatic brain injury. Chapter 3 introduces the problem and the necessity for such synthesis and reviews the literature relevant to the topic. Chapter 4 presents an improved synthesis of rac-progesterone - an important step in the synthesis of ent-progesterone. Chapter 5 compares the efficiency of the two approaches : an old one and the improved route.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The taste system enables the detection and discrimination of potential nutrient sources necessary for maintaining essential life processes.  Nutrients bind with taste receptors in the oral cavity that convert the food-derived signal into neural activity interpretable by the brain.  The four independent, canonical taste qualities are “sweet”, “salty”, “sour”, and “bitter” with additional proposed basic tastes, such as “umami”, “polysaccharide”, and “fat” taste, garnering support in the literature.  A given taste quality is elicited by nutrient compounds that share chemical properties.  The proposed qualities of interest here were “umami” and “polysaccharide” taste.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Prior in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the taste receptor mechanisms responsible for mediating “sweet” taste, elicited by sugars and sweeteners,  and “umami” taste, elicited by L-glutamate, in mammals are heterodimers of the Taste Receptor Type 1 (T1R) proteins—T1R2+T1R3 and T1R1+T1R3, respectively.  However, whether the T1R1+T1R3 heterodimer is the sole mediator of “umami” taste is not without controversy; other mechanisms have been proposed.  Further disputes relate to the classification of “umami” as an independent taste quality.  Whereas a portion of the literature implicates “umami” as a unique taste sensation, evidence suggests it represents a mere combination of “salty” and “sweet” taste.  The experiments here (Chapters 2-6) combined psychophysical methodology with genetic knockout models to address the following:</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	1)	Are the individual T1R proteins—T1R1, T1R2, and T1R3—necessary for maintaining sensitivity to “umami” stimuli?</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	2)	Given the proposed commonalities between “umami” and “sweet” taste, is the T1R2+T1R3 involved in transducing the L-glutamate signal?</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	3)	How is sensitivity to other non-“umami”-tasting amino acid stimuli affected upon deletion of one or more T1R proteins?</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The taste detection of the prototypical “umami” stimulus, monosodium glutamate (MSG), in wild-type (WT) controls, and T1R1, T1R2, T1R3, and T1R2+T1R3 knockout (KO) mice was severely impaired if not eliminated when the taste signal from the sodium component was minimized by the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) blocker amiloride.  Only when inosine monophosphate (IMP), a known potentiator of the L-glutamate taste signal, was prepared with the MSG and amiloride mixture were WT and T1R2 KO mice able to detect the compound stimulus due, in part, to the taste of IMP.  In contrast, mice lacking T1R1 or T1R3 were incapable of detecting IMP alone, but showed sensitivity to at least the higher concentrations of MSG (+amiloride) when IMP was present.  Similarly, T1R2+T1R3 KO mice showed significant sensitivity loss to the purportedly “sweet-like” achiral amino acid glycine.  However, the sensitivity of T1R1 KO mice to L-lysine was unimpaired.  Collectively, these data demonstrate the necessity, but not exclusivity, of the T1R subunits in the taste transduction of some amino acids such as MSG (in the presence of IMP) and glycine.  The partial competence observed in some of the mice lacking the T1R1 or T1R3 subunit suggests the presence and activity of another receptor independent of the T1R1+T1R3 heterodimer—perhaps a novel protein or T1R homodimer.  Furthermore, unimpaired sensitivity to L-lysine in the T1R1 KO mice suggests that some L-amino acids can be detected through T1R1+T1R3-independent mechanisms without sensitivity loss.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Polysaccharides, specifically maltodextrins, such as Maltrin and Polycose, are composed of glucose polymer mixtures of varying glucose chain lengths.  Although glucose and other sugars activate the T1R2+T1R3 heterodimer, maltodextrins are suggested to potentially bind with a different receptor leading to the generation of a qualitative taste perception distinguishable from that of sweeteners.   Recent evidence supporting this hypothesis derives from T1R2 or T1R3 KO mice.  While these KO mice display relatively normal responses to maltodextrins the slight impairments in behavioral responsivity raise the possibility that T1R homodimers might contribute to polysaccharide taste transduction.  Therefore, experiments incorporating psychophysical methodology and mice lacking both T1R subunits of the sweet taste receptor (Chapter 6) were conducted to address the following questions:</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	1)	Is the T1R2+T1R3 heterodimer necessary for maltodextrin taste detection?</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	2)	Do maltodextrins and sweeteners possess discriminable taste characteristics?</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Most T1R2+T1R3 KO mice displayed similar sensitivity to Polycose as WT mice.  However, some were only sensitive to the higher Polycose concentrations, implicating potential allelic variation in the polysaccharide taste receptor.  Concentrated polysaccharide and sweetener solutions are characteristically viscous, at least at the higher concentrations, and this oral somatosensory stimulus feature may serve as a cue in this taste detection task.  Therefore, viscosity-matched Maltrin and sucrose concentrations were presented to KO and WT mice in a 2-tastant operant discrimination procedure.  Both WT and KO mice competently discriminated Maltrin from sucrose.  However, performance in WT mice was likely driven by the different taste percepts of the two stimuli, while KO mice likely relied on the taste cue from Maltrin as opposed to sucrose.  To my knowledge, these results represent the first demonstration that maltodextrin is qualitatively distinguishable from sucrose in an explicit taste discrimination task, and, coupled with the detection data, implicate that distinct dedicated taste pathways from the periphery to central circuits are mediating polysaccharide and sugar taste.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>East African “shorts rains” variability has long been a subject of interest both for its complexity and its sometimes dire human impacts. Four large-scale factors are thought to influence the shorts rains: Niño 3.4, the IOZM, and the surface and upper-level zonal winds over the central Indian Ocean. Recent research has shown that these established teleconnections are not as robust as previously thought. Particularly, the relationships between the short rains season and these factors have broken down since 1982, with several seasons having opposite conditions than what was expected. Furthermore, the debate over which large-scale factors have the most effect on the short rains season is on-going. In this study, the relationship between the interannual variability of the short rains and known large-scale forcing factors is examined with the goal of answering three questions: 1) Are the factors associated with dry and wet conditions different before versus after 1982? 2) Why did dry or wet conditions fail to occur when predicted in recent years? 3) Do dry seasons with different combinations of large-scale factors produce different local patterns in atmospheric circulation? To investigate these questions, different October-November seasons were designated into categories. Analysis was done on several diagnostic variables for each category of rainfall seasons. Contrary to what was expected, zonal wind field results showed few differences between pre- and post-1982, giving little answers as to why the relationships between the short rains and these factors has changed since 1982. Omega results highlight influence of a narrow area of upper-level sinking and rising motion over and just off the coast of East Africa. This study suggests that this feature, while indeed connected to the four established links, could shed new insight on the short rains interannual variability if evaluated as an individual factor. Results also reaffirmed prior research that shows wet and dry conditions have different sensitivities to large-scale factors. Additionally, it was found that different combinations of factors, which all produced dry conditions, had different local atmospheric patterns. Some of the greatest contrasts seen in local patterns were between factor combinations that include the IOZM compared to combinations without it. This suggests that different large-scale factors could counteract each other.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Voltage-gated potassium channels (Kv channels) play a vital roll in cellular excitability and neuronal communication by catalyzing the translocation of potassium ions across cellular membranes. After synthesis occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Kv channels must reach the cellular periphery. The coat protein complex II (COPII) mediates this trafficking process. However, the mechanism used by COPII to associate with Kv channels remains controversial. I show that trafficking of the of the Kv channel subfamily member 3, Kv1.3, partially relies upon the tandem di-acidic motif E443-E445-E447, and is a bona fide client of the Sec24a cargo recruiter of the COPII coat. These results expand upon previous studies aimed at deciphering the disputed Kv1.3 secretory trafficking mechanism.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Biophysical properties and surface localization of Kv channels can be modulated by their association with auxiliary subunits termed beta subunits (Kvβ). The subfamily member 2 (Kvβ2.1) protein has been shown crystallographically to exist in more than one plausible biological assembly, but its oligomeric state in solution has not been well characterized. I show that Kvβ2.1 in solution exists as an octamer, but upon increased reduction potential Kvβ2.1 octamers dissociate into tetramers in vitro. Furthermore, I use cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) to structurally characterize the octameric complex and find a previously unidentified density in the N-termini, which could play a role in the formation of Kvβ2.1 octamers or Kv channel-Kvβ2.1 complexes. These results demonstrate that there could be a physiological cue that couples the dissociation of Kvβ2.1 octamers to tetramers followed by the association of Kvβ2.1 tetramers with Kv channels.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>With technological advances in electron detection devices used in cryoEM, I examine some of the influences that potentially hinder achieving atomic resolution using cryoEM single particle reconstructions. I tested previous metrics shown to greatly enhance the ability to achieve atomic resolution using cryoEM, and further expanded on those metrics by showing the effects of rigorous dose compensation and image alignment. To this extent I was able to determine a 2.8 Å structure of the adeno-associated virus using our new metrics. These results demonstrate how cryoEM is ushering in a new era in structural biology. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Determining the full-length, high-resolution structure of a Kv channel in a native-like membrane in a non-crystalline environment is a long sought after goal in structural biology. Moreover, structural characterization of the interactions that occur between COPII and a membrane-embedded cargo molecule has not been completed. I present an innovative method and advances towards determining the high-resolution cryoEM structure of membrane reconstituted Kv1.3 encapsulated within a COPII coat. This work lays a foundation to solve the high-resolution structure of membrane-embedded Kv1.3 and examine the COPII-Kv1.3 interactions that occur within a coated vesicle.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Engagement of individuals with suicide ideation into mental health treatment is a considerable challenge. Previous studies examining barriers and facilitators to service use among suicidal individuals have primarily focused on observed correlates (e.g., demographic characteristics). While there is utility in delineating these characteristics, treatment engagement and retention efforts can be strengthened by assessing belief systems about treatment itself and by determining the association between severity of suicide ideation and views of mental health treatment. In this regard, the first aim of this study was to determine if greater severity of suicide ideation is associated with elevated negative views of treatment. Further, understanding modifiable psychological motivational processes that may underlie the association between suicide ideation and beliefs about treatment may provide insight into appropriate interventions to promote treatment engagement and to retain suicidal individuals who initiate treatment. One useful framework through which to understand these relationships is Self-Determination Theory (SDT), which posits that humans have three basic psychology needs—autonomy, relatedness, and competence—that, when fulfilled, motivate human behavior. Thus, guided by SDT, the second aim of this study was to determine if autonomy, relatedness, and competence separately and/or collectively moderate the association between suicide ideation and negative views of treatment. To test these aims, data were analyzed from a sample of 215 individuals who presented to a community mental health training clinic. Severity of suicide ideation was assessed via the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (BSS). The psychological needs posited by SDT were assessed via the Basic Psychological Needs Scale (BPNS). The Negative Treatment Indicators (TRT) content scale of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory–2 (MMPI-2) was utilized as an indicator of views of treatment. The Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale was included as a covariate. A series of regression analyses were employed to test relevant main effects and interactions. As predicted, severity of suicide ideation was associated with greater negative views of treatment in both an unadjusted model and a model adjusted for GAF score. There were significant main effects of Self-Determination Theory constructs on negative views of treatment, such that greater psychological needs fulfillment was associated with less negative views of treatment. However, the analyses testing the interaction between suicide ideation and basic psychological needs in the prediction of negative views of treatment were generally not statistically significant. Thus, our finding that, among psychiatric outpatients, greater severity of suicide ideation was associated with more negative views of treatment, even after adjusting for overall functioning, underscores the critical need for further efforts to engage and retain these high-risk individuals into mental health treatment.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study was a mixed methods investigation into the instructional practices of teachers of students with visual impairment as they relate to tactile graphics. Information was solicited through the use of an on-line survey, phone interviews, and videotaped lessons. Primarily, the study was designed to explore the extent to which instruction in tactile graphics is provided by teachers of students with visual impairments (TVIs). A secondary purpose of this study was to explain the strategies, curricula, and perceived training needs of TVIs related to teaching this important skill.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This is a study of the strategic and tactical use of ironclad warships during the American Civil War. The project seeks to examine why the naval administration on both sides (led by Gideon Welles for the Union and Stephen Mallory for the Confederacy) decided to give such vessels an opportunity in combat, their reaction to early operations (such as the famous battle at Hampton Roads on 8-9 March 1862), and how they learned to deploy the ships as the war progressed--accounting for difficulties with terrain, fortified opposition, learning curve for personnel, and weaknesses of the weapon system technology. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The study also encompasses history of science and technology concepts such as gatekeeper theory and social construction of technology. The military gatekeepers, Union and Confederate, had to adopt weapons that suited their strategic needs as a part of their overall objective. The Confederate’s need to maintain open ports and fend off the Union Navy’s superior numbers made superior quality of ships a viable recourse. The Union’s need to defeat the Confederate Navy, including overcoming any of the South’s technological leaps, made inclusion of ironclad warships a valid plan. However, both sides of the conflict had to deal with different socially constructed backgrounds. The South’s agricultural heritage and lack of industrial development hindered its ability to build or improve naval technology at home—forcing it to look abroad for assistance at a time when major nations would not recognize the Confederacy’s official existence. The Union’s entrenched naval traditions and cumbersome bureaucracy slowed approval of new and often unproven technologies. The result of these forces, military and technological, was an unforgiving trial by fire for the ironclad armored warship in the American Civil War.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The identification of forensic cases often includes the use of skeletal elements to assess the age-at-death of an individual. The pubic symphysis is the preferred and most often used skeletal age indicator. Standard techniques, such as the Suchey-Brooks system, require that the morphology of the pubic symphysis is visually compared to shape characteristics typical for phases with associated age intervals. As individual factors accumulate during the aging process, estimating the age-at-death for older individuals becomes increasingly more difficult. In addition, methods based on visual inspection of the bones introduce some level of subjectivity and observer-related error. This research makes use of about 100 3D laser scans of the pubic symphysis of white male skeletons with known ages-at-death, and proposes several objective, quantitative methods for shape analysis that aim to provide a surface or outline measure of the shape of the scans that minimizes the age-estimation error. The proposed methods include the use of thin plate splines, two-dimensional Fourier, wavelet and elliptic Fourier analysis, and a technique that uses the radius of a best fitting circle (in 2D) or sphere (in 3D) as a measure of the curvature of a shape. In addition some refinement and partitioning techniques were implemented. The project investigates the relationship between the exact age-at-death and the different measures produced by each method. Also included are results of applying a recently proposed computational method, the &lt;i&gt;SAH-Score&lt;/i&gt;, to new scan data and scan partitions. As a final result, the project proposes multivariate regression models that combine the measures with highest statistical significance to minimize the age estimation error (about 12 years) and maximize the adjusted R-squared value (over 55%). Furthermore, the results are subjected to two cross-validation analysis to test for the accuracy of the models when used in practice.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Florida Articulation Agreement and common course numbering make transferring from a Florida College System (FCS) institution to a Florida State University System (SUS) institution almost seamless. With 28 state colleges across the sunshine state, many students opt to begin their college careers in these institutions that were all once known as community colleges. The purpose of this study was to examine if transferring from an FCS institution after the first two years of undergraduate study and earning an associate’s degree negatively affects student success in terms of bachelor’s degree attainment, academic performance, and time to bachelor’s degree. Students that earned an associate of arts (AA) degree from any of the 28 FCS institutions and then transferred into the University of Florida (UF) were compared with their native rising junior counterparts at UF. This study found that overall rising juniors did outperform the associate of arts degree FCS transfer student peers. Rising juniors did better in overall graduation grade point average (GPA), time to degree, and in bachelor’s degree attainment in six years or less. African American associate of arts degree earning transfer students however, did earn higher GPAs than their African American rising junior counterparts. College personnel and student affairs professionals should continue to study the transfer student population as a unique subset of students to better understand the different challenges they face at the university level and how they can be best prepared for academic success.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The poems in the dissertation manuscript Another Mona Bone Jakon are the formal dispersal and performance of the masculine “I,” a subject position these poems embody and pulp as a question necessary to a poetics of radical autobiographical practice. The question is: how is pleasure a form of critique? More specifically, what is a masculine pleasure that refuses to own, to only illuminate? How to write an embodied pleasure that affirms a necessarily difficult joy in consumption, whether economic, political, sexual, institutional, or intellectual, while also acknowledging complicity with systematic violence and identification with the male face (and body) of our culture’s various catastrophes? What is a refusal that maps and coalesces in what it refuses? As a book of intertextual long poems, Another Mona Bone Jakon aims to be an affective archive accumulated in encounter with these questions. A range of formal approaches and styles inform these poems, including modes of lyric narrative and framing complicated by artificiality and digression, radical appropriation/deep reference methods that unframe the space of the poem, experimental translation techniques that seduce portions of the avant-garde canon into contemporary cultural exchange, the inclusion of real and imagined correspondence, and the formation of a prosody textured by broad juxtapositions of tones and discourses.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Given that sports teams follow the schedules provided by their respective league offices, there has been much debate in terms of a potential impact of differential rest intervals on a team’s productivity. In general, workers of an organization need rest in order to optimally perform. Rest can also reduce workers’ fatigue and stress, which can have a positive impact on worker performance and ultimately be a benefit to an organization. The same notion of rest is applicable to professional sport teams, as their abilities and performance are key to team productivity. Because a team’s schedule is controlled by a sport league or association that organizes sporting events, it is common for team managers and coaches to complain about insufficient rest periods for their teams. Teams in the National Basketball Association (NBA) follow an unbalanced game schedule in terms of rest days and the length of a home stand/road trip. The league does not prioritize each team’s rest days when scheduling games. As a result, teams frequently play back-to-back games with little or no rest days, and when traveling play multiple games in a row during a regular season.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A potential problem with an unbalanced league schedule is that zero or a small number of rest days increase players’ fatigue, which could subsequently impair overall team productivity. It was unclear to what degree differential rest intervals impact team productivity in the NBA. This issue is important, because team productivity is associated with the competitiveness within the league, which can influence team revenue derived from attendance, television rights deals, and other sources. Based on this notion, I examined whether differential rest intervals and the length of a home stand/road trip impacted team productivity in the NBA. I tested three statistical models with three dependent variables, in order to approach team productivity from diverse perspectives. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The three dependent variables were team performance measures, win/loss, and margin of victory. To operationalize the concept of rest in the NBA, I employed rest periods of each team. Two other measures of the concept of rest were also chosen: the length of a road trip and a home stand. As indirect measures of the concept of rest intervals, these two factors are also important assuming that a long stay at home (on the road) may advantage (disadvantage) teams, because travel is believed to increases players’ fatigue. The NBA prioritizes a venue’s availability when scheduling games, so some teams stay at home for multiple games whereas other teams have to travel to play multiple games on the road. Thus, I attempted to gain insight as to how team productivity may have changed depending on a team’s rest interval, length of a road trip, and length of a home stand scheduled by the NBA. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Rest intervals were only significant in relation to two performance metrics, field-goal percentage and steals, while a team’s margin of victory and probability of winning did not change with rest days. The non-significant impact of rest intervals on a team’s productivity in relation to its game outcomes demonstrate that rest intervals were not a key determinant of game outcomes in the NBA. The improvement in field-goal percentage and steals was too low to change game outcomes. In addition, the impact of the length of a home stand and a road trip on team productivity were negligible, regardless of their statistical significance. These results indicate that the NBA’s priority for building a schedule—venue availability—has not been flawed in that no team was advantaged or disadvantaged by playing successive games at home or on the road. The empirical results of the current study are supportive of NBA teams’ and players’ efforts to reduce the negative impact of no or short rest days on team productivity. I also found that travel factors such as the length of a home stand and a road trip (elements thought to impact a home advantage) were not greatly influential to a team’s wins. Based on the results of the current study, I provide directions for future research with diverse approaches to the concepts of rest, fatigue, and productivity in sports.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>What Makes some conflicts more severe than others? This paper examines this question first by discussing what “severity” actually means. Then, the paper argues that rebel groups are stronger when they have access to lootable resources. When rebel groups are stronger, civil conflicts should tend to be bloodier. To examine this argument, this paper employs Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression and discusses the results. The results here show strong support for the argument made in this paper.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The focus of this treatise is pedagogical material and solo literature for the E-flat clarinet.  Despite the E-flat clarinet’s inclusion in many pieces for orchestra and wind band, the instrument is rarely incorporated into an applied clarinet curriculum.  Perceptions of the instrument as piercing, shrill, and out of tune only perpetuate the discomfort and apprehension many clarinetists experience when faced with situations in which they must perform or teach E-flat clarinet.  Discussion of the instrument’s development, along with its treatment in large ensembles, serves to demonstrate how the stereotypes associated with the E-flat clarinet may have evolved.  Several excerpts from orchestral and wind band literature are included as examples of the instrument’s typical functions in ensemble writing.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Since there is limited pedagogical material available for E-flat clarinet besides orchestral excerpts, the second half of this treatise provides suggestions for teaching methods and solo repertoire to be used in private lesson or practice settings.  Conceptual exercises adapted from B-flat clarinet etude and method books, as well as recommendations by several performers and educators who specialize in playing the E-flat clarinet are presented.  Standard excerpts are also adapted as examples of potential fundamental exercises.  The final chapter of this treatise includes descriptions of six pieces for E-flat clarinet and piano, along with performance and teaching considerations.  This material is intended to aid clarinetists in their teaching and practice of E-flat clarinet, and to highlight selected repertoire of an instrument that does not often receive attention in lesson or recital settings.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>During World War II, the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 required conscientious objectors (COs) who opposed any form of military service to perform “work of national importance under civilian direction.” The program that carried out this alternative service was the Civilian Public Service (CPS), in which approximately 12,000 pacifists served at 151 camps established across the nation during the war.  Some of those camps were in Florida and Mississippi, where CPS men worked with state and local public health authorities to combat diseases that plagued the South's poor, including hookworm and malaria. Though an advance over previous options for COs, CPS was not always well-received, by either the American people or the men who served within it.  This dissertation will examine the camps in Florida and Mississippi to assess the success (or lack thereof) of the CPS alternative service program during the war, and also to explore the larger question of how well the United States upholds and protects the right of its citizens (particularly, nonconformist citizens) during a time of national crisis.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Brazos River area is located at the entrance of the former Western Interior Seaway on the shallow northern Gulf of Mexico shelf. Marine sediments in the region were deposited in a middle to outer shelf environment. Outcrops on the Brazos River in the Falls County area of Texas record nearly continuous and predominantly siliciclastic sedimentation during the Late Cretaceous and early Paleogene. The Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary there, as well as the Upper Cretaceous and Paleogene sediments around it, are clay-rich marls with excellent preservation. The main goal of this study is to document the well-preserved Upper Cretaceous (Campanian-Maastrichtian) nannofossils with a low resolution look across the K-Pg boundary into the lowest Paleocene sediments.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this study, seven outcrop sections from the Upper Cretaceous Marlbrook, Neylandville and Corsicana Formations and the lower part of the Danian Kincaid Formation from the Brazos River area were examined for calcareous nannofossils. The nannofossil assemblages are abundant and diverse in the Campanian and Maastrichtian sections, and abundant with low diversity in the lower Danian. The samples yielded 6 biozones defined by 7 nannofossil datums. Of these datums, five first occurrences (FO), one last occurrence (LO) and one first occurrence acme were observed. Based on quantitative analysis 54 genera and 108 species were identified in this study.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Carbon nanotube (CNT) fibers are very promising materials for many applications.   Strong interactions among individual CNTs could produce a dense yarn results in exceptional properties. These properties are used in the application of high-performance reinforcement for composites. . As the reinforcement, the primary function is to provide outstanding load bearing capability. Currently literatures use a variety of measurement techniques and gauge lengths that have not been uniform for CNT yarn tests. The need for a standardized testing method for characterization is necessary in generating reproducible and comparable data for CNT yarn or fiber materials</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this work, the strength of CNT fibers was characterized using three different types of tensile test method: the film and fiber test fixtures from dynamics mechanic analysis (DMA), and –TS 600 tensile fixture. Samples that underwent the film and TS 600 tensile fixture were attached with a thick paper tabbing methodology based on ASTM standard D3379.  As for the fiber fixture was performed with the test material attached directly to the fixture based on the fiber test instruction from TA Instrument. The results of the three different methods provided distinct variance in stress, strain, and modulus. A design of experiment (DoE) was established and performed on the DMA film fixture as determined from the preliminary experiment. The DoE was successful in quantifying the critical parameters’ ranges that attributed to standard deviation of average stress. These parameters were then tested on 30 more samples with an improved additive manufactured tab. The results significantly decreased all mechanical testing parameters’ standard deviations. Most importantly, the results prove the probability of a valid gauge break increased to more than 400%.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In order to prepare for the future, at least some people might spend time imagining how a target person’s future behavior could impede the achievement of their goals. These imaginings represent no truly new information about the target person, as they are self-generated.  However, if people misattribute the increased cognitive accessibility of the target’s negative behavior to a meaningful source of information, the imaginings could still have the power to impact impressions of the target.  Across 3 studies, I tested the hypothesis that imagining a future scenario in which a target had the potential to behave badly would negatively impact participants’ impressions of the target, an effect that would be moderated by the imaginer’s locus of control orientation and that might grow stronger after enough time elapsed for source confusion to take place.  Specifically, I tested the prediction that externally-oriented people would increase the negativity of their target judgments after such imaginings, but internally-oriented people would experience either no change or a positive change in their target judgments.  In Study 1, as predicted, imagining a hypothetical future scenario had a negative impact on target judgments that was moderated by locus of control.  In Study 2, as predicted, anticipating a real future interaction with a disagreeable confederate had a negative impact on confederate judgments that was moderated by locus of control, even after the real situation was resolved favorably.  In both studies, effects persisted one week later in a small follow-up sample but did not grow stronger.  Study 3 included an additional control condition to test the hypothesis that future imaginings would produce an impact above and beyond merely recruiting memories of somebody’s real past bad behaviors. However, Study 3 failed to replicate the findings from Studies 1 and 2.  Implications of these mixed results are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In recent decades, the influence of negative health behaviors on physical health and mortality has garnered a great deal of attention (Institute of Medicine 2001).  Research suggests that these negative health behaviors, such as smoking, binge drinking, and lack of exercise, are leading preventable causes of morbidity and early mortality in the U.S. (Institute of Medicine 2001). Yet, little research has explored whether there are differential impacts of risky health behaviors on health outcomes by social groups such as race/ethnicity. Using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2003-2008, linked with the National Death Index,  My dissertation focuses on filling existing gaps in the literature by exploring the associations between health behaviors, physiological distress,  and mortality and how these associations vary by race and ethnicity in the U.S. I examine 1) how these relationships (health behaviors, physiological dysregulation, death) vary by race/ethnicity; 2) the role health behaviors play in the relationship between physiological dysregulation and mortality as well as how this role varies by race/ethnicity and; 3) investigate how the individual items (biomarkers) that make up the physiological dysregulation measure can be grouped by behaviors and race/ethnicity in a way that further elucidates  the previously mentioned relationships. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>First, negative binomial regressions show a differential relationship between negative health behaviors and physiological dysregulation by race/ethnicity. Namely, Whites experience a significantly higher detrimental impact of negative health behaviors on their physiological dysregulation than do Blacks, and to a lesser extent Mexican Americans. Yet, running Cox Proportional Hazards models on the risk of mortality reveals no racial/ethnic differentials in the impact of health behaviors on mortality. The latent class analysis of the biomarker indicators is then used to further parse out why there is a difference in the racial/ethnic variations in the relationship between poor health behaviors and physiological distress but not mortality. These findings suggest that respondents’ biomarkers do cluster into healthy, cardiovascular, metabolic, and inflammatory groups. The cardiovascular group is defined by higher proportion of minorities, particularly Blacks, as well as a stronger relationship with negative health behaviors. The group is also the most likely to experience mortality. The already high likelihood of minorities having high cardiovascular risk may explain why there is a weaker relationship between physiological dysregulation and risky health behaviors. This research could extend information on the consequences of risky health behaviors as well as inform public policy on the importance of considering social differentials when addressing health behavior risk.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>In our work we analyze and implement numerical schemes for the infinite Prandtl number model for convection. This model describes the convection that is a potential driving force behind the flow and temperature of the Earth's mantle. There are many schemes available, but most are given with no mention of their ability to adequately capture the long time statistical properties of the model. We investigate schemes with the potential to actually capture these statistics. We further show numerically that our schemes align with current knowledge of the model's characteristics at low Rayleigh numbers.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF-1) is an angiogenic factor with therapeutic potential for the treatment of ischemic disease. FGF-1 has low intrinsic thermostability and is characteristically formulated with heparin as a stabilizing agent. Heparin, however, adds a number of undesirable properties that negatively impact safety and cost. Mutations that increase the thermostability of FGF-1 may obviate the need for heparin in formulation and may prove to be useful “2nd-generation” forms for therapeutic use. Chapter one is a report on a pharmacokinetic (PK) study in rabbits of human FGF-1 in the presence and absence of heparin, as well as three mutant forms having differential effects upon thermostability, buried reactive thiols, and heparin affinity. The results support the hypothesis that heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) in the vasculature of liver, kidney and spleen serves as the principle peripheral compartment in the distribution kinetics. The addition of heparin to FGF-1 is shown to increase endocrine-like properties of distribution. Mutant forms of FGF-1 that enhance thermostability or eliminate buried reactive thiols demonstrate a shorter distribution half-life, a longer elimination half-life, and a longer mean residence time (MRT) in comparison to wild-type FGF-1. The results show how such mutations can produce useful 2nd-generation forms with tailored PK profiles for specific therapeutic application.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter two is a systematic mutational analysis to eliminate buried free cysteines in FGF-1. Buried free Cys residues can contribute to an irreversible unfolding pathway that promotes protein aggregation, increases immunogenic potential, and significantly reduces protein functional half-life.  Consequently, mutation of buried free Cys residues can result in significant improvement in the storage, reconstitution, and pharmacokinetic properties of protein-based therapeutics.  Mutational design to eliminate buried free Cys residues typically follows one of two common heuristics: either substitution by Ser (polar and isosteric), or substitution by Ala or Val (hydrophobic); however, a detailed structural and thermodynamic understanding of Cys mutations is lacking.  We report a comprehensive structure and stability study of Ala, Ser, Thr and Val mutations at each of the three buried free Cys positions (Cys16, Cys83, and Cys117) in fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF-1).  Mutation was almost universally destabilizing, indicating a general optimization for the wild-type Cys, including van der Waals and H-bond interactions. Structural response to Cys mutation characteristically involved changes to maintain, or effectively substitute, local H-bond interactions -- by either structural collapse to accommodate the smaller oxygen radius of Ser/Thr, or conversely, expansion to enable inclusion of novel H-bonding solvent.  Despite the diverse structural effects, the least destabilizing average substitution at each position was Ala, and not isosteric Ser.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter three is a report on a gain-of-function mutation FGF-1 S116R and its potential interaction with the FGFR-1c. The 18 signaling members of the mammalian fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family have a broad range of functions in development, tissue homeostasis, and metabolism. This family includes the paracrine and endocrine FGFs - distinguished by the high heparan sulfate (HS) affinity of the former. HS plays a key role in cell signaling of the paracrine FGFs through formation of a ternary complex of FGF\FGF receptor (FGFR)\HS. Binding to HS on the surface of vascular endothelial cells also defines the peripheral compartment in the pharmacokinetics of the paracrine FGFs, and modulation of FGF HS affinity by specific mutation has the potential to tailor paracrine/endocrine properties. A designed S116R mutation in FGF-1 as constructed with the goal of increasing HS affinity. X-ray structure and biophysical analyses indicate that the S116R mutation has no discernable structural perturbation or change in protein stability or folding cooperativity in comparison to wild-type (WT) FGF-1. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) analysis of complexation with sucrose octasulfate (SOS; a disaccharide HS analogue) indicates a statistically significant, albeit minor, increase in affinity. Surprisingly, assays of mitogenic activity show an order of magnitude gain of function. Several X-ray structures for distinctly different FGF\FGFR\HS ternary complexes have been reported. These structures predict substantially different environments for position 116 - varying from solvent exposure to participating in specific intermolecular FGFR contacts. The pronounced gain of function for the S116R FGF-1 mutation is most consistent with a recently reported novel FGF-1\FGFR1c\HS complex structure, which predicts the establishment of unique FGF\FGFR heterodimerization contacts involving S116R, and is distinct from either of the prevailing “2:2:2 symmetric” or “2:2:1 asymmetric” models.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Value-Added Models (VAMs) require consistent longitudinal data that includes student test scores coming from sequential years. However, longitudinal data is usually incomplete for several reasons, including year-to-year changes in student populations. This study explores the implications of yearly population changes on teacher VAM scores. I used the North Carolina End of Grade student data sets, created artificial sub-samples, and run separate VAMs for each sub-sample. Results of this study indicate that changes in student population could affect teacher VAM scores.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>A new method for the segmentation of 3D breast lesions in dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) images, using parallel programming with general purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPUs), is proposed. The method has two main parts: a pre- processing step and a segmentation algorithm. In the pre-processing step, DCE-MRI images are registered using an intensity-based rigid transformation algorithm based on gradient descent. After the registration, voxels that correspond to breast lesions are enhanced using the Na ̈ıve Bayes machine learning classifier. This classifier is trained to identify four different classes inside breast images: lesion, normal tissue, chest and background. Training is performed by manually selecting 150 voxels for each of the four classes from images in which breast lesions have been confirmed by an expert in the field. Thirteen attributes obtained from the kinetic curves of the selected voxels are later used to train the classifier. Finally, the classifier is used to increase the intensity values of voxels labeled as lesions and to decrease the intensities of all other voxels. The post- processed images are used for volume segmentation of the breast lesions using a level set method based on the active contours without edges (ACWE) algorithm. The segmentation algorithm is implemented in OpenCL for the GPGPUs to accelerate the original model by parallelizing two main steps of the segmentation process: the computation of the signed distance function (SDF) and the evolution of the segmented curve. The proposed framework uses OpenGL to display the segmented volume in real time, allowing the physician to obtain immediate feedback on the current segmentation progress. The proposed implementation of the SDF is compared with an optimal implementation developed in Matlab and achieves speedups of 25 and 12 for 2D and 3D images, respectively. Moreover, the OpenCL implementation of the segmentation algorithm is compared with an optimal implementation of the narrow-band ACWE algorithm. Peak speedups of 55 and 40 are obtained for 2D and 3D images, respectively. The segmentation algorithm has been developed as open source software, with different versions for 2D and 3D images, and can be used in different areas of medical imaging as well as in areas within computer vision, such like tracking, robotics and navigation.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are inorganic nanocrystals that possess several unique photophysical properties, including tunable narrow emission and remarkable photo- and chemical stability. They have large surface area, and thus can be decorated with large numbers and a variety of molecular vectors. These properties combined offer a potentially superior alternative to traditional organic fluorophore for advanced applications in bio-imaging and bio-sensing.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Herein, our effort has centered on developing a series of metal coordinating ligands with controllable structures to modify the QD surfaces and construct biocompatible nanocrystals. The ligand architecture accounts for several factors: (i) variable coordination number, (ii) nature of the hydrophilic moiety, polyethylene glycol (PEG) or zwitterion, and (iii) versatility of end-reactive groups including amine, azide, carboxylic acid and aldehyde. The ligand design is combined with a newly developed photoligation strategy to promote the dispersion of luminescent QDs in buffer media. The dissertation is organized in six chapters:</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In chapter 1, we provide a brief introduction of the basic photophysical properties of QDs and the synthesis history for growing high quality semiconductor nanocrystals. We also present some of the most effective methods reported to date to prepare aqueous QD dispersions, discuss the effective chemical coupling strategies for conjugating biomolecules, and review the recent literatures that have used QD-bioconjugates for imaging and sensing purposes.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In Chapter 2, we describe a novel photoligation strategy to promote the transfer of luminescent QDs from hydrophobic to hydrophilic media using lipic acid (LA)-based ligands. We also discusse the experimental conditions, mechanismfor in-situ ligand exchange and the generosity of the method towards the diverse functionality while maintaining the optical properties of the nanocrystals.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In chapter 3, we present the design and synthesis of three sets of compact zwitterionic ligands comprising either one or two lipoic acid (LA) groups chemically linked to a zwitterion moiety. These ligands are then combined with the photoligation strategy to promote the phase transfer of QDs to buffer media.  The high compactness and the stability of the nanocrystals over a broad range of conditions have been discussed.This chapter also highlights the conjugation of mCherry to the QD surface via metal-histidine coordination, as a proof-of-concept, to develop FRET-based sensors.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In chapter 4, we detail a versatile strategy to prepare a series of poly (ethylene glycol) containing multicoordinating ligands optimized for the surface-functionalization of luminescent QDs and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) alike. Our chemical design relies on the modificationof chiral L-aspartic acid precursor, and the advantages of using aminoacid combined with lipoic acid and reactive PEG moieties have been discussed. Nonetheless, the two sets of ligands: bis(LA)-PEG-FN and LA-(PEG-FN)2 described here are compatible with photoligation strategy to yield hydrophilic, colloidally stable and reactive nanoparticles (QDs and AuNPs).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In chapter 5, we discuss the preparation of hydrophilic QDs with intact azide (-N3) and aldehyde (-CHO) bio-orthorgonal functionalities on their surfaces. Strain promoted click chemistry and hydrazine ligation will be discussed to illustrate the orthogonality of two reactive groups, azide and aldehyde. Additionally, we demonstrate an optical method to extract the number of reactive -CHO groups per QD and finally estimate the total number of ligands bound to each QD for a few distinct size nanocrystals.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>         Metal eutectic fluxes are useful for exploratory synthesis of rare earth intermetallics. In this work, the use of rare earth/transition metal eutectics such as: Nd/Co, Pr/Co, Ce/Co, Nd/Ni and Sm/Ni have yielded many structually and magnetically complex phases, which also help us to to gain better understanding of reactivity trends of various elements in the flux. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>         The intermetallic compounds R2Co2SiC (R = Pr, Nd) were prepared from the reaction of silicon and carbon in either Pr/Co or Nd/Co eutectic flux. These phases crystallize with a new structure type in orthorhombic space group Immm, with unit cell parameters a = 3.978(4) Å, b = 6.094(5) Å, c = 8.903(8) Å (Z = 2; R1 = 0.0302) for Nd2Co2SiC. Silicon, cobalt, and carbon atoms are connected with each other to build up two-dimensional flat sheets which are separated by puckered layers of rare-earth cations.  Magnetic susceptibility measurements indicate that the rare earth cations in both analogs order ferromagnetically at low temperature (TC = 10 K for both).  Single crystal neutron diffraction data for Nd2Co2SiC indicates this ordering occurs in two steps.    </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>           Crystals of two new germanide intermetallic compounds were grown from Nd/Co or Pr/Co eutectic flux. The crystal structure of Nd8Co4-xAlxGe2C3 (Pbcm, a=8.00Å, b=11.71Å,c=15.07Å; Z=4, R1=0.0261) features germanium centered neodymium clusters Ge@Nd9 capped with Co and C atoms which form infinite zigzag chains. Magnetic susceptibility measurements indicate the Nd ions order at 50K. Magnetic anisotropy studies show the Nd3+ magnetic moments tend to align ferrimagnetically along the c axis. The phase RE6Co5Ge1+xAl3-x (RE=Pr, Nd) crystallizes with the Nd6Co5Ge2.2 structure type in hexagonal space group P-6m2 (a = 9.203(2)Å, c = 4.202(1) Å, R1 =  0.0109 for Pr6Co5Ge1.80Al2.20; and  a = 9.170(3) Å,   c = 4.195(1) Å, R1 = 0.0129 for  Nd6Co5Ge1.74Al2.26), featuring chains of face-sharing Ge@RE9 clusters intersecting hexagonal cobalt nets linked by aluminum atoms. Magnetic susceptibility measurements indicate that both phases exhibit ferromagnetic ordering of the cobalt layers with TC in the range of 130-140K, and the rare earth ions order at low temperature (30-40K). The magnetic measurements on oriented crystals of Nd6Co5Ge1.74Al2.26 show a strong preference of the Co moments to order along the c-axis. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>          A cerium cobalt borocarbide compound, Ce10Co2.75B11.5C10(triclinic, P-1, a = 8.5131(5)Å, b = 8.5144(5)Å, c = 13.5709(7)Å,  = 100.870(1)°,  = 93.677(1)°,  = 90.041(1)°, Z = 2, R1 = 0.0293) was grown as large crystals from reactions of boron and carbon in cerium/cobalt eutectic melts.  The structure of the cerium-rich product features Co4 squares capped by borocarbide chains.  Magnetic studies show a ferromagnetic transition at 10 K and also indicate fluctuating cerium valence.</DISS_para>
