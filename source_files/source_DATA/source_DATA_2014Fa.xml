         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Public education in the United States has seen many changes over the years. Some of those changes came in response to what are now recognized as clear problems with religious liberty in the common education system adopted in the mid 1800's. This dissertation reviews past and current ideas related to religious liberty and the larger issue of liberty of conscience (Nussbaum, 2008) in education and pursues a research question by considering past and current issues. Does a system of general, mass education necessarily infringe upon students' liberty of conscience? This question is pursued following a Deweyan framework of philosophy of education wherein a "felt difficulty" is identified, information is gathered to apply to the difficulty, and possible solutions to problems identified (Dewey, 1938). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>I begin with a discussion of liberty of conscience and a discussion of some of the conflicts included in a system of mass education. This establishes the structure of the difficulty, or problem. The history of the public education system in the United States is reviewed with a focus on the common education system adapted in the 1830's along with relevant issues related to religious intolerance. Improvements in the respect for religious diversity applied to that system over time and improvements proposed but not yet fully implemented are discussed. Ideas from religious intolerance literature is introduced to add insight and expose the larger issue of liberty of conscience including how those ideas can be applied to educational systems. The process of religious intolerance (Corrigan &amp; Neal, 2010) is developed into an architecture of religious intolerance that can assist with identifying this type of intolerance in educational settings. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>I argue that while many of the strongest issues of religious intolerance in public education have been resolved, many problems still remain. I will also argue that the intolerance is not limited to religious intolerance but includes intolerance for ideas stemming from many different epistemic foundations. This will lead to a consideration of an idea I have labeled as epistemic intolerance. These arguments support an answer to the research question, which is that a system of general, mass education does necessarily infringe on students' liberty of conscience if one or more cultural majorities centrally control that system of education.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Purpose: To examine pulse oximetry (PO) levels in healthy adult subjects across the adult age span, and to examine the same in a sample of individuals with severe and very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and to compare their results.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Method: PO levels were recorded via the BIOPAC Systems, Inc. (Goleta, CA) computer based data acquisition unit in conjunction with the Acqknowledge version 4.1 software. Subjects for this study were drawn from a sample of 60 healthy young men and women between the ages of 18 to 38 (30 males and 30 females) and a sample of 60 healthy older men and women (30 males and 30 females) aged 60 years and over. A clinical population of 11 COPD subjects (3 males, 8 females) with an age range of 43 to 82 also participated in the study. Each subject swallowed 10 ml of water three times, 10 ml of applesauce three times, and three small individual pieces of diced pears three times. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Results: In the healthy adult group, a 2 (age) x 2 (gender) repeated-measures ANOVA revealed no statistically significant main effects for within-subject factors of  bolus type or the interactions of bolus x gender, bolus x age or bolus x gender x age. For between-subject variables there was no main effect for gender but age was significant F(1, 116) = 36.94, p &lt; .001 and the interaction of gender x age was significant F(1, 116) = 5.62, p = .019. For the COPD sample, a Friedman test did not reveal statistically significant differences across the bolus types. For the comparison between the healthy adults and COPD groups a Mann Whitney U test revealed that there were statistically significant differences between the groups for all the of the bolus types: U = 22, p = .011 for water, U = 26, p = .023 for applesauce, and U = 22, p = .011 for pears. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Conclusions: Our study contributed information regarding the invariant nature of PO levels in healthy adult swallows across a range of consistencies (for a typical bolus volume). The same pattern was true for individuals with COPD. These results suggest that fluctuations in PO values might indicate respiratory compromise, though additional investigation is warranted to confirm this hypothesis.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Tropical cyclone intensity prediction is an issue at the forefront of mesoscale numerical weather prediction efforts because it is an area where historically there have been only small improvements, and yet much more progress is needed to improve advance warnings for land- falling tropical cyclones (TCs). In recent years, research instrumentation has been developed for deployment aboard aircraft that remotely study tropical cyclones in order to answer critical intensity questions about TCs. One such instrument is the NASA Hurricane Imaging Radiometer (HIRAD) that has been developed to observe hurricane surface wind speeds and rain rates. This study explores the expected benefits of this instrument's data to numerical simulations of tropical cyclones using two different data assimilation methods within the experimental framework of Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSE). The HIRAD instrument performed its inaugural hurricane flights during the summer 2010 NASA Genesis and Rapid Intensification Processes (GRIP) field program, when it first studied Hurricane Karl undergoing Rapid Intensification (RI) during its brief transit over the southern Gulf of Mexico. RI events such as this one are particularly difficult to forecast given the short duration and distance over water between landmasses. The aims of this study are four-fold: first, the creation of two Nature Run simulations of Hurricane Karl as a strong and a weak hurricane; second, the accurate simulation of the HIRAD instrument's rain rate and wind speed observations; third, the development and use of two data assimilation schemes for use with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model using simulated HIRAD data for both Nature Runs; and fourth, the improvement of Hurricane Karl's intensity forecast at the end of the data assimilation period due to the inclusion of HIRAD observations and potential use for aiding the forecast of landfalling intensity. The two data assimilation schemes in this study include the creation of an update to the Krishnamurti et. al, technique of Physical Initialization of rain rates for a mesoscale model, and the adjustment and use of an Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) data assimilation scheme developed by Zhang et al. for use with tropical cyclone wind speeds. Additionally, since HIRAD currently flies in the NASA HS3 field campaign on the same Global Hawk as the NASA High-altitude Radar (HIWRAP)- a dual-frequency, dual-beam conical scanning Doppler radar system- a few OSSE experiments are performed combining simulated data from both instruments. These assess the potential benefits of assimilating HIRAD wind speeds alongside HIWRAP radial velocities to further improve the initialization of TC intensity.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Interdisciplinary research is often problem-based, arising to serve needs that cannot be fulfilled without crossing domain boundaries. Interdisciplinary researchers face a number of issues such as poor communication, methodological differences, and sources of funding. As any academic team comes together it has to organize, develop work processes, and create deliverables. Teams that form for a relatively short time to accomplish a specific goal (e.g., for the duration of a grant) have the added pressure of a deadline. Interdisciplinary time-limited teams must do all this while communicating and negotiating across disciplinary boundaries, most likely with different disciplinary norms and vocabularies. This study fills a gap at the junction of studies of teamwork processes and academic interdisciplinarity and contributes to theoretical knowledge of the process of academic interdisciplinary teamwork.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study explores an intrinsically transient interdisciplinary research team's process of collaboration across domain boundaries to design an educational technology intervention. It combines grounded theory method and social network analysis, using purposive samples of 4260 team e-mails and eight intensive interviews with key informants. The study takes a social approach to research, using Strauss's social worlds perspective, Kazmer's intrinsically transient social worlds model, and Star's boundary object theory as sensitizing concepts to explore the boundaries of the social worlds of the team and how they segmented and changed over time, the roles of the team members, challenges that emerged and strategies developed to address them, and how the team members bridged the social worlds of the team.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The importance of iterative design emerged as a strong concept from the findings and this concept extended to the workings of the team as well. A model of interdisciplinary team technology development in a time-limited setting is proffered that includes inputs (activities, the project goals, and roles and responsibilities as originally understood by the team), outputs (the system, publications, project reports, and applications for new grants), intervening elements (rules, policies, and procedures and technology issues), and strategies to keep progress moving (multiple deadlines, entrepreneurialism, and a flexible role structure). Future research should be used to validate, refine, and expand the theory; to refine the research design and the instrumentation; and to further explore theoretical implications.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Background: Obesity is an ongoing socio-economic worldwide epidemic and major modifiable risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), which continues to be the main determinant of all-cause mortality.  A potential mechanism by which obesity associates with CVD is an increased stiffness of the arteries leading to a decreased vascular function and development of hypertension.  Moreover, muscle strength and mass are inversely related to arterial stiffness and obesity.  Although exercise training is a proficient intervention for treating CVD risk factors and increasing muscle strength/mass, the most effective intervention for decreasing arterial stiffness is still unclear.  Whole-body vibration training (WBVT) is a relatively novel exercise mode which requires static or dynamic movements on a vibrating platform and has similar adaptations in the skeletal muscle as resistance training (RT).  However, the effects of whole-body high intensity RT seem to be adverse, although controversial to arterial function in young healthy adults and middle-aged with prehypertension or hypertension.  WBVT is usually performed with leg exercises using the body weight (unloaded) as resistance to the exercise. However, the addition of an external load or resistance to WBVT (WBVT+EX) has shown beneficial adaptations in improving arterial function, bone mineral density, hormonal responses, and muscle strength/mass. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether WBVT+EX would induce greater benefits than unloaded WBVT on arterial function and muscle strength in young-overweight and obese (body mass index, BMI= 30.9 &amp;plusmn 0.7 kg/m&lt;super&gt;2&lt;/super&gt;) women. Methods: Twenty-two young (20 &amp;plusmn 1 yr) overweight/obese women were randomly assigned to a non-exercising overweight/obese control (O-CON), WBVT, or WBVT+EX for 6 weeks.  Thirteen lean women were assigned to a lean control (L-CON) group in order to compare them at baseline to the age-matched overweight/obese women.  Pulse wave velocity (PWV), brachial blood pressure (BP), aortic BP, wave reflection, muscle strength, and body composition were measured before and after 6 weeks. Results: Statistical significance was set at P &lt; 0.05.  Data were presented as mean &amp;plusmn SE.  There were no significant time effects or group-by-time interactions for brachial-ankle PWV (baPWV), carotid-femoral PWV (cfPWV), brachial systolic BP (bSBP), brachial diastolic BP (bDBP), aortic diastolic BP (aDBP), augmentation index (AIx), augmentation pressure (AP), and transit time for the reflected wave (Tr).  cfPWV and aSBP decreased (P &lt; 0.05) in the WBVT group while baPWV and aDBP decreased in the WBVT+EX.  There was a significant group-by time interaction (P &lt; 0.01) for faPWV, aSBP, aortic mean arterial pressure (aMAP), and AIx adjusted at 75 bpm (AIx@75). In addition, group-by-time interaction was detected for P1 and P2 such that the reductions observed in the WBVT and WBVT+EX groups were significantly different (P &lt; 0.05) from the O-CON group.  The WBVT and the WBVT+EX groups had significant increases in leg strength (P &lt; 0.01) when compared to the O-CON group (group-by-time P &lt; 0.01) while a time-effect (P &lt; 0.01) was observed in the chest 1RM only in the WBVT+EX group.  Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first study to detect beneficial effects of WBVT+EX on arterial parameters, as shown by improvements in aortic BP, PWV, and wave reflection while still maintaining increases in muscle strength in young overweight/obese women.  Although unloaded WBVT seems to be an effective exercise modality to improve arterial function in obese postmenopausal women, it does not seem to be as efficient in young obese women.  This study suggests that, although WBVT had some positive effects on arterial function in young overweight/obese women, a more evident benefit on arterial function is observed after increasing the exercise intensity of WBVT through an external load progressed from 15 to 8 RM.  Future studies should focus on older populations with greater risk of cardiovascular and/or other chronic diseases that are associated with reduced muscle strength/mass.  WBVT+EX should be incorporated and recommended for young overweight/obese women in order to improve arterial function and prevent the loss in muscle mass related to weight loss.  Additional studies should also consider the use of WBVT+EX as an adjunct exercise modality in order to incorporate its use in clinical populations prone to physical disabilities due to sarcopenia and dynapenia.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>A great challenge that biology faces is in integrating phenomena from different scales. On the micro scale of the spectrum, we can measure subcellular processes, like gene expression and regulation. On the macro scale, we can measure species level variation, ecological interactions, and the like. The challenge biology faces is in following the causal threads that lead individuals, populations, and ultimately, species to the variation in traits that we see in nature. The idea that there are cascades of causality that reduce to a microscopic scale is often referred to as the Genotype to Phenotype map (Houle and Govindaraju 2010). The Genotype to Phenotype map is ultimately a problem of measurement; what do we need to measure at each scale of interest in order to understand and, more importantly, predict variation elsewhere on the spectrum?</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This thesis is focused on two parts of the genotype-phenotype spectrum. The first chapter focuses on the macro scale, specifically on how traits maintain stasis across species. Here we use Drosophila melanogaster wing shape as a model to test whether stasis is explained by constraint or by stabilizing selection. We test for constraint with an artificial selection experiment on wing shape. We then test for stabilizing selection by measuring flight differences among selected and unselected flies and by testing for mate preference.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the second chapter, I focus on the micro scale by describing a method to measure the spatial properties of gene expression patterns. Quantitative measures of gene expression currently focus on mutations in the genome and/or the magnitude of expression. This ignores the spatial components of gene activity that are critical in the formation of pattern and the maintenance of growth during development. I describe methods to measure the spatial characteristics of genes that form discrete and continuous patterns of expression. I then give three examples of the method by quantitatively disrupting three genes and estimating the effects on a discrete and a continuous expression pattern.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Insect flight muscle (IFM) is the preferred model system for visualizing actin-myosin interactions due to its highly ordered lattice of actin and myosin filaments. Electron tomography (ET) of fast-frozen, actively contracting Lethocerus IFM has recently resulted in a model for the weak to strong transition in the myosin crossbridges that produce force (Wu et al., 2010). These myosin molecules consist of a motor domain (MD), a lever arm and a coiled-coil rod domain that forms the filament backbone. The MD and lever arm region together constitute the subfragment 1 (S1) domain. The MD contains the ATP catalytic site and the actin-binding site. The myosin lever arm contains the essential and regulatory light chain bound to a long alpha helix. The first 50 nm of the rod domain consists of the subfragment 2 (S2) region, which acts both as a linker and adapter to transmit force produced by the MD and is sufficient to form the myosin dimer. Atomic models of myosin heads remodeled to fit the cross-bridge density show a distinctly straightened appearance when compared to the crystal structures of myosin subfragment 1 (S1). This implies that there is an aspect of the structural changes that occurs in force production that has not been recognized in myosin crystal structures of various intermediates. A weak-to-strong binding transition involving an azimuthal reorientation of the myosin MD on actin could explain this observation provided that myosin's &amp;#945;-helical coiled-coil S2 domain emerged from the thick filament backbone at a particular location. Previous studies did not visualize the S2 domain in either the raw tomogram or in subvolume averages. Here we have used ET of IFM fibers in rigor, in which the filament lattice has been swollen in low ionic strength buffer, to view where S2 emerges from the thick filament backbone as a test of the weak to strong transition. The results show that the S2 origins of those rigor myosin heads bound to the target zone of active muscle originate from the same region of the thick filament as implied by the position of the S1/S2 junction observed in active muscle. This shows the myosin heads in clear agreement with the previously proposed weak to strong transition model. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In order to visualize IFM by ET, crossbridge samples must be sectioned because they are otherwise too thick. Sample preparation methods include fixation and embedding followed by sectioning and staining. These preparation steps can potentially induce artifacts. The most notable sectioning artifacts are compression and shearing of the specimen. We examined ~80 nm thick transverse sections (cross-sections) cut with both a vibrating knife (sonic-knife) and static knife and explored different knife settings. We examined the mitigating effects of these sectioning parameters on both compression during cutting and shear distortions on the filaments as seen in tomograms of rigor muscle swollen in low ionic strength medium. Separate from specimen preparation challenges, data collection also presents with a set of artifacts. Mass loss in plastic sections in conventional ET can reduce section thickness by as much as 30%. We evaluated the benefit of collecting tilt series at -190°C with &lt; 60 e-/Å2 total exposure, a value that is 50% of the dose typically used in cryo-ET for frozen hydrated specimen, in order to minimize radiation-induced mass loss that results in section thinning. Reducing the artifacts in our sample facilitated reconstruction of the IFM lattice making it possible to probe aspects of muscle contraction in greater detail than previously possible. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>ET is most useful for imaging biological structures in situ. A sample with reduced artifacts opens the door for better reconstructions. We used subvolume averages of both thin and thick filaments to reassemble the filament lattice with high signal-to-noise ratio averages. We used the improved samples with the intent of resolving the subfilament structures in the thick filament backbones as well as the subunit structure in the actin thin filaments. The information obtained from these averages provided two separate frames of reference for deciphering the relationship between crossbridge origins on the thick filament with crossbridge binding sites on actin.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>There are no published quantitative studies of coccolithophore standing crops in the North East Gulf of Mexico (NE GOM). When the Macondo oil spill happened in April of 2010 researchers scrambled to determine what effect it would have on the GOM ecosystem. For coccolithophores, it is hard to say exactly what effects the oil spill had on the population because there is no data from this region prior to the spill. This research seeks to establish a baseline for coccolithophore standing crops in the NE GOM in the months of February, March, and December. A biostratigraphic software program was employed to show a graphical representation of the samples in a way that is easily digested. These months were also compared to see what, if any, seasonal variation occurs between December and March.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Saudi Arabia has long been held as one of the largest oil producers in the world with a vast amount of wealth. The country's meteoric rise to their current status can be attributed to the development of its oil fields by an American company that gained virtual control over the economy of a fledgling nation. This situation prompted the country to establish a codified Labor Law, which gradually gave control back to the State. In this project the 1969 Labor and Workmen Code will be examined as well as the factors that caused its creation and prompted its continued evolution to its current form.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	This thesis explores the factors to why it was necessary for the Saudi Arabian Government to create a codified labor law and abandon Sharia (Islamic Law) in commercial matters, in addition to how the state currently uses the law to keep a firm grasp on its natural resources. The lessons learned from the American-led ARAMCO period (1938-1980) were included in the law, thus creating a turning point in Saud Arabian history that allowed the government to reclaim control of its economy.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Many sources will be used in this thesis but the most substantial is the Labor and Workmen Law because it contains specific provisions that were enacted to curb American influence. Translated sources from the Saudi Ministry of Labor and the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency are also used to highlight the current form of the law as well as many secondary sources bolster the argument that the Saudi Arabian Government established a Labor Code that would ensure a reduction of American hegemony while also making the state the sole influence in labor and commercial matters.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this dissertation, I examine the concept of cultural capital (Bourdieu 1973; Lamont and Lareau 1988; Lareau 2002) as it applies to teachers' evaluations of native and immigrant students' academic and social behaviors. Using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, I examine how rates of fifth grade student participation in cultural capital-building activities, such as playing sports or taking music or art lessons, vary by race and nativity status. I also examine how parental contact and involvement with their child's school and teacher varies by race and nativity status. I find that rates of student and parent involvement in cultural capital-building activities generally favor native students. I then test whether or not teachers give positive or negative evaluations regarding native and immigrant students (1) literacy skills, (2) approaches to learning, and (3) interpersonal skills, and if cultural capital influences these teacher evaluations.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Prior research suggests that cultural capital can give some students an edge in the classroom. Given that native students and their parents tend to have more involvement in cultural capital-building activities, I predict that teachers' evaluations of native students' skills will be more positive than their evaluations of immigrant students. In most cases, immigrant students are not systematically evaluated more negatively by teachers than their native peers. In fact, the results show that Hispanic and Asian immigrants make actually receive higher teacher evaluations regarding literacy and learning skills than native students. However, the overall differences in these native/immigrant student teacher evaluations generally do not seem to be affected by the possession of cultural capital. Race, nativity status, and cultural capital do not seem to have any influence on teachers' evaluations of students' interpersonal skills.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation examines representations of Protestantism during a crucial period of legal persecution initiated by Louis XIV's Revocation of the Edict of Nantes (1685) and concluded during the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Era. Drawing on a vast variety of printed sources by Enlightenment writers, social reformers, priests, pastors, revolutionaries, and even Napoleon Bonaparte, this dissertation examines the versatile and fungible nature of Protestantism in the wake of the Revocation. Consideration of Protestantism permitted the exploration of a variety of pressing issues, including the role of religion in society, the perfectibility of human nature, the characteristics of an ideal citizen, secularism, pluralism, and human rights.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>     This study of representations of Protestants in France during the long eighteenth century-- by both Protestants and non-Protestants -- offers new insights on the Enlightenment, the French Revolution, the Napoleonic Era, and the history of Protestantism in general. It crosses traditional chronological boundaries, building off of the latest historical scholarship and cultural theory, to argue that an understanding of modern, progressive Protestantism emerged over the course of the eighteenth century, alongside and intertwined with the more secular minded doctrines normally associated with the Enlightenment, culminating in the nineteenth century understanding of liberal, progressive Protestantism. As such, this dissertation argues that Protestantism became attached to and helped shape modern ideals like commercial economics, democracy, republicanism, freedom of conscience, liberalism, progress, and the idea of modernity itself.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Critical numismatic discourse in eighteenth-century Spain helped create the nation's first national history inclusive of Spain's historical traditions. Historians often associate the development of the Spanish nation and national identity with the nineteenth century, but in doing so they have largely overlooked the preceding century. The eighteenth century, however, witnessed the development of state administrative and cultural institutions. At this time, the Bourbon monarchy patronized and protected the Royal Academy of History, whose patriotic historians collected the nation's historical artifacts and began writing a new "general history" of Spain. The collection and study of coins were central to the historical endeavors of the Academy. Despite being an important methodological tool in historical scholarship for hundreds of years, historians have largely overlooked numismatics in historiographical studies. Yet it is because of critical numismatic discourse that historians encountered Spain's diverse histories and accepted them as part of Spain's national historical narrative. The present study looks at numismatic discourse at the Royal Academy of History in eighteenth-century Spain and, using Spain's Moorish history as an example, argues that critical numismatic discourse helped create Spain's first national history inclusive of Spain's neglected and culturally diverse past.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The inclusion of electronic equipment in the performance of traditionally acoustic instruments has sparked a new genre of musical possibilities. Through an exploration of the history of the electroacoustic musical genre, the technologies employed, performance practices, and the experiences of a representative sample of bassoonists currently performing within the field, this treatise demonstrates how the addition of electronics in music has developed the genre of electroacoustic bassoon performance.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The experiences of four representative bassoonists, Michael Burns, Jeffrey Lyman, Jim Rodgers, and Paul Hanson, are highlighted to demonstrate how each uses electroacoustic performance in his career, as well as the specific technologies and equipment employed to transform the traditional acoustic bassoon into an electroacoustic instrument.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>There are an estimated 44.4 million people living with some form of dementia. Relatively recently, medical professionals have begun to start using odor identification tests to early diagnose dementia-related disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Given that cognition and olfactory functioning are so intimately linked, albeit no knowledge of the governing underlying mechanisms, I designed a series of experiments combining olfactometry, learning paradigms, and metabolism. I hypothesize that if disorders of cognitive decline coincide with decreased olfactory acuity, then modulation of olfactory output can regulate cognitive ability. We found that in two functionally different models of cognitive decay (prenatal cocaine exposure and diet-induced obesity), detriments in two-odor discrimination, as assessed by a KNOSYS 8-channel liquid olfactometer, were also present. Following this, I then investigated whether enhanced olfactory ability also enhanced cognition. Gene target deletion of the voltage-gated potassium channel, Kv1.3. produces a "super-smeller" phenotype, accompanied by an increased metabolism. These Kv1.3-null mice do not demonstrate deficits in olfactory ability or cognition following being challenged by a high-fat diet.  Given these results, I wanted to mimic the Kv1.3-null phenotype in wild-type animals by administering insulin, a pharmacological dampener of Kv1.3 activity, to mice intranasally. Two-odor discrimination and cognitive ability was assessed via olfactometry and odor-reversal contingencies respectively. Possible changes in metabolism were also monitored via custom-designed, computer-interfaced, metabolic chambers. I was not able to observe any changes in metabolism, nor were there any enhancement of olfactory and cognitive function. Over all, the findings here demonstrate that olfactory and cognitive decline may accompany one another in some instances. In addition, although Kv1.3-null mice that display enhanced olfactory ability, are resistant to fatty diet-induced cognitive dysfunction, attempts to mimic this behavioral phenotype in wild-type mice were unsuccessful and I was not able to fully demonstrate whether enhanced olfactory ability could in turn enhance cognition. Ultimately the data obtained from these experiments will add further evidence to this link between sensory systems and cognitive capability; possibly providing a better understanding and therefore improved diagnosis of cognitive disorders that inflict millions world-wide.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The structure and function of the eye is conserved across vertebrates.  Mutagenesis screens of zebrafish have led to the discovery of many genes essential for retinal development and function.  In one such screen, a recessive allele on the &lt;italic&gt;zvm9&lt;/italic&gt; locus was identified due to the lack of an optokinetic reflex in larvae of otherwise normal appearance.  Preliminary histology indicated a lack of lamination in the &lt;italic&gt;zvm9&lt;/italic&gt; mutant retina and immunohistochemistry confirmed phenotypic defects in all layers of the retina.  These included thin or absent plexiform layers, disorganization of cells within laminae, and the loss of specific retinal cell types.  Additionally, cell death in both the retina and forebrain was identified by TUNEL.  The presence of ectopic mitoses during retinal development and the later observation of ectopic cones suggests that the &lt;italic&gt;zvm9&lt;/italic&gt; product is a crucial component of a complex regulating cell-cell junctions or apical-basal polarity.  The notable absence of synaptic structures in cone photoreceptors is consistent with my hypothesis that this complex is also required for proper cell-cell interactions.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>On February 21, 1862 Colonel Thomas Green launched an assault on a fixed Union defensive position in the New Mexican Territory during the American Civil War. The charge met with success where several others failed during the war. Across a field over six hundred yards long and with artillery support the Confederates were able to seize the defenses. These defenses had an attachment of six cannons under the command of Union Captain Alexander McRae and anchored the Federals left flank. The capture of these guns and subsequent break through on the northern portion of the field led to the Confederate victory at the Battle of Valverde. What has been overlooked are the reasons that led to the success of this frontal assault where so many others failed during the Civil War. Due to the remoteness of the battle in the desolate American west, the charge and the elements that were implemented both purposely and accidentally on the field that day have been glossed over by history. By examining events that led up to the battle, the movement of forces on the day of the battle, and a thorough examination of all angles of the assault, a conclusion will be arrived at of principles that, when implemented, will increase a commander's success on assaulting fixed defensive positions. The examination will conclude by briefly looking at these elements in future wars to see how they were implemented on other battlefields.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Students of Vocal Performance are commonly instructed in the rules of diction for French, German and Italian languages, making it an easy task to select songs for performance from among these nationalities.  There are also many beautiful, unique, interesting and moving songs from the Russian vocal literature.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In an effort to make Russian song more accessible to those not familiar with the language, this treatise will providing a reference regarding one of the composers, Nikolai Karlovich Medtner and his settings of Fyodor Ivanovich Tutchev poems.  The singer will find herein biographical information on the composer and poet; descriptions of Medtner's musical style; and transliterations, transcriptions and translations of the texts.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Medtner was a prolific song composer, having published 106 songs, sixty of which are settings of Russian texts.  He chose poems from five Russian poets of the Romantic era as source material:  Aleksander Sergeyevich Pushkin, Mikhail Yuryevich Lermontov, Afanasy Afanasyevich Fet, Valery Brussov, and Fyodor Ivanovic Tutchev.  His music is highly chromatic with complex rhythms, but with soaring lyric melodies and always a clear tonal center. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Medtner was critical of his contemporaries' use of atonality and polytonality, which he called cacophony.  He published a book in the Russian language in France in 1935, The Muse and the Fashion.  This was then translated into English by his friend, the musicologist Arthur Swan, and published in 1951.  This book sets forth Medtner's philosophical views on music and denounces the practices of atonality and polytonality.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Tutchev is often referred to as one of three great Russian poets of the Romantic era, along with Pushkin and Lermontov.  He was not a poet by profession, but spent his life in government positions.  Many of his poems are philosophical in nature, and many express deep and profound emotion.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Singers who are unfamiliar with the Russian language will find a valuable resource in the original translations, transcriptions, and transliterations of the 15 Tutchev poems that Medtner chose for these song compositions.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Metal flux synthes is a useful alternative method to high temperature solid state synthesis; it allows easy diffusion of reactants at lower temperatures, and presents favorable conditions for crystal growth. A mixed flux of calcium and lithium in a 1:1 ratio was explored in this work; this mixture melts at 300°C and is an excellent solvent for main group elements and CaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Reactions of p-block elements in a 1:1 Ca/Li flux have produced several new intermetallic and Zintl phases. Electronegative elements from groups 14 and 15 are reduced to anions in this flux, yielding charge-balanced products. More electropositive metals from group 13 are not fully reduced; the resulting products are complex intermetallics.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The reactions of tin or lead and carbon in Ca/Li flux produced the analogous phases Ca&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;Tt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C8 (Tt = Sn, Pb) in the monoclinic &lt;italic&gt;C21/c&lt;/italic&gt; space group (a = 13.2117(8) Å, b =10.7029(7) Å, c = 14.2493(9) Å, &amp;#946; = 105.650(1)° for the Sn analog). These compounds are carbide Zintl phases that includes the rare combination of C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;super&gt;4-&lt;/super&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;super&gt;2-&lt;/super&gt; units as well as Sn&lt;super&gt;4-&lt;/super&gt; or Pb&lt;super&gt;4-&lt;/super&gt; anions. Ca/Li flux reactions of CaH2 and arsenic have produced the Zintl phases LiCa&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;As&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H in orthorhombic &lt;italic&gt;Pnma&lt;/italic&gt; (a = 11.4064(7), b = 4.2702(3), c = 11.8762(8) Å), and Ca13As6C0.46N1.155H6.045in tetragonal &lt;italic&gt;P4/mbm&lt;/italic&gt; (a = 15.7493(15), c = 9.1062(9) Å). The complex stoichiometry of the latter phase was caused by incorporation of light element contaminants and was studied by neutron diffraction, showing mixing of anionic sites to achieve charge balance.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Ca/Li flux reactions with group 13 metals have resulted in several new intermetallic phases. Reactions of indium and CaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the Ca/Li flux (with or without boron) formed Ca&lt;sub&gt;53&lt;/sub&gt;In&lt;sub&gt;13/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;4-x&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;23+x&lt;/sub&gt;(2.4 &lt; x &lt; 4.0) in cubic space group &lt;italic&gt;Im-3&lt;/italic&gt; (a = 16.3608(6) Å) which features metallic indium atoms and ionic hydride sites. The electronic properties of this "subhydride" were confirmed by &lt;super&gt;1&lt;/super&gt;H and &lt;super&gt;115&lt;/super&gt;In NMR spectroscopy. Attempts to replace boron with carbon yielded Ca&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;InC&lt;sub&gt;13-x&lt;/sub&gt;, (&lt;italic&gt;Im-3&lt;/italic&gt;, a = 9.6055(8)Å) which contains C34- units. A very similar phase, Ba12InC18H4 (&lt;italic&gt;Im-3&lt;/italic&gt;,a = 11.1415(8) Å), was grown from the reaction of indium, carbon, and LiH in Ba/Li flux. This compound also includes C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;super&gt;4-&lt;/super&gt; units. Preliminary Ca/Li flux reactions of aluminum with other main group elements have produced several new phases: a hydride clathrate Ca&lt;sub&gt;31&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt; in cubic &lt;italic&gt;Fd-3m&lt;/italic&gt; (a=18.0835(15) Å), Ca24Al2(C1-xHx)N2H16 in tetragonal &lt;italic&gt;P42/nmc&lt;/italic&gt; (a=15.9069(12) Å, c=13.7323(10) Å, and Ca4Al2N5 in orthorhombic &lt;italic&gt;Pna2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/italic&gt; (a = 11.2331(1) Å, b=9.0768(8) Å, c=6.0093(5) Å.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This dissertation examines concert dance, Broadway musicals, and film musicals from the mid-1930s to the early Cold War period, exploring how choreographers, directors, and performers expressed American nationalism through dance.  Nationalism in dance transferred from the ballet stage during the buildup and early years of World War II to Broadway and Hollywood musicals in the mid-1940s to late 1950s.  This shift brought Americana dances to a wider audience--the concert dance audience was small and elite, but the audience for movies was larger and more diverse.  In addition to analysis of the dancing, this dissertation utilizes the papers of choreographers, Broadway publicists' scrapbooks, the records of the Production Code Administration, film preview audience surveys, reviews, letters, and interviews.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Frontier figures and servicemen were already a part of American identity before cowboy ballets and tap dancing sailor movies; however, dancing made these figures come to life for audiences, wrapping up ideology in attractive, virtuosic performance.  Nationalism in dance intersected with personal artistic expression, censorship, government policy, critical response, and audience reaction.  As the audience grew, so did concerns over mediating the messages presented.  Dance was a part of U.S. diplomacy, propaganda, and identity.  This dissertation contributes to the current scholarship on dance and nationalism because it spans across concert dance, popular culture, and mass media, linking multiple disciplines in the process.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Two leading theories exist to explain the progenitor models of Type Ia supernovae. In the single-degenerate scenario (SDS), a carbon-oxygen white dwarf slowly accretes matter from a non-degenerate binary companion that is exceeding its roche lobe until the mass of the white dwarf reaches the Chandrasekhar limit (&lt;italic&gt;M&lt;/italic&gt; &amp;sim; 1.4 solar masses). At this point a deflagration wave begins in the core, eventually turning into a detonation wave that reaches the surface and annihilates the white dwarf, causing the supernova event. In the double-degenerate scenario (DDS), two white dwarfs lose angular momentum due to the emission of gravitational waves and merge together, exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit and causing a supernova. In this study, we explore the observational evidence indicative of only the single-degenerate scenario by looking at the long-term effects caused by the interaction between the supernova debris and the non-degenerate companion. We model the interaction in two dimensions using the PROTEUS code that utilizes adaptive mesh refinement. Our simulations involve one supernova type interacting with one of seven different companion types -- four main-sequence-like stars (MS), one subgiant (SG), and two red giants (SY). During the interaction, a region mostly devoid of material is formed behind the companion. We find that the structure of this `hole' formed behind the companion is similar across each of these models, with an angular size extending 30&amp;deg;-45&amp;deg;. The structure of the supernova remnant is affected out to 90&amp;deg;-100&amp;deg; as a result of the interaction with the companion. Each companion type has a characteristic percentage of mass stripped from it by the end of the simulation with MS stars losing about &amp;sim;20% of their mass, the SG star losing about &amp;sim;10%, and the SY stars losing about &amp;sim;40%, where in the SY case only the denerate core and a small portion of the stellar envelope is left over. We find that the interaction contaminates the companion with trace amounts of Nickel-56. 10&lt;super&gt;-16&lt;/super&gt; to 10&lt;super&gt;-8&lt;/super&gt; solar masses of Nickel-56 are found in the MS stars, 10&lt;super&gt;-7&lt;/super&gt;super&gt; solar masses are found in the SG star, and 10&lt;super&gt;-19&lt;/super&gt; to 10&lt;super&gt;-21&lt;/super&gt; solar masses are found in the SY stars' leftover envelope, though this contamination may be purely numerical. In the initial stages of the interaction, we find that the superheated material trapped between the companion and the expanding ejecta is capable of prompt X-ray emission through the evacuated hole once it travels around the companion and along the border of the hole. The temperature of this material is expected to decrease once it reaches the hole, but at each model's most energetic time, all three sample systems considered are capable of producing soft X-rays (for the MS38 system, the bulk of potential X-ray emission lies in the range 2.73 to 4.32 KeV, for the SG system, 1.08 to 2.43 KeV, and for the SY319 system, 0.09 to 0.27 KeV).</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This doctoral thesis studies the life and writings of Hrotsvit of Gandersheim, a 10th century Saxon canoness within the Ottonian Empire. Hrotsvit's decision to write, and thus enter the male-dominated literary realm, places her within a unique category. This canoness' writings explore her perceptions of the worth of the Christian female in subjectivity and voice. Although her stated purpose for her dramas was to compete with the Roman poet, Terence, she also sought to provide female characters with strengths and choices not given to other female characters in either the Classical or medieval tradition. This project aims to study Hrotsvit's six dramas, as compared with Terence's six plays, in terms of the canoness' interplay with thematic inversion and subversion. This paper will delve into Hrotsvit's background in order to hypothesize as to her ambitions and goals. It will also analyze the canoness' forms of inversion and subversion within both writers' prologues, focusing on the humility topos as understood in Classical times and medieval times. This thesis also will study the themes of female subjectivity and voice within the literary structures of disguise, marriage, and parental figures. Lastly, this dissertation will analyze the themes of female subjectivity and voice within Hrotsvit's dramas as compared to the hagiographical sources she used as her source material, in order to posit that the canoness not only openly challenged Terence, but also obliquely challenged the representation of women from the hagiographical literature.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The hexokinase family of enzymes catalyzes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of glucose to generate glucose 6-phosphate and ADP. Consistent with highly evolved catalysts, hexokinases I-III possess high apparent substrate affinities (low Km) as a result of specificity optimization. Hexokinase IV, commonly known as glucokinase (GCK), has a low apparent affinity for its physiological substrate glucose and is not significantly inhibited by the reaction product. Interestingly, it displays positively cooperative kinetic behavior while functioning exclusively as a monomer with a single glucose binding site. A lag in steady-state saturation curves places the inflection point in the range of physiological blood glucose levels, allowing activity to be highly tunable in this region. Fasting and fed states can therefore dictate the rate of glucose phosphorylation in the reaction that represents the rate-limiting factor of insulin release and glycogen synthesis. The most compelling evidence for the pivotal role of GCK in glucose homeostasis was the discovery of mutations in the glk gene that result in long-term glycemic complications. Established as a central regulator of blood glucose, efforts to target GCK in the treatment of diabetic disorders resulted in the development of glucokinase activators.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Small-molecule activators of GCK bind to an allosteric site and increase the enzyme's apparent affinity for glucose (K0.5). Effects on turnover (kcat) and cooperativity (Hill coefficient) can vary widely, and these differences have remained largely uninvestigated. Conflicting kinetic models have been proposed in the literature that disagree as to whether glucose binding is pre-requisite to activator association. Our kinetic activity assays, obtained via stopped-flow, suggest that activators can indeed associate with some population of GCK in the absence of glucose. To investigate the differing effects on turnover by activators, we performed viscosity variation assays. We found that the kcat of GCK is partly dependent on some diffusion-limited process, such as product release. In the presence of different activators, whose effects on turnover varied from unchanged to augmented 30%, we observed a significant change in dependence for just one of the three compounds tested. Compound A increased kcat by 10% and showed a nearly complete dependence upon solvent viscosity, suggesting that the activator functions by accelerating some preceding event that makes product release the determinant for turnover.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The precise in vivo regulation of GCK and the presence of its highly effective allosteric activation site have led some to speculate the existence of an endogenous activator. Such a molecule would likely provide a safe scaffold in the design of future GCK therapeutics. We tested a variety of biogenic compounds using linked-enzyme assays for activating properties. When these tests proved unsuccessful, we developed a methodology that would provide the ability to genetically select for activating cyclic peptides among a library of 106 unique members. We combined a proven genetic selection system devised in-house with a uniquely engineered plasmid construct that generates randomized cyclic peptides in vivo. The methodology was optimized to be sensitive to the presence of GCK activation. In addition, we describe alternative approaches and ongoing efforts on this front.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between early familial racial/ethnic socialization and the self-efficacy and academic achievement of African American children during the elementary years, and across the transition to middle school. In particular, the mediatory effects of self-efficacy were examined longitudinally. The Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Kindergarten class of 1998 - 1999 (ECLS-K) was used to examine the impact of kindergarteners' at-home exposure to racial/ethnic socialization on levels of school-related self-efficacy and academic achievement of the same children in fifth and eighth grades. African American students (N = 3224) from this nationally representative dataset were a part of this study. Albert Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory (also referred to as the Social Learning Theory) with particular focus on his conceptualization of Self-Efficacy, was used as a guiding framework for this study. Analyses were conducted using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Results showed that there was a significant and positive relationship between early childhood racial/ethnic socialization and the later academic achievement of pre-adolescent and adolescent African American school children in both fifth and eighth grades. However, the results also indicated that that self-efficacy had only minimal and insignificant mediating effects on the relationship between racial/ethnic socialization and academic achievement. The implications from these findings include impetus for marriage and family therapists and other practitioners and educators to include more family-centered and ethnically/racially relevant strategies and interventions to support families faced with school-based difficulties. Additional implications for therapists, educators, and researchers, were discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to provide initial documentation of the complexity of first grade teachers' oral and academic language during instruction and interaction with their students.  Oral language includes sounds, words, sentence structure, meaning, and the meaning of sentences and words.  Academic language, the language that is used in school, is more complex and specific than the oral language used in the home.  The findings of multiple studies suggest that children's early oral language may predict later reading comprehension achievement.  Children's oral language has also been correlated with the oral language of their primary caregivers.  Upon entry to school, teachers become primary caregivers and the oral language model that students experience daily. Yet, teachers' level of oral language during instruction and interaction with their students has not been documented until now.  In this mixed methods design study, I asked two questions. My first question was, What is the level of first grade teachers' language use in their classrooms?  Randomly selected language samples from four teachers were transcribed and analyzed using Systematic Analysis of Language Transcripts (SALT) software to code teachers' classroom language.  The variables used to document teachers' language level were syntax (mean length of utterance, MLU), vocabulary diversity (number of different words/total number of words, type/token ratio), and proportion of academic language words (words identified in kindergarten and first grade district curriculum maps as academic language words and Coxhead's [1998] Academic Word List).  Teachers' language was descriptively different for individual teachers.  The MLUs for teachers in time samples were 6.91 (SD=.8; T1), 6.04 (SD=66; T2), 6.59 (SD=.99; T3), and 6.62 (SD=1.22; T4).  The type/token ratios for teachers were .27 (SD=.04; T1) .34 (SD=.05; T2), .33 (SD=.05; T3), and .33 (SD=.05; T4).  The SALT database indicates that the MLU of a first grade student would be 6.9 (SD = 1.25) words.  The type/token ratio (word diversity) of a first grader would be .4 (SD = .09).  The percentages of K1 academic language words in time samples were 7.70% (T1), 7.29% (T2), 8.75% (T3), and 7.68% (T4).  The percent of words from Coxhead's (1998) Academic Word List in language samples for each teacher was below .10%.  Language samples were then standardized by taking the first 54 utterances (interquartile range) of each teacher's randomly selected language samples.  The combined mean of the MLU in standardized utterance samples of all teachers was 6.47 (SD = 2.00).  The type/token ratio in the combined standardized utterance samples of all teachers was .43 (SD = .05).  Statistically significant, positive correlations were found between number of different words and MLU for all teachers and all teachers combined in standardized utterance samples.  There were also statistically significant positive correlations between teachers' use of words from Coxhead's (1998) Academic Word List and MLU for three teachers and a weak, statistically significant correlation between MLU and Coxhead's (1998) Academic Word List words.  My second question used for triangulation asked, What are first grade teachers' perceptions of their role in the development of students' oral and academic language and of the supports and barriers to facilitating students' language development?  Interviews with each teacher elicited their perceptions of their oral and academic knowledge, the supports and barriers they experience when supporting their students' language development, and their professional development experiences.  Three of the teachers identified the need for more time as a barrier for supporting students' language growth, and the fourth teacher identified the need for her students to have more practice using language.  Statements made during their interviews, for the most part, matched with teachers' talk in their classrooms.  Suggestions for future research conducted with a larger, more representative sample may allow comparisons of language between teachers and across schools and demographics of the students.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This treatise examines the legacy of French horn player, Jean Devémy, who taught at the Paris Conservatory from 1967 to 1969.  Thirty-one pieces for horn by twenty-six composers were used during those years in the Concours de Prix, an annual competition for students.  Many of these pieces have been forgotten and deserve to be revived.  The first chapter of the treatise contains an introduction explaining the significance of the treatise.  Additionally, it includes information about the history of the horn in France and the Paris Conservatory Concours de Prix. The second chapter presents biographical information for Jean Devémy, and the third chapter examines his teaching.  The fourth chapter begins with an overview of the thirty-one pieces written for Devémy's classes and the twenty-six composers who wrote them.  It is followed by smaller sections about each piece and its composer.  The two appendices attached to this document are a discography of Jean Devémy's recordings and a chronological list of the morceaux de concours examined in this document, along with their respective ranges.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The large number of students who choose to leave the university before graduation has caused administrators to explore new ways to retain students.  Research indicates "only half (51%) of students who enrolled at four-year institutions in 1995-96 completed bachelor's degrees within six years at the institutions at which they started" (Kuh, Cruce, Shoup, Kinzie, &amp; Gonyea, 2008, p. 540).  Institutions of higher education are responding to these concerns by allocating significant resources specifically targeting first-year students focused on improving their experiences and outcomes (Jamelske, 2009).  Research indicates that over the last 35 years, thousands of institutions have created first-year programs with increased retention rates and persistence to graduation as the primary goal (Barefoot, 2000).  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between course content and graduation of students enrolled in the First-Year-Experience (FYE) program at Florida State University.  This study compared the three approaches to course content - academic, social, and mixed (both academic and social) - offered through the First-Year Experience program to determine which approach was associated with higher student graduation.  This study compared sections with similar course-related characteristics to minimize the influence of outside factors on the results.  Multiple class sections of the FYE program over a six-year timeframe were examined and comparisons drawn based on the course content.  Therefore, the educational significance of this study is to advance the existing body of knowledge and to improve instructional practices for First-Year Experience programs around the country.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH, MIM 251200) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that results from a loss of neural progenitors in the embryonic neocortex. Patients with MCPH have a significantly small brain and exhibit reduced cognition.  MCPH is a genetically heterogeneous disease involving mutations in thirteen genes, nine of which centrosome protein-coding genes, one of which is &lt;italic&gt;CDK5RAP2&lt;/italic&gt;. The centrosome is the major microtubule organizing center in all animal cells. While MCPH is a neural stem cell disease, the molecular mechanisms for the disease remains unknown. Proteomic analysis of a mutant in the &lt;italic&gt;Drosophila&lt;/italic&gt; &lt;italic&gt;CDK5RAP2&lt;/italic&gt; ortholog, &lt;italic&gt;centrosomin&lt;/italic&gt; (&lt;italic&gt;cnn&lt;/italic&gt;), we discovered proteins involved in intermediary metabolism, oxidative stress, and inherited Parkinson's disease that were post-translationally modified in mutant brains relative to wild type brains. These findings led us to discover that &lt;italic&gt;cnn&lt;/italic&gt; mutants have neurological defects, including poor locomotor and flight performance, and are less active. We further demonstrated that &lt;italic&gt;cnn&lt;/italic&gt; and &lt;italic&gt;Sas-4&lt;/italic&gt; (MCPH6/CPAP in human) mutant cells have elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, chronically activating the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) stress signaling pathway and thus activating FOXO by nuclear localization. The cause for these stress responses appears to be due to a severe deficiency in autophagy induction in MCPH mutant cells. Autophagy is a major catabolic pathway for the degradation of damaged proteins and organelles. Here we show that MCPH proteins are required for autophagy induction and act downstream of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase, a negative regulator of autophagy. Together these results demonstrate a novel function for MCPH genes in oxidative stress and regulating autophagy.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Over the past few decades, the smart grid technology has been developed rapidly due to its main features of more involvement of customers and abilities to accommodate all renewable energy and distributed storages. More importantly, it offers an improved reliability, power quality and self-healing capability. However, there are many problems and challenges associated the development of smart grid. For example, the economic dispatch problem (EDP) in a smart grid has become more complex and challenging due to special characteristics of smart grid. For example, one of the major characteristics of smart grids is plug-and-play due to its accommodation of distributed energy. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Economic dispatch is the short-term determination of the optimal output of a number of electricity generation facilities, to meet the system load, at the lowest possible cost, subject to transmission line loss and generation constraints. In short, EDP is an optimization problem and its aim is to reduce the total operation cost. Various mathematical and optimization methods have been developed to solve EDP in power systems. Most of the conventional methods collect global information and process commands in a centralized controller. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In a smart grid, it's expensive and unreliable for these conventional centralized methods to achieve a minimum cost when generating a certain amount of power within certain power constraints. There are several reasons why it's not suitable to use centralized methods for EDP in a smart grid. First of all, the centralized controller requires a high level of connectivity to collect all the information among power generators. A failure or error may impair the effectiveness of the centralized controller. Secondly, the topologies of the smart grid and the communication network are likely to be variable in a smart grid. Therefore, a small change in the smart grid may lead to reconfiguration of the centralized algorithm. Thirdly, the centralized controller is not able to accommodate the plug-and-play characteristic of smart grid. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this work, we propose a distributed controller based on consensus algorithm to solve the EDP in a smart grid. The consensus algorithm is based on graph theory in the area of communication. Compared with the centralized method, the distributed algorithm features advantages of less information requirement, robustness, and scalability. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In order to present a more practical scenario of EDP, a quadratic cost function and comprehensive constraints are assumed in the problem definition. It's assumed that the valve point effect of the generation unit is negligible. Different from the centralized approach, the proposed algorithm enables each generator to collect the mismatch between power demand and power generations in a distributed manner. The mismatch power is used as a feedback for each generator to adjust its power generation. In order to implement the consensus algorithm, the incremental cost of each generator is selected as the consensus quantity and will converge to a common value eventually. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Simulation results of different case studies are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Effect of power constraints, communication topology and generator dynamic on the convergence and iteration speed of proposed algorithm is also examined. These case studies are simulated and analyzed in Matlab/Simulink. The convergence speed and total generation cost of proposed algorithm are also compared with the conventional algorithms such as lambda iteration method and particle swarm optimization. The consensus algorithm has a better combined performance of convergence and total generation cost compared to lambda iteration method and particle swarm optimization. In order to validate the consensus algorithm, an IEEE 14 bus system with the proposed algorithm is established in PSCAD/EMTDC and verified by comparing with the analytical results.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The thesis presents and evaluates five new gravity constrained structural cross-sections about the Palos Verdes and Cabrillo faults of southern California. They both have been active since the Miocene, however the Palos Verdes fault zone is considered to be a greater seismic hazard. Using geologic, gravity and seismic data we present new interpretations about the geometry of the Palos Verdes and Cabrillo faults. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para> In the San Pedro and Los Angeles Harbor region approximately125 new gravity data were collected with a Worden gravimeter and new structural cross-sections were constructed by using data of our gravity surveying. The collected data displays  a Simple Bouguer gravity anomaly high near the Cabrillo fault and northwards toward the Palos Verdes fault there is an approximately 30 mGal decrease. The Palos Verdes fault itself is characterized by an inflection in the gravity data and a relatively flat zone immediately to the north. This shelf in the gravity data is important because the highly productive Wilmington Oil Field is located in this area and it is likely a product of the particular geometry in the region. The Palos Verdes fault also forms the edge of the larger Los Angeles Basin. Our basic interpretation is that the Palos Verdes and Cabrillo faults are primarily strike slip faults. However, a horst-like block between the two faults has been uplifted and horizontally shortened. Our main interpretation is that Catalina Schist basement uplift and subsequent basin fill to the north is responsible for the large negative gravity anomalies associated with the Palos Verdes fault.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>At low temperature (&lt;italic&gt;T&lt;italic&gt;) and weak magnetic field (&lt;italic&gt;B&lt;italic&gt;), two dimensional electron systems (2DES) can exhibit strong &lt;italic&gt;1/B&lt;italic&gt;-periodic resistance oscillations on application of sufficiently strong microwave radiation. These oscillations are known as microwave induced resistance oscillations (MIROs), MIROs appearing near cyclotron resonance (CR) and its harmonics involve single photon processes and are called integer MIROs while the oscillations near CR subharmonics require multiphoton processes and are called fractional MIROs. Similar strong &lt;italic&gt;1/B&lt;italic&gt; periodic resistance oscillations can occur due to strong dc current, and are known as Hall-field resistance oscillations (HIROs). Oscillations also occur for a combination of microwave radiation and strong dc current. In one prominent theory of MIROs, known as the displacement model , electrons make impurity-assisted transitions into higher or lower Landau levels by absorbing or emitting one or more (&lt;italic&gt;N&lt;italic&gt;) photons. In the presence of combined strong dc current and microwave radiation, electrons make transitions between Landau levels by absorbing or emitting photons followed by a space transition along the applied dc bias. The object of the dissertation is to explore how the different resistance oscillations are affected by strong microwave radiation when multiphoton processes are relevant. We used a coplanar waveguide (CPW) structure deposited on the sample, as opposed to simply placing the sample near the termination of a waveguide as is more the usual practice in this field. The CPW allows us to estimate the AC electric field (&lt;italic&gt;E_{AC}&lt;italic&gt;) at the sample. In much of the work presented in this thesis we find that higher $N$ processes supersede the competing lower &lt;italic&gt;N&lt;italic&gt; processes as microwave power is increased. We show this in the presence and in the absence of a strong dc electric field. Finally, we look at the temperature evolution of fractional MIROs to compare the origin of the fractional MIROs with that of integer MIROs.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This dissertation is mainly focused on the investigation of cathode in Li-air batteries using organic electrolyte and the development of high-rate rechargeable Li-air flow batteries.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A Li-air battery using organic electrolyte with an air electrode made with a mixture of carbon nanotube (CNT) and carbon nanofiber (CNF) is utilized to investigate the capacity limitation effects of cathode using a multiple-discharge method. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show that the discharge product mainly forms at the air side of cathode due to low oxygen solubility and diffusivity in the organic electrolyte. This inhomogeneous distribution of discharge product indicates that the Li-air cell falls short of the maximum capacity of air electrode. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) demonstrated that during discharge at high current density (1 mA/cm2) pore blocking is the major factor that limits capacity; however, during discharge at low current density (0.2 mA/cm2) both pore blocking and impedance rise contribute to the capacity limitation. It's been confirmed that cathode is the dominant limitation to the discharge capacity. Also, the gradient porosity structure of cathode is able to increase the capacity based on the weight of carbon, but the electrolyte loading needs to be optimized to achieve high energy density of cell.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A novel rechargeable Li-air flow battery is demonstrated. It consists of a lithium-ion conducting glass-ceramic membrane sandwiched by a Li-metal anode in organic electrolyte and a carbon nanofoam cathode through which oxygen-saturated aqueous electrolyte flows. It features a flow cell design in which aqueous electrolyte is bubbled with compressed air, and is continuously circulated between the cell and a storage reservoir to supply sufficient oxygen for high power output. It shows high rate capability (5 mA/cm&lt;super&gt;2&lt;/super&gt;) and renders a power density of 7.64 mW/cm&lt;super&gt;2&lt;/super&gt; at a constant discharge current density of 4 mA/cm&lt;super&gt;2&lt;/super&gt;. Adding RuO&lt;super&gt;2&lt;/super&gt; as a catalyst in the cathode, the battery showed a high round-trip efficiency (ca. 83%), with the overpotentials of 0.67 V between charge and discharge at a current of 1 mA/cm&lt;super&gt;2&lt;/super&gt;. A Li-air flow battery using graphite as anode is also demonstrated for several cycles.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism, this dissertation dissects molecular and biological functions of three proteins: Rootletin (Root), testis-specific Centrosomin (CnnT) and Spermitin (Sprn).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Centrosomes are the major microtubule-organizing centers (MTOCs) in animal cells and each one consists of a pair of centrioles, a mother and a daughter centriole, surrounded by the pericentriolar material (PCM). Centrosomes play critical roles in cell division, cell polarization and intracellular trafficking, etc. In some cell types, the mother centriole matures to organize the primary cilium that is important for cell signaling and sensory perception. Cilia are linked at their base to the cell body by a cytoskeletal structure called the rootlet, whose detailed functions remain largely unknown. We have identified a protein called Rootletin (Root) that localizes at the rootlet in ciliated neurons. Root is essential for normal neuron-specific behaviors of the flies, including locomotion, mechanosensation, chemosensation and hearing. Furthermore, ultrastructure studies revealed that Root is required for organizing the rootlet, and we found that rootlet assembly is centriole-dependent. Altogether, we will define the important role of Root in rootlet organization and its requirement for ciliary functions. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Mitochondria are energy centers in cells. In Drosophila, they also participate in sperm tail elongation by providing a structural platform for microtubule (MT) organization to support the elongating tail. Centrosomin (Cnn) has several variants, its centrosomal forms (CnnC) are essential for functional centrosomes. We discovered that the other non-centrosomal class of Cnn splice products (CnnT) is mainly expressed in fly testes. And unlike CnnC, which localizes at centrosomes, CnnT localizes to spermatid mitochondria (nebenkern). Cell culture and in vivo studies show that CnnT is necessary and sufficient to recruit MT-nucleating factors to nucleate MTs on mitochondria. Our study also suggested CnnT is required for normal sperm elongation and male fertility. Overall, we propose that CnnT promotes assembly of unique MTOCs on the surface of mitochondria where, in elongating sperm cells, it facilitates sperm tail growth.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the last chapter, we present our study on a novel testis-specific mitochondrial protein named Spermitin (Sprn). Using fluorescence microscopy, we found that Sprn is a mitochondrial protein localizing in the matrix of the spermatid nebenkern. However, Sprn is dispensable for normal sperm development and male fertility.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The central purpose of this thesis is to explore the behavior of the numerical solution of the Cold- Ion model with shock forming conditions in one and two dimensions. In the one dimensional case, a comparison between the numerical solution of the Vlasov equation is made. It is observed that the Cold-Ion model is no longer representative of the cold-ion limit of the Vlasov-Poisson equation when a spike forms in the solution. It was found that the lack of a spike in the solution of the Cold-Ion model does not necessarily mean that a bifurcation has not formed in the solution of the Vlasov-Poisson equation. It was also determined that the spike present in the solution of the one dimensional problem appears again in the two dimensional simulation. The findings presented in this thesis opens up the question of determining which initial and boundary conditions of the Cold-Ion model causes a shock to form in the solution.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The focus of this dissertation is to study the magnetic properties of several novel transition metal complexes, with particular emphasis on using SQUID magnetometry alongside electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and spectral simulations for accurate elucidation of the magnetic parameters: S (effective electron spin), g (Zeeman tensor), D and E (axial and rhombic zero-field splitting energies), and U (energy barrier of magnetization relaxation). The main goal was to examine structure-property relationships in order to search for the key features which give rise to large magnetic anisotropy, and to find new compounds which exhibit long-term remnant magnetization at a single molecule level, i.e. single molecule magnets (SMMs). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The compounds presented include four new mononuclear polyoxotungstate compounds with the formula [M(HXVW7O28)2]13&amp;#8722; (M = CrIII, FeIII, MnIII) (X = As/P). Although, these compounds contain a simple MIIIO6 octehedral core, they were found to exhibit unusually large zero-field splitting (ZFS) due to imposed molecular distortion from highly charged WVI and PV/AsV ions in the second coordination sphere of the MIII center. Also presented are four new coordinately unsaturated cyclic alkyl amine carbene compounds. Determination of the oxidation state of the metal center in these two and three-coordinate compounds ,which is vital in understanding their magnetic and chemical reactivity properties, was achieved. Additionally, slow magnetic relaxation, which is a distinctive feature of SMMs, was observed for the iron-based molecules. Lastly, the magnetic properties of three heterotrimetallic M2Cr(dpa)4Cl2  (M = Cr2, Mo2, W2) compounds (dpa = 2,2'-dipyridylamido) are presented. These S = 2 compounds also exhibit slow magnetic relaxation and show increased ZFS upon substitution of heavy ions into the linear trimetallic chain. Additionally, the ground state spin result is confirmed using molecular orbital analysis by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The reoccurring theme, which relates these very different compounds, is that each possess significantly large axial ZFS (D), an indispensible parameter for the development of spin technology devices. Although significant progress has been made in recent years to better understand the origin of D, so far, the conditions that determine the sign and value of D are not fully understood. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>SQUID magnetometry and variable-temperature-variable-frequency EPR were used to precisely measure D here, as these are the most reliable experimental sources for studying magnetic anisotropy in molecules with large D. Through detailed experimental and theoretical analysis, the origin and nature of ZFS, in the aforementioned compounds, is described herein. Thus, this dissertation represents a major effort to quantify D in transition metal complexes and to highlight the different factors which can lead to large values of the parameter. It is hoped that this dissertation may serve as a brief guideline for the ways in which future magnetically anisotropic materials can be developed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>At the turn of the 20th century, many American composers became engaged in what is now known as the Indianist Movement. The movement began following published musical transcriptions and cylinder recordings of Native Americans by American ethnologists. Numerous American composers were inspired by the melodic material and composed works such as symphonies, operas, choruses, string quartets, piano solos, and art songs from the Native American melodies. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	This treatise will provide a background on the Indianist Movement in terms of the chronology of development, the personnel involved, and the means of and reactions to Native American melody harmonization. An in depth study of the text and music from Arthur Farwell's Three Indian Songs, Op. 32, and Charles Wakefield Cadman's Four American Indian Songs, Op. 45, will highlight the compositional style and harmonic approach by two of the highest regarded Indianist Movement composers.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This paper examines the presence of death in contemporary, 1990-2013, award-winning picture books in the United States, Canada, England, and Australia. Literary awards nationally, and globally, recognize titles that are considered to be exemplary in their genre. These awards--the Caldecott from the United States, the Governor General's Award for English-Language Illustration, the Kate Greenaway Medal from the United Kingdom, and the Children's Book Council of Australia's Best Picture Book of the Year Award--are the most prestigious in their country of origin and greatly impact the economic value and visibility of each title, the global children's book market, and the careers of the winning author and illustrators. Although death education for young children is hotly debated, its importance cannot be understated. Given the continuing trend of research showing the benefits of death education for children there has been a remarkable lack of award-winning literature that depicts death, dying, and learning how to cope with the extreme feelings these events create. A larger presence of death in award-winning children's literature would provide an easy-to-find, and reference, guide of excellent books parents or other adults could give to children to teach them about death, healthy coping methods, and empathy.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>For many higher education institutions, alumni donations are the lifeblood of financial support. This is why so much time, effort, and resources are expended in an attempt to solicit donation funds from any given school's alumni base. Although motivation and ability to give vary drastically, there are certain elements which have proven to be reliably predictive of giving behavior. The stronger any individual identifies with an institution, the more likely is their donation.  Data were collected from the alumni of a Southeastern public university through a survey questionnaire gauging their motivations for giving, behavioral intent, and organizational identification. 3,663 alumni were contacted and 489 successfully completed the survey. As expected, identification was found to be statistically significant regarding donation behavior. Multiple facets of identification varied in respect to statistical significance between genders.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Disaster response and emergency preparedness procedures are predicted through an in-depth and unique understanding of planning, mitigation, response, and recovery efforts. It is also contingent on both emergency responders and those impacted by the disaster to comprehend the specific social and geographical challenges of their local environment. Higher education institutions must provide students with a safe and nurturing environment to help with academic and social development. With this increased emphasis on safety, it is imperative that higher education institutions understand their students' perceptions of disaster response and emergency preparedness efforts. This purpose of this study was to utilize transformational leadership theory as a way to explore students' perceptions of natural disaster plans and emergency preparedness efforts at a higher education institution. Qualitative interviews were conducted with students regarding their knowledge of natural disaster and emergency preparedness efforts and through qualitative analysis, 12 themes emerged. The results from this study suggest a disconnect between administrators and students with regards to the effective communication of natural disaster and emergency preparedness information. In conclusion, the unique characteristics of higher education institutions such as governance and structure create a need for the emphasis of emergency preparedness procedures such as preplanning, and mitigation efforts by leadership personnel. Transformational leadership, specifically individual consideration, intellectual stimulation, inspirational motivation and idealized influence, were examined as a possible framework for addressing the characteristics of higher education institutions that limit effective communication of emergency procedures.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>"Bonds of Empire: The Politics of Penal Colonies in the Founding of America and Australia," is a transnational study of convict transportation, a method of exile typically accompanied by forced servitude that existed in Britain's early modern empire. It explores the advent of a penal-settlement imperial ideology which was intended to solve both the domestic problem of petty crime, while simultaneously allowing the English (and later British) government to establish a foothold in places to which free settlers would not immigrate. "Bonds of Empire" reveals that this imperial ideology was almost universally a failure. After free settlers became important components of British colonies in both America and Australia, convict transportation turned into a serious point of contention between colonial governments concerned with their own moral purity and reputation, and the British government which cared more about punishing offenders and deterring crime at home. Ultimately, this study argues that the inherent contradiction which existed between penal colonies and free settler colonies, made Britain's penal-settlement ideology untenable as a method of empire building.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Different sources of uncertainties have been inevitably induced into the environmental modeling due to different reasons such as the variability in the future climate state, incomplete knowledge and complexity of the nature system, and randomness in the system properties. These uncertainties make the model predictions inherently uncertain, and uncertainty becomes an important obstacle in environmental modeling. This dissertation presents a general framework for purpose of uncertainty quantification and it provides quantitative measures for relative importance of different uncertain factors to model outputs. The framework includes two parts: uncertainty analysis which implements variance decomposition technique to decompose and quantify different types of input uncertainty sources (i.e., scenario, model and parametric uncertainties); global sensitivity analysis which develops a new set of variance-based global sensitivity indices for measuring importance of model parameters with considering multiple future climate scenarios and plausible models. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To demonstrate the usage and compatibility of the uncertainty quantification framework with different types of models, it was applied into two distinct cases: a synthetic groundwater reactive transport case and a barrier island morphological case. In the groundwater case, a Bayesian network integrated groundwater reactive transport model was built and studied for a synthetic case. Different uncertainty sources are described as uncertain nodes in the Bayesian network. All the nodes are characterized by multiple states, representing their uncertainty, in the form of continuous or discrete probability distributions that are propagated to the model endpoint, which is the spatial distribution of contaminant concentrations. In the barrier island case, a new Barrier Island Profile (BIP) model which simulates the barrier island cross-section morphological evolution was developed and studied. For a series of barrier island cross-sections derived from the characteristics of Santa Rosa Island, Florida, BIP was used to evaluate their responses to random storm events and five potential accelerated rates of sea-level rise projected over a century. Monte Carlo simulation is used to decompose and quantify the predictive uncertainties for uncertainty analysis of both cases. In the global sensitivity analysis, besides quasi-Monte Carlo simulation, sparse grid collocation method was also implemented to estimate the global sensitivity index to save the computational cost in the groundwater case. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The study of BIP model demonstrates that BIP is capable of simulating realistic patterns of barrier island profile evolution over the span of a century using relatively simple representations of time- and space-averaged processes with consideration of uncertainty of future climate impacts. The results of uncertainty quantification for both cases demonstrate different types of model input uncertainty sources and the relative importance of model parameters can be quantified using the developed uncertainty quantification framework. And the global sensitivity indices may vary substantially between different models and scenarios. Not considering the model and scenario uncertainties, may result biased identification of important model parameters. The framework will be very useful for environmental modelers to prioritize different uncertainties and optimize expanse of limited resources to more efficiently decrease predictive uncertainty. Although only two applications are demonstrated, this uncertainty quantification framework is mathematically general and it can be applied to a wider range of hydrologic and environmental problems.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The internationalization of academic institutions is a comprehensive approach to higher education that helps prepare students for professional work in the globally interconnected society of the twenty-first century. Previous research has indicated that university faculty members play an important role as educational leaders, motivators, and facilitators of knowledge, encouraging their students to be practically engaged in the process of learning an academic field from international perspectives. In this respect, leadership of study abroad creates a great deal of responsibility and faculty members handle the most pressures. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>       The purpose of this study was to understand the university faculty motivation to lead educational programs overseas today, providing a comprehensive view of various academic fields and faculty profiles. Two aspects have been explored: (1) the content of professors' attitudes and the goals they attempt to pursue by leading academic programs abroad, and (2) their level of self-determined motivation. Self-determination theory served as a conceptual framework for this study, guiding the investigation of self-motivation and self-determination of individual faculty. The research design of this study included quantitative and qualitative methods. I developed the survey to test the hypothesis that a high degree of self-determined motivation of university faculty positively predicts various indicators that stimulate professors to travel overseas with their students. I also conducted interviews to explore qualitative essentials of faculty motivations and their international academic experiences. Findings from this research support academic institutions and International Programs offices in predicting intentions of university faculty to lead educational programs abroad, preparing a new generation of globalized citizens. Implications for policy were discussed to enhance professors' interests towards active involvement in the process of academic internationalization.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to test whether or not increased self-esteem can protect against negative consequences of self-objectification. Specifically, a quasi-experimental design, utilizing self-esteem and self-objectification manipulation, was employed to test the extent to which self-esteem can serve as a buffer against negative emotions (e.g., shame), negative appearance evaluation, an appearance orientation, and decreased cognitive performance among males (&lt;italic&gt;n&lt;/italic&gt; = 138) and females (&lt;italic&gt;n&lt;/italic&gt; = 132). Participants (&lt;italic&gt;n&lt;/italic&gt; = 270) were physically active individuals with a mean age of 24.22 years (&lt;italic&gt;SD&lt;/italic&gt; = 8). State self-esteem was manipulated by providing false feedback about their facial appearance and having students write a short essay about their favorite or least favorite body parts. State self-objectification was manipulated by having participants wear tight or baggy clothes, while looking at themselves in a mirror. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Findings showed main effects for &lt;italic&gt;appearance evaluation&lt;/italic&gt; and &lt;italic&gt;appearance orientation&lt;/italic&gt;, such that females were more satisfied with their appearance than males, and males placed more importance on their physical appearance compared to females. Although none of the interaction effects for state self-objectification were significant, some approached statistical significance. The interactions for state self-objectification included (1) gender and self-esteem manipulation, and (2) gender and self-esteem manipulation and state self-objectification manipulation. Interaction effects of state shame and appearance evaluation of gender and self-objectification were also significant. Although the findings of the present study are mixed on many accounts, they present numerous venues for future research to examine the nature of self-objectification experiences within/between males and females.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>French choreographer Maurice Béjart used the third space in performance to fracture notions of fixed gender identity by removing it from facile and binary definitions.  Postcolonial theorist, Homi K. Bhabha, originated the concept of a contradictory and ambivalent third space in which new cultural identities may be constructed.  Using this concept, an analysis of Béjart's choreography will show how the choreographer exploited the fundamental ambiguity and instability inherent in gender performance in dance.  Third space uncertainty produced new possibilities of interpretation between the signifier of biological sex and the significance of gender identity in performance.  Much of Béjart's work bypassed ballet's rigid dichotomizing view of the sexes, which allotted an artificial lightness and refined delicacy in pointe work for women and exhibitions of spectacular jumps and strength in partnering for men.  Béjart redefined gender in dance by employing the indeterminacy of the third space to shift the boundaries between male and female gender identities which were ordinarily defined as contradictory opposites.  The choreographer's concentration on the male dancer destabilized gender boundaries in dance and challenged established cultural authorities.  Béjart's passage through the third space constitutes a generative interval for queer performativity.  The presumed distinctions between the two opposed genders were subsequently destabilized and deconstructed by the introduction of a third differentiation.  By his passage through the third space, Béjart transformed gender identity and incorporated the themes of gender instability and inclusiveness into a creative aesthetic.  Within the traditional performance framework of ballet, Béjart created fluid gender formations through the resignifying potential of the third space.  By his acquisition of "otherness," the performer participated in the formation of gender as a creative process.  Béjart's male dancer inhabited a third space of an "otherwise male."</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>When conservative politicians captured Washington in the 1980s and 1990s, they brought with them a style of rhetoric rooted in the South of the 1950s and 1960s. The three core elements of this Southern style are clear:</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>*	Strong beliefs -- firmly held, loudly proclaimed and adhered to at the risk of becoming dogmatic.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>*	Learning not to see -- a practiced avoidance of complications or distracting issues, an ability to turn a blind eye, to deny the obvious.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>*	Policing of the public square -- strict enforcement of the ruling beliefs, at times becoming a bullying of allies to keep them in line, paired with quick and sharp public attacks on dissenting opinions.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The Southern style is now an ingrained element of the conservative movement, and it operates with, and relies upon, active cooperation of the conservative press. This, too, has roots in the South. During the decades of civil rights activism, Southern newspapers instilled Southern ideology and allegiance among white readers, turned a blind eye to injustice and other weaknesses of Jim Crow culture and cleared the public square of dissenting opinions and alternative points of view. This study examines how the Southern style operated in the 1950s and 1960s, focusing on the work of journalists in Richmond, Virginia, Tallahassee, Florida, and Jackson, Mississippi, and on their interactions with political leaders, activists and the public.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The deployment of high flux magnetic processing in industry requires the ability to model the expected results of a proposed processing, and the current assumptions in the literature did not reflect the actual outcome in measurements of ductile iron. Simple binary iron-carbon alloys of less than one weight percent carbon were thermo-magnetically processed and then compared with Gibbs free energy phase transformation predictions. The data was used to quantify the change in the Gibbs free energy associated with the addition of a static high flux magnetic field, which is complicated by the change in magnetic response as the iron carbon alloys pass through the Curie point. A current common practice is to modify Gibbs free energy by -12J per mole per Tesla applied, as has been reported in the literature. This current prediction practice was employed in initial experiments for this work and the experimental data did not agree with these predicted values. This work suggests two specific influences that affect the model, chemistry and magnetic dipole changes. First, that the influence of alloying elements in the original chemistry, as the samples in the literature were a manganese alloy with 0.45 weight percent carbon, as well as not being precisely controlled for tramp elements that commonly occur in recycled material, created a change that was not predicted and therefore the temperatures were incorrect. Also, the phase transformation in a high flux magnetic field was measured to have a different response under warming versus cooling than the normal hysteresis under ambient magnetism. The change in Gibbs free energy for the binary alloys was calculated as -3J per mole per Tesla in warming, and -8J per mole per tesla in cooling. The change from these values to the -12J per mole per Tesla previously reported is attributed to the change in chemistry.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This work attributes the published increase in physical properties to the Hall-Petch relation as a result of the finer product phase nucleation created by the addition of a high flux magnetic field. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Additionally, a pure iron sample was analyzed and found to be unique, in that the transformation temperature decreased with the application of a static magnetic field, opposite to what occurs in the iron carbon alloys. While the presence of a two-phase field is a viable cause due to the chromium impurity content in the sample creating a dilute binary alloy versus a pure element, this effect could also be attributed to the high magnetic field increasing the number of state variables present.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The purpose of the current study was to test theories of student involvement and leadership development, examining the influence of mentor relationships on student leadership development outcomes.  The 2009 administration of an on-line survey through the MSL, a national study on college student socially responsible leadership capacity development, provided sufficient data for this study.  The literature review outlined the study's association with the conversations on student involvement, leadership development, and mentoring.  Several models served as conceptual and theoretical support anchoring the project in ongoing research.  The research design ensured strong methodology to support the study's research question: what does a match or mismatch of gender and race between student and mentor contribute to student leadership development?  Multiple regression analysis performed in three blocks provided estimates of the differential importance of each independent variable on the dependent variable.  The results of the study thereby provided the answer to the research question: differences in mentor dyad demography influence student leadership development uniquely.  Students in a mentor relationship with their self-identified most significant mentor gained more socially responsible leadership capacity when their mentor was a different race or different gender and race.  Higher education leadership can apply the knowledge gained to education practice and research.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The system of intellectual property is based on the fundamental proposition that creativity beneficial to the whole of society is best achieved through a limited monopoly grant for the creator.  The modern U.S. copyright regime, however, has made a mockery of that grant's limits.  This analysis tracks the case &lt;italic&gt;Aereo v. ABC et al&lt;/italic&gt; to illustrate the ease with which broadcasters can use copyright's broad language - e.g. the Transmit Clause - to snuff out potential competition.  This not only deprives the individual of products and services in the present, but it also forecloses avenues of innovation in the future - the exact opposite of intellectual property's stated intent.  To rectify this I propose three unique but interconnected remedies: an expanded, more robust copyright misuse doctrine, a safe harbor for local retransmission of broadcast signals, and compulsory Internet simulcast of the broadcast signal.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation examines the portrayal of autonomous girlhood in five young-adult (YA) novels that appropriate Shakespearean plots for twenty-first-century girl audiences: Caryl Cude Mullin's Rough Magic (2009), Lisa Klein's Lady Macbeth's Daughter and Ophelia (2009 and 2008), Lisa Fiedler's Romeo's Ex: Rosaline's Story (2006), and Mirjam Pressler's Shylock's Daughter (2001). It postulates that these novels are the postfeminist extension of a much earlier subgeneric trend--that of mass-produced, affordable Victorian-era didactic Shakespeares, the central purpose of which is to use Shakespeare's cultural capital in order to transmit messages regarding the nature of appropriate girlhood. This dissertation argues that that some analogously available and affordable YA novel adaptations of the twenty-first century, despite being postcolonial and postfeminist and therefore reacting against the squeaky-clean, traditional norms of their predecessors, put forward gender roles that are just as restrictive. Each chapter will cover one of Shakespeare's plays, a corresponding YA novel adaptation, and a related issue in contemporary American girl culture and/or feminist theory. The ultimate goals of such a transhistorical analysis are first: to determine what type(s) of girlhood the novels put forth as valid and why, and second: to evaluate the novels' brand(s) of didacticism in terms of what it offers to its target audience of adolescent girls. Overall, this dissertation argues that successful YA Shakespeares for girls should exhibit nuanced characterization and developed female community, ideally one that results in intergenerational feminisms.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>By utilizing passive and active methods of flow control, the aerodynamic performance of external and internal components can be greatly improved. Recently however, the benefits of applying active flow control methods to turbomachinery components for improved fuel efficiency, reduced engine size, and greater operational envelope has sparked a renewed interest in some of these flow control techniques. The more attractive of these, is active control in the form of jets in cross flow. With their ability to be turned on and off, as well as their negligible effect on drag when not being actuated, they are well suited for applications such as compressor and turbine blades, engine inlet diffusers, internal engine passages, and general external aerodynamics. This  study consists of two parts. The first is the application of active control on a low-pressure turbine (LPT) cascade to determine the effectiveness of microjet actuators on flow separation at relatively low speeds. The second study, motivated by the first, involves a parametric study on a more canonical model to examine the effects of various microjet parameters on the efficacy of separation control and to provide a better understanding of the relevant flow physics governing this control approach. With data obtained from velocity measurements across the wide parametric range, correlations for the growth of the counter-rotating vortex pairs generated by these actuators are deduced. From the information and models obtained throughout the study, basic suggestions for microjet actuator design are presented.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Cyclophilin A (CyPA) and its peptidyl-prolyl &lt;italic&gt;cis/trans&lt;/italic&gt; isomerase (PPIase) activity plays an essential role in hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication. Mounting evidence indicate nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) of HCV as the major target of CyPA. We have identified a dipeptide region in a conserved region of NS5A domain 2 (D316/Y317) that regulates dependence of HCV upon CyPA and sensitivity to cyclophilin inhibitors. We have systematically characterized all proline residues in the C-terminal region of NS5A with functional replication assays, providing a high-resolution mapping of the relative contribution of each proline towards modulating CyPA sensitivity. Additionally, we have used biochemical binding assays to map the precise regions and residues within NS5A that regulate recruitment of CyPA. These data indicate a conserved tandem CyPA-binding site flanking either side of the D316/Y317 motif. Next, we have used NMR spectroscopy to examine the structural features surrounding this motif and the implications of mutations that relieve CyPA dependence. These data indicate the mutations at D316/Y317 induce structural changes in the region which are sensitive to disruption by CyPA. A promising inhibitor of CyPA is currently in phase II clinical trials for the interferon-free treatment of HCV. These data enhance our understanding of the role CyPA plays in the HCV life cycle and therefore further our understanding of mechanism by which clinical CyPA inhibitors suppress HCV infection in patients.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The following dissertation presents the initial stages of the development of the new rollover safety assessment protocol developed for paratransit buses. Each year, the State of Florida purchases over 300 paratransit buses. In 2011, the purchased buses came with over 40 different floor/wheelbase/chassis configurations. Such variety of purchased vehicles gives the ordering agencies a flexibility of ordering vehicles optimized for desired purpose, but also creates a challenge for the rollover safety assessment procedures. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Currently, there are two standards available to be used for rollover crashworthiness assessment of buses, the FMVSS 220 standard and the UN-ECE Regulation 66. The FMVSS 220 is commonly used in the United States to evaluate rollover crashworthiness of wide variety of buses. Its quasi-static nature offers an attractive, easy to perform test that provides good repeatability of results. Nevertheless, due to the nature of applied load, this procedure may not be the best choice for evaluating the dynamic behavior of a bus during a rollover accident. In contrast, the UN-ECE Regulation 66 employs a full scale, dynamic rollover test to examine response of buses in rollover accidents. The dynamic rollover, which forms the basis of the ECE-R66 approval procedure closely resembles the real world rollover accident and this regulation has been adopted by over 40 countries in the world. However, the dynamic nature of this test makes it expensive, time consuming and difficult to perform.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This situation calls for an update of an approval procedure, in order to test the purchased buses within the available time and budget. The initial development of the new assessment protocol, the Equivalent Rollover Testing (ERT) procedure, was carried out in this dissertation. The ERT procedure is conceived as an alternative approval method for the experimental or virtual full scale rollover testing. The new protocol was developed based on collected experimental experience, extensive numerical studies and theoretical considerations. The ERT procedure establishes a set of experimental tests, on the components of bus structure, that if satisfied give a high level of confidence that the tested bus will pass the requirements of the ECE-R66 rollover procedure.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The proposed ERT procedure is further tested through the parametric studies on five detailed finite element models of paratransit buses. The models, developed in the Crashworthiness and Impact Analysis Laboratory (CIAL), cover a wide range of buses, from small 138 in to a large 255 in wheelbase configurations. Through the modifications of structural components of each of the buses, a set of 132 bus designs and corresponding 132 rollover tests was established. Each of the developed buses was also subjected to the provisions of the ERT procedure. The comparison of results showed that ERT procedure presents a conservative approach to paratransit bus safety evaluation. Out of all 132 test cases there was not a single bus that passed the provisions of the ERT procedure, but has failed the full scale ECE-R66 rollover test. The proposed ERT procedure, complemented by future validation experimental study presents a promising alternative for the paratransit bus rollover safety evaluation.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The effects of mesoscale (50-1000km) sea surface temperature (SST) variability on tropical cyclones (TCs) are investigated with model simulations of an idealized TC as well as simulations of Hurricane Igor (2010) using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Mesoscale SST gradients significantly modify the surface wind speed and direction leading to areas of enhanced divergence/convergence and curl along the gradient. This paper explores the effects that these interactions between mesoscale SST gradients and the atmosphere have on TCs.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In these idealized simulations it is shown that an SST gradient of similar scale to the idealized TC vortex produces asymmetry in the eyewall convection and leads to vertical misalignment of the vortex. Simulations of Igor are conducted with three different SST setups: a run with an unaltered SST field, a run with increased SST gradients, and a run with decreased SST gradients. Igor's intensity and structure is found to be sensitive to the three different SST setups but the specific mechanism could not be identified. It is found that the magnitude of moisture advection increases with increasing SST gradient magnitude on the warm side of a gradient.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The stereoelectronic control of reactivity provides a special, yet necessary challenge. Pericyclic reactions play an important role in the development of theoretical organic chemistry, and they enable many practical synthetic processes. Because bond-breaking and bond forming are closely coordinated in the TS, the reaction path of neutral pericyclic reactions does not involve radical, carbocationic, or carbanionic intermediates controllable by the usual choice of resonance patterns. This difficulty is well illustrated by the lack of reliable and convenient means of exerting electronic control over Huisgen dipolar cycloaddition reactions, e.g., the azide-alkyne cycloaddition.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Current strategies for accelerating azide-alkyne cycloadditions involve catalysis (CuAAC) and reactant destabilization (SPAAC). CuAAC is fast, selective and widely used, but the toxicity and redox properties of Cu render it unsuitable for important areas of chemical biology and nanotechnology. The SPAAC alternative results in a non-specific increase in reactivity that can be associated with poor stability and selectivity. It is clear that alkynes activated solely using reactant destabilization are getting close to the limits of practical utility. Provided within is a general strategy for transition state (TS) stabilization of the concerted pericyclic processes via carefully optimized electronic substituent effects.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Computational predictions are followed by experimental studies which benchmarked and validated the choice of theoretical methods. This work highlights two strategies for selective TS stabilization in catalyst-free azide-alkyne cycloadditions: hyperconjugation and H-bonding. When these strategies are combined and stereoelectronically optimized, the combination of these TS-stabilizing effects should lead to ~1 million fold acceleration. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Alkynyl crown ethers provide a scaffold for transition state stabilization, where propargylic C-O bonds within the macrocycle are constrained for hyperconjugative assistance. Preorganization of &amp;#963;-acceptors into the optimal arrangement for hyperconjugative interactions alleviates a portion of the entropic penalty for reaching the TS. Optimal alignment can be reinforced, and transition state stabilization can be further amplified, by binding positively charged ions to the crown ether core, highlighting the potential for applications in ion sensing. Future work into optimizing cavities that fully utilize stronger binding in the TS can provide an alternative strategy for TS stabilization, providing alkynes that can be activated by the presence of external stimuli.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>An important feature of the new approach is stereoelectronic amplification, which is achieved by optimal positioning of &amp;#963;-acceptors at the endocyclic bonds that are antiperiplanar to the breaking alkyne &amp;#960;-bonds. In strained alkynes, such hyperconjugative stabilization is present in the starting materials, relieving strain to provide stability, but becomes stronger in the TS, providing an accelerating effect overall.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Also described is a radical cascade that provides the first documented example for the control of chemical reactivity via selective transition state (TS) stabilization due to the through-bond (TB) interaction of non-bonding orbitals, providing a conceptually new approach for the control of radical reactivity.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The rarity of homolytic C-C scission results from the strength of this bond (~80 kcal/mol for the parent C-C bond in ethane). This transformation becomes thermodynamically favorable and kinetically accessible via careful design of radical leaving groups. The energetic penalty for breaking a strong &amp;#963;-bond can be compensated by gaining aromaticity in the product and by formation of a stabilized 2-center, 3-electron "half-bond" in the departing radical fragment.  These effects become important even at the relatively early stages of the reaction, providing selective transition state stabilization and effectively accelerating the fragmentation. The weakened &amp;#963;-bond is able to participate in highly stabilizing through-bond interactions between the initial radical adduct and the lone pair present in the incipient fragment, eliminating &gt;80% of  the energy cost for C-C bond cleavage. Such stereoelectronic design of radical leaving groups leads to a new and convenient route to Sn-functionalized aromatics.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The U.S. financial advisor industry seems to have all of the necessary ingredients for a classic lemons problem: an information asymmetry between advisor and client, frequent conflicts of interest between advisor compensation and client goals, and uncertain quality stemming from the many credence good features of financial products and advice. In this study, the first of two empirical investigations sets out to test whether voluntary advisor certification helps to mitigate this potential lemons problem. Using a unique dataset constructed from public registration records, certification appears successful in this mitigation role. Specifically, higher quality is evident among certified advisors who, after controlling for other observable characteristics, are estimated to have 30 percent lower rates of disclosure events per year of experience than their non-certified counterparts. It is argued that this quality segmentation is the result of an underlying signaling mechanism.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Current federal law imposes fiduciary liability upon financial advisors registered as investment adviser representatives (IARs.) However, despite offering similar services, this same liability standard is not applied to advisors who register as brokers. Many groups, including the U.S. Congress, express concern about how this fiduciary discrepancy creates negative consequences for broker clients. While well-defined consequences are often left unspecified, it is typically implied that brokers, owing fewer legal obligations to their clients, engage in more misconduct than IARs. The second empirical investigation of this study sets out to test whether this presumed misconduct is evident in higher rates of customer complaints. Despite popular concern, several methods of analysis are unable to find any statistically significant difference between the complaint rates of brokers and IARs. Instead, it appears that advisors with dual registration--a group that presumably accepts some fiduciary obligations--are the most likely to generate significantly higher complaint rates. This study proceeds to defend the use of customer complaints as an indirect measure of misconduct and describes several factors which might mitigate the effects of a fiduciary discrepancy.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>         This study examines state agency leadership and the viability of the traditional politics-administration dichotomy in state government. Despite all the academic theorizing about how appointed public managers should be involved in policy making, the ground truth is much different. Standing at the uncomfortable nexus of politics and administration, senior public managers face a difficult task of managing the political environment while simultaneously leading and managing their own organizations. In so doing, they face the most difficult and sensitive aspect of public sector leadership.  Powerful, politically-connected actors seek to influence public sector leaders and have policies formulated and executed in ways beneficial to them. This type of political influence can often have a significant impact on the decisions of these senior appointed officials.  This study examines how appointed state agency heads manage political influences to their leadership in the context of the politics-administration dichotomy.  The research explores how political influence impacts agency head leadership priorities and examines the strategies developed to accommodate those influences.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In 2011, President Obama called upon the education system to prepare students to be competitive in today's global workforce in order to regain the United States' position as the international leader in business, politics, and education. In response, colleges and universities have begun to internationalize their curriculum and introduce more cross-cultural experiences for students such as study abroad and international service learning programs.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>     The intention of this study was to understand how intercultural competence was developed in students participating in three international service projects approximately one and a half years after their return, understand students' attitudes about their experiences, and propose suggestions for program improvements into future planning. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para> 	Using a logic model as the conceptual framework for understanding program theory, this study addressed the following questions:</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>1.	To what extent are intercultural competence outcomes realized by students approximately one and a half years after their return from participating in one of UHP's three international service projects? </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>2.	What program elements facilitate or impede students' acquisition of intercultural competence?</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>3.	What program elements can be expanded upon or changed to improve the program? </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The study was conducted with mixed methods and incorporated both qualitative and quantitative data. Surveys were conducted using the Intercultural Effectiveness Scale (IES) and the Intercultural Sensitivity Inventory (ICSI), which were designed to identify students' intercultural competence outcomes. The IES measures three dimensions: continuous learning, interpersonal engagement, and hardiness. Based on the dimensions of the IES, interviews were completed with each student approximately one and a half years post-project trip. The two student program directors also participated in a separate, second interview process seeking input on proposed changes both for the organization and the future design of international service projects. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>     Sixteen students participated in one of UHP's three international service trips. Fifteen responded to the surveys and 14 made themselves available for an individual interview. Results were based on the subsequent analyses and triangulation of these data sources. The data showed all but one student scored in the `high' range of the IES. The interview responses supported these scores and showed that students developed not only intercultural competence through their experience on the trip, but other skills including project management and evaluation. The data collected via the Intercultural Sensitivity Inventory suggested that students appeared to be flexible and open, however, the scores on the adaptability section suggested participants' misunderstanding of the objective of the measurement tool itself. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>     Program elements which facilitated students' development of intercultural competence were identified. These included their involvement in the management of day-to-day activities while in-country, integration into the community and the culture, participation in community development activities, and extensive intercultural interactions. Because students were able to work and live alongside local community members, they seemed to gain a greater empathy for the culture and truly valued providing services to them. Survey data showed that students scored highest in the Interpersonal Engagement dimension, and this was supported by the interviews. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	A lack of planning was identified by many as a factor undermining the effectiveness of the program. All participants commented that they felt some of the elements were not planned well enough and that this had negative effects on the program outcomes. Although the change of plans seemed to upset students and distracted them from their goal of helping the host community, it all also gave them opportunities to develop other important skills like problem solving and team work. A number of important recommendations to enhance the program surfaced in the interviews,  including: having experienced directors stay with the program for a long period of time; pre-trip opportunities to learn more about the culture, the host country, and the work to be expected upon arrival; recording and passing on lessons learned, policies, and practices; recruiting students earlier for participation in projects; delegating some of the planning work to students; recruiting from a  greater range of academic disciplines; more pre-trip time to get to know other students; and having a liaison in the U.S. for the students abroad. The implementation of these recommendations will provide UHP with a stronger foundation and ensure a more sustainable organization. Overall, all participants found the experience to be life changing and expressed the desire to have more such organizations on campus. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Recommendations for future research include comparisons between a control group and the intervention group as well as comparisons within group from before, immediately after, and sometime after in order to understand the impact of the trip over time. It is also recommended that UHP conduct more internal evaluations so that they can compare data across years.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In food webs, which are composed of antagonistic species interactions (with negative component effects), predators frequently suppress herbivores and indirectly benefit plants via "trophic cascades". Yet, ecological webs commonly contain multiple types of species interactions. Mutualistic species interactions (with only positive component effects) are ubiquitous across ecosystems and often co-occur with antagonistic relationships. A mechanistic understanding of cascades in ecological webs with both mutualistic and antagonistic species interactions is largely lacking, especially for cascades across four trophic levels.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation focuses on how mutualistic interactions between predators and herbivores affect trophic cascades from fourth trophic level predators to plants. I used field experiments to evaluate the mechanisms leading to plant responses to predators in an ecological web that includes a mutualism between predacious ants and herbivorous treehopper insects. In this ecological web, ants have both mutualistic and antagonistic interactions with herbivores, resulting in a net effect of ants on plants that depends on the magnitude of positive and negative indirect pathways. These ant effects provide opportunities for testing the relative importance of antagonistic and mutualistic interspecific interactions for cascades. I tested the following predictions for cascades of effects on plants:</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>1) antagonistic interactions are more important than mutualistic interactions,</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>2) predators in the fourth trophic level will indirectly benefit plants, and</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>3) elevated nitrogen deposition will cause stronger effects from predators to plants.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Among studies that have evaluated the effects of mutualisms on tri-trophic cascades, paths of antagonistic effects were generally considered stronger than indirect effects including mutualism. To test this expectation, I first demonstrated that ants simultaneously had a positive effect on treehoppers, and a negative effect on beetles, resulting in less beetle damage to plants hosting the mutualism. Then I compared interaction strengths through the entire insect herbivore community on plants with and without ants. The ant's mutualism with treehoppers was the sole strong interaction contributing to the net indirect effect of ants on plants. Predation, herbivory, and facilitation were weak, and the net effect of ants was reduced plant reproduction. This net indirect effect was also partially due to behavioral changes of herbivores in the presence of ants. An additional treehopper manipulation showed that the treehopper's effect on ant foraging was largely responsible for the ant's net effect on plants; ant workers were nearly ten times as abundant on plants with mutualists and effects on other herbivores were similar to those in the ant-manipulation experiment. This study shows that mutualistic interactions can be strong relative to negative direct interspecific interactions, and can drive indirect ecological dynamics.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>I next asked whether a predator in the fourth trophic level indirectly benefits plants in this ecological web. Fourth trophic level predators consume lower-level predators, which can indirectly harm plants when herbivores are released from predator suppression. However, I found that black bears, which are predators of ants, were beneficial for plants. Plants near bear-damaged ant nests had greater reproduction than those near undamaged nests, due to weaker ant protection for herbivores, which allowed herbivore suppression by arthropod predators. These results suggest that bears and other predators should be managed with the understanding that they can influence primary producers through many paths.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Lastly, I asked whether low-level nitrogen (N) deposition alters the cascade from bears to plants. Widespread, low-level N deposition often enhances plant quality for herbivores and increases herbivory, but it is not known if this small anthropogenic nutrient enrichment affects trophic cascades. A previous study found that high levels of N enrichment caused this ant species to more strongly decrease beetle damage to plants; therefore I expected the indirect effect of bears on plants to become stronger under low-level N enrichment. I found that low-level N enrichment and bear damage to nearby ant nests had interacting effects on plants. The cascade was weak in N-enriched conditions because plants were more resistant to herbivores and predator effects were not stronger. This research indicates that cascades are currently being disrupted by N deposition.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Overall, my studies show that mutualistic species interactions can be influential for trophic cascades. These results highlight the need to integrate mutualisms into trophic cascade theory, which is based primarily on antagonistic relationships. Positive and negative species interactions frequently co-occur and may often have interdependent effects on ecological dynamics. Progress in community ecology may be greatly promoted by adopting a perspective that integrates multiple types of species interactions in the same ecological network.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Research based on the affective approach has established that political partisans' emotional responses to identity-threatening news content, particularly that of anxiety and anger, will affect their subsequent information seeking (e.g., Marcus et al., 2000; 	Arpan &amp; Nabi, 2011), although they did not agree upon the effect of anger. Some contend that anger will close off information seeking (Valentino et al., 2008), and some argue that anger will motivate more information seeking (Arpan &amp; Nabi, 2011). Based on the Hostile Media Effect and Lazarus' (1991) cognitive appraisal theory of emotion, the current study examined the role bias-induced emotions (anger and anxiety) play in mediating partisan information seeking preferences, as well as the roles that anger expression trait and issue novelty play in moderating partisans' emotional responses. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The current study involved an experiment including a 2 (Novel v. Familiar issues) X 3 (three different identity-threatening issues) design with a control condition (non-threatening) to explore the mediating role of anger and anxiety on subsequent information seeking preferences (identity-bolstering information, identity-threatening information, and neutral information), as well as moderating effects of anger expression and issue novelty. A total of 243 participants completed this study. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The results indicated three main findings. First, bias-induced anger, but not anxiety, motivated participants to want to read additional identity-threatening information. Second, surprisingly, only the interaction of anger-in expression and exposure to identity-threatening news articles affected the subsequent identity-threatening information seeking, which was contrary to the current study's proposition. The higher the anger-in expression trait, the stronger bias-induced anger's mediating effect. Third, perceived issue novelty did elicit greater anger and anxiety, and it also moderated bias-induced anger's effects on identity-threatening information seeking: the more perceived issue novelty, the stronger bias-induced anger's mediating effect. The findings have implications for the relationship between exposure to identity-threatening news and information seeking in a democratic society. Limitations and suggestions for future research were discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The trafficking of proteins between intracellular compartments must be tightly regulated in order to maintain cellular balance. Early secretion form the endoplasmic reticulum is mediated by a complex of five coat proteins forming the COPII coat. Genetic, biochemical, and structural studies have resulted in a model for the formation of COPII-coated vesicles. Early stages of COPII assembly involve activation of small guanosine triphosphatase protein Sar1 which cycles between two conformations based on its nucleotide state. Upon exchanging GDP for GTP, Sar1 exposes an amphipathic N-terminal &amp;#945;-helix which inserts into the outer leaflet of the ER membrane initiating curvature. This step is followed by the sequential assembly of Sec23/24 and Sec13/31 protein complexes forming a coat on the ER membrane that recruits and packages the cargo to be transported. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Nearly one third of the protein encoded by the mammalian genome are trafficked from the ER through the secretory pathway. Mutations in the COPII proteins lead to multiple diseases that are associated with the retention of cargo proteins at their site of synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum. Thus, the COPII machinery must adapted to transport highly heterogeneous sets of proteins in terms of their shapes, sizes, topology and final destinations. However, the mechanism by which this occurs remains largely unknown. Answering this question requires a deep understanding not only of the roles played by different COPII components in modulating lipid membrane curvature and in inducing vesicle scission, but also the interactions between cargo proteins and the COPII coat components. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this study I first addressed the role of Sar1 and GTP hydrolysis in membrane deformation and vesicle scission. Sar1 alone is found competent for vesicle scission in a manner that depends on the concentration of Sar1 molecules occupying the membrane. The mechanism by which this occurs involves the alignment of Sar1 molecules on low curvature membranes to form an extended lattice. The continuity of this lattice breaks down as the curvature locally increases. This correlation between Sar1 lattice formation and the degree of curvature implicates Sar1 organization in regulating membrane constriction prior to vesicle scission. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The smallest repeating unit constituting the ordered lattice is a Sar1 dimer. Therefore, similar to other membrane shaping proteins, Sar1 dimerization may be responsible for the formation of constrictive membrane curvature. Based on this, initial predictions suggested that directed mutagenesis of the sites of Sar1 dimerization will generate Sar1 mutants that are incapable of performing vesicle scission. We propose a model whereby Sar1 dimers assemble into ordered arrays to promote membrane constriction and COPII-directed vesicle scission. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the absence of membranes, valuable insights into the interactions of the COPII proteins in an assembled coat are derived from structural analysis using cryogenic electron microscopy. Therefore, understanding the requirements for COPII vesicle scission in vitro is also critical for generating a specimen of COPII-coated vesicles budded from ER-derived microsomes and suitable for further structural analysis.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The problem of comparisons of shape populations is present in many branches of science, including nano-manufacturing, medical imaging, particle analysis, fisheries, seed science, and computer vision. Researchers in these fields have traditionally characterized the profiles in these sets using combinations of scalar valued descriptor features, like aspect ratio or roughness, whose distributions are easy to compare using classical statistics. However, there is a desire in this community for a single comprehensive feature that uniquely defines these profiles. The shape of the profile itself is such a feature. Shape features have traditionally been studied as individuals, and comparing distributions underlying sets of shapes is challenging. Since the data comes in the form of samples from shape populations, we use kernel methods to estimate underlying shape densities. We then take a metric approach to define a proper distance, termed the Fisher-Rao distance, to quantify differences between any two densities. This distance can be used for clustering, classification and other types of statistical modeling; however, this dissertation focuses on comparing shape populations as a classical two-sample hypothesis test with populations characterized by respective probability densities on shape space. Since we are interested in the shapes of planar closed curves and the space of such curves is infinite dimensional, there are some theoretical issues in defining and estimating densities on this space. We therefore use a spherical multidimensional scaling algorithm to project shape distributions to the unit two-sphere, and this allows us to use a von Mises-Fisher kernel for density estimation. The estimated densities are then compared using the Fisher-Rao distance, which, in turn, is estimated using Monte Carlo methods. This distance estimate is used as a test statistic for the two-sample hypothesis test mentioned above. We use a bootstrap approach to perform the test and to evaluate population classification performance. We demonstrate these ideas using applications from industrial and chemical engineering.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to determine whether parents and guardians understand the specific benefits of a music-based early intervention program for their child's development, when given data documented through observational methods. Participants (N=15) for this study were parents or guardians of children 2 to 4 years of age who attended "Music Play" in Tallahassee, Florida. On-task behavior data was coded from the 4 video recordings of the children who attended with their parents/guardians. After receiving the documentation, the parents were asked to complete the post-survey measure. Data was obtained from 8 parents out of the original 15 who consented to participate. Results from this study confirm that children benefit from music-based instruction for early intervention and that parental perceptions are altered when documented group on-task behaviors are presented. Further research needs to be conducted to affirm these responses with a larger sample size. Overall, parents and guardians have a good understand of the benefits of music-based instruction for their young children.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this thesis was to develop the Gas Push-Pull Test (GPPT) for landfill cover soil applications to measure H2S oxidation. This thesis begins with an overview of solid waste management in the USA, and describes the alternatives for discarding and handling of solid waste. Also, discussions about the components that makeup a landfill to help resist the exposure of contaminants from the solid waste to the environment is elaborated upon. In addition, the ways in which landfill gas is generated by placing solid waste into landfills along with mitigation techniques to help attenuate H2S is discussed. Then the most suitable test to quantify in-situ rates of chemical or microbial reactions in the vadose zone or unsaturated zone which is the GPPT, is introduced.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>As a part of the development of the Gas Push-Pull Test (GPPT), chapter three presents a new methodology that allows for sound implementation of the GPPT in diverse subsurface environments such as a landfill to better understand the transport of gaseous components during the GPPT. For this to be accomplished, many GPPTs were run in fine sand and clayey fine sand with non-reactive gases methane (CH4) and sulfur hexaflouride (SF6) with molecular weights of 16.04 g/mol and 146.06 g/mol. With the data from the GPPTs, an equation or function called the correction factor was formulated to correct for the difference in molecular weights. The correction factor was applied to the GPPTs data and was successful in correcting CH4 and SF6 the non-reactive gases to have a molecular weight equal to the reactive gas Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) with a molecular weight of 34 g/mol. Now one does not have to search for a tracer with equal transport capabilities like the reactive gas, one need only apply the correction factor. Now you are able to account for how much reactive gas was lost because of transport through the cover soils and by reactions within the cover soils. Once the correction factor was applied, the reacted portion can be used to calculate oxidation or reaction rates of landfill cover soils which is shown in chapter four.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Also, to optimize H2S reduction in various soil types, it was important to be able to accurately quantify the reaction rate coefficient, k. Therefore, chapter four focuses on the use of lab and field techniques to examine reaction rates of H2S with fine sand, silty fine sand, clayey fine sand, compost and landfill cover soil. First, a series of laboratory flask experiments were conducted to assess the reaction rates of various soil types with no moisture, and then with varying water content from 10% to 60%. Next, the Gas Push-Pull Test (GPPT) was conducted in the field in different soil types to assess reaction rates. The laboratory results showed that the landfill cover soil had the highest reaction rate of 41.87 hr-1 when the soil had no moisture. Whereas compost had the highest reaction rate from 5.84 hr-1 to 9.98 hr-1 when moisture content increased from 10% to 60%, respectively. The laboratory results showed that lab-measured reaction rates of dry soils are strongly related to total iron content. For instance, the landfill cover soil had the highest reaction rate of 41.87 hr-1 with an iron content of 31,000 mg/kg of soil. On the other hand, fine sand had the lowest reaction rate of 1.47 hr-1 with an iron content of 100 mg/kg. The reaction rate with water was also measured to be 1.44 hr-1. It was noticed that water causes the reaction k to decrease for soils that had high k values with 0% water content. Whereby water causes the reaction k of compost to increase.  The GPPT well-mixed and plug-flow reactor models' reaction rates for fine sand ranged from 1.63 hr-1 to 3.02 hr-1 and from 0.45 to 2.02, respectively. The GPPT well-mixed and plug-flow reactor models reaction rates for clayey fine sand ranged from 63.80 hr-1 to 144.49 hr-1 and from 47.77 hr-1 to 74.08 hr-1, respectively. Lastly, the GPPT well-mixed and plug-flow reactor models reaction rate values for landfill cover soil ranged from 55.83 hr-1 to 318.18 hr-1 and from 32.69 hr-1 to 110.14 hr-1, respectively. Also, fine sand tested for reaction rates in the flask and with the GPPT was not significantly different because of the homogeneity of the soil. However, the clayey fine sand and landfill cover soil tested for reaction rates was significantly different because of the heterogeneity of the soils. Both the flask test and the GPPT are easy and convenient to perform, but the GPPT is the most reliable because it quantifies in-situ reaction rates.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Furthermore, to understand the attenuation of H2S, chapter five looks at lab and field scale studies that were conducted with potential landfill cover soils. For the laboratory experiment a rigid translucent plastic cylinder with a diameter of 5 1/2 inches and a height of 24 inches was constructed. The inside of the column from bottom to top was composed of a 2mm geotextile underlayment, a five-inch layer of course gravel, another two pieces of 2mm geotextile underlayment, twelve inches of 50-50 compost peat (by volume) mixture, and a six-inch air space. Then landfill gas (LFG) was injected into the column to assess the mitigation of H2S. After pumping 28,000 L of LFG was introduced into the column, which indicated the average instantaneous removal efficiency during the monitoring period was 85.7%. Also, the total mass of H2S introduced into the column was approximately 3.12g, the total mass emitted was 0.28g, and the total mass retained by the 1 foot soil mix was 2.84g. Therefore cumulative removal efficiency was 91%. In addition, to check for physical and chemical adsorption in the column, the saturated four-inch bottom layer of the soil mix was removed and tested for total sulfur. The sulfur adsorption capacity of the soil mixture was 2.2 g of total S per kg of dry mass of soil mix. The Michaelis-Menten kinetics parameters to understand the biological oxidation of H2S was determined to be Vmax of 450 nmol/s/kg of dry soil mix and a half saturation constant Km of 30 ppm.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Also, a field scale study was conducted by constructing three 65x35 lysimeter test pads at the Riverbend Landfill. The test pads were made up of a composition of local soil and compost. As of October 2014, the average removal efficiency of the test pads is 99%. Test pad II with 6 inches of local soil on the bottom and 12 inches of local soil on the top had the highest H2S removal efficiency of 100%. Whereby test pad I with 18 inches of local soil and test pad III with 6 inches of local soil, both had 99% H2S removal efficiency. Also, continual monitoring of the test pads will persist, because of the increase of LFG flow into the test pads by increasing the orifice plates to 1 inch. In addition, the total sulfur and iron content of the test pads will be examined especially since LFG is still being introduced to the test pads. Lastly the newly developed GPPT will be utilized to study the field scale H2S oxidation of each test pad.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation explores the role of food representation and identity in Hispanic cultural production as they participate in establishing resistant agency despite historical contexts of authoritarian oppression. Accordingly, I explore subjectivity through the lens of food studies as it is grounded in notions of difference and therefore allows us to establish understandings of self and other - both personal and political. Next, I use this relationship between food and subjective experience to demonstrate how - regardless of the details in which it is manifested - in each of the historical contexts, the end result of food representation is a politics of resistance which in some fashion challenges the authoritarian status-quo. This is a process that occurs within the text, among characters and often manifested through a challenging of gender roles. However, these works (and specifically their varied historical trajectories) also demonstrate that the language of food extends far beyond the text, participating in larger projects that challenge, undermine, and rewrite the ethical atrocities committed during each of these oppressive political regimes.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The novels and films included in this study were chosen to purposely span various geographical and historical time periods encompassing dictatorship, political transition, and those produced in democratic retrospect, which thus revisit an oppressive past in the Hispanic world. In chapter one, I explore food representation as it problematizes Puerto Rican identity in the face of United States imperialism in Luis Rafael Sa&amp;#769;nchez's Puerto Rican novel &lt;italic&gt;La Guaracha del Macho Camacho&lt;/italic&gt; (1976). In chapter two, I analyze gastropoetics in Margarita Engle's US-Cuban novel &lt;italic&gt;Singing to Cuba&lt;/italic&gt; (1993), as it establishes interconnectedness among the characters, which is juxtaposed with the ruptures created by Castro's communism. In chapter three, I investigate how culinary metaphor is used to rewrite Spain's history of Francoist oppression in Almudena Grandes' Spanish novel &lt;italic&gt;Ine&amp;#769;s y la alegri&amp;#769;a&lt;/italic&gt; (2010). Finally, this study concludes with an analysis of food representation in two films that depict the transition from authoritarianism to democracy: Manuel Gutie&amp;#769;rrez Arago&amp;#769;n's &lt;italic&gt;La mitad del cielo&lt;/italic&gt; (1986), a Spanish transitional piece, and Silvio Caiozzi's transitional film &lt;italic&gt;La luna en el espejo&lt;/italic&gt; (1990), produced under Chilean dictatorship.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this thesis, I examine how two activist groups--the Electronic Disturbance Theater and Anonymous--have transposed Thoreauvian Civil Disobedience for the virtual realm to explore how this shift of performance space also shifts traditional notions of performance.  I further consider how these &lt;italic&gt;hacktivists&lt;/italic&gt;, or hacker-activists, use the dynamic dimensions of cyberspace in a way that allows for interesting intersections of actors and spectators while calling attention to the ethical implications and sociopolitical impacts of their actions.  The thesis begins by situating technology in a brief timeline of non-violent activism, establishing the internet as a necessary and useful site of political resistance able to provoke and incite change.  Before turning to my objects of study, I take time to distinguish malicious hacking acts from sociopolitical hacktivism acts to highlight the moral and legal ambiguity between the two.  To then provide an example of early hacktivist methods, I discuss how the Electronic Disturbance Theater has used technology and the internet in their performances of resistance, the ramifications of their actions, and how hacktivism might evolve alongside the increasing sophistication and complexity of the internet.  Finally, I introduce the hacktivist collective known as Anonymous to explore how they have propelled and redefined online activism by incorporating simultaneous physical activism in their performances.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Clouds play an important role in the earth's energy budget, and changes in their properties can remarkably impact the amount of warming in response to greenhouse gas increases. In this study, we applied the Coupled Feedback Response Analysis Method (CFRAM) to estimate the contributions of cloud property changes to the magnitude of the annual mean-surface temperature response in a transient  simulation where CO2 increases at rate 1% yr-1 , using the NCAR Community Climate System Model, version 4 (CCSM4). To examine closely the contributions of changes in cloud properties to the annual mean-surface temperature, the full-cloud level is divided into three levels in terms of the cloud-top pressure (CTP). This study found that the annual and global mean-surface temperature response is a warming of (+0.175 oK) due to the net cloud feedback that comes mainly from the positive SW cloud feedback. The medium (400 &lt; CTP &lt; 700 mb) clouds changes are the dominant contributors (+0.175 oK) to the surface warming due to their magnificent positive SW cloud feedback (+0.33 oK). High (CTP &lt; 400 mb) clouds changes cause a weak negative contribution (-0.0218 oK) to the surface warming because of the close cancellation between their large negative SW and large positive LW high-cloud feedbacks. Low (CTP &gt; 700 mb) cloud changes are the least contributors to SW and LW cloud feedbacks (positive SW and negative LW); however, they still contribute positively (+0.0217 oK) to the net cloud feedback with an absolute magnitude that is almost equal to the contribution of the high-cloud changes. Furthermore, this study found that the annual mean-surface temperature increases in the Polar Regions (60o-90o in both hemispheres) are due to the positive LW cloud feedback from the changes in the three cloud levels, mostly due to positive LW medium-cloud feedback. However, the annual mean surface warming for the region covered between (60o S-60o N) is due to the positive SW low- and medium-cloud feedbacks.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The majority of college students do not read assigned academic materials. This becomes a problem, as long-term mastery and performance outcomes decrease when students merely memorize the material for a test. The goal of this randomized experimental study was to examine the effect of an instrumental statement (designed to help students see the value of reading an academic article by connecting the value of the article to their assumed future goal of graduation) on academic reading engagement (i.e., participants choosing to read an academic article and passing a comprehension quiz). Participants included 213 undergraduate students who were randomly assigned to either a treatment or control condition. Data were analyzed in a series of binary logistic regression analyses. The intervention was found to successfully predict academic reading engagement (p &lt; .05). Only participants with a high-connectedness score (of the four FTP constructs) were found to predict academic reading engagement (p = .001). Together the intervention and high-connectedness score are statistically significant (p &lt; .001) in predicting academic reading engagement. Practical implications are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Several recently published studies have demonstrated that employing planning strategies oriented on improving the internal characteristics of transit service, including frequency, coverage, intermodal integration, and seamless connectivity between all important trip attractors, positively influences ridership and productivity of multimodal bus and light rail transit systems. However, the research has not assessed overall economic outcomes of implementing these strategies, including social benefits and capital costs. Another emerging body of scholarship pointed to transit service contracting and consolidated regional governance as another possible strategy for improving transit feasibility. Again, not all economic aspects of these decisions have been evaluated thus far, and the available assessments of contracting and transit governance models do not consider long-term effects of specific organizational decisions.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study intends to fill these research gaps by investigating the influence of several internal and external transit performance factors on the amount of net benefits generated by 13 U.S. bus and light rail transit systems, observed annually during the 2001 - 2011 period. The evaluation starts with an estimation of net benefits (agency revenues plus non-direct social benefits minus operating and capital costs). Next, a panel regression model is employed to examine the statistical relationship between specific performance factors and the average net benefits generated by the case systems. The results of this study indicate that higher frequency, higher service density, higher ratio of contracted service and the presence of strong regional transit governance positively influence net benefits. The role of network decentralization (volume of service headed outside of the central business district) appears to be insignificant. These results bring additional evidence indicating the positive outcomes of certain internal transit planning strategies, which corresponds with the findings offered by previous research studies.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>As a central component of the sports industry, athletes are now playing roles far beyond what they do on the field of play, including making contributions to society as philanthropists. Many professional athletes from around the world have established their own philanthropic foundations. However, given that professional athletes are now under frequent media scrutiny because of their celebrity status and perceived financial standing--and particularly once there are scandals or transgressions involving those celebrity athletes--the media will likely attenuate to those incidents via their respective platforms. Subsequently, this mass mediation will likely affect the general public' perceptions towards their philanthropy foundations since these organizations are in direct link with these famous athletes. Therefore, the aim of this research is to shed some light on the ways in which the media frames athletes' transgressions as they relate to those athletes' philanthropic foundations. In order to achieve this purpose, a content analysis was utilized to study the media coverage of a specific case: Tiger Woods' adultery affairs with multiple women behind his wife's back in 2009. By identifying what the multi-media have suggested about the impacts Woods' infidelity scandal has on his Tiger Woods Foundation, this case study will assess the extent to which the foundation is implicated in media due to his personal controversies.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>approximately $32.5 each. There will be at least 14 of this style of part on the completed 32T</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>project. Thus the total cost for the project will be reduced from $21,000 to $455, a 98% cost</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Through testing of the material it was found to follow the common polymer</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>repeatable, and brittle in cryogenic environments.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The geometric tolerancing of the additive manufacturing process are, as expected</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>more precise than +/-0.25mm.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Before utilizing the material, there should be a few additional tests run on it to ensure it</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Composer Daniel Nelson (b. 1965) is a unique figure in the world of contemporary music. A dual citizen of the United States and Sweden, he received musical training in both countries and has had his music performed world-wide. Nelson's music is colorful, often rhythmic, neoclassical in formal construction, harmonically accessible, and  includes influences ranging from Mozart to Depeche Mode. Critics have extolled his music as "exuberant" with "magnificently mobile orchestration."  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Daniel Nelson's &lt;italic&gt;Clarinet Concerto&lt;/italic&gt; (2000) may be regarded as his professional breakthrough. The work was a success in Sweden and performed several times throughout Europe and in the United States. Clarinetist Niklas Andersson premiered and recorded the work in 2000 with the Västerås Sinfonietta. However, the work is still relatively unknown despite its superlative quality, accessibility, and promotion of the clarinet as a versatile instrument technically, stylistically, and emotively. This treatise provides information on all of the works in Nelson's catalogue as well as new pieces currently in production. In order to promote the &lt;italic&gt;Clarinet Concerto&lt;/italic&gt; and further aid it in securing a deserved position in the standard repertoire, this treatise includes a performer's guide. The guide not only provides detailed advice for clarinetists tackling the concerto, but also for collaborative pianists or orchestra conductors.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Violent tropical cyclones (TCs) continue to inflict serious impacts on national economies and welfare, but how they are responding to global warming has not been fully clarified. Here I construct an empirical framework that shows the observations supporting a strong link between rising global ocean warmth and increasing trade-off between TC intensity and frequency in the western North Pacific. Thermodynamic structure of the tropical western North Pacific with high global ocean warmth is characterized by convectively more unstable lower troposphere with greater heat and moisture, but this instability is simultaneously accompanied by anomalous high pressure in the middle and upper troposphere over the same region. Increasing trade-off level between TC intensity and frequency in a warmer year proves that this environment further inhibits the TC occurrences over the region, but TCs that form tend to discharge stored energy to upper troposphere with stronger intensities.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>By increasing the intensity threshold at higher levels we confirmed that the TC climate connection with global ocean warmth occurs throughout the strongest portion of TCs, and the environmental connection of the TC climate is more conspicuous in the extreme portion of TCs. Intensities at the strongest 10~% of the western North Pacific TCs are comparable to super typhoons on average, the increasing trade-off magnitude clearly suggests that super typhoons in a warmer year gets stronger. Conclusively, the negative collinear feature of the thermodynamics influences the portion of TCs at the highest intensities, and super typhoons are likely to become stronger at the expense of overall TC frequencies in a warmer world.  The consequence of this finding is that record-breaking TC intensities occur at the expense of overall TC frequencies under global warming. TC activity is understood as a variation which is independent of global warming, and could be assumed to be an internal variability having no trend. Frequency variation and super typhoon intensity variation are regarded as the addition of global warming influence on TC activity variation. The structure depicts how a previous intensity record is overtaken and frequency falls continuously in the global warming environment in a linear perspective. A peak TC activity year when global ocean warmth is the highest ever is likely to experience a record-breaking intensity. In the same way, the least number of annual TCs may appear when a lull of TC activity occurs in the warmest year.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Within RTI models, Tier 1 instruction represents an important foundation for the prevention and remediation of reading difficulties, but has largely been ignored in previous RTI research.  This study examined the amount, type, and quality of core reading instruction provided to fourth-grade struggling readers.  Further, this research sought to examine whether specific elements of Tier 1 and/or supplemental reading instruction received, predicted growth in fourth grade students' reading skills.  A total of 110 students, receiving school-based reading instruction in 22 classrooms, in four school districts located in two states/sites participated.  Tier 1 reading instruction was observed and coded for instructional dimensions, including reading components, grouping, and quality.  In general, reading comprehension and vocabulary were the most prevalent components of instruction, while limited time was allocated to word-level reading skills.  Several significant differences in time allocated to overall instruction and components of instruction were noted between sites.  Overall, there were few unique Tier 1 instructional predictors of student achievement at the end of the year, and the best predictor of student performance at the end of fourth grade was initial status in the fall.  Further, students receiving supplemental reading instruction outperformed those students receiving only Tier 1 on measures of oral reading fluency.  Implications for classroom instruction and future research are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Given the impressive growth and soaring popularity of watching live sporting events, sport organizations continue to search for ways to maintain or even improve this trend. Indeed, one significant and increasingly advocated approach--that of ensuring that sport organizations remain competitive and can sufficiently meet the demands of the sport marketplace--is a consumer-oriented paradigm. In the growing shift toward such a consumer-oriented paradigm, consumers are viewed as the most valuable assets for an organization. However, in the valuation of sport franchises, very little research has focused on or evaluated the asset value of sport consumers. Therefore, through this dissertation I conceptualize and endeavor to measure sport fan equity (SFE) in order to provide a better understanding of the evaluation of sport consumers. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A three-fold study was undertaken to validate the measurement of SFE, generate the overall SFE index, and examine the hypothesized relationships between key marketing drivers and SFE. In the first study, a first-order confirmatory factor analysis was employed to assess the overall factor structure and validity of the SFE model. Based on the results of the study, which was based on a sample of FSU Seminoles Baseball fans (119 = pilot test; 314 = main study), a seven-factor model consisting of (1) Customer Lifetime Value, (2) Positive Word of Mouth, (3) Learning, (4) Display of Team Affiliation, (5) Trust, (6) Commitment, and (7) Self-Connection was developed by the author. These seven factors were represented by financial, behavioral, and relationship-based components of SFE. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the second study, a Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) method was implemented to obtain a comprehensive index to evaluate the asset value of a sport consumer. Prior to the use of the SAW method, a Customer Lifetime Valuation (CLV) estimation method was employed to calculate the projected financial contribution of individual sport consumers. The average SFE of the FSU Seminole Baseball fans was estimated as 43.2 out of 100. The average SFE is the sum of the average scores of individual SFE components: financial value (8.5 out of 55.25), behavioral value (15.3 out of 22.37), and relationship value (19.4 out of 22.37). In the third study, a structural regression model, a two-step approach, was employed to examine the hypothesized relationships between key marketing drivers and SFE. The results from an empirical examination of the hypothesized model confirmed a positive and significant relationship between Value Equity and SFE, as well as between Relationship Equity and SFE, as reported in previous studies. However, Brand Equity was found to have a non-significant impact on SFE.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The asset value of sport consumers surveyed as part of this dissertation provided essential criteria for estimating overall sport franchise value from the consumer's perspective. In particular, the study provides a comprehensive/simultaneous measurement of customer profitability, behavioral contributions, and psychological commitment, all of which are vital to sport practitioners' more complete and applied understanding of how to better estimate the true value of sport consumers. The results of this dissertation further advance our knowledge of the overall mechanism of SFE and also provide more research opportunities to extend the SFE literature, thereby undergirding the knowledge of SFE in the field of sport management.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Children with special needs often have a tendency to be externally oriented because of their accumulated failure experiences. Accordingly, when children enjoy successful experiences through art making, they may be more likely to feel a sense of control and employ their own abilities The purpose of this study was to identify differences in the impact of two-dimensional (2D) versus three-dimensional (3D) art materials on LOC in South Korean elementary school children with special needs. This study compares the effects of 2D and 3D clay-based art materials in art therapy on LOC in special needs children in group art therapy in South Korea.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This mixed methods study employed a quantitative pre and post-test control group design with a qualitative component. 15 Children with special needs in a South Korean elementary school were divided into three groups using: (1) 2D art media only, (2) only 3D clay-based art media only, and (3) no artistic intervention. The two treatment groups underwent 10 sessions of art therapy. The age of the15 participants ranged from 7-12 years. The Stanford Preschool Internal-External Scale (Mischel, Zeiss, and Zeiss, 1974) was utilized for both the pre- and posttests. For qualitative data, observation, teacher interview, and art pieces were used. One-way ANOVA, Shapiro-Wilk Statistic, post hoc test (Student-Newman-Keuls, Duncan, and Keuky HSD test), paired samples test, and Wilcoxon singed rank test were used for quantitative analysis. Result of quantitative and qualitative data indicate that 2D group and 3D group both showed increased internal LOC score, however, 3D group showed more significant change when analyzed the data using Post-hoc test (SNK and Duncan). The result supported the use of clay-based 3D art media aimed special needs children group art therapy program</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this treatise is to analyze the Caprice Variations for Unaccompanied Violin (1970) by George Rochberg from a performer's perspective. The Caprice Variations amalgamates many historical compositional styles that require a performer's musical understanding and technical capabilities.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>     To provide insight into Rochberg's compositions, Chapter Two gives a biographical review of his life. Tragedy, such as his son's death, provoked his musical style to shift from an atonal to a tonal language. Emerging from this event in his life, Rochberg's work was strongly influenced by earlier composers.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>     This treatise will trace how Rochberg transformed music from influential composers into his modern compositions. The Caprice Variations include eleven quoting works from Beethoven, Brahms, Schubert, Mahler and Webern. The remaining forty non-quoting variations are arranged by musical style in Chapter One, Table 1.1. The table also includes a summary of the fifty-one variations and is organized with the following headings: Quoting and Non-quoting, Timing, Tempo Marking, Music Example, Techniques, and Performance Recommendations.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>     In summary, this treatise analyzes the Caprice Variations from a theoretical and a performance perspective. This treatise will offer interpretations based on the writer's experience as a violinist, providing students a valuable resource to study and perform Rochberg's work.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Transition metal oxides and chalcogenides have been the major focus of studies in condensed matter physics. The complexity of the system, involving spin and orbital effects, as well as lattice degree of freedom, makes them intriguing subjects not only because of these individual effects, but also the effects due to the interaction among them. In AB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; materials (A = Mn&lt;super&gt;2+&lt;/super&gt;, Co&lt;super&gt;2+&lt;/super&gt;, Fe&lt;super&gt;2+&lt;/super&gt;; B = V&lt;super&gt;3+&lt;/super&gt;, Cr&lt;super&gt;3+&lt;/super&gt;; X = O&lt;super&gt;2-&lt;/super&gt;, S&lt;super&gt;2-&lt;/super&gt;) which crystallize in spinel structure (space group F d -3 m), these effects and their interactions manifest in their transport properties, magnetic ordering, itinerant electron magnetism, structural distortion, and geometrical frustration effect due to the antiferromagnetically coupled B-sites. These effects are dependent on the distance between the interacting cations, which can be varied by chemical substitution or pressure. The main objective of this dissertation is to study the physical properties of Mott-insulator spinels in approaching their critical inter-cationic distances where an insulator-metal transition occurs. Studying the insulator-metal transition in Mott insulators is important in advancing our understanding, especially in the field of fundamental physics and materials engineering, on the intricate relationships between the transport and magnetic properties and the emergence of new behaviors that arise from such properties in these materials. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this dissertation, the behavior of the physical properties of Mn&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, AV&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (A = Cd, Mg, Zn), and the transport properties of FeCr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in approaching the insulator-metal transition are reported. Mn&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, AV&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and FeCr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; are chosen for this study due to their dominant V-V or Cr-Cr interactions, which are responsible for their transport properties. In Mn&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, the vanadium-vanadium distance is varied by means of chemical pressure (chemical substitution) to bring the system closer to the itinerant electron limit given by the critical V-V distance of 2.94 &amp;Aring;. In Mn&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, the structural distortion temperature and transport activation energy decreases with decreasing V-V distance, while the magnetic ordering temperature increases. The results of the transport and structural studies are in agreement with the critical V-V distance scenario of electronic delocalization.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Next, a comparative structural study on AV&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with non-magnetic A-site ions (A = Cd, Mg, Zn) and Mn&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is also reported. The study indicates that while the V-V interactions are dominant, the A-site ions and their magnetism produce a considerable effect on the passage from the localized to delocalized electron limit. This is proven by the two paths that emerge in the V-V distance dependence of the transport and structural properties where one path includes only the AV&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, whereas the other includes only Mn&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.     </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The transport property of FeCr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; under high pressure was also studied. Due to the t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt; electronic configuration of Cr&lt;super&gt;3+&lt;/super&gt;, the Cr-Cr interaction is also dominant. A high pressure measurement using a cubic anvil press up to 8 GPa was performed to induce an insulator-metal transition. The decrease in the Cr-Cr distance with increasing hydrostatic pressure was confirmed by x-ray diffraction measurements. The Bloch parameter of FeCr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; was found to be -2.4, which suggests that FeCr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; lies in the localized regime. The high pressure transport measurement on FeCr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; shows a decrease in the activation energy and an increase in the magnetic transition temperature with increasing hydrostatic pressure. An insulator to metal transition was observed at a pressure of 7.5 GPa with a possible onset at 7 GPa, at which the Cr-Cr distance is 3.44 &amp;Aring;.  In the case of Cr-oxides, it was predicted that the critical Cr-Cr distance is 2.84 &amp;Aring;, but it should be higher for a less electronegative anion. Therefore, the difference in the anion species is responsible for the difference of 0.6 &amp;Aring; between the critical Cr-Cr distance in oxides and the actual Cr-Cr distance where the insulator-metal transition occurs. The insulator-metal transition is followed by a structural transformation at P = 8 GPa.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Recent research using TF analysis has suggested that two processes underlie performance feedback event-related potentials (ERPs): a reward sensitive process in the delta range (delta-reward positivity; 0-3 Hz) and a loss sensitive process in the theta range (theta-feedback negativity; 3-7 Hz). In addition to being sensitive to gain outcomes, delta-RP appears to be sensitive to more complex reward context information, such as alternative outcomes and reward magnitude. The current study evaluated delta-RP with respect to reward history, a previously unassessed example of  reward context information. Reward history considers trial sequence context and the specific reward outcomes on previous trials, relative to the current trial. The current study assessed the extent to which delta-RP is not only sensitive to primary feedback (i.e. current outcome), but also reward history, Further, the current study evaluated whether theta-FN is best characterized as a loss sensitive index of primary feedback characteristics. A college sample (N=43) completed a common gambling task, while EEG data was recorded. TF-PCA was utilized to parse overlapping delta and theta activity during the the traditional time-domain FN-P300 period. Delta-RP was sensitive to both current trial reward feedback and more distal reward feedback. The current study determined that delta-RP linearly scaled with the amount of overall reward accumulated over the course of two trials. Theta-FN was primarily sensitive to the current trial outcome with greater activity in response to loss feedback. Further, analysis of behavioral correlates suggested that consecutive loss feedback resulted in a decrease in subsequent reaction time. Overall, results suggest that delta-RP may be a dynamic index of more complex reward information.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Eusocial insect societies are analogous to organisms in that the demography, development and regulation of workers within are shaped by selection acting on whole colony characteristics. Just as relative investment varies across the lifetime and reproductive cycle of a traditional organism, adaptive patterns of worker allocation are expected to vary with colony development and need across each annual cycle. Despite these predictions, adaptive patterns of labor allocation remain un-described for most social insect societies. This dissertation identifies a seasonal pattern of forager allocation in colonies of the Florida harvester ant (&lt;italic&gt;Pogonomyrmex badius&lt;italic&gt;) and describes its relationship to colony demography, size, reproduction, worker development rate, death rate, longevity, and neighborhood dynamics. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Aging &lt;italic&gt;P. badius&lt;italic&gt; workers progress through a sequence of interior labor roles before leaving the nest to forage. By marking and recapturing foragers, forager population size was estimated and foragers were identified as a discrete, age-correlated labor group that resides only in the top 12cm of nests that may be more than 200cm deep. Excavation and census of whole colonies revealed that foragers were present in a consistent ratio to the colony's larval population from May through August, but that forager allocation was not a response to larval presence.	</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Proportional allocation to foraging followed an annual pattern, shaped by the interaction of seasonal phases of colony growth and worker development rate. Forager allocation began in March or April and increased to a peak of approximately 40% of the colony in June, as colonies provisioned alates for mating flights in the days surrounding the summer solstice. In spring, proportion foraging increased due to an increase in forager number combined with a reduction in colony size. Beginning in late summer, proportional allocation to foraging decreased, as colonies grew through new worker birth and forager replacement declined. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	This annual pattern was shaped by a five-fold difference in the age of summer and autumn-born workers when they entered the forager population (43 vs. 200+ days). The chronological age of foragers was revealed by collecting whole colonies across two annual cycles, marking age cohorts with colored wire-belts, releasing each colony into a field nest created from melting buried ice chambers, then monitoring the forager population for the appearance of each marked cohort. Slow-developing workers, produced from late August until mid-October each year, dominated the forager population the following March through mid-July; while fast developing workers appeared in early June and developed rapidly to become foragers the following month, overlapping with their older sisters.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	While wild foragers of both types lived an average maximum of 27 days after entering the forager population, these same foragers were capable of surviving for hundreds of days in the laboratory.  Likewise, restricting the foraging range of wild foragers increased forager longevity by 57%, demonstrating that foraging carries mortality risks and the observed age at death was not part of a developmental program involving senescence in &lt;italic&gt;P. badius&lt;italic&gt;. By removing neighboring colonies, this study also showed that interactions with conspecific neighbors can influence the labor thresholds of individual workers, and the demographic structure of whole colonies, as neighbors account for 30% of forager mortality in the spring.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	At the colony level, increased forager longevity suppressed the movement of new workers into the forager population, increasing their time in earlier labor roles and promoting colony growth. In contrast, both removing 50% of the forager population and doubling the larval population did not induce forager replacement or increase the daily rate of new foragers added within seven days. Together, these results suggest a unidirectional control of labor allocation in &lt;italic&gt;P. badius&lt;italic&gt;, where the forager population size is not maintained by workers detecting colony need and filling vacancies, but by workers developing at a rate selected to allow forager replacement.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	 In essence, the annual cycle of forager allocation emerges as &lt;italic&gt;P. badius&lt;italic&gt; workers `age' into behavioral roles at environmentally appropriate times, in the same proportions, on nearly the same dates each year and experience a predictable death rate. This process allows colonies to divide a limited number of workers between competing functions without a leader.The findings of this study reinforce our understanding of the organism-like nature of social insect colonies.  Like cells in a body, the thousands of individual insects in a &lt;italic&gt;P. badius&lt;italic&gt; colony are organized into functional labor groups, which are responsive to cycles of growth, reproduction and dormancy through self-regulating processes. The emergence of measurable, colony-level traits from the accumulation of thousands of transient individuals, from multiple generations is one of the most striking feats of social organization across taxa.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Past research indicates that imagining contact with an outgroup member can reduce prejudice toward that outgroup (Miles &amp; Crisp, 2014). However, for people with few experiences with outgroup members, such as gay men and lesbians who are a numerically small outgroup, imagined contact may be difficult and less effective. The current work proposes imagining contact with famous gay men and lesbians may be one way of resolving these issues and improving the efficacy of imagined contact. In one online study (Study 1) and one lab study (Study 2) we tested the hypothesis that among heterosexuals, imagined contact with famous gay men and lesbians can be an effective means of improving responses toward gay men and lesbians compared to imagined contact with non-famous gay/lesbian individuals and famous heterosexuals. Results supported our predictions demonstrating that imagined contact with famous gay men and lesbians is associated with a more pleasant imagined interaction experience, reduced sexual prejudice, and fewer concerns about being misclassified as gay or lesbian.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Multivariate meta-analysis methods typically assume the dependence of effect sizes. One type of experimental-design study that generates dependent effect sizes is the multiple-endpoint study. While the generalized least squares (GLS) approach requires the sample covariance between outcomes within studies to deal with the dependence of the effect sizes, the univariate three-level approach does not require the sample covariance to analyze such multivariate effect-size data. Considering that it is rare that primary studies report the sample covariance, if the two approaches produce the same estimates and corresponding standard errors, the univariate three-level model approach could be an alternative to the GLS approach.   </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The main purpose of this dissertation was to compare these two approaches under the random-effects model for synthesizing standardized mean differences in multiple-endpoints experimental designs using a simulation study. Two data sets were generated under the random-effects model:  one set with two outcomes and the other set with five outcomes. The simulation study in this dissertation found that the univariate three-level model yielded the appropriate parameter estimates and their standard errors corresponding to those in the multivariate meta-analysis using the GLS approach.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint condition prevalent in older adults that causes pain, functional interference, affects mood, and contributes to use of scheduled as well as as- needed prn and extra over-the-counter (OTC) medication. Music, with imagery and relaxation, have been shown to impact pain perception and medication in this population, yet no studies have used a blended movement intervention with music, imagery, and relaxation, to assess movement-induced pain. Also, no studies have examined an intervention of this type within a one-week period.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Participants were women, between 73 and 95 (N=76), who were randomly placed in an experimental group or control group, alternatively assigned by pain level and blocked to account for multisite study facilitation. A modified visual analog scale (VAS) for pain and modified visual analog mood (VAMs) subscales of tense/relaxed (T/R), exhausted/energized (E/E), and sad/happy (S/H) were assessed immediately following movement. The functional interference from pain (via the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form) was assessed based on recall and medication usage was equated using the Medication Quantification Scale. The independent variable was a therapist-led daily session of blended movement intervention with music, imagery, and relaxation.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A series of Mann Whitney U tests revealed that there were no differences between groups on measures of movement-induced pain, mood, or functional interference. However, all measures but T/R trended towards improvement from pre to posttest scores for the experimental group. Movement-induced pain showed directional change in the experimental group compared to the control group at a level considered clinically important in prior research (Tubach et al., 2005). There was no difference in extra medication usage, but a Friedman repeated measures</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>analysis of variance showed there was a significant difference in the experimental group's total (scheduled plus prn/extra OTC) medication across time between pretest and average intervention day.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Results indicated that, overall a short-term, blended movement intervention with music, imagery, and relaxation appears to not provide analgesia for pain, or affect mood and functional interference in a statistically significant way. However, this intervention may be beneficial within one week and further investigation into applications for pain management, mood enhancement, functional interference, and medication in the OA and older adult population is indicated.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Research literature suggests that school leadership matters, and that their influence on student achievement is typically observed through indirect means.  Following suit, the purpose of this study was to gain an understanding of school leadership behaviors' association with school trust and teacher job satisfaction, in an effort to maximize student achievement.  Using varying survey data from Chicago Public Schools, I perform a series of linear regression analyses to explore these relationships:  First, the relationship school leadership has with school trust and teacher job satisfaction is investigated.  Second, the association school trust and teacher job satisfaction has on student achievement.  Finally, the magnitudes of the relationships school trust and teacher job satisfaction have on student achievement are compared.  The results reveal that school leadership behavior has a relationship with school trust and teacher job satisfaction, but that school trust and teacher job satisfaction do not have clear relationships with student achievement.  The study suggests that further investigation is conducted on the relationship school trust and teacher job satisfaction have on student achievement.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Rats display marked variability in their willingness to consume the artificial sweetener sucralose. Most rats are classified as sucralose avoiders (~75%; SA) while the remaining subset can be classified as sucralose preferrers (~25%; SP). Here, I have shown that these phenotypic differences in the consumption of sucralose are the result of highly consistent and robust behaviors and potentially represent a meaningful, physiological difference in sensory processing with functional consequences for diet choice and weight gain. Specifically, the emergence of a sucralose preference profile is stable across both sexes and at least two rat strains. Furthermore, utilizing an adaptation of the two-response taste discrimination psychophysical paradigm, I have demonstrated that the differences in the consumption of sucralose are sensory based. The taste quality of sucralose appears to be sufficient to split rats into their respective phenotypic groups. These sensory differences appear to generalize to other artificial sweeteners and stimuli with a putative, binary sweet-like and bitter-like taste profile as SA and SP differ in their intakes of concentrated saccharin solutions and quinine-adulterated sucrose in a manner consistent with their responses to sucralose. These sensory differences appear to be mediated by a disparity in the processing of `sweet' tastes. Immunohistochemical analysis of patterns of neuronal activation demonstrate that SA may perceive a more salient `bitter' percept from sucralose, most likely due to a reduced sensitivity to the `sweet'-like qualities of sucralose. Conversely, SP perceive identical concentrations of sucralose as a mixture of `sweet' and `bitter' with the most salient quality being that of a sucrose-like `sweet' taste; a sensory profile consistent with a number of other artificial sweeteners. These differences in sensory processing may be the result of a genetic mutation in one of the Tas1R genes that encode the two proteins that form the functional `sweet-taste' receptor. Evidence for such a conclusion is provided by the observed differential intake of sucralose and at least one other artificial sweetener, as well as differences in the avidity for sucrose solutions as assessed through brief-access licking tests. The demonstrated variation in sensory processing may play a central role in SP, relative to SA, failing to regulate caloric intake, and their subsequent increased propensity for weight gain, when given access to a highly palatable diet. As the increased availability to highly palatable, energy-dense foods has been identified as a contributing factor to the current obesity epidemic, these data may provide a direct, testable model for examining the influence of a `sweet-tooth' on diet choice and excessive weight gain.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The properties of proteins with reduced sequence complexity--either in the form of primary structure symmetry or restricted amino acid alphabets--are controversial.  Studies of protein biophysics and sequence analyses suggest that simplified proteins lack fundamental features of foldability and stability (generally considered to be prerequisites for functional protein structures). Conversely, models of protein emergence and evolution freely invoke simplified proteins and presume them to be stable, foldable, and structured.  To resolve this apparent contradiction, two model proteins with key features of sequence simplification were developed and their folding properties analyzed.  The first model protein is characterized by a symmetric sequence and is derived from the folding nucleus of a human protein, fibroblast growth factor-1.  The second model protein, which also has a symmetric sequence, is greatly enriched for the amino acids that were present at the origin of life.  Studies of the stability, folding, and structure of these model proteins suggest that (1) the folding nucleus is a key element of protein evolution and design, (2) symmetric sequences are compatible with protein folding, and can confer robustness to structural reengagements that facilitate protein structure evolution, and (3) the amino acid diversity present on the early earth was likely sufficient to encode complex protein architecture, especially within a halophile environment.  In total, the data presented here support a crucial role for proteins with sequence symmetry or amino acid alphabet simplification in key biological processes.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The contemporary National Football League (NFL) now sits atop the zenith of American sport business, with unmatched economic growth and popularity. Its success can be measured in terms of revenues, in high television ratings, and in live attendance for its games each week. This dissertation looks into the extent to which the NFL's success--in maintaining a marketable brand image and spectacular corporeal commodity form--is attributable to its distinctive three-pronged system of player governance and punishment: mechanisms for the adjudication of off-field player behavior; mechanisms for the adjudication of on-field player behavior; and mechanisms for the adjudication of player use of proscribed substances. This study will incorporate juridical policy analysis to understand the mechanisms through which such punishment is enacted and enforced, and Foucauldian discourse analysis to disciplinary power imbedded within, and activated by, popular governance rhetoric. It is concluded herein that the NFL's success is attributed to a paradox of liberal economic governance--cartel-structured laissez-faire economic relations--and authoritarian governance of labor activity (on and off the field).</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The BaLn(sub)2(/sub)O(sub)4(/sub) family has been synthesized successfully as single crystals by the flux-growth method.  The phases crystallize in the CaV(sub)2(/sub)O(sub)4(/sub) structure prototype in space group Pnma (# 62).  The structure has been studied using single-crystal x-ray diffraction, and stoichiometry confirmed with EDS, and the unit cell parameters and atomic positions have been determined for the whole lanthanide series (with the exception of the Lu compound).  The effects of the lanthanide ionic radius on the atomic positions in the unit cell has been studied in terms of fractional atomic coordinates, bond lengths and angles, and bond valence sums.  Magnetic measurements have been performed on the series with the exception of the La, Eu, and Lu members in the form of susceptibility versus temperature.  The crystals all show signs of geometric antiferromagnetic frustration with the Néel temperatures significantly below the temperature predicted by the Weiss constant.  Additionally some members of the family, namely BaCe(sub)2(/sub)O(sub)4(/sub), BaNd(sub)2(/sub)O(sub)4(/sub), BaPr(sub)2(/sub)O(sub)4(/sub), BaSm(sub)2(/sub)O(sub)4(/sub), BaTb(sub)2(/sub)O(sub)4(/sub), and BaYb(sub)2(/sub)O(sub)4(/sub) show significant crystal field splitting, that causes deviation from Currie-Weiss behavior</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This evaluation assessed the Curving Cliffs Program (a pseudonym) and how well it reflected the framework for Effective Everyday Practice Supporting School Readiness for All Children in the domain of pre-literacy. The program was a national school readiness program that was designed to provide services in the form of education, nutrition, and health to low-income families, children, and prenatal women. Families were required to meet Federal Poverty Levels to qualify for the program. This program was important because it provided skill development and interventions for children who may be at risk for learning and skill development in later years. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The program's central office was located in the southeastern region and served three counties. All six centers were designed to offer children opportunities to learn and to aid in skill development. Centers were designed to provide children with structured environments that promote pre-literacy development. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to explore pre-literacy practices in Curving Cliffs and assess their alignment with best practices necessary for school readiness. Specifically, six centers were explored to ascertain pre-literacy practices that were used to promote school readiness in the domain of pre-literacy. Data were collected using document reviews, observational data, and semi-structured interviews. Center directors and the Education Coordinator were interviewed to collect data to better understand pre-literacy practices that were used to prepare children for kindergarten.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The study documented key information pertaining to practices used in all six centers to promote pre-literacy. Respondents explained activities that were used at their centers to promote pre-literacy, curriculum used to promote pre-literacy, as well as how environments were structured, tools used to analyze pre-literacy development, and challenges with promoting pre-literacy. The findings showed that program practices aligned with the framework for  Effective Everyday Practice Supporting School Readiness for All Children promoted by the federal government and developed by a consortia of research universities.  However, the study also indicated that there were some variations in pre-literacy practices and resources across the centers.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Determining the equivalence or non-inferiority of a new drug (test drug) with a existing treatment (reference drug) is an important topic of statistical interest. Wellek (1993) pioneered the way for log-rank based equivalence and non-inferiority testing by formulating a testing procedure using proportional hazards model (PHM) of Cox (1972). In many equivalence and non-inferiority trials, two hazards functions may converge to one rather than being proportional for all time-points. In this case, the proportional odds survival model (POSM) of Bennett (1983) will be more sufficient than a Cox's PHM assumption. We show in both cases, when the wrong modeling assumption is made and Cox's PH assumption is violated, the popular procedure of Wellek (1993) has an inflated type I error. On the contrary, our proposed POS model based equivalence and non-inferiority tests maintains the practitioners desired 5% level of significance regardless of the underlying modeling assumption (e.g. Cox,1972; Wellek, 1993). Furthermore for non-inferiority trials, we introduce a method to determine the optimal sample size required when a desired power and type I error is specified and the data follows the POSM of Bennett (1983). For both of the above trials, we present simulation studies showing the finite approximation of powers and type I error rates, when the under-lying modeling assumption are correctly specified and when the assumptions are misspecified.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>ABSTRACT </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Endometriosis, defined by ectopic growths of uterine tissue, is considered an enigma because it is unknown how or even if these abnormal growths contribute to the painful conditions including dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and chronic pelvic pain that often accompany the disease.  Many clinicians and biomedical scientists assume that the amount of ectopic growth (cysts) predicts the presence or severity of pain symptoms, even though considerable evidence suggests that this assumption is unwarranted. Studies from our laboratory using a rat model of surgically-induced endometriosis (ENDO) demonstrated for the first time that the cysts develop a sensory and sympathetic nerve supply. This discovery gave rise to the hypothesis that this &lt;bold&gt;&lt;italic&gt;newly-sprouted innervation of the cysts is a significant contributor to the development (i.e., generation) and maintenance of painful symptoms. One of these common symptoms, studied here, is vaginal hyperalgesia&lt;/italic&gt;&lt;/bold&gt; (often called dyspareunia in women).   The purpose of this dissertation was to use a combination of immunohistochemical, physiological, and behavioral methods to test various aspects of this hypothesis.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the first study, the developmental time course of cyst innervation (sensory and sympathetic) and ENDO-induced vaginal hyperalgesia was examined over a 10 week period post-ENDO.  It was found that rudimentary innervation &lt;bold&gt;appears&lt;/bold&gt; within the cysts at 2 weeks post-ENDO, and becomes &lt;bold&gt;active&lt;/bold&gt; at 3 weeks post-ENDO. Between 4 and 5 weeks post-ENDO, vaginal hyperalgesia becomes significant, but is highly variable as the innervation increases and approaches maturity. By 8 to 10 weeks post-ENDO the cyst innervation and hyperalgesia have both matured completely, plateaued and stabilized.  Based on these findings, the developmental timeline was divided into three phases: &lt;italic&gt;INITIAL&lt;/italic&gt; (1-2 weeks post-ENDO), &lt;italic&gt;TRANSITIONAL&lt;/italic&gt; (4-6 weeks post-ENDO), and &lt;italic&gt;ESTABLISHED&lt;/italic&gt; (8-10 weeks post-ENDO).  In each phase, characteristics of the cyst innervation and vaginal hyperalgesia were found to be as follows: &lt;italic&gt;INITIAL&lt;/italic&gt;, no innervation and no vaginal hyperalgesia; &lt;italic&gt;TRANSITIONAL&lt;/italic&gt;, &lt;bold&gt;immature&lt;/bold&gt; but &lt;bold&gt;active&lt;/bold&gt; innervation and significant but highly variable hyperalgesia; &lt;italic&gt;ESTABLISHED&lt;/italic&gt;, &lt;bold&gt;mature&lt;/bold&gt; innervation and stabilized hyperalgesia both of which varied with the estrous cycle.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Then, in each of the three phases, the contribution of the cysts (and their innervation) to ENDO-induced vaginal hyperalgesia was tested, by removing the cysts and assessing the effect on the development and maintenance of the vaginal hyperalgesia.  In the &lt;italic&gt;TRANSITIONAL&lt;/italic&gt; phase, the relationship between the severity of ENDO-induced vaginal hyperalgesia and the innervation of the cysts, eutopic uterus, and vaginal canal was also assessed.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The effect of cyst removal on ENDO-induced vaginal hyperalgesia in the &lt;italic&gt;INITIAL&lt;/italic&gt; phase &lt;bold&gt;prevented&lt;/bold&gt; the development of vaginal hyperalgesia. In the &lt;italic&gt;TRANSITIONAL&lt;/italic&gt;  phase, cyst removal did not significantly &lt;bold&gt;alleviate&lt;/bold&gt; the vaginal hyperalgesia developed prior to cyst-removal, but, &lt;bold&gt;prevented&lt;/bold&gt; its future development. In the &lt;italic&gt;ESTABLISHED&lt;/italic&gt; phase, cyst removal completely &lt;bold&gt;alleviated&lt;/bold&gt; the vaginal hyperalgesia.  Further, in the &lt;italic&gt;TRANSITIONAL&lt;/italic&gt; phase, innervation of the cysts (sensory and sympathetic) and innervation of the vaginal canal (sympathetic only) significantly correlated with severity of ENDO-induced vaginal hyperalgesia.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Overall, results from these studies strongly support the general hypothesis that the innervation of the cysts contributes to ENDO-induced vaginal hyperalgesia.  Specifically, the cyst innervation likely contributes to the development, severity, and maintenance of ENDO-vaginal hyperalgesia. Importantly however, the varying effects of cyst removal suggest that mechanisms by which the innervation operates to contribute to the vaginal hyperalgesia change during its progression through the three phases from peripheral sensitization to peripherally-independent then peripherally-dependent, hormonally-modulated central sensitization.  Thus changes, which emerge most clearly in the &lt;italic&gt;TRANSITIONAL&lt;/italic&gt;  phase, could help explain the poorly-understood, clinically-challenging issue on how pain transitions from an acute to a chronic problem, not only in endometriosis but also in other chronic pain conditions.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>With tourism serving as its principal industry by the end of WWII, Florida had solidified itself as the preeminent leisure paradise among America's mainstream destinations. Dubbed the "Magic City," Miami was the most popular retreat for the financially affluent and social elite. But Florida was neither magical nor paradise for thousands of colored residents who lived in the country's southernmost state, nor its Negro tourists whose desires to vacation on the warm Peninsula were overcast by segregation and discrimination that touched every facet of black life. The Miami Times, a black-owned and operated newspaper established in 1923, used its editorial and publishing power to expose the façade of Florida's "Magic City" as a welcoming tropical haven. Founded by Bahamian-born H.E.S. Reeves who ran the newspaper with his son Garth C. Reeves Sr., the Miami Times financially and editorially supported efforts to desegregate Miami schools, beaches, residential communities, public transportation systems and sports complexes. In 1948, Miami Times' management took a strategic role in the effort to destroy the racially discriminating policy that governed the city's municipal golf course. This dissertation helps inject the Miami Times into the historical narrative of the civil rights movement in Florida. This case study illuminates its activism between 1948 and 1958 by highlighting the weekly's effort to help abolish the "Monday-only" policy that restricted black golfers to a singular day of access to the Miami Springs municipal golf course. Support of the legal challenge is but one example that demonstrates how the newspaper, as an agent of change, worked with other Miami community leaders to improve conditions for the city's black population. The newspaper's support of the fight to integrate the city's golf course is evidence of its value as a conduit of social and political change in Miami and the state of Florida.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Copper transporting ATPase (Cu-ATPase) is a member of the P1B-subfamily of P-type ATPases, which catalyzes ATP-dependent copper delivery across cellular membranes. The energy derived from ATP is used in the active transport of Cu+ against a concentration gradient across the membrane. During this process, an invariant aspartate residue is auto-phosphorylated and dephosphorylated. Cu-ATPase shares the same type of basic architecture with other P-type ATPases, such as Ca2+-ATPase of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (SERCA). This family of ATPases all possesses three cytoplasmic domains that are the nucleotide-binding (N) domain, the phosphorylation (P) domain, and the actuator (A) domain, as well as the transmembrane domain. Cu-ATPase differs from SERCA by having one or several N-terminal metal-binding domains.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Here, NMR is used to characterize the in solution structure and dynamics of the N and P domains (A387-N675, 31 kDa) of Archaeoglobus fulgidus CopA (CopA_NPwt). Our NMR results suggest that the P domain of CopA_NPwt is undergoing conformational exchange in both the apo and the AMPPCP bound state. Disulfide linking of the N and C terminal helices of CopA_NPwt helps stabilize the P domain resulting in a more organized state (CopA_NPss). CopA_NPss is generally very rigid in both N and P domains on the fast timescale, with the exception of a few flexible loops. The inter-domain orientation of CopA_NPss was determined by using residual dipolar couplings, which report the average population in solution. The N and P domains close up upon AMPPCP binding, which results in a highly compact conformation in the transition state, until phosphorylation occurs that opens up the N and P domains. Moreover, the role of the conserved 548DXXK motif in the hinge of CopA_NPss was explored by studying the structural and dynamics effect of the D548N mutation. This mutation does not affect the inter-domain orientation or the inter-domain flexibility of CopA_NPss, but the D548N mutation resulted in a 5-fold increase of the binding affinity for AMPPCP. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The communication mechanism between the phosphorylation site and the cation binding site of the transmembrane helices was explored. Cation binding to the transmembrane helices drives the stabilization of the P domain, resulting in a functionally efficient phosphorylation pocket wedged between the N and P domains. Phosphorylation of the invariant Asp residue stabilizes a more open inter-domain orientation between the N and P domains, which gives access to the A domain and its dephosphorylation peptide region to undo phosphorylation while opening the transmembrane region enabling ion transport across the membrane. This model suggests how the allosteric communication could be achieved between the phosphorylation site and the ligand-binding site of the transmembrane domain, which can be tested and refined through future experiments both in solution and in crystals.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This manuscript is a collection of poems that relies in part on an unavoidable lineage of Southern poetics, while simultaneously asserting a divergence from that poetic and reimagining how reconciliations with that lineage may be reached. Likewise, the personalities and voices within each poem play a contributing role in the flawed specter of place and event. In exchange for their confession and self-implication of deeds, fantasies, and fears, they seek a kind of pride not found in the simple narratives of redemption.</DISS_para>

      <DISS_content>
         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>"Representation and the Modern Female Subject" examines the socio-cultural work of the fictional woman painter in novels by women authors writing in or about the United States between the years 1870-1930. I focus on representations of women painters to explore the shift that occurs when women take control of their self-images. It is my contention that nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century American women writers employ the self-reflexive figure of the painter heroine to promote an ideological and iconological awareness of the discursive and visual natures of gender construction. The second order act of gender- and self-making produced by the woman author writing the woman painter, who in turn produces ekphrastically rendered images, foregrounds the ways that gender is articulated in art, literature, and the popular media. These self-reflexive representations, therefore, anticipate questions raised by constructivists about how gender ideologies are produced, by whom, and to what effect. In this way, authors such as Lillie Devereux Blake, Elizabeth Stuart Phelps, Kate Chopin, Julia Magruder, Winnifred Eaton, and Jessie Fauset deconstruct hegemonic representations of womanhood or femininity, from the True Woman to the Gibson Girl, to enable a plurality of divergent, sometimes paradoxical, femininities. Implicitly, then, these authors suggest that gender is constructed and negotiated through language and image and, crucially, that women must take an active part in those processes if they are to obtain autonomy.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Motivated by voluntary disclosure theory, I examine the relation between innate and discretionary accruals quality (AQ) and management's earnings forecast decisions.  I argue that AQ provides an indication of the quality of managers' earnings-related information, as accruals that are of higher (lower) quality presumably arise from higher (lower) quality information.  Further, I argue that the two components of AQ, innate and discretionary, have opposite relations with information acquisition costs, an important theoretical determinant of disclosure.  Specifically, higher levels of innate AQ suggest managers bear low information acquisition costs, leading to a positive association with forecast activity.  Conversely, higher discretionary AQ indicates greater information acquisition costs, yielding a negative theoretical association with voluntary disclosure.  I find evidence consistent with these predictions.  Further, improvements in innate AQ correspond to a higher (lower) likelihood of starting (stopping) a policy of forecasting and increases in forecast frequency, though I find no relation between changes in discretionary AQ and changes in forecasting policy.  Finally, as predicted, innate AQ interacts with several previously identified determinants of forecasting, including institutional holdings, abnormal audit fees, product market competition, and litigation risk.  Overall, my results are consistent with theory suggesting both information quality and information acquisition costs play important roles in managers' forecasting decisions.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Taekwondo (TKD) is a popular form of martial arts. The number of TKD academies has increased in the U. S., and there is intense competition among the academies. To compete in a challenging environment, a marketing mix is recognized as a key element in management of a TKD academy. The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of select marketing mix variables on the satisfaction of TKD trainees and their post-purchase behavior. Questionnaires were distributed as part of the study; the questionnaires consisted of seven marketing mix variables (product, price, place, promotion, participants, process, and physical evidence), satisfaction, and post-purchasing behavior (word-of-mouth and intention to continue participation).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The questionnaires were derived from preexisting instruments and developed to assess the determinants of TKD participants' satisfaction and their post-purchase behavior in relation to the marketing mix variables. A total of 300 questionnaires were distributed through convenience sampling at TKD academies located in San Diego, Oceanside, Irvine, Murrieta, California; Tampa, Florida; Duluth, Georgia; Raleigh, Fuquay-Varina, North Carolina; and Midlothian, Virginia. A total of 265 questionnaires were analyzed using statistical methods with PASW for Windows 20.0 program and Amos 18.0 program. The data analysis was included: frequency analysis for the demographic characteristics; assessment of normality, linearity, multicollinearity, and  homoscedasticity for the assumption tests of multivariate analysis; computation of Cronbach's alpha coefficients and item-to-total correlations for evidence of reliability; Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient for evidence of discriminant validity; confirmatory factor analysis for evidence of construct validity; and path coefficient analysis to verify the research hypotheses.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>I concluded from the findings of this study that the product, promotion, participants, and process variables positively impacted trainees' satisfaction. On the other hand, price, place, and physical evidence did not impact trainees' satisfaction. Furthermore, trainees' satisfaction positively impacted their post-purchase behaviors which are intention to continue participation and word-of mouth. One implication is that TKD academy managers should continue developing the product by providing programs such as demonstration or sparring classes for adult trainees. In addition, offering social media services could be effective as a promotional tool. TKD instructors should develop physical abilities and have good personalities. Hiring interns could strengthen the fluency of TKD instruction processes.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Cross-slope flow is critical for governing heat and material exchange, including pollutants and biota, between the coastal and deep ocean.  This study focuses on characterizing the variability of cross-slope near-bottom flow in the DeSoto Canyon region, where the BP's Macondo well exploded in April 2010, using a multi-decadal HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) simulation of Gulf of Mexico circulation. Due to change in shelf orientation east and west of the canyon, wind-driven vertical motions are mostly related to a component of the local wind vector along an angle that may deviate from the local isobaths, with smaller deviations from the along-isobath direction to the east of the canyon and bigger departures to the west. This implies that upwelling is associated with along-isobath winds east of the canyon but shelf waves propagating from the eastern shelf, where northwesterly winds are upwelling favorable, influence cross-slope flow to the west of the canyon. Beyond the shelf break, where the Loop Current and its eddies can directly impact the depth of isotherms, the isotherms are deepened underneath the Loop Current and anticyclones but uplifted on their inshore periphery. The Loop Current also interacts with the west Florida shelf and generates a high pressure gradient that extends northward along the continental slope into the study domain. Consequently, large-scale and persistent upwelling and downwelling events take place over the continental slope of the domain. The vertical excursions mostly range from ±35 to ± 50 m for the shallow isopycnals but can reach to over ± 100 m. Most distinct upwelling and downwelling events are short duration on the order of days, however there is a significant chance for persistent events, which can be induced by either remote or direct interaction of the Loop Current and/or eddies with the slope.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation investigates the origins and development of a novel communal art form called pasacalle that is associated with the district of Villa El Salvador on the outskirts of Peru's coastal capital city, Lima. The main performers of pasacalle in Villa El Salvador (VES) are youth of rural Andean descent. Most are second generation Limeños whose parents immigrated to the city from the Andean highlands. They belong to a community that has always existed on the lower rungs of Limeño society in terms of socioeconomic status and political agency. The genre of pasacalle, driven by a novel Afro-Brazilian-derived drum music, batucada, has become central to their expressive culture. Pasacalle drumming is not just a form of performance art and entertainment, but also a vehicle for solidifying communal bonds, resisting hegemony and marginalization, asserting rights and power, fighting racism, and mediating the complex sociocultural admixture of localized identity, pride in Andean heritage, aspirations for upward mobility within Limeño society, and expressions of a particular brand of cosmopolitan internationalism that defines contemporary life in Villa El Salvador. It is to the exploration of such issues that this dissertation is addressed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study evaluates a CART-based value-added model and compares it with commonly used multiple regression, hierarchical linear model, and student growth percentiles models. The comparisons are done in terms of prediction accuracy, correlations between value-added estimates, year-to-year relationship of value-added estimates, and relationship between value-added estimates and national board certification status.  The four value-added models are applied to a common data set to generate teacher value-added measures based on the same student data. Results of the study indicate that value-added estimates from CART are very similar to the other models. With the added advantages of CART that include handling of missing data , providing importance scores for predictor variables, and its simple way to communicate the results  a non-technical audience, practitioners and policy makers should consider CART-based Value-Added-Model.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In Florida, Medicaid expenditures have grown more quickly than Medicaid caseloads. Since the Medicaid program comprises a large share of all state budgets, controlling Medicaid spending has been the first priority for state governments. To manage spending and improve access to healthcare, states have adopted a managed care approach to Medicaid services. When states pursue Medicaid managed care, they believe that managed care can control Medicaid spending and maintain budget predictability through a capitated payment system. Medicaid beneficiaries are also guaranteed access to care through contracts with managed care health plans and/or providers. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Several studies that have investigated the impact of Medicaid managed care using nationally representative data have often yielded inconclusive or contradictory results. Despite the growing interest in Medicaid managed care in Florida, only a few studies have examined the impact of managed care programs on preventable hospitalization, length of stay, and cost of inpatient care for Florida's Medicaid enrollees. In addition, only a few studies have examined the impact of Medicaid managed care in the context of different market structures. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this dissertation is three-fold. First, this study examines the effects of a Medicaid managed care program on preventable hospitalization, length of stay, and cost of inpatient care for Medicaid patients. Second, the impact of market structure on preventable hospitalization, length of stay, and cost of inpatient care is a subject of interest. Finally, this dissertation extends the existing literature methodologically. This study uses multilevel modeling to estimate variables at different levels simultaneously. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Agency theory and transaction cost economics provide a useful framework for understanding the effects of different insurance schemes on incentives that affect the behavior of both patients and providers. In addition, the model of market structure provides a theoretical framework for predicting the market behavior of Medicaid managed care organizations under market contexts ranging from monopoly to perfect competition. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The study included 1,957,072 Medicaid patients aged 18 to 64 years who were discharged from a short-term general hospital in Florida from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2012. The researcher used two-level hierarchal models to predict the probability of preventable hospitalization, length of stay, and inpatient cost in Medicaid patients. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The results show that Medicaid managed care patients had a higher probability of preventable hospitalization than Medicaid fee-for-service patients. In addition, Medicaid managed care patients were more likely to have shorter lengths of stay and lower inpatient costs compared with fee-for-service Medicaid patients. This study found that market competition moderates the relationship between Medicaid insurance type and dependent variables. The study supports a spillover effect of Medicaid managed care on inpatient costs for Medicaid fee-for- service patients. In conclusion, the dissertation discusses several policy implications.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Wind induced damage is observed in different types of civil engineering structures. There are several methods in use to predict damage. Researchers and stakeholders rely on these methods to quantify damage, which helps to schedule maintenance and to estimate financial loss. These damage prediction methods utilize the knowledge on properties of the wind or the wind load resistance of the material that constitutes the structure. However, recently, researchers have pointed out several shortcomings in these approaches. One such shortcoming is the inability of these methods to address the uncertainty in the data. A typical method for damage prediction rely on the accuracy of statistic of the wind load or the material property used in the analysis. If uncertainty exists in the data, then the statistic obtained from the data will give overconfident inferences. As a result the final predicted damage, will be biased and will not reflect the uncertainties involved in the actual data.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this research, an approach is proposed to enhance the damage prediction model. In order to address the uncertainties in damage prediction, the approach integrates monitored data and existing knowledge, which gives probabilities of damages rather than a single number. The advance in sensors and wireless technologies has enabled much easier access to high-quality monitored data. The monitored data can be used to enhance the accuracy of damage prediction. While using monitored data, the proposed approach also seeks to fully utilize existing damage prediction models. These models provide a strong framework based on theories of mechanics and knowledge gained from many years of research. In order to integrate existing damage models and additional monitored data, a Bayesian approach is adopted. The Bayesian approach provides a sound framework for integrating the existing model and the additional data. In the Bayesian approach the existing model is termed as the prior. The prior is systematically updated using additional monitored data, in order to provide the posterior. In this research two case studies are considered. These are complete sealant failure of three tab asphalt shingles under wind load and fatigue damage of slender structures due to turbulence and wind structure interaction.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In case of asphalt shingles, wind vulnerability is determined using a sensor based strength monitoring and integrating the existing data. The sealant in the shingle, helps to resist the wind load acting on the shingle. After installation of asphalt shingle, the sealant deteriorates over time and loses bond with the shingle. Consequently the wind uplift capacity is reduced and larger area of the shingle is exposed to higher wind load. A complete failure of sealant due to the wind load acting on it is defined as the failure of the shingle. A sensor mechanism is proposed to monitor the deterioration of the sealant and wind vulnerability of the asphalt shingle. Existing knowledge and monitored data is integrated to estimate the uplift capacity and the wind load acting on the shingle. The vulnerability of the shingle at each wind speed is expressed in terms of the sensor reading. MC simulation is carried out to determine the failure contour on the roof and fragility curves of roof at different ages. It is observed that, the fragility curve for a 2% area of roof failure at 100 mph for a 10 year old roof from this study compares well with the results of fragility of roof cover from Cope, 2014.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In case of long span bridges, the wind data from existing and monitored data are integrated to determine the possible statistic of wind data and damage is predicted using this data. Accuracy of fatigue damage prediction depends on the accuracy of the wind speed and direction statistic. Conventional approaches rely on initial wind statistics only, which result in a single fatigue damage value. The proposed approach systematically updates the prior and wind statistic using the monitored data of wind for one year. This is used to determine the possible values of wind speed and direction statistic at the location. Fatigue analysis provides the probability distribution of different fatigue damage values. A long span bridge and long span beam were studied using the conventional and proposed approach. For the long span bridge, the fatigue damage from conventional approach is 0.002 and the mean fatigue damage from proposed analysis is 0.002. For the long span beam it is 0.392 and 0.397 respectively. The results from the proposed approach will give the designers and retrofitters a comprehensive view of the possible values of damage at any location on the bridge, thus helping in planning a maintenance task.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Cement skyscrapers, the smell of automobile exhaust, turned down faces of strangers. New York City during the Great Depression was at odds with the founding fathers' vision of America as a shining City Upon a Hill. Anna Sokolow's feelings about the modern urban landscape, the deadening isolation that often accompanies it, and its forsaken twentieth century anti-hero inspired her to create her celebrated and influential 1955 piece, Rooms. In this dance, Sokolow explores the uncanny loneliness that can affect those living in close quarters to others, specifically in busy, gritty, urban post-war America. During the first half of the twentieth century dancemakers and artists alike were creating a growing body of work that we can now refer to as Americana. These were works that self-consciously drew upon a wide range of American themes and stereotypes. While the politics and aesthetics of Americana are diverse, including work based on such themes as the American Frontier, and African American heritage, this thesis explores Rooms as a case study of a sub-genre I refer to as Dystopic Americana. This thesis represents the use of the Labanotation score of Rooms and historical research. I begin with introductory and contextual information about the study in general and Rooms specifically, followed by a general definition of Americana. I then explore three broad types of Americana: Mythic America, the African American Experience, and Dystopic America. Sokolow's Rooms is a work of Dystopic Americana. I then go on to explain three major themes characteristic of Dystopic Americana and present in Rooms: the modern, urban landscape, isolation and loneliness, and the anti-hero. From these investigations I draw conclusions about the experience of embodied research and argue for the synthesis of history and dance reconstruction as a model of best practices in the field.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The music of Argentinian tango composer Astor Piazzolla (1921-1992) is currently enjoying greater worldwide popularity than ever before among musicians and audiences alike. Yet for much of his lifetime Piazzolla had to struggle for acceptance; his idiosyncratic style is the product of many disparate influences, such that he often found it difficult to appeal to the diverse sections of the public he hoped to win over with his music. Piazzolla referred to his own music as nuevo tango, an avant-garde version of Buenos Aires' most popular dance form. He saw it as a natural evolution of the traditional tango style in which he was well versed, having performed in many of the greatest Buenos Aires tango bands of the 1940s. His detractors among Argentina's tango traditionalists, however, insisted for years that his more erudite compositions were not even tangos at all.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Certainly, in some ways his music displays a closer kinship with Western classical music. Piazzolla had a lifelong love for the music of J.S. Bach, which he first heard as a child through the wall of his family's apartment in New York City. Later, as a pupil of Alberto Ginastera and Nadia Boulanger, he also became a devoted scholar and admirer of Stravinsky, Bartók, and Prokofiev, and his own compositions bear the mark of these twentieth-century giants. Another source of inspiration for Piazzolla was jazz: as a young man he would sneak out to Harlem to hear Duke Ellington and Cab Calloway, and his tastes later expanded to include the likes of Gil Evans and Gerry Mulligan.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Piazzolla was able to fuse these various influences--classical, jazz, and tango--into a distinctive musical idiom that, while indebted to other styles, is nonetheless uniquely and unmistakably his own. Initially there was not much public support for this new musical voice, especially in his native Argentina. But through perseverance and relentless self-promotion over the course of a performing career that spanned more than fifty years, Piazzolla was able to increase his fan base from a small but loyal core of devotees into a worldwide following that has only continued to grow since his death. The eclecticism of his source material, once a stumbling block to his critics, is now a major source of appeal for today's increasingly diverse cosmopolitan audiences. Piazzolla's music has been especially embraced in the classical music community, where it has found such distinguished champions as Yo-Yo Ma, Gidon Kremer, and the Kronos Quartet. A growing number of arrangements of his works are being produced for ensembles of various sizes and configurations, so that more musicians can have the pleasure of bringing Piazzolla's music to an ever-wider public.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this treatise is to introduce my new arrangement for woodwind quintet of Piazzolla's original composition Concierto para Quinteto. This piece was premiered in 1971 and was designed to feature the musicians of the Quinteto Nuevo Tango, the most successful of Piazzolla's groundbreaking ensembles: it is scored for bandoneon, violin, electric guitar, piano, and double bass. It consists of three movements or sections (played attaca), and at nine minutes in length it is among his more substantial instrumental pieces. It exhibits all the traits of his mature compositional style, and while Piazzolla wrote this quintet during his most productive and creative period--the late 1960s and early 1970s--it remained in his active performance repertory until the end of his career.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This treatise begins with a brief survey of Piazzolla's life and career. Full-length scholarly biographies of Piazzolla are widely available, so in keeping with the primary purpose of this treatise and in order to avoid redundancy, the first chapter focuses primarily on those aspects that will provide readers with a grasp of Piazzolla's musical style and influences, and the trajectory of his creative life. The second chapter features a discussion of the Quinteto Nuevo Tango--its instrumentation, the unique role of each instrument in the group, its importance within the totality of Piazzolla's oeuvre--an exercise necessary to understand the ensemble for which Piazzolla wrote Concierto para Quinteto. The third chapter provides an analytical commentary on Piazzolla's original version of Concierto para Quinteto, dealing with questions of form, harmony, and orchestration, and finishes by offering an in-depth look at my new arrangement, detailing the various challenges and decisions I faced when creating my own adaptation of the piece.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Studies of musical agency have been growing in the field of music theory since the publication of Edward T. Cone's book &lt;italic&gt;The Composer's Voice&lt;/italic&gt; (1974). Indeed, recent publications by scholars such as Robert Hatten and Seth Monahan demonstrate that musical agency continues to be a topic worthy of investigation today. These authors tend to explore the function of agents within a piece, virtually ignoring the way agents arise in music. In this dissertation I work toward a solution to this problem by developing a theory of musical agency that explores the following questions: (1) How do virtual agents emerge in music? (2) What is the relationship between agency and narrative? (3) Can virtual agents influence music at levels deeper than the surface?  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>I propose that the concept of musical intention provides music theorists with a possible answer to this question. Action Theory, a robust subfield active in philosophy and sociology, views intentionality as a focal point in research on human agency--research that deserves more attention in studies of musical agency. Following assertions by action theorists Donald Davidson and Alfred Mele, I argue that an entity only attains the status of an agent when it performs an intentional act. With respect to music, then, I outline six categories of intentionality that can offer support to an agential hearing: gesture, contradiction of musical forces, unexpected event, conflict, repetition/restatement, and change of state. Further, I suggest that certain passages of music can be interpreted as intentional acts performed by virtual musical agents.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>I begin by reviewing the literature surrounding Action Theory in philosophy and sociology, and Agency in music theory in Chapter One. After defining each category of intentionality in Chapter Two, I investigate how the categories of intentionality interact with recent theories of musical narrative and Schenkerian analysis in Chapter Three. To demonstrate how my insights apply to analysis, I examine Beethoven's Bagatelle Op. 126, No. 2 and Mendelssohn's Song Without Words Op. 30, No. 6. These two analyses also serve as an introduction to the way in which my methodology is applied in analysis. In Chapter Four, I use the categories of intentionality in combination with both narrative and Schenkerian analysis to develop an agential reading of Schubert's Piano Sonata in A, D. 959. My agential analysis adds nuance to Hatten's (1993) and Charles Fisk's (2001) readings of the work. I suggest that two agents are present at the beginning of the movement, and I investigate how these agents act throughout all four movements of the piece. In the first three movements, the two agents are in conflict with one another, and by the end of the fourth movement the two agents achieve a synthesis that resolves their conflict. Not only does an understanding of intentionality in music clarify earlier work on musical agency, but it also provides opportunities for richer interpretive analyses. To conclude my dissertation I suggest possible avenues for further investigation, and I briefly apply my methodology to a passage of post-tonal music.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The objective of this study is to study spatial and temporal paleontological distributions as they relate to the histories of Ninetyeast Ridge and Broken Ridge from ODP Leg 121. This study is important for establishing connections between different fossil assemblages, especially between those of the high latitudes and those of low latitudes. The assemblages were used to perform biostratigraphic analyses of sequences on Ninetyeast Ridge and Broken Ridge in the Indian Ocean and to compare assemblage changes to position changes of the tectonic plates through time. The zonation scheme used for the analysis is from Okada and Bukry (1980). Although there were some small changes within the assemblages of the holes described, the changes were not significant. The assemblages throughout the interval studied contained only low-latitude species.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Recent demographic trends show that multiple partner fertility (MPF; having children by more than one partner) is prevalent in American family life, particularly among unmarried men and women. MPF challenges family relationships and leads to poor economic and socio-emotional outcomes for parents and children, and paternal MPF is particularly problematic as it often results in fathers parenting multiple groups of children across households. Whereas some research shows that paternal MPF is associated with less supportive coparenting relationships among non-resident fathers and mothers and less father involvement, little is known about the mechanisms linking MPF with coparenting support and father involvement. Using data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study and the family chaos perspective as a guide, the current project included three studies addressing the role of family chaos in the lives of unmarried non-resident fathers and their relationships with mothers and children.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In Study 1, I examined the association between paternal MPF and family chaos, indicated by partnership instability, residential instability, work stability, number of different work shifts, work flexibility, material hardship, and perceived social support. In Study 2, I tested a mediation model hypothesizing that paternal MPF is associated with higher levels of family chaos, and family chaos, in turn, is associated with less coparenting support as perceived by both non-resident fathers and mothers of a focal child. Building on Study 2, Study 3 tested a mediation model hypothesizing that both family chaos and coparenting support mediate the association between MPF and father involvement with the focal child. As the timing of MPF may also matter, the effects of both early MPF (fathering a child by another partner before the focal child's first birthday) and later MPF (fathering another child between the focal child's first and third birthdays) on family chaos, coparenting support, and father involvement were examined with no MPF fathers as the comparison group.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Overall, findings from Study 1 were that paternal MPF was associated with some indicators of family chaos (greater partnership instability, residential instability, material hardship, less work stability), but not others (work hours, number of work shifts, work flexibility, social support). Early MPF and later MPF were similarly related with work stability and material hardship, although later MPF was more strongly associated with partnership instability than was early MPF. Associations between MPF and family chaos were generally small. Results from Study 2 showed that most indicators of family chaos did not mediate associations among paternal MPF and coparenting support two years later. One exception was that both early and later MPF were associated with partnership instability which, in turn, was negatively, though only marginally, associated with fathers' perceptions of coparenting support. Results from Study 3 were similar to those of Study 2 and showed that most indicators of family chaos did not mediate the associations among paternal MPF, coparenting support, and father involvement two years later. Early MPF was negatively, though marginally, associated with social support which, in turn, was positively associated with concurrent reports of mothers' coparenting support, and mothers' perceptions of coparenting support were associated with father involvement two years later. Later MPF was directly associated with father involvement two years later, but this association was not mediated by family chaos or either parents' perceptions of coparenting support. Overall, findings suggest that family chaos may be a factor in the lives of fathers who experience MPF; however, further research is needed understand these associations.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Trapping of a photoinduced metastable paramagnetic state of a molecular material is one of the most fascinating phenomena of molecular bistability, due to its potential uses in memory devices, sensors, or radiation detectors. This thesis focuses on two photomagnetic systems that are very different but show conceptual similarity - spin-crossover (SCO) complexes and sigma-dimers of organic radicals. Despite the long history of research on SCO in complexes of 3d4-3d7 transition metal ions, the design and preparation of SCO complexes for surface functionalization, the prediction of spin state behavior, and the combination of SCO with other properties, such as conductivity or ferroelectricity, in a single material are current emerging areas associated with many challenges. In this thesis, we demonstrate that 2,2&amp;#8242;-biimidazole offers a convenient platform for modification of SCO complexes for surface functionalization. The ligand can be conveniently alkylated at the protonated nitrogen atoms, preserving essentially the same ligand filed strength. We suggest a simple approach to predicting the spin state of tris-homoleptic diimine complexes with the Fe(II) ion. We also show an effective way to incorporate TCNQ*&amp;#61540;- organic radical as the conducting moieties into SCO complexes. These complexes offer a rare example of highly conducting photomagnets.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The light-induced magnetism has been studied extensively in spin crossover coordination compounds and charge transfer complexes. Prior to the present work, however, no such studies existed on organic systems in solid state form. Here we demonstratefor the first time the photoinduced splitting of hypervalent 4-center 6-electron S***S&amp;#8722;S***S bridged &amp;#963;-dimers of bisdithiazolyl radicals, 8-fluoro-4-ethyl-4H-bis[1,2,3]dithiazolo[4,5-&amp;#61538;: 5',4'-e]pyridin-3-yl, &amp;#61538;-dimer phase (&amp;#61538;-FBPEt) and 8-fluoro-4-methyl-4H-bis[1,2,3]dithiazolo[4,5-&amp;#61538;: 5',4'-e]pyridin-3-yl, (&amp;#61538;-FBPMe). The results are very encouraging, as we have been able to generate the S=1/2 radical forms of these materials under irradiation. Moreover, these radicals exhibit an unprecedented stabilty in the solid state; one of them convert back to the diamagnetic &amp;#963;-dimer (S=0) at the temperature as high as 242 K. The dimer-to-radical photoconversion, which we dubbed the LIRT (light-induced radical trapping) effect, has been demonstrated by magnetic susceptibility measurements, optical spectroscopy, and single crystal X-ray diffraction.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Research suggests that the life satisfaction of gender, racial, and sexual minorities is significantly lower than males, Whites, and individuals who identify as heterosexual, respectively.  A disparity in life satisfaction between minority and majority groups needs to be addressed so that interventions may be developed to combat these inequalities.  The present study explored whether mindfulness and/or acceptance moderated the relationship between minority status (gender, racial, sexual) and life satisfaction.  For example, was the disparity in life satisfaction between racial minorities and Whites reduced as levels of mindfulness increased? </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Participants included 309 college students, age 18-25 from two southeastern universities.  All data was collected during Summer and Fall 2014.  The purpose of the present study was to explore mindfulness and acceptance as potential moderators in the relationship between minority status and life satisfaction, controlling for income, victimization, and health status (i.e., report of a mental health, substance condition, disability, or chronic illness), through two separate hierarchical regression analyses.  Life satisfaction, mindfulness, and acceptance were measured by total scores on the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS; Diener, Emmons, &amp; Larson, 1985), Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ; Baer et al, 2006), and the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II (AAQ-II; Hayes et al. 2004), respectively.  Results suggested that college students' levels of dispositional mindfulness did not significantly moderate the relationship between minority status and life satisfaction.  However, acceptance was found to significantly moderate the relationship between gender and life satisfaction, wherein as acceptance increased the difference in life satisfaction between male and female college students decreased.  Additionally, the relationship between mindfulness and life satisfaction and acceptance and life satisfaction were explored through two bivariate correlation analyses. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Results were consistent with previous literature suggesting mindfulness was significantly positively related to life satisfaction.  College students who reported higher levels of dispositional mindfulness were found to have higher levels of life satisfaction.  Additionally, college students who reported higher levels of dispositional acceptance were found to have higher levels of life satisfaction.  Finally, the relationships between status (i.e., gender, race, and sexual orientation) and life satisfaction, controlling for health status, victimization, and income, were calculated through three ANCOVA analyses.  Results suggested that male and female college students did not significantly differ in life satisfaction.  LGBQ identified college students and heterosexual college students also were not found to significantly differ in life satisfaction.  However, Black/African American/Afro-Caribbean college students were found to have significantly lower life satisfaction than White and Hispanic/Latino college students.  None of the other race/ethnicities included in the study were found to significantly differ in life satisfaction.  The implications of the present study's findings, limitations, and directions for future research are also presented.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Muscle plays a primary role in movement of the body of multicellular organs. A study of muscle contraction at a molecular level will provide understanding of muscular malfunction, as well as insights into the basic mechanism of bimolecular motors. Muscle contraction involves a complex interaction between multiple proteins with multiple domains. Not all of these interactions are well understood. This study is focused on the role of the S2 segment of muscle myosin. S2 is part of the long alpha-helix coiled-coil rod, and plays a significant role in both muscle contraction and myosin II ATPase regulation. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this study, we use the HMM fragment of smooth muscle myosin II (smHMM) which contains a pair of myosin heads held together by the S2 domain. smHMM with a full length S2 shows the ATPase behavior of a fully regulated smooth muscle myosin (smM) but is soluble rather than filamentous. Biochemical studies have shown that the length of the S2 domain affects actin-activated ATPase regulation in smHMM, an observation that would suggest that torsional rigidity of the alpha-helices that comprise S2 is the physical basis because the two heads, which would be nominally on opposite sides of the coiled-coil alpha-helices, must rotate to a position on one side only. However, interpretation of the biochemistry suggested that the effect of S2 length on regulation was due to a requirement that the S2 coiled-coil be long enough to interact with one of the myosin heads in the inactive complex. Modeling studies investigating this effect concluded that torsional rigidity was the explanation. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Torsional motions could also be involved in the binding of both myosin heads to a single actin filament because as with formation of the ATPase inhibited conformation, the two heads must come to the same side of the S2 domain. In this case, there is no suggestion of an interaction between the S2 domain and the actin-attached heads and thus an effect can have a simpler interpretation. On that basis, we investigated whether the length of the S2 domain has an effect on the simultaneous binding of both myosin heads to an actin filament using two recombinant smHMM constructs, one with a full length S2 (wt-HMM), the other with a highly shortened S2 with a length of two heptads of S2 followed by a 32 residue leucine zipper (2hepzip-HMM). We compare the amount of 2-headed binding to actin in these two otherwise identical constructs in the complete absence of nucleotide, known as the rigor state, and in the presence of saturating levels of ADP. The myosin S1 head has its strongest binding affinity to actin in the rigor state; while in the presence of ADP, it has less binding affinity. Thus, if torsional rigidity is the physical basis of the effect, the predicted outcome is more 2-headed attachment to actin with wt-HMM-rigor compared to 2hepzip-HMM-rigor, and a less 2-headed attachment for both constructs when ADP is added.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>For this study, we directly visualize the smHMM attachment to actin filament by combining cryo-electron tomography with subvolume alignment and classification using multivariate data analysis. Methodological advances in several steps were necessary to achieve this goal: (1) segmentation of the subvolumes from the tomograms, (2) alignment of the subvolumes to a feature held in common among all members, and (3) clustering into groups a heterogeneous collection of subvolumes that vary with respect to several criteria. In this study the common feature is the actin filaments, and the heterogeneous feature is the presence or absence of myosin binding to actin by either one head or two. We use a novel approach that utilizes convolution and least squares fitting to smooth the stochastic error in the subvolume centers and Euler angles to improve the alignment. The subvolume alignment was done in a way that enabled all the bound myosin heads to be localized to a single classification site from which the variability can be assessed in a simplified way. Following identification of the bound myosin heads, the different types of attachment are determined that include 2-headed attachments, 1- headed attachments with one free head, which may or may not have an accessible, unlabeled actin subunit nearby, and 1-headed attachments that have no unbound second head, which may arise from dissociation of the S2 domain (Chapter 3). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We find that the when the S2 domain is shortened to a length of 2 heptads plus a leucine zipper that 2-headed binding decreases by a factor of 2 compared to full length S2 constructs. This we interpret as evidence of a torsional effect of the S2 helices. Moreover, the addition of ADP, rather than decreasing the amount of 2-headed binding increased it by ~5% in the case of wt-HMM. The effect of ADP addition is compatible with published accounts of ADP addition to smooth muscle fibers, which showed that tension increased by ~3% and stiffness decreased by ~10% (Chapter 4).</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The scopes of this thesis research are two folds: the first one is to the construct the intensity-based composite radial-vertical profiles of tropical cyclones (TC) using GPS-based dropsonde observations and the second one is to identify the major deficiencies of Mathur vortices against the dropsonde composites of TCs. The intensity-based dropsonde composites of TCs advances our understanding of the dynamic and thermal structure of TCs of different intensity along the radial direction in and above the boundary layer where lies the devastating high wind that causes property damages and storm surges. The identification of the major deficiencies of Mathur vortices in representing the radial-vertical profiles of TC of different intensity helps to improve numerical predictions of TCs since most operational TC forecast models need to utilize bogus vortices, such as Mathur vortices, to initialize TC forecasts and simulations.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	We first screen all available GPS dropsonde data within and round 35 named TCs over the tropical Atlantic basin from 1996 to 2010 and pair them with TC parameters derived from the best-track data provided by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) and select 1149 dropsondes that have continuous coverage in the lower troposphere.  The composite radial-vertical profiles of tangential wind speed, temperature, mixing ratio and humidity are based for each TC category ranging from "Tropical Storm" (TS) to "Hurricane Category 1" (H1) through "Hurricane Category 5" (H5). The key findings of the dropsonde composites are: (i) all TCs have the maximum tangential wind within 1 km above the ground and a distance of 1-2 times of the radius of maximum wind (RMW) at the surface; (ii) all TCs have a cold ring surrounding the warm core near the boundary layer at a distance of 1-3 times of the RMW and the cold ring structure gradually diminishes at a higher elevation where the warm core structure prevails along the radial direction; (iii) the existence of such shallow cold ring outside the RMW explains why the maximum tangential wind is within 1 km above the ground and is outside the RMW, as required by the hydrostatic and gradient wind balance relations; (iv) one of the main differences among TCs of different intensity, besides the speed of the maximum tangential wind, is the vertical extent of near-saturated moisture air layer inside the core. A weaker TC tends to have a deep layer of the near-saturated moisture air layer whereas a stronger TC has a shallow one; (v) another main difference in the thermal structure among TCs of different intensity is the intensity and vertical extent of the warm core extending from the upper layer to the lower layer. In general, a stronger TC has a stronger warm core extending downward further into lower layer and vice versa.  The features (iv) and (v) are consistent with the fact that a stronger TC tends to have stronger descending motion inside the core. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The main deficiencies of Mathur vortices in representing the radial-vertical profiles of TC of different intensity are (i) Mathur vortices of all categories have the maximum wind at the surface; (ii) none of Mathur vortices have a cold ring outside the warm core near the boundary layer;  (iii) Mathur vortices tend to overestimate warm core structure in reference to the horizontal mean temperature profile; (iv) Mathur vortices tend to overestimate the vertical depth of the near-saturated air layer near the boundary layer.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Fog and smoke can combine to form dangerous zero visibility conditions along roadways throughout the state of Florida. The ability to forecast when and where fog will occur is problematic. Fog can occur over large and small scales, and is dependent on many meteorological and geographic variables. This study used Automated Weather Observation Stations (AWOS) and Automated Surface Observing Systems (ASOS) throughout the state of Florida to develop a climatology to ascertain what conditions are necessary for radiation fog development. Forecasted dewpoint depression, wind speed, cooling rates, the derived vertical hydrolapse, and other variables were shown to all affect fog formation. Using this information, a fog forecasting model was developed. The model was used to determine a three-hour binary forecast for the early morning hours, every day, at the location of the mesonet stations used. The model would predict fog if meteorological conditions preceding the forecasting time met a series of threshold levels. The goal was to make the model easy to deploy so that law enforcement can make a fast decision of whether to warn the public about potentially dangerous road conditions. The model was compared to other forecasting techniques such as the Model Output Statistics (MOS) fog product and climatology. After comparing the model to reference forecasts, it was found that the model outperformed climatology by a significant margin and was able to detect more fog events than MOS. However, the model had a higher false alarm rate and lower percent forecasts correct compared to MOS .</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>A firm's legitimacy becomes a critical issue during an organizational crisis. Blending social identity theory (SIT) and institutional theory, I explain why legitimacy is more difficult to maintain for foreign firms than domestic firms. Specifically, I argue that foreign firms are likely to suffer a greater loss in legitimacy from an organizational crisis because of their legitimacy characteristics and foreign identity. In building the discussion about foreign firms' legitimacy characteristics, I argue that foreign firms face severe restrictions in establishing cognitive legitimacy due to constituents' identity-based bias toward foreign firms. As a result, domestic firms and foreign firms develop differing properties of legitimacy. When an organizational crisis strikes a foreign firm, this ex ante legitimacy property and the magnified foreign identity reinforce each other to result in more damage to legitimacy for foreign firms. Moreover, an organizational crisis that strikes a foreign firm is likely to have a stronger negative spillover effect on other foreign firms within the same industry. The proposition and hypotheses in this study were empirically tested using the recall data of 10 automakers in the US automobile industry between 2006 and 2013. The legitimacy of a firm was measured using two constructs from prior studies: tenor of media and volume of media (Pollock &amp; Rindova, 2003). A total of 15,019 newspaper articles were analyzed using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software to estimate tenor of media, and additional 469 news articles were used to estimate volume of media. Lastly, this study employs GEE to test the ten hypotheses. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The results suggest that foreign firms are indeed at a higher risk of losing legitimacy not only from their own crises but also other foreign firms' crises. More specifically, an organizational crisis results in a harsher legitimacy setback for a foreign firm than a domestic firm. Furthermore, when a foreign firm faces a crisis, its negative effects seem to spread only to other foreign firms, whereas domestic firms may even benefit from the foreign firm's crisis. There was no negative spillover affecting domestic firms either from a foreign firm's recall or domestic firm's recall. Therefore, the empirical results point to the existence of the identity-based liability of foreignness.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The anterior third of the hypothalamus contains numerous nuclei involved in the regulation of reproductive, stress, circadian, and homeostatic behaviors. Due to the multifarious roles of this small area, neurotransmission is diverse and variegated between the discrete functional nuclei present there. The gaseous neurotransmitter, nitric oxide (NO) has already been shown to have an important regulatory role within the medial preoptic area (MPOA) of the anterior hypothalamus, where it serves to facilitate the expression of sex behaviors. However, little is known about the role of other gaseous neurotransmitters in this behavioral system. Here, I report that carbon monoxide (CO), an endogenously produced gas that also acts as a neurotransmitter, also has a functional behavioral role within this brain area in rats. The central administration of CO-facilitating molecules to the MPOA improves copulatory performance and reduces measures of anxiety, whereas CO-inhibiting molecules serve to impair copulatory performance and increase measures of anxiety. These effects are exerted through two cellular pathways: the cyclic GMP (cGMP) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) signaling systems. These pathways are somewhat distinct, with PGE2 inhibitors effectively blocking CO-induced anxiolysis but only impairing copulatory behavior during the first sexual experience, and cGMP inhibitors effectively impairing copulatory behavior during all experiences but facilitating rather than reducing anxiolysis. These dual mechanisms of CO signaling may stem in part from the disparate expression of the CO-producing enzymes HO-1, which is expressed transiently after the first sexual experience, and HO-2, which increases expression only with repeated experience, as quantified by immunofluorescence. Together, these results indicate that CO has a dual behavioral role within the anterior hypothalamus, exerting control over both reproductive and anxiety behaviors, and that its similarities and contrasts to NO may stem from the variable regulation of the two CO-producing enzymes.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Deepwater Horizon (DwH) blowout released 5.0x10&lt;super&gt;11&lt;/super&gt;g C from gaseous hydrocarbon into the water column and up to 6.0x10&lt;super&gt;11&lt;/super&gt;g C from oil (Joye et al., 2011). Oil was visible on the surface, but &lt;0.01% of the gaseous hydrocarbon escaped the water column (Kessler et al., 2011; Yvon-Lewis et al., 2011). Metabolically efficient methanotrophs consumed the gases, converting them into either CO2 or biomass. For this study, we analyzed carbon isotopes, &amp;delta;&lt;super&gt;13&lt;/super&gt;C and &amp;Delta;&lt;super&gt;14&lt;/super&gt;C, in suspended particulate organic carbon (POC) to detect the fate of some of the hydrocarbons. Suspended particulate organic carbon has a residence time of 5-10 years in the water column (Druffel and Williams, 1990) and is composed of floating biomass including mucus, plankton, bacteria, fecal pellets and other organic particles greater than 1&amp;mu;m. POC too large to float sinks and is then classified as sinking POC. Marine snow is an example of sinking POC. Suspended and sinking POC can be composed of the same types of biomass, however they can be formed from different carbon sources and different areas of the water column. The primary focus of this study is on suspended POC. We hypothesized that the DwH event caused depleted &amp;delta;&lt;super&gt;13&lt;/super&gt;C and &amp;Delta;&lt;super&gt;14&lt;/super&gt;C signatures in POC that we would see fade over time and with distance away from the blowout, horizontally and vertically in the water column. Our second hypothesis was that carbon isotope signatures should also differ between natural hydrocarbon seep sites and non&amp;minus;seep sites. We also wanted to determine the percent carbon in each sample from methane or oil derived carbon and the total amount of POC in our sampling area in the Gulf of Mexico composed of carbon from hydrocarbons. Our data set was compared to sediment carbon isotope data from the Gulf of Mexico to rule out one possible alternative hypothesis that could cause depleted carbon isotope signatures, sediment resuspension. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To complete these objectives, POC samples were collected from Desoto Canyon and other seep and non-seep sites across the Northern Gulf of Mexico in 2010, 2012 and 2013. Seawater was filtered, collecting the POC on glass microfiber filters, which were then acid fumed, dried and analyzed for &amp;delta;&lt;super&gt;13&lt;/super&gt;C and &amp;Delta;&lt;super&gt;14&lt;/super&gt;C. The hydrocarbon plume from the DwH blowout was detected in 2010 POC samples. Over 2010, 2012 and 2013 sampling years, &amp;delta;&lt;super&gt;13&lt;/super&gt;C signatures ranged from &amp;minus;17.8 / to &amp;minus;35.2 /. Radiocarbon signatures ranged from 71.2 / to &amp;minus;755.5 /. Percent carbon from modern, methane and oil derived carbon for 29 deep POC samples was estimated to contain 58% &amp;plusmn; 19% modern, 33%&amp;plusmn;19% methane and 9%&amp;plusmn;5% oil. We found no yearly variation between signatures on POC samples collected in the deeper waters, which suggests that the Gulf of Mexico always has depleted carbon isotope signatures at deeper depths and the effect of the oil spill, although clearly detectable in 2010, was relatively minor on suspended POC. GC600, a well known and active seep, appears to have the same qualitative impact on the POC carbon isotope signatures as the blowout. The blowout released an estimated 4.6&amp;minus;6.0x10&lt;super&gt;11&lt;/super&gt;g C from oil into the water column. Through direct recovery, skimming, or burning, 35.5% of the released oil was removed from the environment leaving 2.9&amp;minus;3.9x10&lt;super&gt;11&lt;/super&gt;g C from oil behind that could possibly be incorporated into POC. Adding the 5.0x10&lt;super&gt;11&lt;/super&gt;g C from gaseous hydrocarbons to the oil left in the water column, there is an estimated 7.9&amp;minus;8.87x10&lt;super&gt;11&lt;/super&gt;g C released from the wellhead. We calculated the total POC reservoir in our sampling area of 9.4x10&lt;super&gt;10&lt;/super&gt; m2 of the Gulf of Mexico, to be 2.1x10&lt;super&gt;12&lt;/super&gt; to 4.4x10&lt;super&gt;12&lt;/super&gt;g C. If 100% of the remaining hydrocarbons were assimilated into biomass, the hydrocarbons from the blowout would make up 20&amp;minus;42% of the total POC reservoir in the Gulf of Mexico. Du and Kessler (2012) estimate that of the 0.47x10&lt;super&gt;12&lt;/super&gt;g of hydrocarbons released, 0.1x10&lt;super&gt;12&lt;/super&gt; g C were converted into biomass, which makes up only 2&amp;minus;5% of the total POC reservoir we calculated. As suggested above, our data suggest that the deep Gulf of Mexico always has depleted carbon isotope signatures, implying that the bacteria in the water column of the Gulf of Mexico acts as a buffer, reducing the impact of the blowout and natural seeps on global climate by preventing methane from reaching the atmosphere.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>When teaching music, selecting the right instructional materials for each student is tremendously important. This project is a bibliography of pedagogical materials currently available to harp instructors in the United States.  The focus is on solo harp literature for lever and pedal harp players of various age groups who play at the beginner through early intermediate levels, or namely, the first through third years of study for the average student. Annotations provide an analysis of each item regarding its level and usefulness.  Most of the listings consist of print materials, with an additional sampling of DVDs.  The materials are categorized in four sections: harp methods for children, harp methods for adults, supplemental solos, and instructional DVDs.  This project seeks to find a balance between newer materials and the older classics of harp literature.  Due to the rapidly changing nature of the internet, useful harp websites are listed in an addendum, Appendix A.  Appendix B is a glossary of practical harp terms that pertain to types of harps and common techniques used to play the harp.  Appendix C contains tables of materials that can be used with small harps of 26 strings, and materials that can be used with pedal harp only.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>All modern day landfills contain a series of perforated pipes installed beneath the waste whose purpose is to collect all liquid which drains through the cell. This system is called the leachate collection system and its primary purpose is to drain any liquid toward a central location where it is pumped and then treated, discharged, or recirculated. It has been discovered that certain landfills see a buildup of precipitates within the system which leads to clogged pipes and buildup of leachate head on top of the landfill. The formation of the precipitates is linked to the chemical and biological make-up of the leachate generated within the landfill. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In order to better understand this clogging process and thus be able to prevent it in future landfills, the chemical and biological characteristics of leachate as well as landfill design must be examined. It is now known that ash content within the waste will lead to greater clogging. This is due to the fact that ash contributes greater amounts of the calcium necessary for biofilm to grow within the drainage media. While one solution to this problem is the monofilling of ash residue in separate landfills, many operators still choose to combine MSW and ash. Since no law exists prohibiting the later it is the goal of this research to design a model which may be used by landfill operators to foresee clogging potential of their landfill and thus prevent it. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The main objective of this study is to use a &amp;ldquo;film growth approach&amp;rdquo; to simulate clogging in Florida landfills. The change of hydraulic properties and porosities of leachate drainage materials due to calcium carbonate buildup will be predicted using Florida specific leachate composition data and leachate generation data for typical landfills operated in different micro-climates of the state. The results of this investigation will be used to examine the adequacy of the current design methodology of leachate collection systems in the state of Florida. The findings of this study will then be used to estimate the service life of LCSs in different regions of the state.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The study was conducted in four stages. The first stage consisted of a literature review of previous laboratory and field tests of LCSs. It also took into account all available FDEP databases of leachate quality and quantity. The second stage aimed at modeling calcium carbonate growth within an LCS based on results obtained in the first stage. The third stage consisted of an analysis of LCS clogging results as applied to model landfills which represented typical landfills throughout the state of Florida. The performance of these model landfills and LCSs was evaluated to see what kinds of changes are noticeable in the leachate quality and quantity over the lifetime of the landfill. Clogging of drainage media was the main focus of this stage because this clogging is the biggest contributor to LCS failure. Finally the adequacy of design of LCSs in model landfills was examined and adjusted as needed based on results obtained in stages 1-3. It was also possible to estimate the service life of existing and future LCSs to make sure that no leachate ever escapes the landfill and contaminates the groundwater.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Power Electronic-based Distribution Systems (PEDS) can provide excellent features such as load regulation, high power factor, and transient performance; especially in the large scale grids which are highly penetrated with the renewable energy resources, as well as innovative Power Electronic-based Components (PECs) such as Solid State Transformers (SSTs), Fault Isolation Devices (FIDs), machine drives, and inverters. Conversely, they are prone to exhibit negative impedance instabilities due to the regulated output voltage, high power factor and constant-power nature of the individual components in the system. Therefore, small-signal and large-signal stability assessments of the PEDS play a prominent role in the different stages of systems analyses such as preoperational (design), operational, and post-operational stages. Herein, various stability analysis techniques, along with their pros and cons, are described.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This work proposes to develop a novel "real time" stability analysis criterion and technique to assess small-signal stability of the PECs in the contemporary distribution systems. This will consist of a new small-signal stability criterion as well as appropriate technique to assess small-signal stability of the PECs based on the proposed criterion. The proposed criterion is developed based on d-q impedance measurement technique and Nyquist criterion. The advantages of the proposed criterion and technique include the capability to be developed for real-time applications, the simplicity of development on software and hardware, and the use of a powerful algorithm to address small-signal stability of the PEDS, etc. The primary contribution of this work is the real-time stability analysis methodology; more specifically, the capability of the proposed criterion and technique to be implemented in a real-time platform. The parallel perturbation of source and load is one of the key features of the proposed method that enables real-time capability. In addition, the proposed stability criterion, based on impedance measurement and Nyquist stability criterion, contributes higher accuracy in small-signal stability assessments of the systems by providing a complete Nyquist contour of the system's return-ration matrix. Ultimately, this yields lighter computational loads, faster computation times, and more accurate evaluation of the system's stability in a way that enables the assessment of the relative and absolute stability of the PEDS. Another advantage of the proposed technique is that it takes part of the system's nonlinearities into account by perturbing the systems with chirp signal and in a range of frequencies, instead of exclusively fundamental frequency.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Hardware development and experimental implementation also is presented in this work. In the experimental implementation section of the proposed work, an Impedance Measurement Unit (IMU) is developed via Power Hardware in the Loop (PHIL) experiment and measures source and load impedances in real-time. Subsequently, the proposed stability criterion is implemented on the real time digital simulator (RTDS) and by utilizing information from the developed IMU, small-signal stability of the test bed is investigated in real-time.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This thesis investigates the relationship between the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) and the United States government and foreign policy between its inception in 1917 and the publication of its pamphlet "Speak Truth to Power" in 1955. Rooted in both Progressive-era thought and a particular Quaker ethic, the AFSC's work found support within the government in both the Hoover and Roosevelt Administrations when the Friends' goals aligned with the government's, and through friendships at the leadership level, like Clarence Pickett's strong working relationship with Eleanor Roosevelt. This relationship proved especially effective during the Friends' World War II-era refugee and feeding relief work, which earned the organization a Nobel Peace Prize in 1947. However, the Friends' reputation suffered in the atmosphere of the early Cold War years, as their opposition to the US-Soviet arms race and reluctance to condemn the Soviets earned them deep suspicion within the American government.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Climate feedback mechanisms are known to substantially affect the surface temperature response to an external forcing. This study aims to advance our physical and quantitative understanding of forcing and feedback contributions to the surface temperature response to an external forcing. The dissertation begins with a comprehensive overview of the climate feedback concept and the frameworks used to interpret the effects of forcing and feedbacks on surface temperature. The climate feedback-response analysis method (CFRAM), a relatively new climate feedback framework whose advantages over the traditional climate feedback analysis framework are delineated, is then used to study the seasonal surface temperature response to a doubling of CO2 in a global warming simulation of the NCAR CCSM4. This allows us for the first time to explain the major features of the seasonal warming structure quantitatively. Polar regions, for example, experience the largest warming and the greatest seasonal variation, with maximum warming in fall/winter and minimum warming in summer. In summer, the large cancelations between the shortwave and longwave cloud feedbacks and between the surface albedo feedback warming and the cooling from the ocean heat storage/dynamics feedback lead to a warming minimum. In polar winter, surface albedo and shortwave cloud feedbacks are nearly absent due to a lack of insolation. However, the ocean heat storage feedback relays the polar warming due to the surface albedo feedback from summer to winter, and the longwave cloud feedback warms the polar surface. Therefore, the seasonal variations in the cloud feedback, surface albedo feedback, and ocean heat storage/dynamics feedback, directly caused by the strong annual cycle of insolation, contribute primarily to the large seasonal variation of polar warming. Furthermore, the CO2 forcing, and water vapor and atmospheric dynamics feedbacks add to the maximum polar warming in fall/winter.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The CFRAM allows for a process-based decomposition of the temperature response into individual contributions by the forcing and non-temperature feedbacks, which implicitly include the thermal-radiative coupling (i.e., temperature feedback) effects between the surface and atmosphere. To uncover this hidden effect in the CFRAM, this study develops and introduces a method known as the surface feedback-response analysis method (SFRAM) to isolate the temperature feedback effects on surface temperature, allowing for a physical and quantitative understanding of the temperature feedback effects. The temperature feedback effect is found to be the most important contributor to the surface temperature change, accounting for nearly 76% of the global mean surface warming. From the CFRAM perspective, the temperature feedback effect is just the indirect effects of the forcing and non-temperature feedbacks. The SFRAM analysis, in conjunction with the CFRAM results, indicates that in general the indirect effects of the forcing and non-temperature feedbacks on the surface temperature change are larger than the direct effects; thus demonstrating the influence and strength of the temperature feedback effect in the CFRAM results. By isolating the temperature feedback loop, an understanding of why the indirect effects are generally larger than direct effects is achieved.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The SFRAM also serves as a bridge to the traditional TOA feedback analysis. A comparison of the SFRAM results with those of the traditional TOA feedback analysis indicates the largest disparity in interpretation is given for the lapse-rate feedback, which is shown to just stem from a misinterpretation of the temperature feedback effects on surface temperature. A better and more intuitive explanation is achieved through the surface perspective of the SFRAM than the TOA perspective of the traditional feedback analysis. A reconciliation of the surface and TOA perspectives is achieved once the temperature feedback effects are included with the effects of the forcing and non-temperature feedbacks, as in the CFRAM analysis.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>As businesses expand to incorporate a more global perspective, study abroad programs are needed to help American college students compete with their international peers. Businesses are realizing that employees must possess skills that help with their understanding of and interaction with those from foreign countries. As a means of achieving this end, study abroad programs have become an increasingly important part of the educational experience for undergraduate students. Personal growth and interpersonal development are important aspects of being able to work effectively with others. Study abroad programs have long claimed that students make gains in these areas.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This mixed-methods research study explored how emotional-social intelligence is impacted by participation in a long-term study abroad program. Specifically, the study sought to determine if there was a difference in the emotional-social intelligence scores of college students prior to and after their participation in a long-term study abroad program as measured by the EQ-i2.0. Additionally, the study used interviews to explore how college students view their long-term study abroad experience. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The results demonstrated that there were statistically significant differences in the EQ-i2.0 pre-test and post-test scores of study participants before and after their participation in a long-term study abroad program.  Specifically, the mean differences of total EQ, the self-perception and self-expression composite scales, and the self-regard and flexibility subscales were statistically significant.  As it relates to the qualitative data, students reported that most of their experiences were related to developing a more accurate understanding of and acceptance of self, as well as becoming more self-reliant.  In addition, students reported an increased desire to understand others.  This included an appreciation for other people and other cultures.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The United States has fallen below many countries in international assessments of middle school aged students in the fields math and science. Computer games have only grown in popularity. In the last few decades, the time spent playing computer and video games have increased as well. Educational games try to recapture some of this time that may otherwise be wasted, but many have failed to preserve the main reason people are drawn to them, the sense of fun. Earthquake Rebuild is a game being developed to assist teachers in the presentation of the common core standards in mathematics in a fun and engaging way. The game is being developed for students in grades six through eight. The setting and story line are motivated by the Fukusima earthquake. The player will be rebuilding a village after its destruction by an earthquake. Earthquake Rebuild follows a</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>small group of students, educators, and experts. The project is using Unity 4 as the game engine. A proof of concept demo is completed, with classes to score and track players, as well as classes that will ease the development of the next version.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>A novel electrochemical cell design based on yarn or fiber-like carbon nanotube electrodes was developed as an engineered solution for flexible electrochemical devices, namely electrical energy storage devices. Proof-of-concept cells consisting of porous CNT networks as the sole structural support, electronic conductor and active charge storage material were fabricated and tested. The coaxial yarn cell provided a robust structure able to undergo flexural deformation with minimal impact on the energy storage performance. Greater than 95% of the energy density and 99% of the power density was retained when wound around an 11 cm diameter cylinder. The electrochemical properties were characterized at stages throughout the fabrication process to provide insights and potential directions for further development of these novel cell designs.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To demonstrate the ability to improve the performance and extend the applicability of the CNT network based cell design to various cell chemistries and material combinations, the versatile redox activity material vanadium oxide (VO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;) was deposited onto CNT yarns. A supercritical fluid deposition and in-situ oxidation process was utilized to create thin conformal coatings of vanadium oxide on carbon nanotube (CNT) surfaces throughout the porous structure of CNT yarns. Half-cell electrochemical characterizations were conducted on carbon nanotube-vanadium oxide (CNT-VO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;) yarn electrodes in an 8 M LiCl aqueous electrolyte. The high surface area, interconnected pore structure and high electrical conductivity of the CNT yarn enabled extraordinary rate capabilities from the high capacity Li/VO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; system. Cyclic voltammetry tests with scan rates of several volts per second, requiring current densities of hundreds of amperes per gram of electrode mass produced voltammograms with distinguishable redox peaks from Li-ion intercalation/deintercalation. Capacitances of over 150 F g&lt;super&gt;-1&lt;/super&gt; were achieved at a scan rate of 5 V s&lt;super&gt;-1&lt;/super&gt; over a 1.2 V potential window resulting in an energy density of &gt; 32 Wh kg&lt;super&gt;-1&lt;/super&gt; (&gt; 30 Wh L&lt;super&gt;-1&lt;/super&gt;) for the yarn electrode. The charge storage also showed good reversibility when cycled over this large potential window, maintaining 90% of the capacitance after 100 cycles at a scan rate of 2 V s&lt;super&gt;-1&lt;/super&gt;. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Investigation into the structure-property relationship of the CNT yarn and the effects on electrochemical energy storage performance was conducted through half-cell testing of single-filament CNT yarn electrodes. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) enabled the development of an equivalent circuit model based on representation of the CNT yarn through a parallel configuration of a constant phase element (CPE) and Warburg impedance element. Various physical properties of the electrode and electrode-electrolyte system can be obtained from model fitting of the experimental data, providing the ability to verify model accuracy through the comparison of known physical properties (e.g. electrode resistivity), as well as the ability to gain insight into complex electrochemical phenomena from previously unmeasured properties. Analysis of the modeling results for the DC potential dependent EIS tests on electrodes of various lengths suggest a relationship between the effective ion diffusion lengths, the extent of mobile charge carries in the CNT electronic structure and the fractal dimension of the hierarchical self-similar CNT yarn electrodes. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The unique concentric cylinder architecture of the flexible coaxial electrode cells displayed an unintended sensitivity of the cell open-circuit voltage (OCV) to the atmosphere surrounding the cell; specifically to changes in the relative humidity. This potentiostatic responsiveness from the coaxial cell was characterized experimentally and a hypothesis was developed relating the OCV response to humidity to the chemical potential energy that exists upon the establishments of concentration (activity) gradients.  The Nersnt relation was used to provide quantitative support of the hypothesis through the development of a time-dependent model of the OCV response to the relative humidity. Finite element methods were used to approximate the 1D solution to Fick's diffusion laws to model the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O transport through the polymer electrolyte membrane and calculate the time-varying water concentration profile. The model results provide strong support of the hypothesis that the open-circuit voltage response is based on the time-dependent concentration gradient of water between the inner and outer electrodes of the coaxial cell. These results have implications for applications such as humidity sensors, wearable energy harvesting, and self-powered detection devices.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>According to the 2010 census, the number of African Americans rose from 34.7 million in 2000 to 38.9 million in 2010; this represented a 12% increase in ten years. Similarly during the same time period, Latinos accounted for more than 50 percent of the nation's total population growth (Flores &amp;amp; Oseguera, 2011; U. S. Census Bureau, 2010; U. S. Census Bureau, 2010). Yet, both groups remain underrepresented in higher education. A major determinant of college participation for underrepresented racial minorities is the availability of funding. While individual states and institutions provide financial resources, via various measures, the federal government provides a substantial amount of need based funding in the form of Pell Grants. The College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007 (CCRAA) mandates yearly increases to Pell Grant starting in 2008 and continuing until 2017. The main purpose of CCRAA is to reduce college costs and increase access. However, there is no preliminary evidence that this was accomplished for students once CCRAA was enacted, particularly those who are underrepresented and depend most on Pell Grant funding. With this in mind, the purpose of this study is to investigate the enrollment patterns of African American and Latino students after the enactment of the CCRAA. Multiple regression and fixed effects models were used to examine the enrollment of both minority groups using an institutional level analysis of four-year, degree granting postsecondary institutions. Findings from this study provided a first glimpse into the effectiveness of CCRAA in increasing first-time full time enrollment. Pell Grant increases were found to have a positive effect on Latino student enrollment at four-year institutions, both public and private. These findings have implications, particularly for policy makers and potential students, but also for higher education research.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Previous studies have analyzed various atmospheric tornado parameters in a Tropical Cyclone (TC) environment. This study focuses on the evolution of these parameters through a TC landfall. The TCTOR dataset, which assigns all TC tornadoes to their respective TC, is used to group qualifying events from a pool of 1201 tornadoes during the period of 1995-2010 into eight time intervals relative to TC landfall. The environment is then analyzed using seven operationally used tornado parameters. A statistical, spatial, and sounding analysis is performed to determine how the tornadic environment evolves over time after landfall. Analysis shows that statistically significant differences in the mean value of each parameter are found between pre-landfall, post-landfall, and various time interval comparisons. Composite field charts and case studies show that the wind shear parameters at different vertical layers help explain tornado concentrations in space at different time intervals. In addition, a comparison of composite field charts is made between the larger pool of 32 TCs in the ALL composite and the 10 TCs representing the lowest tercile, with respect to the total number of tornadoes produced. This comparison shows higher magnitudes of shear parameters in the ALL composite. Combined with model derived soundings of three prolific tornado producing TCs, this study shows that the increase in shear in the lowest layer (0-1 km) is the best diagnostic tool to explain the increase in tornado occurrences at TC landfall. This finding supports prior research, which showed that low level shear maxima coincided with tornado locations. The increase in shear in the 0-3 km and 0-6 km layers at later time intervals is found to be the best diagnostic tool to explain the secondary increase in tornado occurrences after 24 hours past TC landfall. Additionally, 24 hours after TC landfall appears to be the critical time that separates weaker TC tornadoes at prior time intervals from stronger ones that resemble mid-latitude cyclone tornadoes that occur after, based on parameter values, hodograph analysis, and conceptual models. Lastly, the Significant Tornado Parameter (STP), used with discretion, is shown to work well in diagnosing tornado occurrence in some time intervals but proves to be a poor tool in others.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation argues that representations of masculinity in the Hollywood war/combat films of the Vietnam film cycle reflect the changing and changed mores of the era in which they were made, and that these representations are so prevalent as to suggest a culture-wide shift in notions of masculinity since the Vietnam War. I demonstrate that the majority of the representations of masculinity in the Vietnam War film cycle (an expression that includes all films on the Vietnam War but particularly those produced in Hollywood) have achieved mythic status--accepted truths--but are often exaggerated and/or are erroneous to the point of affecting how historical events are understood by subsequent generations. Such is the power of cinema. This dissertation, then, adopts a cultural-political-historical perspective to investigate Hollywood's virtual re-creation of the Vietnam War and its combat participants as dystopic, anti-mythopoeic figures whose allegiance to patriotism, God, and duty are shown to be tragically betrayed by a changing paradigm of masculinity and has thus created a new mythos of the American male which abides in the American consciousness to this day. All of which is to ask, why was there such a significant change from admirable cinematic representations of America as a nation that represents the ideology of freedom and liberty for all and U.S. soldiers as the hallmark of strength and goodness in the WW II movies to the mostly wretched representations of both in the Vietnam War cycle? While each chapter of my dissertation will attempt to identify plausible answers to these questions, I will also seek to explore why and how these alterations from the regnant traditions of American values--honoring the military, respecting the government and other traditions, such as the nuclear family, marriage as a sacred institution, monogamy as the respected norm, children as inviolable, gender roles as fixed, separation of the races, etc.--came to such a tumultuous head in the 1960s and resulted in the significantly altered constructs of values and masculinity that have become the norm in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century. In order to investigate historical cinematic representations effectively, it is necessary to consider the actual events of the times and challenge the subsequent various mythopoeic formations of the Hollywood Vietnam veteran.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Categorically-based systems for assessing personality disorders (PDs) have been criticized on a number of grounds, including arbitrary cutoffs for diagnosis, heterogeneity among presentations of the same PD, overuse of PD not otherwise specified, and high comorbidity, both among different PDs, and between PDs and other types of mental disorders. The present study sought to validate the Personality Disorder for DSM-5 (PID-5), a trait-based model for assessing personality disorders. The sample consisted of 212 undergraduates and community members recruited to over-represent individuals with high and low trait fear as well as high and low trait disinhibition. Self-reported PID-5 trait scores were correlated with clinician-rated interview-based personality disorder symptoms. Personality traits specified in Section III of the DSM-5 provided excellent representation of Antisocial PD, Borderline PD, and Avoidant PD interview-based symptoms, moderate representation of Obsessive-Compulsive PD symptoms, and minimal representation of Narcissistic PD symptoms. Further traits were  identified as relevant to PDs without representation in the DSM. Additionally, results indicated that the recruitment strategy augmented the base rates of Cluster B and Cluster C PDs in the sample.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The overall purpose of this study is to establish the baseline for a new line of research into the effective relationship between traditional jazz musicians and swing dancers in current social dancing environments. The study is a mixed-method study utilizing a qualitative study to understand and describe the values and performance practices of musicians who play for swing dancing plus a quantitative study to examine the preferences and behaviors of dancers. The study gathered data at four different Lindy Hop swing dance events throughout the Eastern United States. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Part A of the quantitative section of the study gathered demographics data with an in-person survey form. Demographics data was analyzed with descriptive statistics and tested for significant interactions within the data. A total of 236 dancers participated with 1050 different dances being rated. Participants were closely divided into "leads" (n = 122) and "follows" (n = 112). Results from the demographics study showed a median year of 2009 in which dancers started dancing the Lindy Hop. They also had a median Level of Expertise of Intermediate/Advanced. Leads reported a higher Level of Expertise than follows. Dancers attend dances a median twice a week, and travel from four to eight times a year to Lindy Hop events. The four dance events differed significantly by Starting Year (p = 0.006), Level of Expertise (p &lt; 0.001), Travel Frequency (p = 0.001). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Part B of the quantitative section gathered ratings of individual dances using a dance log in which each participant rated six different dances along five metrics: Dance Rating, Song Rating, Song Familiarity, Partner Familiarity and Partner Skill level. The means and standard deviations for each of the booklets ratings are: Song Rating (M=3.94, SD=0.78), Dance Rating (M=4.01, SD=0.84), Song Familiarity (M=3.09, SD=1.47), Partner Familiarity (M=3.04, SD=1.50), and Partner Skill (M=2.96, SD=1.12). There was a moderate correlation (n=981) between Dance Rating and Song Rating of rs = 0.427. There was a moderate correlation of rs = 0.466 between Song Familiarity and Song Rating (n=1023), and of rs = 0.336 between Dance Rating and Partner Skill (n=979). All other correlations are weak. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The qualitative section utilized interviews of four musicians from the Lindy Hop community that were transcribed to identify markers of influence and descriptive terminology and categorized into five themes: Musician Descriptors, Dancer Descriptors, Environmental Descriptors, Performance Practice Descriptors, and Community Descriptors. Musician Descriptors are variables based on the musician's background and experience. Dancer Descriptors identified factors pertaining to general dancer expectations. Environmental Descriptors center on factors involving the ballroom setting, such as size and audience proximity. Performance Practice Descriptors, the most extensive group describes the specific methods and variables involved in performing for dancers. Community Descriptors lists the ideological values, relationship types and phrases used to describe the swing dance community. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the discussion, each of these three sections are combined to present an overview summary of the demographics, patterns and practices of the Lindy Hop community with the purpose of creating a baseline upon which to base future research.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Over 232,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in 2014 in the United States, and approximately 40,000 women will die from this disease. Similarly, it is estimated that 230,000 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in the United States, and over 29,000 men will die from this disease. These figures make breast cancer and prostate cancer the two most diagnosed cancers in women and men, respectively, and they are both the second leading cause of cancer mortality in their respective genders. These alarming numbers show that we have a long way to go before finding a cure for cancer. Because cancer is a multifaceted disease, systems biology approaches provide excellent ways to fully appreciate and understand its complexity. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The overall theme of this dissertation is the application of data analysis and bioinformatic techniques in order to gain insight to the signaling pathways involved in breast and prostate cancer. High-throughput genomics and proteomics allow for an unprecedented glimpse into the inner workings of biology, particularly in the case of cancer. These relatively inexpensive, high-throughput experiments have given rise to a glut of data that has not been thoroughly analyzed. This means that data analysis and bioinformatics techniques can be applied to large data sets in order to answer questions and unlock new directions in cancer research. Here, a comprehensive differential gene expression analysis and pathway analysis was performed using the breast cancer data from The Cancer Genome Atlas in order to understand health disparity in African American breast cancer. Furthermore, proteomics and phosphoproteomics experimental techniques were applied to better understand the protein expression differences and signaling pathways of an advanced metastatic prostate cancer cell model. Finally, data analysis of patient models for aggressive prostate cancer was performed in order to compare and contrast the differences with the advanced metastatic prostate cancer cell model.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Tropical atmospheric waves play a major role in the variability and change of weather and climate in the tropics as well as in the globe. They also interact with other tropical systems such as tropical cyclones (TCs) and El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The improved understanding of the tropical waves, such as their origins, their spatiotemporal structures, and their life cycles, can lead to better prediction of weather and climate change in the tropics as well as over many other areas of the globe. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Most of the previous diagnoses of observed tropical waves came from two categories: (1) case studies in which individual waves of particular types are examined, leading to scattered information of the spatiotemporal characteristics of these waves; and (2) climatological studies using wavenumber-frequency domain analysis which is not able to identify spatiotemporal inhomogeneity of tropical waves. To fill the gap between these two approaches, we use a recently developed spatiotemporally local analysis method, the multi-dimensional ensemble empirical mode decomposition (MEEMD) method, and known spatial wind structures of different types of waves to systematically extract the evolution information of tropical waves over large temporal and spatial domains. Through further analysis of the extracted wave events, the spatiotemporal inhomogeneity of tropical waves is characterized. In this study, as the very first step toward a comprehensive study, our focus is placed on mixed Rossby-gravity (MRG) waves.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The propagation characteristics, period, and horizontal (zonal and meridional) scale of MRG events detected in this study can match with both the theoretical results and observational studies. There are 23 MRG events detected from the 3rd MEEMD component in the year 2002, among which most events occurred over the western Pacific Ocean and fewest MRG events over the Indian Ocean. The phase velocity and meridional scale are largest over the Atlantic Ocean while smallest in the Indian Ocean. The locations and propagation characteristics of MRG events show great spatiotemporal inhomogeneity. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>After the evolution of MRG events are obtained, they can be connected with TCs. A new hypothesis, which better matches the observation, is proposed  that the swelling and westward propagation of MRG wave pattern help the TCs moving westward and toward higher latitudes, which is necessary for TCs to develop at early stage.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The Violin Futura Project is a set of recitals featuring currently 34 commissioned solo violin miniatures written for and performed by Piotr Szewczyk. It showcases the multitude of divergent styles and compositional approaches present on the musical scene at the beginning of the 21st Century. Three levels of analysis are performed in this treatise: archetypal, harmonic, and extended notation/techniques. Archetypal analysis shows the connections to the past as seen</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>in these modern pieces, and puts them in a socio-cultural and musical context. Analysis of harmonic language and extended techniques showcases the divergent approaches and pedagogical challenges. The chapter on pedagogical approaches talks about the various approaches to learning and interpreting these and other contemporary pieces. Conclusion draws larger connections and gives advice to violinists and pedagogues on ways to incorporate contemporary music into pedagogical and performance settings, how to find and connect with</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>composers, how to develop specific skills needed for interpretation and performance of contemporary music.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>In order to avoid repeating the patterns of past failed technology initiatives, eschew various types of paralyzing blame cultures, capitalize on the momentum offered by outside stakeholder interest, and maintain the agency to stay consistent with our own techno-theories and pedagogies, this study develops a model writing program administrators (WPAs) can utilize in order to create sustainable programmatic technology inclusion (SPTI) in their First Year Composition (FYC) programs. In order to achieve this, this study uses a national survey of FYC stakeholders and interviews and focus groups with FYC directors, instructors, and students at three different institutional types to explore the comprehensiveness and usefulness of Dickie Selfe's framework of a three-step process and three additional complications from Sustainable Computer Environments. The findings from this research are then paired with Kristie Fleckenstein et al.'s "ecology of mind" from "A Portable Ecology" to create a sustainability-focused constellation of interrelated and interdependent ecologies that can serve as a model for WPAs to embed in their own institutional contexts and employ in their FYC programs.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This study examined whether pre-service teachers demonstrated bias when presented with reading assessment results in graphical form accompanied by a description of pseudo-students that differed across three achievement levels (low, average, or above average) by race, gender, and socioeconomic status (SES). Bias influenced by race, gender, and SES has been observed to influence teacher-student relationships, students' reading and mathematics gains, and students' emotional and behavioral self-regulation. This study addressed the following research questions: (a) to what extent are pre-service teachers biased in their ratings of students' achievement based on demographic factors: race, gender, socioeconomic status, and students' depicted vocabulary and reading performance levels?  (b) to what extent do pre-service teacher characteristics influence bias, and if they do, which teacher characteristics appear to be related to the bias? This study surveyed 144 pre-service teachers who completed a survey developed by the researcher. In this survey, pre-service teacher participants were provided a graph of vocabulary, decoding, and reading comprehension fall and spring percentile ranks and asked to evaluate the reading ability of 24 pseudo-students with profiles that varied by race, gender, and SES across 3 performance levels. Pseudo-student profiles were systematically counterbalanced so that there were no differences in reading and vocabulary scores by profiles within achievement groups. The profiles of the pseudo-students were randomly presented to pre-service teacher participants. Results revealed that pre-service teachers demonstrated bias in their judgments of students' reading capabilities based on gender and race in their ratings, and this differed by SES and performance level - a 4-way interaction effect. Overall, except for low SES students with average achievement, pre-service teachers rated the reading skills of white boys much more favorably. Next, pre-service teachers tended to rate black girls more favorably, particularly when they were low performing low SES, average and above average performing higher SES students.  With a few exceptions, pre-service teachers showed notable negative bias against white girls and black boys. It is important to keep in mind that there were no differences in achievement among the pseudo-student profiles within performance groups. Observed bias was generally greater for pre-service teachers who were early in their academic training compared to those who were farther along in their training. Given the research evidence that teachers' expectations influence student achievement, the bias observed has implications for practice and future research.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this dissertation, I explore how a community in East Los Angeles, California planned a urban greenway routed by local schools and to what extent schoolchildren use the trail.  Previous research has largely focused on greenways as a community amenity for adults.  However in this study, I investigate schoolchildren's use of an urban rail-trail.  With this greenway being routed near schools, I explore to what extent, if any, are schoolchildren using the greenway to actively travel to school.  Though there is extensive literature on both greenways and active travel to school as discrete research topics, there is a gap in the literature concerning whether or not greenways can serve as an environmental support for children's active travel behavior to school.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Concerning the research design, I used a single case study approach to document the critical case of the Whittier Greenway.  After conducting a nation-wide search, I selected this case based on the following criteria.  First, I located greenways routed near school properties.  Second, I prioritized urban greenway sites over rural greenway sites.  I selected Whittier, California because it has sufficient density where children's active travel to school is more likely to occur than in more rural settings. For the methodology, I interviewed key individuals who have historical knowledge of the trail, analyzed planning documentation, and retrieved archival resources to create a rich descriptive account of how the greenway was created.  To determine children's greenway use and active travel behaviors, I employed survey methodology at three schools with property adjacent to the greenway: two elementary schools and one high school.  One of the three schools has restrictive access to the greenway.  Each school has a largely Latino student population.  I used student surveys at the high school and parents surveys at the elementary schools.  Both surveys are adapted from the nationally recognized Safe Routes to School survey to include greenway use and behavior questions.   To determine children's use of the greenway, I employed descriptive statistics and performed a content analysis.  Also, I ran descriptive statistics, a logistic regression, and a Pearson's Chi-Square analysis to address the extent that schoolchildren are using the greenway to travel to school.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Concerning the findings, this case illustrates how a city planned and created an urban greenway. Serving as the catalyst that started the project and part of the general planning process, participation played a vital role in the creation of the Whittier Greenway.  This case also reveals how one community successfully planned and constructed an urban rail-trail without the use of a city's general funds.  A further analysis of the survey results reveals that both children and youth use the greenway as a recreational amenity.  Though high school students use the greenway for recreation, their most common use of the greenway was traveling to destinations within their community.  From a sample of active travelers, the results show that greenways may make it easier for high school students to walk or cycle to school compared to walking or cycling through neighborhoods.   Distance and traveling with a companion are significant predictors that influence students' use of a greenway when traveling to school.  As the distance from home to school increases, high school students are more likely to take the greenway to travel to school as compared to active travel through neighborhoods.  High school students are also more likely to use the greenway to go to school if they travel alone rather than with a companion.  For other communities contemplating a greenway project, the Whittier Case offers greenway practitioners' lessons on how to plan and fund an urban greenway near schools.  In addition to being a recreational support, the Whittier Greenway serves as a transportation corridor for high school students to travel to school among other community destinations.  In terms of policy implications, evidence from this case suggests that a greenway intervention near schools may be a viable strategy worth further testing to promote active travel to school in other communities.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Hindbrain glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) neurons project to numerous feeding-relevant forebrain areas.  One such region is the lateral septum (LS), which plays a role in learning, motivation, and stress.  We hypothesized that stimulation of GLP-1R in the LS affects food intake.  Rats were implanted with unilateral cannulas targeting the LS, and intra-LS injections were made 30 min before dark cycle onset.  We examined the effects of the GLP-1R agonist Exendin 4 (Ex4) at doses subthreshold for effect when delivered to the lateral ventricle (0.01 or 0.025 µg).  Ex4 had no effect on feeding at 2 and 4 h into the dark phase, but the 0.025 &amp;#956;g dose suppressed overnight intake.  We then assessed the effects of ventricle-subthreshold doses (1.0, 2.5, 5.0, or 10.0 µg) of the GLP-1R antagonist Exendin (9-39) (Ex9) vs vehicle injected into the LS.  Ex9 increased chow intake at 2, 4, and 20 hours post-dark onset relative to vehicle.  We assessed the role of LS GLP-1R in motivation for food by examining operant responding for sucrose on progressive ratio (PR) schedule.  Intra-LS injections of Ex9 (10.0 µg) or vehicle were made 45 min prior to the start of the PR session.  We also tested PR responding after a nutrient preload designed to maximize GLP-1 neuron activation.  The preload strongly suppressed PR responding, but blockade of LS GLP-1R did not affect motivation for sucrose in either preload condition.  The Ensure preload significantly suppressed 24-hour chow intake relative to no preload condition.  However, intra-LS Ex9 treatment significantly reduced this compensatory reduction in chow intake after the preload.   These experiments suggest that the LS is a relevant site for neuronal GLP-1 influence on food intake.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Health issues, such as sexually transmitted infections, would traditionally be addressed in information campaigns such as print or commercial (radio or video) public service announcements (PSAs).  However, these information-based campaigns have been found to have unintended negative effects and cause resistance to the message, such as psychological reactance and counterarguing.  Health messages included in entertainment programming, called entertainment education, are thought to be more effective than the information-based campaigns more blatant attempts at persuasion. This dissertation investigated 1) if modeling a safe sex behavior in combination with an injunctive norms cue (depiction of social sanctions that indicated a reward for an adaptive behavior and/or a punishment for a maladaptive behavior) in an entertainment program significantly influenced norms perceptions, 2) if modeling a safe sex behavior in combination with an injunctive norms cue in an entertainment program significantly influenced the accessibility of norms perceptions, 3)  whether including an explicit descriptive norms cue (depiction of the prevalence of a safe sex behavior) in addition to the modeled behavior with an injunctive norms cue increased the influence of the program on norms perceptions/the accessibility of norms perceptions, and 4) if perceptions/the accessibility of norms perceptions were mediating factors between identification/perceived similarity with characters and behavioral intent.  In study one (n = 106), participants were randomly assigned to view one of two conditions: a health message that featured a modeled behavior with an injunctive norms cue or a control message. Results demonstrated that a) exposure to a health message that featured a modeled behavior with an injunctive norms cue can influence the accessibility of injunctive norms perceptions in viewers and b) the effect of identification and perceived similarity on behavioral intent was mediated by the accessibility of injunctive norms regarding sexual health behavior. A second study was conducted to replicate the results of study one and investigate if the addition of an explicit descriptive norms cue was more influential than just the modeled behavior with an injunctive norms cue.  In study two (n = 140), participants were randomly assigned to view one of three conditions: a health message that featured a modeled behavior with an injunctive and descriptive norms cue, a health message that featured a modeled behavior with an injunctive norms cue only, or a control message. Results of study two demonstrated that a) a single mediated message can influence the perceptions of injunctive norms in viewers, b) the effect of identification and perceived similarity on behavioral intent were mediated by the perceptions/accessibility of injunctive norms perceptions, and c) the addition of an explicit descriptive norms cue was not more influential than just the modeled behavior with an injunctive norms cue. The results as well as theoretical and practical implications are discussed. Further, suggestions for future research are offered.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The DNA in the eukaryotic genome is wrapped in 147--bp segments around an octamer of histone proteins to form the fundamental subunit of chromatin, the nucleosome. Nucleosomes regulate the access of proteins to DNA, thus regulating important DNA-templated events such as transcription, translation, recombination, and repair. In order to characterize the chromatin landscape in maize, we mapped nucleosome positions using micrococcal nuclease (MNase) to enrich for nucleosomal DNA. We mapped nucleosomes under a variety of experimental conditions and in different tissues. We identified an unexpected, nonuniform source of variation which we traced to the degree to which chromatin is digested with MNase. We exploited this property to identify nucleosomes in the maize genome that possessed unique biochemical traits as being hypersensitive or hyper-resistant to MNase digestion. These regions were associated with important biological processes, including gene expression levels, transcription-factor binding, and highly-conserved noncoding sequences. In addition, we found that these nucleosomes displayed tissue specificity, implicating this special type of chromatin feature in regulating gene expression under different cell physiologies. We extended this work to the human genome and made similar discoveries: hypersensitive nucleosomes were associated with gene expression levels and were enriched in important regulatory elements. We also found hyper-resistant nucleosomes to be highly-associated with paused RNA polymerase II, implicating these nucleosomes in regulating transcriptional elongation. Thus, our approach to chromatin profiling uncovers novel biochemical states of multicellular organisms that are likely important for transcription, differentiation, and cellular responses.</DISS_para>

From the 1925 birth of the Grand Ole Opry and Ralph Peer's 1927 &amp;ldquo;discovery&amp;rdquo; of Jimmie Rodgers and the Carter Family in Bristol, country music emerged from the &amp;ldquo;hillbilly&amp;rdquo; culture of the Cumberland Gap and gained nationwide credibility through efforts by promoters to combat concerns of emotive and sonic disorder and recklessness. They presented their performers, programs, and songs as utterly congruous with what they imagined to be a cultural standard of inoffensive religious feeling, sourced from and complicit in Protestant values. In Rodgers and the Carters, subsequent industry players embraced an affective discourse centered on the mortal threats of sin and the positive feelings associated transcendence. The mastery of this discourse contributed directly to the industrial standardization of country music's norms. Throughout the Depression and Postwar eras, producers and songwriters adopted a language of &amp;ldquo;good-naturedness,&amp;rdquo; shorthand for a religious predisposition toward depression and its cessation, in a bid to sell records and increase exposure. This emergent para-Protestant affective-industrial complex contributed directly to country music's habitation in Nashville, now known worldwide both for Protestant governance and country music culture. It framed the successes of crossover stars like Roy Acuff and Claude Ely while complicating the careers of legends like Hank Williams. The Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum demonstrates the ways this affective discourse continues to influence the memory and business of American country music.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In a post-modern society, creativity is the key to both cultural and economic prosperity in the U.S. and in the world. The creative sector has become an important element of the economy, and it also contributes to the cultural wellbeing of the community and generates social progress. For many small towns and rural communities across the U.S. that struggle with stagnation and decline, developing the creative sector may offer an array of benefits including improving local economies, empowering the community from within, and bringing about socially useful development outcomes. This research investigates the role of art industries in small town revitalization with a focus on the empowerment impact. Using a multiple-case study design and mixed methods, the research evaluates the empowerment effects of different art programs in two pairs of small towns located in Georgia and Florida. In each pair, one town has a major art program while the other does not. The two pairs of small towns are: Colquitt, GA and Camilla, GA, and Mt. Dora, FL and Minneola, FL. The research has found empirical evidence for the empowerment effect of art programs on the participants and the community. Further, the research has constructed explanations on how and why such impact takes place through a`Creativity-based Empowerment and Development Model'. The findings of the research offer crucial guidelines for community leaders, development planners and policy makers to design effective programs and policies associated with community development and creative industries.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The dissertation stage, a time of independent research for doctoral students, is characterized by a lack of interactions with peers and faculty members, including the faculty dissertation advisor, that are typically present during earlier stages of doctoral programs (Ali &amp; Kohun, 2006; Gardner, 2008b, 2009).  As a result, students in the dissertation stage may experience isolation.  This isolation, a result of a lack of interactions with faculty and peers, can lead to dropout from the doctoral program (Ali &amp; Kohun, 2006).  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>     Given that students have the most frequent interactions with the dissertation advisor during the dissertation stage (i.e., Ali &amp; Kohun, 2006), this study aimed to understand how faculty dissertation advisors aid in students' persistence during the dissertation stage.  Specifically, the study answered (1) how faculty dissertation advisors define their role during the dissertation stage, (2) general strategies advisors use during the dissertation stage to help students persist, (3) strategies used by advisors to assist different types of students during the dissertation stage, and (4) how advisors facilitate academic and social integration at the dissertation stage.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>     This study utilized a mixed methods research design to understand dissertation advisors' role in students' persistence during the dissertation stage (Fraenkel &amp; Wallen, 2009).  Specifically, faculty dissertation advisors from one college of education at a research university in the southeastern region completed a questionnaire and a subset of these faculty participated in a follow-up interview.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>    Consistent with Barnes and Austin's (2009) findings, results showed that participants utilized several functions, including collaborating, mentoring, advocating, and chastising to perform their role during the dissertation stage.  Participants also valued several characteristics, friendly/professional, collegial, supportive/caring, accessible, and honest, when performing their role as dissertation advisor.  Additionally, participants indicated they use a series of general strategies, which Barnes and Austin termed as helping advisees be successful.   </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>     Interview findings also identified five categories of threats to students' persistence during the dissertation stage, as well as corresponding strategies participants used to help advisees maneuver these threats to persistence.  The themes included advisees' personal responsibilities, psychological concerns, time, dissertation project hurdles, and isolation.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>     While Tinto's (1993) model of doctoral student persistence failed to elaborate on how the dissertation advisor facilitates academic and social integration during the dissertation stage, results indicated that, in general, faculty dissertation advisors do at least encourage advisees' academic integration by helping advisees plan and conduct research, aiding in their professional and workforce development, and encouraging them to publish articles and/or publishing articles with advisees.  Additionally, dissertation advisors encourage advisees to connect with their peers and with faculty members inside and outside the academic department.  However, less than half of participants encouraged advisees to connect with staff and administrators in the campus-wide community.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>     Results of this study can be used to further research on the doctoral student experience and the advisor's role in that experience.  Additionally, findings from this study can be used by dissertation advisors, academic departments, and university administrators in policy and standards of practice to help ensure students' persistence during doctoral programs, especially during the dissertation stage.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The advent of high-throughput techniques has led to exponential increase in the size of biological data encoded in various formats and stored in different databases. This has posed challenges for biological scientists to retrieve, use, analyze, and integrate data. To meet the urgent need of organizing a massive amount of heterogeneous data, there has been a trend towards the development of bio-ontologies. Among many current bio-ontologies, the Gene Ontology (GO) is one of the most successful and has been widely used across different biological communities. This study applied Activity Theory and Stvilia's Information Quality Assessment Framework to examine the infrastructure supporting the development, maintenance, and use of the GO among different biological communities. Employing the netnographic approach, this study gathered data in a natural setting via archival data analysis, participant observations, and qualitative semi-structured interviews.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The findings indicated that the GO was collaboratively developed and maintained by a consortium of biological communities, mainly model organism databases. Representatives from each of the GO Consortium member were assigned the role of GO curators and formed into groups working on different aspects of the GO. The division of labor within the GO Consortium ensures that the formidable ontology development process can be divided into manageable projects. The GO Consortium consists of not only biocurators but also software engineers and bioinformaticians, providing technical and software support. As an open community, the GO Consortium has been bringing in new groups and welcomes any individuals to submit content for inclusion in the GO database. GO's collaborative development approach can be adopted by other similar ontologies or large-scale sociotechnical systems.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	This study also provided a rich description of GO's data quality work and a conceptualization of GO's data quality structure, including a typology of GO's data quality problems and corresponding quality assurance actions. This knowledge base can be used for the design and management of similar sociotechnical systems and the development of best practices for knowledge organization system curation in molecular biology and biomedicine. The data curation skills that were perceived important for the GO can not only inform the training of biocurators, but also give new insight into the curriculum design and training in Library and Information Science and Data Science. The findings of this study can benefit the GO by identifying various data quality issues and contradictions in its data curation work as well as suggesting strategies and actions for improvement. Future research includes developing quantitative models for assessing the quality of different aspects of GO's data curation work. Netnographic studies can be conducted with different groups and teams within the GO Consortium to investigate their data practices and collaboration patterns, which can inform the design of support repertoires for scientific teams.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Mixture IRT modeling allows the detection of latent classes and different item parameter profile patterns across latent classes. In Rasch mixture model estimation, latent classes are assumed to follow a normal distribution with means constrained to be equal across latent classes for the model identification purpose. In the literature, this conventional constraint was shown to be problematic in establishing a common scale and comparing item profile patterns across different latent classes. In this study, a simulation study was conducted to explore the degree of recovery of class membership. Also, the class membership recovery of the conventional constraint approach was compared to the class-invariant item constraint approach. The results show that the recovery of class membership has the similar recovery for both approaches. In addition, the consistency of class membership for two approaches is consistent with each other.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Coefficient Omega was introduced by McDonald (1978) as a reliability coefficient of composite scores for the congeneric model. Interval estimation (Neyman, 1937) on coefficient Omega provides a range of plausible values which is likely to capture the population reliability of composite scores. The Wald method, likelihood method, and bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap method are three methods to construct confidence interval for coefficient Omega (e.g., Cheung, 2009b; Kelley &amp; Cheng, 2012; Raykov, 2002, 2004, 2009; Raykov &amp; Marcoulides, 2004; Padilla &amp; Divers, 2013). Very limited number of studies on the evaluation of these three methods can be found in the literature (e.g., Cheung, 2007, 2009a, 2009b; Kelley &amp; Cheng, 2012; Padilla &amp; Divers, 2013). No simulation study has been conducted to evaluate the performance of these three methods for interval construction on coefficient Omega. In the current simulation study, I assessed these three methods by comparing their empirical performance on interval estimation for coefficient Omega. Four factors were included in the simulation design: sample size, number of items, factor loading, and degree of nonnormality. Two thousands datasets were generated in R 2.15.0 (R Core Team, 2012) for each condition. For each generated dataset, three approaches (i.e., the Wald method, likelihood method, and bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap method) were used to construct 95% confidence interval of coefficient Omega in R 2.15.0. The results showed that when the data were multivariate normally distributed, three methods performed equally well and coverage probabilities were very close to the prespecified .95 confidence level. When the data were multivariate nonnormally distributed, coverage probabilities decreased and interval widths became wider for all three methods as the degree of nonnormality increased. In general, when the data departed from the multivariate normality, the BCa bootstrap method performed better than the other two methods, with relatively higher coverage probabilities, while the Wald and likelihood methods were comparable and yielded narrower interval width than the BCa bootstrap method.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study is a content analysis of China-related research published in three prominent communication peer-viewed journals, Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly, Journal of Communication, and Communication Research between 1979, the year after China started to implement its reform and opening-up policy and 2013. The purpose of this study is to discover potential trends in China-related research published in the communication field. Thus, every peer-reviewed article pertaining to mainland China (N = 55) is considered as a unit of analysis. This inquiry focuses on the nature of the topic covered, the theoretical framework, methodological details, research questions and hypotheses as well as authorship, statistical approach, sampling method and source of data. Results indicated that American institutions published the largest amount of communication research on China. Political issue and public opinion was the most popular research topic addressed dominantly through quantitative method and most specifically with content analyses. The published research, tested through hypotheses more than research questions, dominantly featured theoretical framework and more precisely agenda-setting. Statistically, frequency was used in the majority of articles. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides an effective approach to track the labeled pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs) for neural transplantation and neurological disorder treatments.  However, labeling the thawed cells after cryopreservation can be limited by the inefficient intracellular labeling and variations in labeling efficiency.  Therefore, cryopreservation of the pre-labeled cells can provide uniform cell population and operational convenience for the following in vitro and in vivo investigations.  In this study, the feasibility of cryopreserving PSC-derived NPC aggregates labeled with micron-sized particles of iron oxide (MPIO) was investigated.  The NPC aggregates derived from embryoid body formation were labeled in suspension with different concentrations of MPIO in the range of 0-100 ug Fe per mL.  The results indicated that intracellular MPIO incorporation was retained after cryopreservation (70-80% labeling efficiency), which did not significantly affect cell recovery, proliferation, cytotoxicity and neural lineage commitment.  MRI analysis was performed in the phantom tissue environment using cell layers with different MPIO exposures separated by agarose gels.  The results showed comparable detectability for the MPIO-labeled cells before and after cryopreservation indicated by T2 and T2* relaxation rates.  These findings indicate the feasibility of cryopreserving MPIO-labeled PSC-derived NPC aggregates for potential cell banking toward various in vitro and in vivo cell tracking studies.</DISS_para>

      <DISS_content>
         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The market for solar energy has been expanding rapidly worldwide. However, due to the weather conditions, photovoltaic (PV) systems generally have considerable power variations, which include voltage fluctuations and frequency variations. As a result, the connected power systems may experience adverse effects from the fluctuating power generated by the PV system. The intermittent power generation of a solar farm can perturb the supply and demand balance of the whole power system. For stability, a power network requires a spinning reserve, which increases with the growth of PV installations and inevitably degrades the efficiency of power generation. Therefore, mitigating the adverse effects on the grid from an intermittent PV source is expected to be essential for increasing the penetration level of PV systems. Recently, battery energy storage system (BESS) has been seen as a promising solution to help PV integration, due to the flexible real power control of the batteries. Unfortunately, this technique has not been applied extensively due to the high cost of batteries. If chosen, battery storage needs to be designed methodically, which is critical for the owners of PV.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Firstly in this dissertation, an original sizing strategy is proposed for a dispersed BESS in distribution feeders with distributed PV systems. The main functions of the dispersed BESS are overvoltage reduction and peak-load shaving. The benefits and cost analysis of the installed dispersed BESS are conducted. Under high penetration level of PV systems, to assess the effect of the dispersed BESS on overvoltage reduction, the proposed cost-benefit analysis uses the work stress of voltage regulation devices as a reference. The factors of load shifting, peaking power generation, as well as dispersed BESS costs and an estimation of lifetime are considered in the annual cost calculation. In particular, lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) batteries and lead-acid batteries have been selected to demonstrate the proposed method on the modified GE distribution feeders. The economic analysis of these two types of battery can determine the lower cost battery type and the cost-effective size design for the dispersed BESS on different locations in the distribution system under high PV penetration level.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Secondly, this dissertation proposed a method to optimize the design of a centralized BESS capacity and the energy management system (EMS) based on a utility revenue analysis for a large-scale PV plant application. The battery storage, which is controlled by the EMS, aims to enhance the integration into the grid of a large PV plant by shaping the fluctuating PV plant output into a relatively constant power and supporting the peak load. LiFePO4 batteries and lead-acid batteries are used to demonstrate the proposed method in a utility model. The lifetime and the systematic performance of these two types of battery are compared. Furthermore, the change in utility revenue caused by the installed battery storage can be calculated and maximized based on the proposed method to determine the optimal design of BESS capacity and EMS for a large PV power plant application.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>These two proposed methods can offer insights into the performance and economic analysis of a BESS in PV applications for project designers and business stakeholders. With the help of the developed methods, BESS designs can be optimized for any PV application with the necessary changes according to practical application. Finally, the scope of future work is discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this dissertation is to examine how horizontal and vertical governance structure affects energy and sustainability policymaking at the local level. Although sustainability is an important issue at all levels of government in the American federal system, local governments increasingly play a major role in the development and implementation of policies directed at enhancing environmental outcomes such as energy conservation. Accordingly, sustainability research is beginning to shift more of its attention to municipalities, developing a framework for understanding global climate change as a local issue, and examining the influence and corresponding effects local institutions have in the implementation of sustainability policies. However, previous studies tend to overlook the importance and impact of intergovernmental relations on urban sustainability outcomes. The dissertation particularly analyzes how the relations between local and higher-level governments influence local institutional structures in addressing energy conservation and climate change concerns, as well as "green" energy policy outcomes at the local level. This research advances our theoretical understanding of interlocal collaboration and the impact of federal grant programs on local implementation efforts. This dissertation contains three essays. The first essay examines how state laws and institutions influence interlocal collaboration. The second essay analyzes how federal rules and regulations affect local governmental decisions to engage in collective action. Finally, the third essay determines the direct impact of a federal grant program on local green policy outcomes.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this dissertation, we investigate the edge spin excitations and reconstructions of quantum Hall (QH) liquids. Edge spin reconstructions reflect the interplay of confining potential, electron-electron interaction, and Zeeman splitting at the edges of QH liquids. The main method used in this dissertation is the exact diagonalization calculation for finite size systems. The QH liquids studied in this dissertation are classified into three kinds, based on their topological properties and statistics of quasiparticles (quasiholes).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The first kind of QH liquids is spin-polarized QH liquids. The QH liquids with filling factors &amp;nu = 1 and 1/3 are studied in this kind. We find the low-energy excitations of the &amp;nu = 1 and 1/3 are bosonic edge spin waves. Instabilities of these ferromagnetic state with altering confinement strength result from the softening of these spin waves and formation of edge spin textures. A microscopic trial wave function is used to study the edge instabilities of larger systems with particle number up to 40, and the obtained results are consistent to the ones calculated by exact diagonalization.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The second kind of QH liquids is spin-unpolarized QH liquids. The liquids with &amp;nu = 2, 2/5 and 2/3 are studied in this kind. When &amp;nu = 2, exact diagonalization on edge electron systems indicates that compact Hartree-Fock states with different total spin always become ground states in some regions of parameter space, and the ground states appearing between two compact states are their edge spin waves. The initial &amp;nu = 2 instability is toward the compact state with total spin 1. At &amp;nu = 2/5, the edge instabilities is also triggered by softening of the edge spin waves with smoother confinement. The situation of &amp;nu = 2/3 unpolarized QH liquids is a little different, because it has one backward-moving edge spin wave mode and one forward-moving magnetoplasmon mode. There is no mystery about what kind of instability would occur with stronger or smoother confinement. The exact diagonalization calculation of finite systems can reproduce the instability induced by edge spin wave at the stronger confinement side and gives an estimate about the critical value of confining potential. But instability due to edge magnetoplasmon mode can not be realized in small</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>size systems because of the high velocity of this mode.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The last kind is the non-Abelian QH liquid (at &amp;nu = 5/2). Its edge instability triggered by softening of edge magnetoplasmon excitations with smoother confinement.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Three different confinements are compared in the study of integer QH liquids in finite size systems. And some quantitative predictions on the edge instabilities for a certain type of confining potential are reached in the thermodynamic limit. The effect of Zeeman splitting to the edge instabilities is also considered in this dissertation.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The dissertation research is focused on improving performance on genome wide nucleosome positioning. Nucleosome is the basic structural unit of DNA in eukaryotic cells. As nucleosomes limit the accessibility of the wrapped DNA to transcription factors and other DNA-binding proteins, their positions play an essential role in regulations of gene activities. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Experiments have indicated that DNA sequence strongly influences nucleosome positioning by enhancing or reducing their binding ability to nucleosomes, therefore providing an intrinsic cell regulatory mechanism. While some sequence features are known to be nucleosome forming or nucleosome inhibiting, however, existing models have limited accuracy in predicting quantitatively</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>nucleosomes occupancy (i.e., statistical nucleosome positioning) based on DNA sequence.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The study developed several algorithms to produce better features as well as more accuracy models to predict nucleosome positioning. It first proposed several models to classify a given DNA sequence as nucleosome forming sequence or nucleosome inhibiting sequence. Then, it turns the focus to predict the probability that a basepair is covered by any nucleosome. Moreover, based on a one basepair dataset, it found an intrinsic pattern which can be used to develop a single base pair nucleosome localization algorithm. Experimental results have shown the proposed methods are</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>comparable or better than all existing solutions.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Competitive dynamics is the study of firms' competitive moves; and corporate governance is the study of the influence of boards of directors on managers. Both areas of study have revealed important factors that affect performance, such as making aggressive competitive moves and incentivizing managers (Ferrier, Smith, &amp; Grimm, 1999; Sanders &amp; Hambrick, 2007). Despite the ramifications of both perspectives on important firm outcomes, prior research has not linked these two areas. Traditionally, competitive dynamics research has focused on the market conditions and resources that encourage and enable firms to undertake aggressive competitive actions. Yet, research in this stream has not focused on the influence of directors or managers in this process. In this sense, competitive dynamics research has made predictions that are inconsistent with corporate governance research by inadvertently assuming that all managers are equally motivated and equally capable of enacting resources toward aggressive competitive actions.  Corporate governance research, on the other hand, has focused on the mechanisms (i.e., monitoring, incentives, and guidance) that boards use to encourage and enable managers to act in shareholders' best interests. Yet, research on corporate governance has not linked these mechanisms to competitive interactions among rivalrous firms. Using data from the restaurant industry from 2006-2012, the results support the idea that corporate governance influences competitive aggression. Results also suggest that industry-specific experience has direct and interactive effects that enhance performance, whereas extra-industry experience can be misapplied and harm short-term performance.  By combining these two areas I provide a realistic and comprehensive model of the way that boards and managers influence competitive outcomes. In doing so, I extend Chen's (1996) attention-motivation-capability theoretical framework to show that managers differ in their motivation and capability and that these differences are a driving force behind firm-variance in competitive moves.</DISS_para>
