         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In the past decade, FDOT has carried out network-level decisions through the utilization of AASHTO Pontis Bridge Management System. Like most states, Florida DOT had been previously using a customized version of the 1997 AASHTO CoRe Element Guide and developed its inspection, deterioration and cost frameworks using the 1997 capabilities. In compliance with the MAP-21 directive, Florida modified its procedures of bridge inspection data collection, cost, and deterioration and preservation models development based on the new AASHTO 2013 manual.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This thesis research was aimed at developing a Semi-markov based preservation model based on the revised bridge inspection process. The changes however, required a revision of past deterioration models, both Markov and Semi-markov. Thus, transition probabilities based on the two-parameter Weibull distribution describing the natural deterioration of each element were generated and consequently, optimized preservation policies. This task required a review of Florida bridge data, creating a time-based deterioration model and thereafter, generating preservation actions to be taken on the bridge elements.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A literature review of state DOT inspection and preservation manuals, the, NBIS requirements, AASHTO BrM 5.2.1 documentation and other helpful publications was also conducted in the process.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The network-level optimization model was established with the application of linear programming algorithms and stochastic theories.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Accumulating evidence suggests that individuals with a history of multiple traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) are at increased risk for developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) when compared to trauma exposed individuals without a TBI history. These findings, coupled with the overwhelming prevalence of blast-related TBI endured by American soldiers in current military theatres, highlight the urgent need to investigate processes linking TBI with elevated risk for PTSD. Research has indicated a variety of executive functioning deficits associated with TBI that point towards prefrontal cortex dysfunction similar to those observed among individuals at risk for PTSD. These deficits have been linked to PTSD through fear conditioning and extinction paradigms, in which those with greater fear conditioning and/or deficient fear extinction are at increased risk for PTSD. The current study was the first to investigate fear conditioning and extinction abnormalities as putative mechanisms explaining the link between TBI history and risk for PTSD. Results indicated that individuals with a history of TBIs did not exhibit aberrations in rates of fear conditioning or extinction. However, a history of TBIs was associated with greater overall reactivity throughout each phase of the protocol. Interestingly, individuals with a history of TBIs also demonstrated slowed habituation of reactivity to the unconditioned stimulus, though this effect was trending. These results suggest that TBI may be linked with PTSD not through rates of fear conditioning and extinction, but through greater reactivity to novel and potentially threatening stimuli as well as slowed habituation to aversive stimuli.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation presents biostratigraphic, taxonomic and paleoceanographic studies of sediment cores from low-latitude Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Legs 154 (Site 929), 115 (Site 709), and 202 (Site 1237). Three major paleoceanographic events are featured: 1) the Oi-glacial events in the early-late Oligocene, 2) the Late Oligocene Warming Event (LOWE), and 3) the Oligocene/Miocene Boundary and Mi-1 glacial event. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	 In Chapter Two, a new modified calcareous nannofossil zonation is proposed for the low latitudes that is composed of five major zones and three subzones between 24-30 Ma in age. The first occurrences of Sphenolithus avis, S. ciperoensis, Crassidiscus backmanii along with an increase in abundance of S. ciperoensis, and the last occurrences of S. predistentus, Crassidiscus backmanii and S. ciperoensis are synchronous and reliable throughout the tropics. The last occurrences of Sphenolithus distentus and S. avis are considered unreliable events due to a possible reworking of the former taxon and a diachronous occurrence of the latter. The last occurrences of Helicosphaera compacta and S. pseudoradians are only found in two out of three basins and thus are used as secondary events. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The spatial and temporal distributions of calcareous nannofossil assemblages show major variations within the three tropical/subtropical sites. Sphenolithus taxa were found in low abundances in the Atlantic Ocean. Weak tolerance to low salinity is proposed since salinity declined in the Atlantic Ocean during the late Oligocene glacial events due to episodes of freshwater and terrigenous discharge from the Amazon River. This also lowered the δ18O values of seawater at Site 929 compared with the other sites. Furthermore, Site 929 was not far from its present-day position near the mouth of the Amazon River, thus, the low salinity levels best explains the observed major decline in Sphenolithus taxa.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Calcareous nannofossil relative abundances (%) and bulk oxygen and carbon stable isotope data reveal a covariant response to glacial (Oi) events. During glacial events, temperate-, cool-water and eutrophic taxa dominated the tropical assemblage, whereas warm and oligotrophic taxa declined. This increase in temperate and cool-water taxa suggest that the tropical surface oceans witnessed a decrease in temperature that allowed cool-, and temperate-water taxa to extend their geographic range into the tropical zone. The Oligocene global glacial events (Oi-2*, Oi-2a, Oi-2b, and Oi-2c) were associated with accelerated upwelling in which eutrophic conditions prevailed and r-mode taxa dominated the total nannofossil abundance.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Both Sphenolithus predistentus and Helicosphaera species show prominent increases during glacial (Oi) events. Unlike other Sphenolithus taxa that favored high salinity, S. predistentus increased in abundance during glacial events characterized by high δ18O and δ13C values. Similarly, Helicosphaera taxa show the same pattern with sporadic occurrences. This suggests that S. predistentus and Helicosphaera species were adapted to increased levels of nutrient (eutrophic or mesotrophic). Between 24-25 Ma, warm and oligotrophic taxa increased drastically and dominated the overall assemblage. However, bulk sediment δ18O and δ13C values at the three sites do not show a consistent decreasing trend similar to the global composite deep-sea isotopic record. Although the paleoecological group suggests oligotrophic conditions associated with dominate warm water, the paleotemperature of the sea surface during the LOWE was not as warm as during the Eocene hyperthermals.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	In Chapter Three, a new and significant late Oligocene Sphenolithus species is described from the tropical ODP materials. The new species, Sphenolithus avis, has a prominent short range spanning upper Zone NP23 to upper Zone NP25 with an age from ~29.9 Ma to 24.8 Ma. Sphenolithus avis is widely distributed and it differs from S. ciperoensis by more flaring proximal shields. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	In Chapter Four, high-resolution Oligocene/Miocene calcareous nannofossil biostratigraphy has revealed thirteen events, five of which are reliable and synchronous due to their similar ages in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. The synchronous events are: the last occurrences (LOs) of C. fenestratus and S. delphix, and first occurrence (FO) of S. disbelemnos and the beginning and ending of the S. conicus acme. The Sphenolithus conicus acme is documented in the Indian Ocean between 23.5 Ma and 22.8 Ma. This acme was first found in the Pacific Ocean across the Mi-1 glacial event which is characterized by high δ18O and δ13C values. This study supports a correlation of the S. conicus acme in the Indian Ocean with that of relatively similar age in the Pacific Ocean.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Effortful control (EC) is defined as the ability to inhibit or delay a prepotent response, typically in favor of a subdominant response. It has been suggested that, in young children (i.e., preschool-aged), EC is a multidimensional construct, composed of “hot” or affectively salient and “cool” or affectively neutral dimensions. However, findings regarding these dimensions are equivocal. Whereas studies that measure hot EC using delay of gratification-type tasks typically find both Hot and Cool EC factors, studies that measure EC using hot tasks that differ from cool tasks by their level of affective salience only typically do not find separate Hot and Cool EC factors. The purpose of this study was to determine whether hot and cool EC differ by more than just affective salience. To test this, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted using three sets of EC tasks: one set requiring children to inhibit a prepotent response in favor of a subdominant response (cool conflict), another similar set that also included rewards for correct responses (hot conflict), and a set requiring children to delay or inhibit a response to an affectively salient stimulus (i.e., gift, treat; hot delay). CFA was conducted in a sample of 214 3- to 4-year-old preschool children (M age = 4.06, SD = .54; 52.1% female). The best-fitting model was a two-factor model consisting of moderately correlated (r = .52, p &lt; .001) Conflict and Delay factors. As further support of these two factors, the Conflict factor was significantly associated with a Literacy factor (β = .61, p &lt; .001) and a Mathematics variable (β = .42, p &lt; .001) and the Delay factor was significantly associated with an Externalizing factor (β = .30, p = .01). These results indicate that that there are distinct, related EC factors that differ not only on affective salience, but also on the behavioral regulation demands of the task.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Continuous Performance Test (CPT) is a term used to describe a family of cognitive tasks that require an individual to view a sequence of stimuli on a screen while responding under certain conditions and withholding responses under other conditions. Despite the widespread use of the CPT in research, there is no consensus regarding whether different versions of this task are measuring the same or distinct underlying constructs. The purpose of this study is to examine whether two variations of the CPT that differ in target-frequencies and response requirements measure a unitary construct or distinct constructs. Participants included 150 4-and 5-year-olds who were oversampled for elevated levels of inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive behaviors. Participants completed three X-CPTs, three NotX-CPTs, and three direct measures of inhibitory control. For each participant, a teacher completed a behavior ratings scale. Confirmatory Factor Analyses were conducted to examine whether the indices of performance on the CPT (i.e., omission errors, commission errors) measured unitary or distinct constructs across versions of the CPT. Findings suggested that the degree to which X-CPTs and NotX-CPTs measured the same underlying constructs depended on whether scores that include errors made due to disengagement in the task were included in analyses. When the scores of children who disengaged were excluded, omission errors were found to assess the same underlying construct across CPT paradigms whereas commission errors were found to assess distinct constructs. The factors representing CPT performance indices demonstrated poor convergent and discriminant relations to teacher-ratings of behavior and direct measures of inhibitory control.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The teacher-student relationship is one of the most important relationships in any educational experience. In this inquiry I explore the ethics of the teacher-student relationship, namely as a relationship between the self and the other. Drawing on both personal and general educational experiences, I note felt difficulties in the current traditional and modern contexts of the student-teacher relationship and I aim to explore their philosophical roots. In the history of philosophy of education there are two main theses on such relationship: the rationalistic thesis as presented by Plato and the naturalistic thesis as presented by Rousseau. I proceed by analyzing the teacher-student relationship in Plato’s Meno and The Republic where teaching as midwifing and as leading is advanced. Using a Deweyan and a Levinasian account of violence, I argued that both modes of teaching allow for violence against the other’s otherness. Student’s alterity is sacrificed when the conformity with the ideals in both modes is not achieved. On the other hand, Rousseau argues for a different account where the student-teacher relationship should remain natural, which means to foster a self-sufficient student. In this approach the teacher’s role is reduced to a natural force where her/his otherness is sacrificed. I argue that this mode of relating alienates both the teacher and the student. In the process of pursuing self-sufficiency the self is alienated from its’ others. This examination should help us deepen our understanding of current problems in education, such as violence, alienation, and lack of communication. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	As an invitation to view the self-other relationship in the context of the student-teacher relationship differently, I propose dialogic hospitality. Dialogic hospitality provides us with three critical aspects of the ethics of the student-teacher relationship: First, it gives the other priority over the self, which decreases the chances of reducing the other to the self. Second, hospitality works contra violence against others. The safety of the guest and the safety of its otherness is a main purpose of hospitality. Furthermore, the reduction of the other/guest to the self is considered antihospitality. Third, dialogic hospitality works against alienation since it goes beyond instrumentality and shows the essential role of the other in the creation of the self. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Seeing education in the lenses of dialogic hospitality requires tackling a set of questions such as: how does hospitality work in public spheres such as schools? What effect does that have on the unconditionality of hospitality? What kind of relationship to space in education does hospitality require? How can hospitality as a short-term relation satisfy longer-term relationships such as educational relationships? Is hospitality teachable? I tackle these questions to show that first, hospitality disturbs the private/public dichotomy and helps us think of schools as homes. Further, dialogic hospitality advances our understanding of how important the sense of belonging to schools for students and teachers to be hospitable. Second, I advance an account of hospitality where its short nature is appropriate for procuring longer ethical relationships. Finally, I argue for a hospitable occupational mode of schooling where the self practices its being-for-the-other nature.  Dialogic hospitality should advance our discussions about current educational issues such as diversity in classrooms, global education, and student-teacher relationships.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Previous research has shown that holding, or placing one’s hands near, an object can alter visual processing of that object in a variety of ways, including enhancing the detection of change, reducing the effect of distraction, and boosting sensitivity to low-spatial frequency information.  These studies have mostly used abstract laboratory cuing and search paradigms to demonstrate a near-hands advantage.  In the current study we explored whether enhanced visual analysis in the space near one’s hands confers an advantage when applied to a real-world visual search task.  We asked participants to search for knives in X-ray images of luggage (a TSA baggage screening task).  Stimuli were presented on a tablet computer.  In one experiment participants performed the task by pressing response boxes at the edge of the screen, which forced them to grip the display within their hands.  Alternatively, they responded with button press on a mouse held within their lap.  There was no effect of hand placement on speed or accuracy.  In a second experiment, participants were asked to use their finger to trace along the image of the bag to ensure that all potential target locations were inspected.  In addition to any effect of hand proximity to the target, it was anticipated that this strategy would encourage a more systematic search strategy, potentially improving accuracy.  Participants inspected bags substantially longer when using this strategy (1,238 ms longer for target present trials, 2,590 ms for target absent trials).  Interestingly, this additional time spent viewing the image did not result in improved accuracy.  While basic research suggests that hand proximity can influence visual processing, these benefits may not scale-up to more complex search situations.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Background: Athletes regularly compete in temperatures ranging from well below 0° Celsius (C) to those exceeding human body temperature (37°C). The lack of current understanding regarding the individual and interactive influences of exercise during hot and cold exposure is currently limiting optimization of training, racing and fueling strategies implemented by endurance athletes when performing in these extreme environments. As such, determining the degree to which ambient temperature affects substrate metabolism and performance both during and after endurance exercise in trained athletes is warranted. In the present study, we systematically investigated the environmental impact of temperature on substrate mobilization within subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue (SCAAT) in situ and whole-body substrate oxidation during submaximal steady state cycling. Purpose: To investigate the effect of hot, cold, and neutral environmental temperatures on lipolysis within SCAAT and whole-body substrate oxidation during steady state exercise and subsequent time trial (TT) performance in endurance-trained cyclists. Methods: Ten healthy, endurance-trained male cyclists (age = 22.80 ± 2.76 yr; height = 178.58 ± 5.65 cm; mass = 74.02 ± 10.95 kg; body fat = 18.35 ± 3.37%; peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) = 60.60 ± 4.67 ml·kg-1·min-1; power output at lactate threshold (LT) = 234.00 ± 35.00 W) participated in randomized, crossover design study that consisted of baseline testing to determine LT and VO2peak, two familiarization trials, and three experimental trials. The three experimental trials consisted of cycling in hot (39.03±1.06°C; 40.19±2.18%RH), cold (3.06±1.78°C; 41.63±5.60%RH) and thermoneutral (19.43±0.98°C; 38.97±2.23%RH) temperatures in a randomized order. The exercise protocol consisted of 25 min of cycling at 70% LT, followed immediately by 25 min at 90%LT, a 15-min break and then a 20-km TT in a thermoneutral room. In situ lipolysis of the SCAAT was measured throughout the trial with microdialysis, a minimally invasive method used to monitor SCAAT interstitial glycerol concentrations. Whole-body carbohydrate and fat metabolism was measured via indirect calorimetry, fingerstick and venous blood sampling. Results: Nine out of ten subjects were unable to complete the hot condition steady state portion of the protocol, so no TT was performed on the hot visit. No significant differences (p ≤ 0.05) were observed between groups for any measured variable aside from increased heart rate (HR) in the heat (141.16 ± 2.40 bpm) as compared to cold (124.48 ± 2.40 bpm; p &lt; 0.001) and neutral (127.98 ± 2.40 bpm; p = 0.002) conditions. A significant time effect was observed for HR, core temperature, interstitial glycerol, blood lactate, carbohydrate and fat oxidation, VO2 and RER. No differences were observed between cold and neutral TT performances. Conclusion: SCAAT lipolysis increases during steady state exercise; however, the environmental conditions in which exercise was performed did not significantly alter SCAAT metabolism or blood flow, nor did temperature influence whole-body substrate metabolism in well-trained male cyclists. Subjects were unable to complete the TT in the heat, and no differences were observed between cold and neutral TT performance.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Traditional light emitting diodes (LEDs) involve a complicated device structure with multiple layers stacked over one another. Such a complex, multilayered architecture restricts the application of diverse fabrication techniques. Earth-abundant organometal halide perovskites (Pero) have been well astounded for their appealing optoelectronic properties, low cost and solution processability which make them ideal candidates for large size photovoltaic and LED applications. The objective of this thesis work is to fabricate Pero LED with uniform surface morphology, eliminating the multilayers with the help of Pero/Polyethylene oxide (PEO) composite thin film. Because of the simplicity in device architecture, this novel approach has the potential to surpass all the conceivable troubles involved in the fabrication of Pero LEDs. Preliminary results show a working device achieved by spin coating a thin film of Pero/PEO composite on ITO/glass serving as a bottom electrode and with In/Ga as the top electrode.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The overall purpose of this dissertation is to provide insight into the role surplus lines insurance companies play within the insurance industry. Surplus lines insurers are regulated quite differently than standard insurance companies, and they also serve a different purpose within the insurance marketplace. These insurers, by definition, write policies that are deemed uninsurable within the standard market. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The first essay provides a comprehensive background of the surplus lines and admitted insurance markets, with a special focus on areas of regulatory distinctions. Given some insurance groups include surplus lines affiliates and others do not, I consider methods by which surplus lines insurers add value to their insurance groups. These potential methods of value contribution are diversification, profitability, capitalization, and competitive advantages. After examining the impact surplus lines insurers have on their respective groups, I implement an instrumental variable probit regression to determine whether those contributions are observable when comparing surplus lines affiliated groups to their non-surplus lines affiliated counterparts. I utilize group level data in the empirical analysis, and find that surplus lines affiliated insurer groups are distinguishable from non-surplus lines affiliated groups in a variety of ways. Specifically, groups with surplus lines affiliates are more geographically diversified, in addition to being more diversified across the types of products they offer. I also provide evidence that suggests surplus lines affiliated groups are more profitable and write more business in catastrophe prone areas than groups without surplus lines affiliates. Lastly, I find that surplus lines affiliated groups write higher proportions of their overall premiums in liability lines of business than do groups without surplus lines affiliates. I am unaware of any prior studies that empirically examine surplus lines insurers. In addition, this essay adds to the literature via the identification of value contribution mechanisms by which surplus lines insurers contribute value to the insurer groups.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	In the second essay, I examine the impact of regulation on capital market behavior by examining both internal and external reinsurance transactions. Specifically, I differentiate between admitted and surplus lines insurers in order to determine whether the two types of firms serve different purposes within the overall reinsurance marketplace. Prior research in this area has not considered the degree of regulatory stringency imposed on a firm when examining the demand for capital, and as such, this essay offers a contribution to the extant literature by investigating this relationship. A simultaneous equations model (SEM) is implemented to capture the firm’s demand for internal and external reinsurance, which can serve as a substitute for equity capital. I also examine whether the quantities of internal and external transactions differ for these insurers during periods of market stress. Findings indicate that surplus lines insurers cede significantly more affiliated reinsurance premiums than do admitted insurers. In addition, I find evidence consistent with internal and external reinsurance being used by insurers as complements, rather than substitutes.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The concept of coastal and marine spatial planning (CMSP), a tool now used globally, was established as a way to manage increasing interests in development and conservation of coastal and ocean areas. Planning literature has recognized the importance of being able to characterize good quality plans; however, no standard for how to evaluate coastal and marine spatial plans exists. This research provides a foundational effort in establishing an evaluative tool (and baseline) for CMSP plan quality. The evaluative tool assesses the overall quality of the content of coastal and marine spatial plans according to existing planning literature; and assess the orientation of the plans towards the benefits of CMSP espoused by UNESCO. Case studies are also used to obtain a better understanding of the processes that created two coastal and marine spatial plans, and evaluate if any of the evaluation elements not evident in the plans were actually included in the planning process. The coastal and marine spatial plans scored quite low on the evaluative tool. Ultimately, the plans evaluated seem to present facts and intentions without telling a story. The case studies, on the other hand, show that while the plans do not exhibit information about many of the elements measured by the evaluation tool, their development processes were far more robust than the evaluation results indicate. The amount of support that the processes garnered also indicate that these were high quality and successful planning processes. The findings show that the planning process matters, and that it is important to then document that robust, meaningful participatory process in the plan. Key information about how coastal and marine spatial plans, and other plans, can be improved is presented.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Comparing patterns of spatial genetic structure across co-distributed species is critical to making inferences about the factors influencing population divergence, persistence, and change over time.  The fields of phylogenetics and phylogeography are changing rapidly with the application of high-throughput sequencing to non-model organisms.  Cost-effective use of this technology for these studies, which often include a relatively small portion of the genome for several taxa, requires strategies for genome partitioning and sequencing multiple individuals in parallel.  In this dissertation, I implement several strategies to develop markers and collect large multi-locus datasets to investigate evolutionary history and spatial genetic structure of North American frogs.  In the first study, I estimated a multilocus phylogeny for the North American chorus frog genus Pseudacris using anonymous nuclear loci developed using a reduced representation library approach.  I sequenced 27 nuclear loci and three mitochondrial loci for 44 individuals on 1/3 of an Illumina MiSeq run, obtaining 96.5% of the targeted amplicons at less than 20% of the cost of traditional Sanger sequencing.  I found heterogeneity among gene trees, although four major clades (Trilling Frog, Fat Frog, crucifer, and West Coast) were consistently supported, and resolved the relationships among these clades for the first time with strong support.  Bayesian concordance analysis in BUCKy and species tree analysis in *BEAST produced largely similar topologies, although I identified taxa that require additional investigation in order to clarify taxonomic and geographic range boundaries.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the next study, I further examined one species complex within the chorus frog genus across its range, the Illinois Chorus Frog (Pseudacris illinoensis) and Strecker’s Chorus Frog (P. streckeri).  Populations of P. illinoensis, which was originally described as a subspecies of P. streckeri, occur in small, disjunct regions associated with scarce sand prairie habitats that have been impacted by human development and agricultural practices.  In addition to the anonymous nuclear and mitochondrial loci described above, I developed 24 microsatellite loci to study the genetic structure of P. illinoensis and P. streckeri, investigate the evolutionary history of this species complex, and help inform conservation efforts.  I implemented a Bayesian model comparison approach to investigate previous biogeographic hypotheses while simultaneously inferring the presence of genetic structure in this species complex.  Phylogenetic analyses uncovered a deep divergence between populations in the Edwards Plateau of central Texas and all other P. streckeri/P.illinoensis populations, but suggested the disjunct distribution of P. illinoensis occurred more recently.  The best-supported migration model was consistent with the hypothesis that central Texas represented a refugium from which populations expanded via multiple routes.  This model also indicated that disjunct northern and southern regions of P. illinoensis should be considered genetically distinct management units.  This study provides an evolutionary context for future studies and conservation efforts in P. illinoensis, and demonstrates the utility of model-based approaches for phylogeographic inference.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the last two studies, I used targeted sequence capture and high-throughput sequencing of four anurans collected from 36 congruent localities to investigate aspects of phylogeographic concordance in the Southeastern U.S. Coastal Plain.  In total, I recovered  &gt;375 nuclear loci across species and assembled nearly complete mitochondrial genomes, resulting in one of the most comprehensive phylogeographic datasets to date.  Individual nuclear gene trees were poorly resolved even with long (~1400 bp) nuclear sequences, suggesting little concordance among nucleotide sites.  The mitochondrial and combined nuclear datasets were largely concordant, and indicated high spatial and temporal discordance among species, which may correspond to differences in natural history.  The Southern Toad (Anaxyrus terrestris) exhibited the weakest genetic structure and the Southern Leopard Frog (Lithobates sphenocephalus) exhibited the most resolved patterns of genetic structure.  Two treefrogs (Hyla cinerea and H. squirella) had very similar levels of structure, except for two highly divergent H. cinerea individuals in the westernmost part of the sampled range.  When compared to paleoclimate niche models, I found the two species with divergent western and eastern clades (H. cinerea and L. sphenocephalus) had more limited areas of climatic niche stability from the Last Glacial Maximum to present.  I concluded that differential responses to past climate change combined with differences in natural history characteristics have shaped discordant patterns of genetic structure in anuran amphibians of the Southeastern Coastal Plain.  Overall, large-scale genomic datasets combined with ecological and climatic data provide insight into the processes underlying subtle patterns of intraspecific genetic variation.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Scholarship on multimodality repeatedly emphasizes the need not just for a multimodal focus in individual composition classrooms but also an integration of multimodality into the composition curriculum. Collectively, this scholarship sounds a call for a new kind of composition curriculum and, accordingly, new outcomes. This poses a key question for us as well: how might we develop, implement, and sustain multimodal curricula within composition programs so that curriculum reflects more accurately the current communicative landscape? To answer this overarching question, this project utilizes a mixed methods approach combining survey and case study methodologies. The findings for this dissertation include the following: 1) composition programs at the national level still focus overwhelmingly on print, proving that multimodal curricular transformation has not yet taken place; 2) there is little consensus on what a multimodal composition curriculum looks like or includes; 3) programs that have achieved multimodal curricular transformation do so at the intersection of outcomes statements and assignments; 4) outcomes statements at programs that have achieved multimodal curricular transformation define composition as a rhetorically-based, inquiry-driven process of making texts; and 5) assignments at programs that have achieved multimodal curricular transformation ask students to combine multiple modes, attend to design, exhibit material-rhetorical flexibility, and circulate the texts they create, thereby exhibiting transformed practice.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>An interpretation of CMS searches for evidence of supersymmetry in the context of the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) is given. It is found that supersymmetric particles with color charge are excluded in the mass range below about 400 GeV, but neutral and weakly-charged sparticles remain non-excluded in all mass ranges. Discussion of the non-excluded regions of the model parameter space is given, including details on the strengths and weaknesses of existing searches, and recommendations for future analysis strategies. Advancements in the modeling of events arising from quantum chromodynamics and electroweak boson production, which are major backgrounds in searches for new physics at the LHC, are also presented. These methods have been implemented as components of CMS searches for supersymmetry in proton-proton collisions resulting in purely hadronic events (i.e., events with no identified leptons) at a center of momentum energy of 13 TeV. These searches, interpreted in the context of simplified models, exclude supersymmetric gluons (gluinos) up to masses of 1400 to 1600 GeV, depending on the model considered, and exclude scalar top quarks with masses up to about 800 GeV, assuming a massless lightest supersymmetric particle. A search for non-excluded supersymmetry models is also presented, which uses multivariate discriminants to isolate potential signal candidate events. The search achieves sensitivity to new physics models in background-dominated kinematic regions not typically considered by analyses, and rules out supersymmetry models that survived 7 and 8 TeV searches performed by CMS.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study examined the role of humility in romantic relationships.  Specifically, a theoretical model was tested in which perceptions of humility are associated with self-forgiveness and partner forgiveness in romantic relationships, which are in turn associated with relationship satisfaction.  A sample of emerging adult females (N = 152), who reported being in a romantic relationship completed measures of self-reported humility, self-forgiveness, partner forgiveness, and relationship satisfaction.  Serial mediation analyses were conducted using structural equation modeling procedures.  Perceptions of humility were not related to relationship satisfaction directly.  Significant indirect effects through self-forgiveness and partner forgiveness did serially mediate the influence of humility on relationship satisfaction.  Findings are discussed as well as limitations and implications for research and clinical practice.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Drawing from the decision-making literature, the framing and cross-modal discounting paradigms were used to investigate the effect of age on the subjective valuation of technology.  Using the framing paradigm to covertly measure age differences in relative subjective valuation, it was hypothesized that older adults would undervalue technology relative to younger adults and when compared to non-technology-related rewards.  Through the use of the cross-modal discounting paradigm, it was also hypothesized that older adults would display a larger perceived attribute difference between technology and non-technology-related rewards when compared to younger adults.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Three experiments were conducted utilizing both online and in-lab samples.  Analysis of the framing items revealed few age differences in risky choice preferences across the scenario modalities.  Gift cards for technology or non-technology-related items were not found to be subjectively valued differently between age groups, or differently from unallocated money within age groups.  Analysis of the cross-modal discounting items revealed a subset of individuals, evenly distributed across age groups, which perceived a large attribute difference between the gift cards, showing a preference for the non-technology-related reward.  These outwardly contradictory results and implications for older adults and technology adoption are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>As low-lying areas, deltas are sensitive to changes associated with advance taking place on the land and in the ocean. The pattern of change in shoreline positions over time can be used as an indicator of changes in land and/or ocean environments. Land development and rapid population and economic growth can cause subsidence due to excess groundwater extraction, reduction of river sediment supply by dams, and floodplain engineering. Global eustatic and local relative sea-level changes can also significantly affect the coastline of the lowland area. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the causes of shoreline change in the Chao Phraya (CPY) River delta in Thailand, which is a coastal region dominated by intertidal mudflats. This study focuses on river sediment supply, relative sea level change, and mangrove deforestation. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Long-term historical data coupled with field observation were used to determine how these factors are related to shoreline retreat of the delta coastline. Shoreline change evaluation for the Upper Gulf of Thailand, including the Chao Phraya estuary between 1954 and 2013, are based on a series of aerial photographs and satellite imagery. This data set represents historical shoreline positions with time intervals ranging from 2 years to 24 years. The shoreline data were converted into vectorized ArcGIS shapefiles and analyzed using the USGS Digital Shoreline Analysis System ArcGIS extension. River survey data collected during the period 2011-2013 were used for studying the characteristics of river flow and sediment transport in the river system. During the period 2011-2013, the flow and sediment characteristics of rivers were measured 9 times at 8 stations in the Ping, Wang, Yom, Nan, and Chao Phraya rivers. The data cover wet season and dry season flow conditions, including the extreme flood event during 2011. Additionally, sediment deposition rates at the Chao Phraya River mouth were estimated from two sediment cores taken from the Chao Phraya River mouth using 210Pb radiometric dating. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The results of this study indicate that relative sea-level rise due to the extremely high rate of land subsidence is the major cause of rapid shoreline change in the CPY Delta, and is responsible for 56 and 63 percent of shoreline retreat in the western and eastern portions of the Chao Phraya Delta, respectively. Unlike other major deltas in the southeast and east Asia, the severe shoreline recession during the period 1954-2013 is not strongly related to sediment supply reduction associated with large dam impoundments. Conversely, sediment deposition rates at the CPY Delta tended to increase after 1994 (30 and 22 years after construction of the Bhumibol and Sirikit Dams, respectively). However, the observed average rate of sediment deposition (8-10 mm/year) is less than the average rate of relative sea-level rise (17 mm/year), and the sediment supply from the CPY is not sufficient to balance land loss due to the rise of sea-level during the past six decades.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>For land-use changes, most of the vegetation areas, especially mangrove forest bounding along the edge of the shoreline, have been converted into aquacultural farmland by 1994. Results from mangrove area analysis over the period 1954-2013 reveal that the reduction of shoreline retreat rates in the eastern CPY was not directly associated with an increase in mangrove areas undergoing reforestation, and mangrove reforestation could not be cited as a shoreline builder or effective measure for coastal protection for coastlines that are rapidly retreating due to land subsidence. However, conversion of mangrove areas into aquaculture farmland can magnify shoreline retreat caused by relative sea-level rise. Results of this study may provide a useful analog for other coastal regimes of the Earth that may experience the effect of the predicted 1-2 meter rise over the next century associated with global warming.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Tyrants play a major role in Greek literature and political philosophy, and occupy a certain prominence on the tragic stage. Many city-states, from Athens to Syracuse to Heraclea on the Black Sea, experienced periods in which tyrants exercised power over political life. The prevalent idea of the Greek experience of tyranny is that it was a bad, undesirable form of government. This study departs from this view and embarks on a reconsideration of tyranny and Greek attitudes toward it by looking at how tyrants are portrayed in sources outside of the ancient political theorists, such as Plato and Aristotle. When we explore accounts of Greek tyrants in the historical sources, we find within them a cacophony of voices, recording different perspectives as well as the variety and hybridity of different models of tyranny. Analyzing this cacophony of voices systematically in a thematic and diachronic study of ancient Greek tyranny reveals the sophistication of attitudes toward tyrants; and demonstrates that writers of historical works recognized forms of tyranny aside from the negative, simplistic model advanced in philosophical discussions. In the end, conceptualizing tyranny as a form of sole rule that is limited neither spatially nor temporally sheds light on the endurance of tyranny throughout the Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic eras.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Colleges and universities are experiencing a growing level of distress on their campuses. Counseling centers have implemented preventive efforts, such as suicide prevention outreach, to avert crisis situations that are potentially life threatening and taxing to university resources. The present study aimed to explore two hypotheses: 1) do counseling centers who meet a higher proportion of students through outreach increase the level of help-seeking on their campus and 2) do counseling centers who meet a higher proportion of students through outreach reduce the level of suicidal distress in their students. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study used archival data about college student distress and newly gathered data about the outreach services counseling center staff provided. Twelve universities provided data about the number of outreach events and the number of people met that outreach events on their campus. The 12 universities contained archival data about level of suicidality and help-seeking behavior of 4,606 students nested in the 12 universities. Hierarchical linear modeling using the HLM software was conducted to test each hypothesis. The results for hypothesis 1 found a non-significant relationship between counseling center outreach and help-seeking behavior. The odds ratio was high (13.3) but the confidence interval was vast. This indicated an estimation problem with the analysis that may be related to lack of variance in help-seeking behavior. The results from testing hypothesis 2 found that there were not enough universities who participated in the study to have sufficient power.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Due to the lower than expected response rate from universities, an interview was conducted with a staff member at a university who participated, but indicated that their center did not collect outreach data. Responses to the interview stated the importance of data collection for counseling centers while also highlighting several barriers to collecting such data. The findings from the hypothesis testing and interview suggest that the collection of outreach data would support the justification for the services counseling centers provide while also contributing to the research on the effectiveness of outreach. Conclusions from this study are related to the previously explored literature and directions for future research are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this dissertation, I developed a measure of sports team reputation.  The reputation construct is one that has been the subject of decades of scholarly focus in the broader management field, but has been comparatively neglected by sport management scholars.  Consumers use the reputations held by organizations to predict future behavior, and decide the ways in which they will engage (or not engage) with those organizations; thus, it is intuitively important for sports teams to cultivate and manage their reputations in order to receive positive benefits from external stakeholders (e.g., fans, spectators, general sport consumers).  The development of the measure provides scholars a tool with which to empirically investigate the relationship between sports team reputation and consumer outcomes.  As such, this research should be viewed as a first—and necessary—step toward increasing our understanding how reputation affects sport consumer behavior.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Herein, reputation is treated as a multidimensional construct comprising consumers’ collective beliefs and attitudes about a focal unit—in this case, a sports team.  Beliefs pertain to reputations for actions pertaining to performance- or character-related attributes, while attitudes are related to favorable or unfavorable overall assessments of reputation.  The measure is based upon this conceptualization. 	To develop this measure, I followed the six-step scale development process detailed by Hinkin (1998): (1) item generation; (2) questionnaire administration; (3) initial item reduction; (4) confirmatory factor analysis; (5) construct validity; and (6) replication.  In the project, I completed the first five of these steps, through which I was able to provide evidence of the validity and reliability of the measure.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Using two independent samples (n = 300; n =181), I demonstrated internal validity of a three-factor measure comprising subscales for performance, character, and organizational prominence.  A fourth subscale for favorability was removed.  Further analysis provided evidene of acceptable model fit in the three-factor models for both samples (Sample 1: RMSEA = .078, SRMR = .049; Sample 2: RMSEA = .075, SRMR = .039).  Based on the results, a significant strong positive relationship was found between organizational performance and organizational prominence (Sample 1: β = .92, p &lt; .001; Sample 2: β = .96, p &lt; .001); while a weaker significant negative relationship was observed between organizational character and organizational prominence (Sample 1: β = -.28, p &lt; .001; Sample 2: β = -.24, p &lt; .001).  One conclusion from the results is that sports teams become known primarily for good high performance, and to a lesser extent, their misdeeds.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Reasons for these trends are discussed, in addition to managerial implications, and limitations of the study.  Ultimately, the development and validation of the present measure enables future empirical study of the reputation construct within the context of sports teams, and other organizations within the sport industry.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation describes the development of alternative products from the copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC).  The first chapter provides an introduction to the CuAAC through the historic timeline of the development of reaction conditions. Finally the current mechanistic understanding and three applications of the commonly used reaction are described. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The second chapter describes a method for the preparation of 5-iodo-1,2,3-triazoles directly from organic azides and terminal alkynes. The reaction is mediated by in-situ generated copper(I) catalyst and iodinating agents.  The method described is a follow-up of the protocol developed by Dr. Brotherton in 2012.  The methodological enhancements of the procedure described in Chapter 2 provides high conversion as well as high iodo/protio selectivity through the reduction in equivalents of alkyne, and employment of [Tri(1-benzyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methyl]amine (TBTA).  Through these improvements the method became more synthetically practical and increased the reaction substrate scope to include unreactive azides and alkynes.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Chapter three describes the synthesis of 5,5’-bis(1,2,3-triazole)s (bistriazoles).  These compounds have been proposed to be employed as chiral ligands in enantioselective synthesis.  Previously reported methods for the synthesis of bistriazoles mainly require decreased reaction temperatures (0-35 oC) and long reaction times (20-48 hours) while applying a limited substrate scope.  The method described in Chapter 3 is a simple and rapid process for the synthesis of bistriazoles from organic azides and terminal alkynes under oxidative conditions ( oxygen atmosphere) with a broad substrate scope.  The reactions are mediated by copper(II) acetate, and completed within 3 hours, with ≥ 50% isolated yields.  TBTA has been employed in the CuAAC to accelerate the formation of 1,2,3-triazoles, in addition TBTA accelerates the formation of bistriazoles.  Employing K2CO3 as a basic additive in MeOH or EtOH as the solvent promotes the oxidative reaction that produces the bistriazole at the expense of the 1,2,3-triazole.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para/>
            <DISS_para>	In Chapter 4 the initial development of 5-alkynyl-1,2,3-triazoles is reported.  The previously reported methods require extended reaction times with varying temperature (rt-60 oC) with a limited substrate scope.  The method described in Chapter 4 is a simple and rapid process for the synthesis of 5-alkyny-1,2,3-triazoels from organic azides and terminal alkynes under oxidative conditions (oxygen atmosphere) with a developing substrate scope.  The reactions are mediated by copper(II) acetate, completed within 3-5 hours, and produce ≥ 50% isolated yields.  Employing 1,5-diazolbicyclo[4.3.0]non-5-ene (DBN) as the basic additive in MeOH or EtOH as the solvent promotes the oxidative reaction that produces the 5-alkynyl-1,2,3-triazoles at the expense of the 1,2,3-triazole and 5,5’-bis-(1,2,3-triazole)s.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Chapter 5 summarizes the work conducted on modifying the conditions applied to the copper catalyzed azide alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC).  Modifications to enhance the synthesis of the 5-iodo-1,2,3-triazoles via CuAAC are the first addressed  Which was followed by the unsuccessful application of the Ullmann reaction for the synthesis of 5,5’-bis(1,2,3-triazole)s.  The subsequent employment of potassium carbonate in the CuAAC, afforded the desired bistriazoles with moderate to high selectivity over 1,4-disubstituted-1,2,3-triazoles.  In addition, changing the base from potassium carbonate to DBN allowed for the 5-alkynyl-1,2,3-triazole to be produced as the major product while diminishing the bistriazole and protiotriazole.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In “Some Thoughts about Feelings,” Susan McLeod encourages teachers to develop a “theory of affect” that could account for the various emotional processes that students encounter while writing (433).  One contribution to such a theory concerns self-efficacy, a mechanism by which students interpret this emotional, sensory input. Self-efficacy plays a crucial role in understanding how students write as both a cognitive and affective activity. As students engage with various texts, they enter into a process wherein they must mediate and interpret the skills they possess. These interpretations, and the beliefs on which they are based, can significantly enable or hinder writers as they engage in the composing process. Therefore, students' self-efficacy beliefs are vital to their success as writers, both inside and outside of the classroom.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Although a significant amount of research explores self-efficacy as related to motivation and performance outcomes, little has been done to map the potential fluctuations of students’ self-efficacy beliefs throughout the composing process. As students progress through a writing assignment, they encounter challenges to their self-efficacy, such as reading the assignment sheet, drafting, receiving feedback, revising, and assessment. These challenges suggest that self-efficacy is not a stable phenomenon; rather, self-efficacy very probably fluctuates as students engage with the challenges presented by a specific task. Understanding the nature of potential fluctuations is important, then, both in a theory of self-efficacy and in teaching writing. Accordingly, this study seeks to determine if, how, when, and from what causes students’ self-efficacy fluctuates over the course of a single writing assignment involving multiple drafts.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To examine potential fluctuations in students’ self-efficacy, I conducted a case study with two students enrolled in a single section of ENC 1101. I interviewed each of the participants face to face twice—once before they reviewed the assignment and again after they submitted the assignment to be graded—in order to create a narrative arc of their sense of self-efficacy throughout the assignment. These interviews were supplemented by self-assessment questionnaires that were completed by students at four designated moments chosen by the researcher and one spontaneous moment chosen by the subjects. The questionnaires consist of two parts: a quantitative self-assessment and a qualitative reflection. The quantitative self-assessment operates as a self-efficacy scale in order to determine how students perceive their abilities at specific moments in the writing process. Following each of the five quantitative assessment occasions, students were then asked to respond to a prompt designed to engage them in a qualitative reflection. These qualitative reflections were coded to determine self-efficacy fluctuations, sources of self-efficacy beliefs, and strategies that students evolved to cope with potential fluctuations. I triangulated these data to generate a rich description of the potential ebbs and flows of self-efficacy across the composing process. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>My data reveals that self-efficacy does fluctuate as students engage with a single assignment involving multiple drafts. However, the fluctuations manifested in different ways and to different degrees. Fluctuations occurred both from moment to moment during the composing process as well as within each discrete moment of the writing process. Additionally, the students reported that performance accomplishments, social persuasion, and physiological reactions played a role in determining their efficacy perceptions and, thus, in triggering fluctuations. The students drew from these sources to varying degrees, and interpreted the sources differently. These data suggest that the sources students draw from to determine their efficacy beliefs vary from study to student and that the more influential sources are most likely to trigger fluctuations. Finally, this study explores the strategies students evolved to address fluctuations. The results of this study illustrate the need for compositionists to attend to what points in the writing process fluctuations are likely to occur, what factors in the writing process might trigger those fluctuations, and what strategies students evolve to address fluctuations. To that end, these findings invite compositionists to reconsider the role of self-efficacy in the writing classroom, and subsequently alter our pedagogy to account for fluctuations in self-efficacy beliefs as our students compose.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Research supports that gay males may be at increased risk for eating disorders compared to heterosexual males, establishing a need to develop and empirically evaluate programs to reduce risk for this population. The present study investigated the feasibility, acceptability, efficacy, and specificity of a cognitive dissonance-based (DB) intervention (The PRIDE Body Project©) in reducing eating disorder risk factors among gay males in a university-based setting. Eighty-seven gay males were randomized to either a 2-session DB intervention (n=47) or a waitlist control condition (n=40). Participants completed validated measures assessing eating disorder risk factors pre-intervention, post-intervention, and at 1-month follow-up, along with post-treatment acceptability measures. Hierarchical Linear Modeling was used to assess differences between conditions across time. Regarding feasibility and acceptability, a total of 36 gay men participated in Session 1 of the program and 86% were retained at Session 2. Acceptability ratings for the program were highly favorable for all items. Regarding efficacy, the DB condition was associated with significantly greater decreases in body dissatisfaction, drive for thinness and muscularity, body-ideal internalization, dietary restraint, bulimic symptoms, negative affect, and self- and partner-objectification compared to waitlist control from pre- to post-intervention. Improvements in the DB group were maintained for all variables at 1-month follow-up, with the exception of body-ideal internalization. Demonstrating the specificity of the intervention to problems targeted within the DB program, conditions did not differ over time on changes in social pressures to conform to the body-ideal or alcohol use problems. Supporting the posited mechanism of treatment effects, body-ideal internalization mediated treatment effects on bulimic symptoms. Additionally, men who had higher baseline eating pathology or lower gay community involvement reported greater and more long-lasting treatment effects, respectively. Results support the feasibility, acceptability, efficacy, and specificity of The PRIDE Body Project©, up to one-month post-intervention and provide support for models of eating pathology in gay men.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Background: Female aesthetic athletes strive to attain an ideal body image for their sports. Dancers in particular pose an addition issue in that they are performing artists and are often not considered athletes. The physical demands placed on dancers from choreography and performance schedules make their body composition, physiology and optimal fitness just as important as their technique development. Body composition, specifically fat mass (FM) and lean mass (LM), has shown positive changes in response to increased protein intake in lean populations (119, 200). A diet higher in protein may be a simple way to optimize body composition and dance performance without dramatically changing or adding to classical dance training. Improvements in body composition from supplemental protein alone may improve aesthetics of dance performance. To date, no studies have investigated the impact of increased protein intake on body composition and performance in a dance population. Purpose: To determine the extent to which supplemental whey protein (PRO) consumed three times daily (75g total/day) for 12 weeks will optimize body composition and dance performance in female collegiate dancers when compared to an isocaloric placebo (PLA). Methods: Twenty-one (19.6 ± 1.4 years) female collegiate dancers from Florida State University’s School of Dance completed this randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study. Participants were randomly assigned a PLA or PRO supplement (25g, 3x/day) and were instructed to consume one scoop (25g protein) with water between major meals of breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Following familiarization, participants completed laboratory testing at baseline, mid, and post-testing of the 12-week intervention. Laboratory testing included, 24-hour urine collection, body composition assessment (dual x-ray absorptiometry; DXA), resting metabolic rate (indirect calorimetry), venous blood draw, whole body circumferences scan, performance tests, and a functional dance performance assessment. Additionally, participants completed weekly 3-day food logs and satiety questionnaires to assess dietary changes throughout the study. Data were reported as mean ± SD. Dependent variables were analyzed by two-way (group x time) analysis of variance (ANOVA). Post hoc test were used to compare group or time differences. Significance was accepted at p&lt;0.05. Results: There were no significant differences in participant demographics, body composition, or diet at baseline. PLA consumed significantly lower protein (g/kg/day) than PRO every week of the study (p&lt;0.001). Body weight, FM, and LM did not change between groups or over time. LM (%) at post-testing trended toward significance between PLA and PRO (+0.5 ± 3.0%, -2.7 ± 5.2%, respectively; p=0.057). Lean mass index (LMI= (LMpost-LMpre)+(FMpre-FMpost)) was significantly lower in PLA (-1.8 ± 3.1) compared to PRO (+0.6 ± 1.9; p=0.048) at post-testing. PLA achieved a higher hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio at mid (63.4 ± 9.2% vs. 54.7 ± 7.8%; p=0.031) compared to PRO and significantly increased absolute (746.4 ± 92.9 W, 856.3 ± 51.6 W; p=0.005) and relative (12.7 ± 1.4 W, 14.6 ± 1.4 W; p=0.004) peak power during the Wingate anaerobic power test from baseline to post-testing. Although not significant, PLA completed the study in negative nitrogen balance whereas PRO was in positive nitrogen balance. Differences detected in aesthetic presentation from baseline to post-testing were significantly lower in PLA (1.9 ± 0.5, on a 1.0-5.0 scale) compared to PRO (2.6 ± 0.8, on a 1.0 to 5.0 scale; p=0.048). Conclusion: Protein supplementation for 12 weeks was well tolerated and significantly improved LMI as well as aesthetic presentation during dance performance. Although overall body composition was more optimal in PRO, individual measures (FM and LM) were not significantly different between groups. PRO supplementation did not significantly impact laboratory testing. Protein supplementation has no adverse side effects on a dance population and improves LMI and aesthetics in dance performance. In addition, protein supplementation provides a simple way to improve the diet as well as LMI in a group of dance athletes that need more nutritional attention.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The importance of permanent magnets with rare earth metals has grown as emerging markets increase their demand for technologies made with these magnets. However, the constraints of rare earth suppliers, the environmental impact of the refining process, and price volatility have left consumers seeking alternative magnets for their applications. This has led to the search for a non-rare earth containing bulk material that will achieve similar magnetic strength and energy product as its rare earth counterpart. Mn-Ga binary alloys have shown promising magnetic properties, even though these alloys contain no rare-earth metals. Both theoretical predictions and experimental work showed that nanoscaled Mn-Ga samples, such as thin films, could have remarkable magnetic properties. Although the prediction provides a useful guideline, and thin films supply us with materials in some application, bulk materials are required for the majority of applications that require a strong magnetic field. To achieve nanostructure as obtained in thin films, we have performed research on making bulk (Mn1-x-yMy)Gax or Mn1-xGax-yMy alloys, where M is a substitutional metallic element, by dynamic mechanically milling and heat treatments. We report efforts to create hard magnetic materials for permanent magnet use. Using this process, materials with high coercivity, up to 18.8 kOe, have been fabricated. We demonstrate that we could enhance the remanence in bulk Mn based materials by engineering both the chemistry and fabrication routes.  Fabrication was followed by a study into the coercivity mechanisms in these materials.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The novel focuses on the story of a group of fifteen year olds living in the same hallway at a prestigious, international, all-girls, catholic boarding school in Geneva the spring Azeneth, a new student, arrives. The story is told from the point of view of Laura, focusing on her friendship with Azeneth, one riddled with hesitance and admiration. Each girl in the group is of a different nationality, but they all share a similarly privileged background. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>When Azeneth arrives to the school, she exposes Laura and the other girls to different ways of approaching their sexuality and questioning their self-perception and the nature of truth. All the girls participate in this revolution of sorts and add to it in different ways, but Azeneth is the catalyst for this. Laura is fascinated by Azeneth and at the same time feels a deep reluctance towards her. Paradoxically, it’s partly in response to her reluctance that Azeneth ultimately chooses her as her main ally at the school.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A Scherezade of sorts, Azeneth gains power and popularity among the girls by telling them stories every night, which she claims are from her past as well as through her outrageous activities at the school. The girl’s fascination with Azeneth lead her to more and more reckless activities at the school to entertain them and keep them from telling on her. In a parallel way, the other girls begin experimenting more and more with their sexuality. This escalates exponentially until the past Az has conjured so fervently in her stories pays them a visit that results in a murder and a death that will always haunt Laura. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The novel is structured as a series of 12 chapters, and is told in first person and past-tense.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Background: Until recently, consuming nutrients close to sleep was believed to have negative impacts on body composition and overall health. However, recent work from our laboratory and others has demonstrated that a low calorie snack, high in protein may be beneficial for facilitating weight loss in overweight and obese adults, increasing overnight muscle protein synthesis in both young and old men, increasing morning metabolism in young men and decreasing morning hunger in overweight and obese women. To date, no studies have investigated the impact of casein intake before sleep on appetite the following morning in overweight and obese men. Purpose: The present study investigated whether casein (CAS) protein consumed within 30 min of sleep could acutely alter morning appetite in overweight or obese men the next morning when compared to a non-caloric placebo (PLA). Methods: Twelve overweight and obese men completed this randomized, crossover, double blind and placebo-controlled study. Subjects came to the laboratory on three occasions: baseline, and in the morning following CAS and placebo (PLA). Within 30 min of sleep, CAS or PLA was consumed. The next morning (6-8 hours later), subjective appetite (visual analog scales for hunger, satiety, and desire to eat) and ghrelin levels (blood samples) were measured. Results: There were no significant differences in next morning hunger (BAS, 35 ± 6; CAS, 49 ± 6; PLA, 47 ± 6 mm, p = 0.21), satiety (BAS, 36 ± 6; CAS, 36 ± 4, PLA, 39 ± 5 mm; p = 0.89), or desire to eat (BAS, 38 ± 6; CAS, 62 ± 8; PLA, 55 ± 5 mm; p = 0.06). Additionally, there were no significant differences in next morning acyl ghrelin (BAS, 54.8 ± 15.7; CAS, 54.3 ± 10; PLA, 61.3 ± 15 pg/ml, p = 0.93), desacyl ghrelin (BAS, 46.4 ± 9; CAS, 43.4 ± 6.9; PLA, 45 ± 9.9 pg/ml; p = 0.97) or ghrelin ratio (BAS, 1.3 ± 0.4; CAS, 1.6 ± 0.4; PLA, 2.3 ± 1.0, p = 0.63). Conclusion: The results of the present study reveal that CAS can be consumed within 30 minutes of sleep without negatively affecting next morning appetite or insulin levels in overweight and obese men. Long-term studies are needed to evaluate the effects of chronic protein consumption before sleep on body composition and appetite.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Lithium-ion Capacitor’s (LICs) performance is greatly influenced by the operating temperature. Many cell design factors such as electrolyte formulation and electrode material composition can determine such performance. The standards for today’s commercial LIC do not reach temperatures needed for extreme temperature applications. Research was completed to develop other electrolytes for wide temperature range applications and along the way side effects of lithium plating and stripping were explored in anode materials. Metrics for performance that were used for LICs were capacity, capacitance and ESR, cycle life retention, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Wide temperature range electrolytes were developed from 70 oC to -40 oC and lithium plating in different anode materials was mitigated.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Youth with disabilities are overrepresented among youth “aging out” of the child welfare system (Hill, 2012), yet few studies specifically examine the needs of youth aging out with disabilities as they transition into adulthood. Addressing this gap, the current study provides a more nuanced account of youth with disabilities’ recent transitions out of the child welfare system. Using two national databases, this secondary data analysis investigates differences in educational and employment outcomes between youth aging out with and without disabilities and across youth aging out with different types of disability (i.e., distinguishing emotional from non-emotional diagnoses). Additionally, this study identifies services that improve these outcomes among youth aging out with disabilities. These lines of inquiry provide information about the experiences and needs of youth aging out with disabilities so that services aimed toward improving educational and employment outcomes can be appropriately tailored to this substantial population of youth aging out of care.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>While the number of children born in cohabiting unions has greatly increased, studies have shown that cohabiting unions are significantly less stable than married unions and that the unions instability is negatively associated with the children’s wellbeing. To support fragile families—to provide more secure and lasting family environment to their children—it is important to better understand how cohabiting parents’ commitment and relational experience affect the union’s stability over time. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The focus of this study was to explore how cohabiting mothers’ and fathers’ plans to marry their partners, along with their coparenting experience, are associated with their later relationship status, both that of getting married and continuing in cohabitation 5 years after their child’s birth. Based on commitment models and the Family Systems perspective, it was expected that both parents’ marriage plans would be associated with later relationship status (H1); the associations between marriage plans and later relationship status would be dependent upon parents’ coparenting experience (H2); and the effects of marriage plans would be indirectly associated with later status via coparenting experience (H3).  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The results from multinomial logistic regression analyses of data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study showed that the marriage plans of mothers, but not those of fathers, at the child’s birth were significantly associated with parents’ marital status—being married—5 years later; also, the difference between the effects of mothers’ and fathers’ marriage plans was statistically significant. In addition, cohabiting mothers’ and fathers’ joint marriage plans were significantly associated with marital status. However, the mothers’ and fathers’ joint marriage plans were not associated with continued cohabitation. The results from testing the second hypothesis showed that the effects of father’s marriage plans were significantly associated with both being married and continued cohabitation when they, as well as their partners, were more satisfied with coparenting. The effects of mothers’ marriage plans were also dependent upon coparenting satisfaction, predicting later continued cohabitation but not being married. From testing the third hypothesis, there was no significant mediating effect of coparenting satisfaction in the associations between marriage plans and later relationship status among either the mothers or the fathers. Clinical and research implications of the findings are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The recruitment and retention of women is a continuing problem in the Information Technology (IT) profession.  Despite positive labor statistics for the IT field, American women are underrepresented.  The belief that their skill sets are not as credible as their male counterparts keeps qualified women candidates from attaining key IT positions.  There will be no growth in representation if women are not enrolling in the advanced degree programs necessary to end the cycle of underrepresentation.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>While there are a number of studies investigating the reasons for the underrepresentation of women in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines; there is not an abundance of research that considers the combined role that gender and self-efficacy play.  The literature dealing with these issues in IT educational and the IT workforce separately is even more limited and particularly evident is the lack of research on the underrepresentation of women in IT.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation research study explored the sense of inclusion and factors that affect differences in participation in Information Technology (IT) education by gender.  An explanatory sequential mixed methods design was used, and it will involve collecting quantitative data via an online survey and then explaining the quantitative results with in-depth qualitative data with interviews.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation identifies and explores the composers’ practices through five aspects of composing practices: technology, affect, prior practice, environment, and sociality. Taken together, these five dimensions describe a concept of composing practices as being shaped by composers’ past experiences, uses of technologies, interactions with environments, interactions with others, and affective states like preferences and beliefs. This exploration of composing practices brings together and elaborates existing Writing Studies research like Kevin Roozen's which traces composing practices writers develop over time and across contexts and Stacey Pigg's which examines how writers' interactions with physical and virtual environments support their writing and learning. The research questions focusing this study ask (1.) if and what role these five dimensions play in the emergence of practices in composers; (2.) if any of these dimensions play a more significant role than the others; (3.) and if one or more dimension plays a greater role in the emergence of practice, why?</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To answer the research questions focusing this study, I use a three-part methodology: a retrospective interview, a recorded observation, and a culminating interview. First, through the retrospective interview, I develop an account of what material environments and writing technologies participants have used over time and across contexts. Such contexts include different courses or subjects at moments in their schooling and different contexts outside of school like home. Second, through the observation and final interview, I developed an account of what writing technologies and environments participants currently use and why those are the technologies and environments composers prefer. Having synthesized and interpreted these three datasets, I constructed a case study of each composer’s current practices.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Through these case studies of composers’ practices, this research resulted in the following five claims: (1.) composers employ a consistent set of practices when producing texts for school and outside of school, and these practices are not included in traditional models of process; (2.) The composing practices composers develop, adapt, and employ are informed by their experiences composing in-school and out-of-school; (3.) composers have developed the practices they employ over the course of their lives, and composers’ past composing experiences figure prominently in the composing practices they currently employ. This is particularly the case for practices and aspects of practices that were part of their development as composers; (4.) composers attend to their composing environments—dwell—by making choices about where to compose as part of the composing process, and in many cases, their attention to environment is informed by a past environment—an originating writing sanctuary—where they reached an important point in their development; and (5.) belief-formation plays a significant role in the composing practices composers adapt and employ because the beliefs that composers develop about their practices and the efficacy of their practices organize and emphasize specific practices in their composing process. As a result, this dissertation shows what practices composers are employing to adapt to the effects of mobile networked technologies and what is involved in the emergence of composers’ practices.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>College students generally engage in little physical activity in traditional college classrooms. It is common for students to sit in chairs for long periods of time while experts lecture on the course material, which further contributes to the sedentary behavior of students. However, this author believes that the built environment has the potential to increase physical activity and accommodate salutogenic design (active design) approaches to learning. This approach could allow students to construct their own knowledge with the teacher serving as a facilitator and provide an opportunity to incorporate greater physical movement within the classroom.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Research was conducted by recruiting higher education students majoring in Education and Interior Design at Florida State University. The primary research question for this study was, “What are the perceptions and preferences of higher education students for furniture that accommodates a variety of sitting and standing postures within classrooms utilizing behaviorist and constructivist pedagogies?” Study participants interacted with different furniture samples that offered various learning postures, and then participated in a survey to identify student perception. The resulting data brought to light that students have an opinion when it comes to what type of posture is best for their specific learning environment. Participants stated that they would feel valued by their university if offered a choice within the classroom. Additionally, students confirmed that each individual learns differently and are unique. Also, participants had a preference for furniture type by time of day, location within the classroom, and teaching strategy. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The study’s original research results were applied to a redesign of a hypothetical higher education building of Turner Hall at Illinois State University. The designed spaces included classrooms, collaboration areas, media centers, a café, and public spaces. The resulting design project showed not only that the presence of multiple furniture types in classrooms is possible, but also explored a broader building environment dedicated to the premise of salutogenic design in its space planning and amenities.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Findings from trauma research have indicated that college students report high rates of trauma exposure, yet they may also experience positive growth outcomes following traumatic events. Researchers also indicate that perceptions of social support resources may impact the capacity for posttraumatic growth in these young adults.  Examining the factors that may foster these positive posttrauma outcomes is necessary to develop more interventions that promote posttraumatic growth for trauma-exposed individuals, especially young adults in college.  As a result of this research, individuals may also better understand the importance of perceived social support following trauma.  Therefore, the impact of perceived social support on posttrauma outcomes in college students was examined in this study.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>    The goal of the present study was to investigate the possible mediating and/or moderating effects of perceived social support on the relationship between event stressfulness, core beliefs disruption, and posttraumatic growth. The study sample consisted of students from colleges and universities within the United States.  A total of 212 participants were included in final statistical analyses because they endorsed an event stressfulness level of 4 or more, thus indicating a significant level of distress that could potentially contribute to posttraumatic growth (Groleau, Calhoun, Cann, &amp; Tedeschi, 2013; Joseph, Murphy &amp; Regel, 2012).  Data for this study were collected between Summer and Fall 2015.  Participants ranged from 18 to 25 years of age.  Trauma, event stressfulness, core beliefs disruption, perceived social support, and posttraumatic growth were assessed using the Trauma History Questionnaire (Green, 1996), a one-item Event Stressfulness measure (Cann et al., 2010), the Core Beliefs Inventory (Cann et al., 2010), the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (Zimet, Dahlem, Zimet, &amp; Farley, 1988), and the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (Tedeschi &amp; Calhoun, 1996), respectively.  A series of regression analyses, including one hierarchical regression analysis, were used to examine the research questions.    </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>    Based on findings from this study, event stressfulness, core beliefs disruption, and perceived social support were good predictors of posttraumatic growth.  Additionally, participants’ perceptions of social support resources moderated the relationship between event stressfulness, core beliefs disruption, and posttraumatic growth.  Perceived social support was not found to be a mediator in this relationship.  In addition, a bivariate correlation analysis was used to examine relationships among the variables.  Results showed significant, positive associations among event stressfulness, core beliefs disruption, and posttraumatic growth.  Posttraumatic growth was not significantly correlated with endorsement of trauma.  Perceived social support was shown to have a significant, negative relationship with endorsement of trauma, but was not significantly positively correlated with any other variable.  Discussion of the implications for these results is provided, as well as study limitations and directions for future research.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Histone variants and post-translational modifications (PTMs) are known to play central roles in genome regulation and maintenance. Quantitavely characterization of the variants and the associated PTMs is the first step to understand their biological functions. However, many variants and the PTM combinations are inaccessible by antibody-based methods or bottom-up tandem mass spectrometry. For many, the only tractable approach is with intact protein top-down tandem mass spectrometry. In this dissertation, a method of identification of histone H4 proteoforms is developed, revealing the challenge of top-down proteomics. Then a method of proteoform identification and relative quantitation of histones H2A and H2B by FT-ICR MS and MS/MS is developed, yielding quantitative identification of all detected H2A and H2B isobaric and isomeric proteoforms with a label-free approach in HeLa. The method is further extended to 1) normal and HIV-infected U937 cells; 2) the Fluorescence Ubiquitination Cell Cycle Indicator (FUCCI) stem cells sorted into early G1, late G1, S, and G2/M phases; 3) MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells synchronized to S and M phases. The top-down MS/MS approach provides a path forward for more extensive elucidation of the biological roles of many previously unstudied histone variants and PTMs.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>ABSTRACT</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation has two aims. The first is to further expand the scope of composition studies to include the/a/our body within digital multimodal composition—considering how it can be an active participant in both the process and the product. The second aim is to interrogate the ways in which the/a/our body interacts with technological components through literacy activities that are engaged within the composing process. Toward that end, it attends to the following overarching question: how does a composer creates an embodied digital performance? The problem space of this dissertation is multifaceted, building first upon bodies in composition and then exploring how they might potentially add to the importance of digital multimodal composition; these two areas of focus are not always examined in tandem, which makes their connection a space worth studying. Therefore, this dissertation addresses both challenging spaces by asking sub questions:</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>1)	How does a composer incorporate his or her body as a site of or component of digital multimodal composition? </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>2)	What literacy activities facilitate the movement between or the integration of material and digital bodies?  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This exploration adds to the existing scholarship within Rhetoric and Composition because it invites compositionists to consider, and explicitly acknowledge, the body as we continue to compose digitally, thereby revisiting the multimodal component of the body and pushing the boundaries between material and digital composing. In order to answer these questions, this dissertation describes the composing process through the lens of dance; identifies literacy activities in which the/a/our body participates; and theorizes the ways in which digital embodiment, and the mind-body connection reintegrate (explicitly) the/a/our body into the composing process. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In order to understand the/a/our body’s potential in composition, this study focuses upon a singular case study that crosses disciplinary boundaries by examining digital dance, or dance and technology choreography. This study details the invention, revision, and performance of the dance Zero, One… performed in spring 2015. Studying this particular performance piece throughout the process highlighted the ways in which a composer (the choreographer in this instance) worked to simultaneously integrate movement phrases of the/a/our body and movement of digital projection as an immersive experience for both the dancers and the audience. In addition to the observation of rehearsals and the performances, interviews were conducted with both the choreographer and the dancers in order to understand the experiences of the composing body and the bodies that were a part of the final product, and choreography notes were collected. The data collected was analyzed in layers; first, it was organized into the major components of the composing process, then the interviews were inductively coded with two coding schemes, and the choreography notes and video observations were analyzed holistically.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The analysis of the data points to four key contributions that directly impact approaches to digital multimodal composition: 1) the/a/our body is active in the process of digital multimodal composition—composing across invention, revision, and performance through the literacy activities enacted; 2) the integration of the/a/our body and technology creates a sense of hyperawareness (distributing attention/awareness to multiple components simultaneously), and it uses kinesthetic awareness (awareness of the relationship between the/a/our body and space) to achieve integration; 3) the somatic and digital components inform one another in the creation of each through their affordances and constraints because they evolve in tandem; and 4) the/a/our body shifts from the individual and becomes a part of the whole within the performance of the digital multimodal composition, and it achieves this by redistributing focus to all of the contributing elements equally. The/a/our body is an active and necessary component in digital multimodal composition, and it is not only relegated to being the composing body but also a contributing element to the composition as a whole.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The field of education requires professionals to respect the diversity of all families.  Many professional organizations outline required practices for all teachers in regard to professional expectations in working with children and families.  In the past, family diversity has typically been portrayed in terms of socioeconomic status, language, culture, family constellation, and ethnicity.  The need to recognize diversity in family structures is supported by the increasing diversity in family constellations in the United States over the past few decades.  The U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (U.S. Census Bureau, 2013) reports that there are 640,000 same-sex couples residing together in the United States.  With the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision (Obergefell et al. v. Hodges, Director, Ohio Department of Health et al., 2015) making same-sex marriage a right nationwide, it is likely that the number of same-sex parented households will increase.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Previous research has indicated that homophobia in schools is directed toward gay, lesbian, bi-sexual, and transgender (LGBT) students as well as children and families headed by same-sex parents (Kosciw &amp; Diaz, 2008; Kosciw, Greytak, Palmer, &amp; Boesen, 2014).  Some of the key findings of past research has shown that students and parents reported hearing biased language, including sexist remarks as well as blatantly homophobic comments from both students and school staff members.  Additionally, students and parents alike have reported reported that school staff members rarely intervened upon hearing negative remarks about LGBT parents.  An additional concern regarding the population of children and families headed by same-sex couples is the impact that teachers’ personal beliefs and attitudes have on classroom practices in schools.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The current literature regarding teacher beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors toward children and families headed by same-sex parents is sparse and dated.  Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine pre-service teachers’ personal beliefs and attitudes toward working with children and families headed by same-sex parents.  Additionally, the study examined the relationships between pre-service teacher background characteristics and their personal beliefs and attitudes as well as the relationship of their perceived learning in coursework to their personal beliefs and attitudes about, comfort levels in working with, and feelings of preparedness in working with children and families headed by same-sex parents.  The study also investigated the correlation between pre-service teachers’ personal beliefs and attitudes about and comfort levels in working with children and families headed by same-sex parents.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>All undergraduate pre-service teachers in the programs of early childhood education, elementary education, visual disabilities, and exceptional student education in the School of Teacher Education at Florida State University were invited to participate in an online survey administered during face-to-face classes.  A final sample of 201 pre-service teachers participated in the study which utilized a Qualtrics survey.  The data were analyzed using SPSS 23.0 statistical software.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Results of the study show that while pre-service teacher personal beliefs and attitudes, comfort levels, and feelings of preparedness in working with children and families headed by same-sex parents is fairly high, there are some areas worth noting.  Specifically, the study found that there is a correlation between a pre-service teachers’ religious background and beliefs, geographic location, and exposure to diverse populations including LGBT people, and their personal beliefs and attitudes toward working with this population.  The results of the study also suggest that although less than half of the participants reported having been exposed to coursework related to working with children and families headed by same-sex parents, pre-service teachers who were exposed to coursework related to working with children and families headed by same-sex parents had more positive personal beliefs and attitudes and higher feelings of preparedness in working with this population of students and their families.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>While the study had limitations related to age, gender, and geographic location, due to the survey being implemented in face-to-face classes at one university, the results indicate a need for teacher preparation coursework that includes LGBT issues along with specific tools and resources to help pre-service teachers in preparing to work with an ever expanding diverse population of students and families, including those headed by same-sex parents.  The results of this study also highlight the need for continued research in the area of teacher preparation related to working with children and families headed by same-sex parents so that pre-service teachers will be prepared to create welcoming classrooms and design instruction that is inclusive of all children and families.</DISS_para>

      <DISS_content>
         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Executive Function (EF) is defined as “self-directed actions so as to choose goals and to select, enact, and sustain actions across time towards those goals” (Barkley, 2012; p. 170). These “self-directed actions” can take the form of behavioral, social, or emotional regulation. Since that time, EF has been associated with the frontal lobe function and has been researched as being affected by multiple physical and mental health disorders (Jurado &amp; Roselli, 2007).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	EF deficits have been linked to Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). ADHD is “a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that is frequently displayed and more severe than is typically observed in individuals at a comparable level of development” (APA, 2013, p. 59). Research indicates that 4.4% of the adult population qualify for a diagnosis of ADHD (Barkley, Fischer, Smallish, &amp; Fletcher, 2002; Bush, Valera, &amp; Seidman, 2006; Glutting, Youngstrom, &amp; Walkins, 2005; Kessler et al., 2005; DuPaul, Weyandt, O’Dell, &amp; Varejao, 2009). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	College students with ADHD face unique challenges compared to their non-ADHD peers with respect to academics (Antshel et al., 2010; Barkley et al., 2006; Dupaul Weyandt, O’Dell, &amp; Varejao, 2009), driving (Barkley, 2011a; Barkley, Anderson, &amp; Kruesi, 2007; Richards et al., 2006), and work performance (Barkley, 2011a; Barkley &amp; Murphy, 2010; Shifrin, Proctor, &amp; Prevatt, 2010; Wilens, Faraone, &amp; Biederman, 2004). Only 20% of young adults with ADHD will enroll in college with about 5% completing college (Antshel et al., 2010; Barkley et al., 2006; Biederman et al., 2006). Adults with ADHD have been shown to have greater likelihood to be at fault for car accidents and receive speeding tickets, (Barkley, 2011a; Barkley, Anderson, &amp; Kruesi, 2007; Richards et al., 2006). Also, adults with ADHD are more likely to have a lower salary are reprimanded more at work (Barkley &amp; Murphy, 2010; Shifrin, Proctor, &amp; Prevatt, 2010; Wilens, Faraone, &amp; Biederman, 2004). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Evaluating ADHD in college students is done through multiple methods ranging from cognitive tests of EF to self-report rating scales on ADHD symptomology (Barkley, 2011a). As said previously, cognitive tests of EF were initially used to study individuals with frontal lobe damage (Barkley, 2011a; 2012; Barkley &amp; Murphy, 2011; Jurado &amp; Roselli, 2007). Meanwhile, rating scales of EF for adults evaluate a myriad of cognitive constructs without being based on any theory that allows clinicians to determine which cognitive functions are executive in nature (Burgess et al., 1998; Climie, Cadogan, &amp; Goukon, 2014; Gioia et al., 2000; Naglieri &amp; Goldstein, 2013).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The Barkley Deficits in Executive Functioning Scale (BDEFS; Barkley, 2011b) is a recently created self-report rating scale that assesses five behavioral deficit areas related to EF: Self-Management to Time, Self-Organization/Problem Solving, Self-Restraint, Self-Motivation, and Self-Regulation of Emotion (Barkley, 2011a). Barkley (2011a) created the BDEFS to easily evaluate EF deficits in adults with ADHD as well as create a measure that was theoretically based (Barkley, 2012). The purpose of this study was to add further evidence to the incremental validity of the BDEFS on assessing ADHD symptoms and life impairments related to ADHD in college students over commonly used cognitive tests of EF.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study analyzed 83 college students diagnosed with ADHD at a southeastern public university. The mean age of the students was twenty-four years old with a median age of twenty-one years old. 47% of the students were male with 69% of the students identifying as Caucasian, 18% as Hispanic, 4% as African American, 4% Asian, and 4% as “Other.” As well, 11% of students identified as being a freshman, 24% as a sophomore, 19% as a junior, 25% as a senior, 16% as a graduate students, and 5 % did not choose a specific year in college. Through the use of multiple independent t-tests and One-way analysis of variances, no significant effects with respect to age, gender, ethnicity, or year in college were found on each of the dependent variables.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>With respect to incremental validity, the BDEFS subdomains consistently added significant variance over the variance accounted for by cognitive tests of EF on each dependent variable (i.e., inattention symptoms, hyperactivity symptoms, impulsivity symptoms, work performance, and driving performance). Conversely, cognitive tests of EF were never able to add significant variance over the variance accounted for by the BDEFS subdomains on each dependent variable. It is clear that further support of the validity of the BDEFS is needed. This study demonstrated additional evidence towards the incremental validity of the BDEFS over cognitive tests of EF on ADHD symptoms and impairments. This study also demonstrated evidence towards the ecological validity of the BDEFS.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>What are the causes and consequences of internal displacement during civil conflicts? This dissertation makes two general claims: First, internal displacement is often the intentional byproduct of territorial consolidation during civil wars. Non-state actors face a particular incentive to induce displacement as a means to increase their hold on territory in both the long and short term. Forced migrants are more likely to relocate within the state when displaced by a non-state actor, becoming internally displaced persons rather than refugees. Second, internal displacement can be seen as a factor that influences the outcome of civil wars themselves. Wide-scale displacement leads to notable increases in civil war duration. As such, this dissertation refines our collective understanding of the causes of internal displacement while at the same time calling attention to the potentially severe effects of displacement on civil war resolution. This project examines these claims through the use of unique micro-level data on the Colombian Civil War as well as cross-national investigations of internal displacement and civil war duration.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Dan P. McAdams has noted that “over the past three decades, a growing number of philosophers, social scientists, and empirical psychologists have developed theories and research paradigms around the fundamental proposition that adults living in modern societies typically create meaning and purpose in their lives by constructing self-defining stories (McAdams 1985; Mclean, Pasupathi, &amp; Pals 2007; Ricoeur 1984; qtd. In McAdams 2013). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation addresses the question of why women  Adult Third Culture Kids (A/TCKs), also termed Global Nomads, have written about their mobile childhoods and what they hoped to achieve by sharing their stories with others. Researchers have attempted to understand how international mobility has led to specific challenges of A/TCKs such as grief brought on by many losses, as well as feeling torn between their passport and host countries’ cultural and ideological expectations. This qualitative study uses a literary analysis and narrative identity theory in order to understand how these self-identified women A/TCKs made sense of their international childhoods by utilizing their own stories. The study concludes that the greatest challenge faced by these authors was the absence of previous literature that would have provided a voice and a template to conceptualize their own journeys. Through literary analysis, this dissertation also attempts to deconstruct general characteristics and aptitudes that have been attributed to A/TCKs. Instead, this dissertation focuses on the parent-child relationship and examins how parents communicated with their children about challenges that were brought on by frequent relocation. The dissertation surmises that parents and friends were important key figures that either silenced the stories TCKs were allowed to tell or, conversely, encouraged further dialogue thereby validating the child’s experiences and feelings, which, in turn, allowed adults to understand their own identity development</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Social class is an important construct throughout the social sciences but has not received nearly as much attention in the management literature as it has in other fields.  As a result, there is relatively little information regarding the role of social class in the areas of organizational behavior and human resources.  The purpose of this dissertation was to understand the role of social class in the employment process, specifically during job search.  Further, a model incorporating social class, job search antecedents, job search behavior, and various employment outcomes was tested.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The dissertation included two studies: a pilot study and a main study.  The pilot study was conducted using 218 job seekers recruited from MTurk and assessed the psychometric properties of the various measures used in the dissertation.  The pilot study’s results also confirmed the dimensionality of the following constructs: socioeconomic status, subjective social status, and job search knowledge and skills.  The main study was conducted using 271 undergraduate seniors seeking employment after graduation and tested the various hypotheses relevant to the research model.  Social class was significantly related to the majority of antecedents to job search behavior, however the majority of the hypothesized moderating effects were not statistically significant.  Overall, the results indicated that social class (a) directly related to social resources and most motivational factors relevant in the job search process, (b) indirectly affected job search behavior through job search self-efficacy, and (c) moderated the relationship between job search behavior and job search duration.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this dissertation, I compare three case study-based analyses of collaborative governance arrangements between municipal government parks and recreation departments and civil-sector disc golf associations. I utilize theories of collaborative governance, an arrangement between two or more organizations sharing responsibility for decision making, problem solving, and/or the provision of a good or service (Ansell &amp; Gash, 2007; Bradley, 2012), to examine the extent to which free-market economic approaches to public sector sport and recreation administration (and namely practices associated with the implementation of devolution) influence the structurations within which disc golf courses are developed, administered, and resourced (Ansell &amp; Gash, 2007; Elwood and Leitner, 2003; Ghose, 2005; Roy, 2015). Although some scholars have examined the use of collaborative governance in sport and recreation (e.g. Brownlow, 2006; Joassart-Marcelli et al., 2011; Perkins, 2009; Perkins, 2010; Pincetl, 2003), there has been little research on sport specific models of collaborative governance at the municipal level and the perceptions of those involved in this model. I look specifically at how the restructuring of government agencies to partner with civil sector organizations for the provision of parks and recreation affect the quality and fluency of those services/facilities (Joassart-Marcelli, Wolch, &amp; Salim, 2010; Holifield &amp; Williams, 2014; Pincetl, 2003; Wolch, 1990). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>For this analysis, I conducted three inductive, qualitative case studies using interviews, observation, and document analysis of disc golf course development and administration in three differentially scaled cities. Overall, I examined participant perceptions of: 1) the management of disc golf space; 2) responsibilities of the organizations involved in collaborative governance; 3) benefits and challenges of the collaborative partnership; and 4) anticipated outcomes of disc golf related to economic development, social inclusion, and public health for policy. The results indicate a variety of collaborative governance models by public administrators and members of local disc golf associations who work together to plan and maintain courses, provide funding, and enhance the local disc golf scene.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation reports the study of three nuclei $^{19}$O, $^{29}$Al, and $^{27}$Mg at high angular momentum using $\gamma$-ray spectroscopy. These experiments were performed at the John D. Fox Superconducting Linear Accelerator at Florida State University (FSU). $\gamma$-radiation and charged particles were detected in coincidence by employing the Compton suppressed FSU $\gamma$-detector array in conjunction with a silicon $\Delta$E-E particle telescope. \\</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>\indent The $^{9}$Be($^{14}$C, $\alpha$$\gamma$) reaction at beam energies of 30 and 35 MeV were used to populate excited levels of $^{19}$O. The data were sorted for $\alpha$-$\gamma$ and $\alpha$-$\gamma$-$\gamma$ coincidences. A total of eight new $\gamma$ transitions and the addition of one new state in $^{19}$O were identified.  Six of these $\gamma$ transitions correspond to neutron unbound states.  These results are compared to shell model calculations using the USDA, WBP, and PSDU interactions. The neutron unbound $\gamma$ decaying states are best identified with states having higher spin and small spectroscopic factors. \\</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>\indent Excited levels were populated in $^{29}$Al and $^{27}$Mg using the reactions $^{18}$O($^{14}$C,p2n) and $^{18}$O($^{14}$C,$\alpha$ n) at 40 MeV. The data were sorted for p-$\gamma$-$\gamma$ and $\alpha$-$\gamma$-$\gamma$ coincidences for $^{29}$Al and $^{27}$Mg respectively.  The level and decay schemes of both nuclei have been expanded with the addition of several new levels and electromagnetic transitions. The results for both nuclei are compared to shell model calculations using the USDA and WBP interactions.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Rolf de Maré’s Ballets Suédois was at the forefront of the Parisian avant-garde between 1920 and 1925.  The company produced twenty-four distinctive, innovative works that challenged conventions of ballet and explored diverse modes of creative expression.  Its goal was “to interpret modern life” through a synthesis of the arts, and in doing so, the company reflected the vitality and volatility of the postwar milieu.  Primary sources reveal the considerable impact the Ballets Suédois had in its day, yet the company has been largely overlooked in scholarly research, mostly due to its brief lifespan and the shadow of Serge Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes.  This dissertation seeks to expand historical narratives of modernism in Paris in the early 1920s.  It considers the vital role of the Ballets Suédois and its embrace of the art of the “everyday” in the wake of the Great War.  It reveals that eclecticism and ephemerality are at the heart of the everyday aesthetic, and the Ballets Suédois and its oeuvre both extolled and embodied these concepts as viable artistic values.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A multidisciplinary study of three selected works produced by the Ballets Suédois—La Boîte à joujoux (1921), Les Mariés de la Tour Eiffel (1921), and Within the Quota (1923)—illuminates varied manifestations of the everyday among the company’s body of work.  The primary focus in each case study is on the music, which was composed by Claude Debussy, members of Les Six, and Cole Porter, respectively.  Essential elements of the music are examined through style analysis and discussed alongside aspects of the dance, visual art, scenario, and mise-en-scène, evidence for which comes from archival research conducted at the Dansmuseet in Stockholm, Sweden, and the Bibliothèque nationale in Paris, France.  Furthermore, each ballet is considered within the larger context of the company’s vision, repertoire, and achievements.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Ultimately, this dissertation addresses the significance of the art of the everyday, as well as the nature of the Ballets Suédois’ legacy.  It demonstrates that the Ballet Suédois and its collaborators celebrated the realities of eclecticism, simultaneity, and ephemerality.  They offered postwar audiences new perspectives on art and life during a period of great change.  They elevated the art of life.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The fundamental chemistry of the f-elements is relatively underexplored compared to any other block of elements on the periodic table. The synthesis, structure determination, and characterization of new f-element compounds may lead to the elucidation of novel materials and structure-property relationships which may in turn have innovative real world applications.  The goal of this research is to synthesize new lanthanide and actinide selenites that are relevant for their optical, ion-exchange, sorption, and magnetic properties. To this end, the research contained herein will address the synthesis and characterization of inorganic materials containing f-elements. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this work, the structural chemistry and resultant physico-chemical properties were probed using selenite as a ligand, often in combination with other metals or counter-ions. Multiple characterization techniques were utilized including single crystal X-ray diffraction, powder X-ray diffraction, superconducting quantum interference device magnetometery, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry, and solid-state ultraviolet-visible-near infrared spectroscopy. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In an effort to synthesize lanthanide- and actinide- containing selenite materials to compare bonding and other chemical properties several new 4f and 5f compounds were discovered including: isotypic structures displaying an unusual case of aliovalent substitution, Th(VO3)2(SeO3) and Ln(VO3)2(IO3) (Ln = Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, and Eu) (Chapter 2), mixed anion materials including three noncentrosymmetric structures, Pr2(SeO3)2(SO4)(H2O)2, KGd2(SeO3)3(H2O), KEu2(SeO3)3(H2O), and Ce2(SeO3)3(VO2) (Chapter 3), isomorphous open-framework structures, Na3Ln4(SeO3)7O·nH2O (Ln =  Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb) (Chapter 4), a 3d-4f heterobimetallic material, DyCo(SeO3)3Cl(O)(H2O) (Chapter 5), and the first example of a lanthanide carbonate selenite, KHo(CO3)(SeO3) (Chapter 6).</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This treatise examines the evolution of the tuba concerto. The goals of this study are to</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>show how the tuba concerto began, to illustrate the musical significance, and to provide an increased awareness of the positive attributes and importance of the tuba concerto genre.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This discussion provides a clear, chronological look at different aspects of tuba concertos to show the progress the genre has made over time. The discussion begins with a selection of the early tuba concertos, from the late nineteenth century through to the 1950s, and their characteristics. Following is an overview of general characteristics and trends in tuba concertos in each decade, starting in the 1960s. One concerto from each decade is examined in detail, emphasizing some of the interesting facets of each work, followed by a brief formal analysis. Review of specific concertos from each decade shows the growth of the tuba concerto over time. The appendices will then provide an index of tuba concertos.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>While the genre began as almost a novelty, tuba concertos have evolved into works that are substantial in their artistry and musical value. Today, tuba concertos are performed, composed, and commissioned by major artists and groups worldwide. The findings of this paper support this thesis and documents evolution of the tuba concerto into a form of serious and well- respected composition.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>A finite dimensional amplitude equation model of 2-dimensional double-diffusive convection near a quadruple-zero (codimension 4) bifurcation point is derived using center manifold reduction. The derivation employs small perturbation-theory to obtain an asymptomatic solution to the 2-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations. The coefficients of the amplitude equations are derived for two parameter regimes corresponding to high and moderate thermal Rayleigh numbers. By numerically approximating the Poincare map of the amplitude equations,  local and global bifurcations are detected that lead to birth of strange attractors. Specifically, strange attractors are generated by homoclinic explosions in the Poincare map. For high thermal Rayleigh numbers, this route to chaos in the Poincare map is analogous to that route present in the continuous Shimizu-Morioka and Rucklidge models, where the bifurcation to periodic convection is supercritical. For low thermal Rayleigh numbers, the route to chaos in the Poincare map is shown to be analogous to the route observed in the Lorenz equations. Additionally, the bifurcations of the strange attractors of the Poincare map are studied, and numerical simulations reveal the presence of period doubling regimes and intermittency, as well as exotic bifurcations which include splitting, and interior crises, of strange attractors.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Previous research has found that social exclusion leads people to be wary of others yet motivated to reestablish social connections. However, most research has focused on how social exclusion affects responses to strangers. The current studies tested the hypothesis that exclusion would lead people to turn to and invest in their friends and family. This hypothesis was not supported. Excluded participants did not differ from non-excluded participants in terms of their desire to spend time with friends and family rather than strangers (Study 1), their desire to pursue pro-relationship goals (Study 1), and their generosity toward their friends vs. strangers (Study 2).</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Cerebral Visual Impairment (“CVI”) is defined by a deficit of vision and visual perception in children that results from damage to the brain (Dutton &amp; Lueck, 2015). Currently, CVI is the most common cause of visual impairment in children in the developed world. The purpose of this paper is to provide an evidence-based curriculum guide to music therapy for children aged 6- to 16-years-old with visual impairments, specifically CVI. The author begins by providing a background on Perkins School for the Blind. Next, she reviews current literature on visual impairments, CVI, and music therapy. Finally, she proposes a curriculum guide for children with visual impairments, specifically CVI, and discusses effective music therapy interventions by age group.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Children who are native Spanish-speaking Language Minority Youth (LMY) comprise the fastest growing population of students in the United States. In addition, these children lag significantly behind their non-LMY peers in academic achievement. To aid in their development of academic skills, it is necessary to evaluate individual factors that are related to later reading and math achievement. One such individual factor is executive function (EF). EF is defined as the set of cognitive skills that underlie children’s ability to regulate their thoughts and actions. Among the skills encompassed by executive function are inhibitory control (i.e., the ability to suppress a dominant response in favor of a subdominant response), working memory (i.e., the ability to maintain and manipulate information in short-term memory), and shifting (i.e., the ability to switch flexibly between tasks). Children who speak more than one language are theorized to have what is called a “bilingual advantage” in their executive function ability such that they outperform their non-LMY peers on tasks of inhibitory control. It is theorized that the bilingual advantage originates from the simultaneous activation of both languages and the constant need to select the relevant language while ignoring their other language. This conflict between languages and the need to select just one language in which to respond confers cognitive advantages that are said to generalize to inhibitory control. However, findings are mixed regarding whether the bilingual advantage exists. A closer examination of these findings suggests that the bilingual advantage is dependent upon the type of inhibitory control task administered. Specifically, the bilingual advantage is said to exist on tasks of interference suppression (IS; defined as the ability to ignore or suppress irrelevant salient perceptual information in a bivalent task and selectively attend to relevant conflicting information), but not on tasks of response inhibition (RI; defined as suppressing a dominant response in favor of a less dominant response). The goal of this study was to evaluate the different types of inhibitory control among children with some degree of exposure to both Spanish and English and to understand better whether there is a bilingual advantage conferred on tasks of interference suppression (but not on tasks of response inhibition) for children with a greater degree of bilingualism. In the current study, 100 Spanish-speaking LMY preschool students were administered an English and Spanish language measure to determine their degree of bilingualism as well as seven computerized tasks of inhibitory control. Four of the computerized tasks evaluated IS (two required verbal responses, two did not) and three of the computerized tasks evaluated RI (one required a verbal response, two did not). Consistent with the first hypothesis, the verbal and nonverbal computerized tasks measured a unitary inhibitory control construct. Consistent with the second hypothesis, results indicated that IS and RI were distinct domains within the broader construct of inhibitory control. Consistent with the third hypothesis, results indicated that a higher degree of bilingualism was associated with stronger inhibitory control, and that children’s degree of bilingualism was relatively more associated with IS than with RI. These findings support the presence of a bilingual advantage conferred to children’s inhibitory control, as well as a specific advantage conferred to inhibitory control tasks that require IS. However, degree of bilingualism was strongly related to children’s English language skills.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This purpose of the present study was to explore the relationship between psychopathology and dysfunctional career thoughts, as little research has combined the two constructs. The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2) was used as a measure of participants’ psychopathology, and the Career Thoughts Inventory (CTI) was used as a measure of participants’ dysfunctional career thoughts. Cognitive Information Processing (CIP) was employed to provide theoretical underpinnings to the study. Five case were chosen from an archival database, and all participants had CTI Total Scale T-scores ≥ 65. Each case contained an MMPI-2 Extended Report which was used to determine findings of psychopathology. Alongside the primary researcher’s interpretations, four Experts in the use of the MMPI/MMPI-2 agreed to interpret the Extended Reports and provide thoughts about symptoms and diagnoses of psychopathology were present. Data were analyzed by the primary researcher and findings were determined based on endorsement across cases.  Results of this study indicated that individuals with high levels of dysfunctional career thoughts might also be experiencing psychopathologies and diagnoses of depression, anxiety, somatic concerns, obsessional-compulsive concerns, personality disorders, and gender and culturally based concerns.  Implications include a strong need for additional training for practitioners at the intersection of mental health and career concerns and awareness to suicidal ideation in those with dysfunctional career thoughts.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>To what extent does an agent’s history affect her moral responsibility? Consider a U.S. one dollar bill. Something’s being a genuine U.S. one dollar bill depends on the history of that thing. It is essentially historical. The bill’s authenticity depends upon whether or not it was printed by an authorized printer of money (and also whether it was printed on an authorized press on authorized paper, etc.). If it was not, then it is a counterfeit. Historicists claim that moral responsibility is essentially historical—like being a genuine U.S. dollar bill. Structuralists deny this. The primary aim of this dissertation is to defend a historicist view of moral responsibility. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Consider a pair of drunk drivers who run over pedestrians while equally drunk. Suppose that they have qualitatively identical non-historical psychological profiles at the time of their respective accidents. But suppose that one freely got drunk at happy hour and freely drove home and the other was force-fed alcohol and placed behind the wheel. It seems like the one who freely drove home is morally responsible for running over the pedestrian, but the other is not—despite the fact that neither of them meet common structuralist necessary conditions for moral responsibility. If asymmetrical judgments concerning the responsibility of the two drivers are justified, then structuralist conditions fail to be necessary for moral responsibility.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Tracing cases, such as the case of the drunk drivers, are one of the primary motivations for historicism. Manipulation cases are another. They are designed to show that structuralist conditions are insufficient. Suppose Manny has installed a device in Vic’s brain. This device allows Manny to stimulate Vic’s brain in a way that causes him to perform some morally significant action while having the right structure of psychological states. It seems that Vic is not morally responsible for this action despite meeting common structuralist sufficient conditions for moral responsibility. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Recently structuralists have argued that tracing cases and manipulation cases do not, if fact, motivate historicism. I first defend tracing from two recent arguments presented by Matt King and Andrew Khoury. I then defend the use of manipulation to motivate historicism from some recent structuralist challenges: the personal identity objection, the unreliable intuition objection, and the x-phi objection. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The three main extant historicist views are: Fischer and Ravizza’s positive historicism, Haji and Cuypers’ mixed historicism, and Mele’s negative historicism. Positive historicism holds that in order to be morally responsible, an agent must have a certain type of history. I argue that this position is susceptible to the problem of manipulation and the instant agent objection. Mixed historicism does not require that agents have pasts. So while it avoids the instant agent objection, I argue that it is inadequate because it relies on a problematic notion of relational authenticity. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Negative historicism simply requires that agents lack certain kinds of pasts. Mele’s historical condition is part of a set of sufficient conditions that is satisfiable by an agent in a deterministic world. I provide several manipulation cases that cannot be accounted for by Mele’s conditions. I argue that we might want an account of historicism that can cover a broader range of cases. I then present a novel version of historicism called conditional historicism that avoids the aforementioned problems with other accounts. Conditional historicism is similar to mixed historicism in that it does not require that agents have pasts. But if agents have pasts, they must be of a certain sort. My project is to flesh out what sort of past agents must have to be morally responsible. Finally, I conclude by taking stock of the dialectic thus far and discussing a terminological issue.</DISS_para>

      <DISS_content>
         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>It seems well accepted that agents can only be morally responsible for what they voluntarily control. Yet as a matter of practice, we seem to hold agents responsible for items outside of their voluntary control, blaming others for failing to notice certain features of their environment, for having certain attitudes, or for forgetting to fulfill a promise. There is an apparent tension between philosophical theory and everyday practice.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>One way to explain away this tension is by appealing to a distinction between direct and derivative responsibility. When an agent S is responsible for something, X, in virtue of being responsible for something else that does not include X, Y, then S is derivatively responsible for X. When S is responsible for X but not solely in virtue of being responsible for some other thing, Y, S is directly responsible for X. One might argue that to be directly responsible for some item, one must have voluntary control over it. We are, at best, derivatively responsible for items over which we lack voluntary control, such as nonvoluntary attitudes. If we can trace back to a point at which an agent had voluntary control over some behavior and was aware of the potential nonvoluntary item that might result, the agent could be derivatively responsible for that item.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Theorists who opt to relieve the tension in this way are called volitionists. They insist that voluntary control is required for direct responsibility. Recently, however, several theorists, called nonvolitionists, have denied that voluntary control is required for direct responsibility. Instead, they claim, agents can be directly responsible for nonvoluntary attitudes and other items over which they lack voluntary control.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this dissertation, I begin to assess the motivation for and merits of such nonvolitionist views. In chapter 2, I attempt to precisely articulate a volitionist thesis, which is more difficult than volitionists and nonvolitionists have yet appreciated. I argue that there are substantial problems with understanding the volitionist thesis as the claim that one is directly responsible only for what is under one’s voluntary control. Rather than formulating the volitionist thesis in this way, as others have done, I suggest that it is clearer and more useful to understand the volitionist thesis as the claim that agents are directly responsible only for their intentional actions.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The volitionist thesis I offer in chapter 2 does not include direct responsibility for many omissions. While volitionists might want to amend this volitionist thesis to include these omissions, I argue in chapter 3 that they cannot do so in a justified way. If volitionists cannot comfortably extend direct responsibility to include omissions, they must account for these items derivatively via some kind of tracing strategy. In chapter 4, I argue that there are problems with proposed epistemic conditions on derivative responsibility, and some nonvoluntary faults—especially negligence and certain omissions—will prove quite difficult, if not impossible, for the tracing strategy. Accounting for responsibility for some nonvoluntary faults either directly or derivatively might be much more difficult for volitionists than they have previously appreciated. In light of this difficulty in matching our everyday responsibility ascriptions and practices, we should entertain nonvolitionist accounts.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The second half of the dissertation explores the plausibility of nonvolitionism. In chapter 5, I explain and defend one of the current leading nonvolitionist accounts: Angela Smith’s rational relations view (RRV). RRV holds that agents can be directly responsible for their attitudes in virtue of a rational connection between such attitudes and the judgments and values that underlie them. The second half of chapter 5 as well as chapter 6 are devoted to defending RRV against various objections, including a recent criticism from Neil Levy. Levy argues that direct responsibility requires consciousness of the moral significance of one’s behavior. I argue that Levy fails to establish such consciousness as necessary for direct responsibility, and then offer some revisions to the rational relations view that might help to mitigate Levy’s worries.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This modified version of RRV, which I call the rational control view (RCV), is thus poised to be a viable alternative to volitionist views. In chapter 7, I explain and defend RCV. My conclusion is modest: RCV is a serious and legitimate contender to volitionist views in light of the problems I highlight in the first several chapters. As such, RCV is worth developing further as we search for the best account of how and why agents are morally responsible for not only intentional actions, but also omissions and attitudes.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The retail industry, and in turn store design, has always been affected by the economy and technological advances (Mayo, 1993). In recent years, the advancement of the internet has proven to be one of the major factors in the retail industry. While the internet has enabled consumers to get what they want in the comfort of their own home, it has taken the recreational and community aspects out of the shopping experience that has been a part of the retail story since buying and selling first started. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The goal of this thesis is to explore and analyze data through an in-depth method of market segment mapping, historic and location research, and design programming to create grocery store shopping experiences, tailored to the local community. The study and project looks at the local community, taking into account that understanding the target market will enable retailers to create positive shopping experiences. Grocery stores were selected as the focus of the study since they are a common thread among all types of people and have been a key element of community living in American history (Mayo, 1993).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The original research component of this project analyzes specific neighborhoods in Jackson, MS to better identify potential target markets and aid in creating grocery store environments that reflect the local community. The methodology is comprised of two different aspects, demographics and sense of place. The demographic data includes five major contributing factors found in the literature review: transportation, existing food structures, ethnicity, population, and fiscal variance. This data was overlaid across the city of Jackson where specific neighborhoods were targeted and analyzed. Once the neighborhoods were selected an in-depth look at the historical aspects and other factors relating to a sense of place were compiled. The study resulted in an analysis of demographic data and was combined with location research and programming for a proposed design solution. The data uncovered local community needs and values in order to tailor the grocery store design to a specific community in Jackson, MS.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Diabatic processes including latent heating and radiation are parameterized in numerical weather prediction (NWP) models and constitute a major source of error. Isolating the extent of diabatic modification in an extratropical cyclone in observational atmospheric data is difficult. This study analyzes four idealized Advanced Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF-ARW) model sensitivity experiments in which radiation or moisture are either included or withheld. The experiments consist of the following: no radiation and no moisture (NRNM), radiation and no moisture (RNM), moisture and no radiation (NRM), and radiation and moisture (RM). Simulations are of an idealized baroclinic wave in the midlatitudes. Because baroclinic waves are associated with synoptic scale weather events, these WRF-ARW simulations are the ideal platform to better understand the interactions of diabatic and dynamic processes.   </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Inclusion of moisture and radiation has a significant impact on baroclinic wave structure and evolution. On the synoptic scale, the RM experiment demonstrates greatest amplification/depth, earliest growth, and was the only experiment with cyclonic breaking in the troposphere and high amplitude anticyclonic breaking in the lower stratosphere. On the sub-synoptic scale, vertical dipoles in isentropic potential vorticity (IPV) and cloud-scale anomalies developed in the middle to upper troposphere as the wave matured. While radiation alone yields no anomaly, and moisture alone yields a small anomaly, the inclusion of radiation and moisture together yields a significantly larger IPV anomaly. Anomalies may be due to constructive interference or nonlinear feedbacks between radiative cooling and latent heating. Results of this study have important implications for NWP, especially in the representation of physical processes via parameterization schemes. Knowledge gained about physical processes and their feedbacks on resolved flow might help to better understand error and bias in NWP models.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this research is to gain insight on different aspects of orchestral performance and ensemble skills from the perspective of the second clarinetist. Most of the existing literature related to orchestral clarinet performance focuses primarily on the audition process and the preparation of principal clarinet excerpts. The aim of this study is to examine the proficiencies needed to perform effectively in an orchestral setting. The focus is primarily on second clarinet playing because it is particularly demanding in regards to ensemble skills. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Through interviews with experts, this research examines the challenges involved in playing second clarinet in an orchestra, and the methods through which an orchestral musician can develop ensemble skills. All of the experts questioned have held a position with a major American symphony orchestra for a minimum of eight years. The experts were consulted about personal attitude and approach, balance, intonation, tone, articulation, preparation, collaboration, and other factors that exemplify excellent ensemble playing. Specific second clarinet excerpts were also addressed, particularly with advice on how to play them in the final round of an audition with a member of the orchestra.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>It is my goal to provide valuable information to help clarinetists and other musicians improve their ensemble skills, to assist teachers in passing on this expertise to their students, and to aid clarinetists seeking to win second clarinet auditions.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of the present study was to investigate factors that contribute to the social adjustment to college for gifted emerging adults. Specifically, perceived parental attachment, and social competence were included. Additionally, social competence was examined to determine if it served as a mediator between parental attachment and social adjustment to college. Results from bivariate correlations and multiple regression analyses revealed positive, significant correlations between parental attachment and social adjustment to college, parental attachment and social competence, and social competence and social adjustment to college. Analyses also found that social competence partially mediated the relationship between parental attachment and social adjustment to college. Limitations, implications, and future research directions were discussed. The majority of research regarding gifted individuals focuses on the experience and developmental domains within the K-12 setting. The findings of the present study add to the significant dearth of literature concerning the college experience of gifted individuals. Specifically, the results provide support that a secure parental attachment influences positive development of social competence and better social adjustment to college in gifted emerging adults.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Interference between similar events is known to be a major mechanism of forgetting.  As such, it is important for us to understand how to reduce interference effects.  While early research suggested that differentiation of the two sources of information was vital for preventing interference, more recent research has found that being reminded of similar material and making associations can be most beneficial.  In the present thesis I put these two mechanisms in opposition, utilizing a two list A-B, A-D paradigm.  Experiment 1 revealed little difference in memory for interfering word pairs between participants in a “reminding” condition asked to make associations vs. a “differentiation” condition asked to differentiate and forget old pairs while studying new pairs. Experiment 2a revealed an interaction, such that those told to make associations showed less interference than those told to forget the first list, while both conditions performed similarly on control pairs.  However, Experiment 2b failed to replicate Experiment 2a.  In Experiment 3 I sought to increase the degree of differentiation between lists by varying encoding.  Using different encoding between lists resulted in equivalent interference in both the reminding and differentiation conditions. Experiment 4 varied encoding instructions to contrast the differentiation present in Experiment 3 against circumstances encouraging associations. One group used the same encoding method for both lists, while another was given different study methods between lists. Results reveal a unique discovery about the important interplay of encoding and study time in determining the likelihood of reminding.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation explores musical meaning and narrative in Francis Poulenc’s music through an interaction of three main analytic approaches: the paradigmatic method of analysis as previously demonstrated by Jean-Jacques Nattiez and Kofi Agawu, and Robert Hatten’s significant work in both musical meaning and gestural theory.  The richly motivic and deeply poignant final substantial work of Francis Poulenc—Sonata for Oboe and Piano (1962)—is my composition of choice in undertaking this substantial analytic feat.  Hatten’s gestural theory has a significant impact on the manner in which I segment each movement of the sonata and choose appropriate paradigms for the segmented motivic units.  Likewise, Nattiez’s and Agawu’s paradigmatic analyses and charts play a substantial role in how I generate my own paradigmatic charts, yet I make significant adjustments to correct for what I believe to be shortcomings in my predecessors’ charts and to supplement the narrative trajectory that I trace through each movement.  Hatten’s work in musical meaning, in particular, profoundly influences my narrative analysis of each movement.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The first chapter serves as an introduction to the dissertation, followed by an in-depth review of the literature that aided me throughout this project.  Sources reviewed include a variety of topics relevant to my dissertation: the paradigmatic method of analysis, narrative and musical meaning, topical analysis, tonal tensions and musical expression, intertextuality, harmonic theory, gestural theory, and Schoenbergian motivic relations.  For each source I review, I consider what aspects propelled me forward in my dissertation.  Additionally, when relevant, I discuss why I chose not to adopt the methods of a particular source, or I discuss how I adapted the methods of a source to help better fit my analytic needs.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Chapter 2 begins with an explanation of my adaptations to the paradigmatic method of analysis and how it benefits my analytic approach.  Introduced at the beginning of the chapter are two charts that are significant to my analytic approach, the paradigmatic chart (adapted to fit my analytic needs) and the Master Diachronic Motivic Event Chart, an in-depth diachronic picture of my process of segmenting the movement into motivic units and placing them into appropriate paradigms.  The main body of Chapter 2 begins with an in-depth analysis of the two main oppositional motives of the first movement, followed by a phrase-by-phrase chronological tracing of motivic interactions and transformations that influence both the form and narrative trajectory of the movement.  My conclusion that the first movement fails to provide motivic or tonal closure influences the direction in which I take the final chapter of my dissertation. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The third and final chapter of my dissertation continues the investigation into the thematization of lack of closure in the remaining two movements of Poulenc’s Oboe Sonata.  This lack of closure is approached through an examination of a series of phrase restarts that are brought on by unresolved dominant thirteenth harmonies functioning as undercutting agents in the second movement and a series of wrong dominant arrivals between the melody and underlying harmony in the third movement, with phrases either ending on functionally-mixed iv9 harmonies or transgressive minor thirteenth dominant harmonies in the wrong key.  Finally, I discuss the parallel and contrasting features between the inconclusive endings of the first and final movements of the Oboe Sonata from both an analyst’s and a performer’s perspectives.  The protagonist (from my narrative analysis) and the oboist both long for a resolution to scale-degree 1 that never arrives.  The reader still has the option to follow a detailed chronological analysis of movements 2 and 3 by reading the analytic comments that align with my motivic segmentations within my Master Diachronic Motivic Event Charts for both movements.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) is comprised of a range of therapeutic modalities and atypical practices which have been found to successfully accompany standard medical care. Interventions such as guided imagery and stress management education, among many others, have been linked to improved health outcomes and recovery in the area of mind-body research (Freeman, 2005; Tusek et al., 1997). The objective of this study was to ascertain the degree of impact biofeedback and guided imagery have on psychological variables and medical measures as individual and combined interventions among orthopedic patients who underwent joint replacement surgery. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Hip and knee arthroplasty patients (n = 60) were randomly assigned to one of four groups where each received some form of preoperative intervention. Participants in the guided imagery, biofeedback, guided imagery and biofeedback, and general education groups all met with the researcher one to two weeks preoperatively where baseline measures were collected, instruction and demonstration on the use of the interventions were provided, and packets were distributed with assessments to be completed during their inpatient stay. Anxiety, stress and coping strategies were all measured at baseline, the day of surgery, and in the hospital on the last day of admission just prior to discharge. In addition, the patients level of reported pain each day following surgery while inpatient was appraised as well as the amount of pain medication needed and length of hospital admission. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Results of the present study support continued use of biofeedback and imagery in medicine and demonstrated the enhanced benefit of combining interventions as proposed. The imagery intervention reduced anxiety and perceived pain among the patients. A reduction in state anxiety scores was observed from baseline measurement to the day of discharge and its patients experienced a significant (p &lt; .01) reduction in pain on post-operative day 3 from days 1 and 2. The biofeedback intervention generated positive results on a number of variables evaluated. A steady decline in stress was observed among patients from baseline measurement through discharge from the hospital as well as the continued reduction in medication use from post-operative day 1 through day 3. Furthermore, participants in the biofeedback treatment reported a significant (p &lt; .05) reduction in pain from post-operative day 2 to day 3 (p &lt; .05). Combining both imagery and biofeedback to be used simultaneously as its own intervention elicited the most significant outcomes compared to all other treatment conditions in reducing stress and medication use. Only participants in the combo intervention experienced a significant (p &lt; .001) reduction in stress from the day of surgery to the day of discharge and required significantly (p &lt; .001) less medication administered through the pain pump than any other treatment condition (p &lt; .01). Patients in the general standard of care intervention receiving education experienced a reduction in anxiety from the initial baseline measurement to day of discharge although it was minimal.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Positive outcomes were observed for all interventions provided in the present study. Outcomes reflect those reported across much of the CAM research exploring the benefits of interventions such as guided imagery and biofeedback on health related outcomes (Blanchard et al., 1987; Gervitz, Hubbard, &amp; Harpin, 1996; Scherwitz et al., 2005). While guided imagery and biofeedback yielded benefits for the variables evaluated as sole treatment approaches, current findings reflect the efficacy of a combined approach with greater significance. The benefits of patients in any complementary and alternative medical practice can only positively influence the overall experience and potential results. Continued development and evaluation of more multifaceted approaches are essential in order to provide an optimal level of care.</DISS_para>

      <DISS_content>
         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>When modeling multivariate data such as vectorized images, one might have an extra parameter of contextual information that could be used to treat some observations as more similar to others. For example, images of faces can vary by yaw rotation, and one would expect a face rotated 65 degrees to the left to have characteristics more similar to a face rotated 55 degrees to the left than to a face rotated 65 degrees to the right. We introduce a novel method, parameterized principal component analysis (PPCA), that can model data with linear variation like principal component analysis (PCA), but can also take advantage of this parameter of contextual information like yaw rotation.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Like PCA, PPCA models an observation using a mean vector and the product of observation-specific coefficients and basis vectors. Unlike PCA, PPCA treats the elements of the mean vector and basis vectors as smooth, piecewise linear functions of the contextual parameter. PPCA is fit by a penalized optimization that penalizes potential models which have overly large differences between corresponding mean or basis vector elements for similar parameter values. The penalty ensures that each observation's projection will share information with observations that have similar parameter values, but not with observations that have dissimilar parameter values.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We tested PPCA on artificial data based on known, smooth functions of an added parameter, as well as on three real datasets with different types of parameters. We compared PPCA to independent principal component analysis (IPCA), which groups observations by their parameter values and projects each group using principal component analysis with no sharing of information for different groups. PPCA recovers the known functions with less error and projects the datasets' test set observations with consistently less reconstruction error than IPCA does. PPCA's performance is particularly strong, relative to IPCA, when there are limited training data.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We also tested the use of spectral clustering to form the groups in an IPCA model. In our experiment, the clustered IPCA model had very similar error to the parameter-based IPCA model, suggesting that spectral clustering might be a viable alternative if one did not know the parameter values for an application.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Existing cure-rate survival models are generally not convenient for modeling and estimating the survival quantiles of a patient with specified covariate values. They also do not allow inference on the change in the number of clonogens over time. This dissertation proposes two novel classes of cure-rate model, the transform-both-sides cure-rate model (TBSCRM) and the clonogen proliferation cure-rate model (CPCRM). Both can be used to make inference about both the cure-rate and the survival probabilities over time. The TBSCRM can also produce estimates of a patient's quantiles of survival time, and the CPCRM can produce estimates of a patient's expected number of clonogens at each time.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We develop methods of Bayesian inference about the covariate effects on relevant quantities such as the cure-rate, methods which use  Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) tools. We also show that the TBSCRM-based and CPCRM-based Bayesian methods perform well in simulation studies and outperform existing cure-rate models in application to the breast cancer survival data from the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Early intervention for toddlers with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is critical, given the potential for altering brain development and the increasing focus on early screening and diagnosis. Evidence is emerging for the efficacy of naturalistic, developmental behavioral interventions (NDBIs) for toddlers with ASD, which merge the behavioral learning and developmental science fields. Among these empirically-supported interventions is the Early Social Interaction Project, a parent-implemented intervention designed to achieve the necessary intensity for toddlers with ASD within natural environments. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted using a complete crossover design, allowing for examination of both treatment format/intensity and timing of treatment (Wetherby et al., 2014). In this RCT, children were randomized to receive nine months of either Individual-ESI, which consisted of three individual sessions per week, or Group-ESI, which consisted of one group session per week. Following completion of the first condition, children received the other condition for nine months, for a total of 18 months of intervention. Findings regarding format/intensity of ESI treatment revealed that children receiving Individual-ESI showed greater gains in social communication skills and receptive language than children receiving Group-ESI. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Despite these promising findings, results from this RCT and other studies of NDBIs suggest that not all children benefit similarly from any treatment, indicating the need to better understand patterns of change during early intervention programs. The present study aimed to contribute to gaps in knowledge of individual patterns and predictors of change during treatment by identifying developmental trajectories during the 18-month ESI intervention and examining child characteristics that predict these trajectories.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Participants were 82 children who were diagnosed with ASD between 16 and 20 months of age and subsequently enrolled in the treatment efficacy RCT (Wetherby et al., 2014). Children received measures of early social communication (Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scales [CSBS]) and autism symptoms in the social communication/interaction domain (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule [ADOS]) bimonthly, yielding nine to ten time points for each child.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Piecewise growth mixture models (GMMs) were conducted in order to identify trajectories of change during intervention. Results were similar for CSBS Speech and Symbolic GMMs, as three-class solutions fit the data best. Classes were characterized by (1) steep, early improvement, (2) moderate improvement, and (3) little or no change. Membership in these classes was predicted by several child characteristics measured before the start of treatment, including speech, social, symbolic, and nonverbal developmental skills. GMMs also revealed three trajectories for CSBS Social analyses. Classes were characterized by (1) plateauing improvement, (2) variable improvement, and (3) no change. GMMs revealed just two trajectories for ADOS analyses: (1) first condition improvement and (2) second condition improvement. Only pretreatment symbolic skills predicted trajectory class membership for these variables measuring early social skills. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>These findings represent the first attempt to demonstrate the presence of distinct trajectories of change during a large parent-implemented intervention for toddlers with ASD. The observed trajectories represent diverse patterns of improvement, as well as very limited improvement in some children despite receiving efficacious intervention. Presence of these trajectories suggests that a group-level approach is likely to obscure individual variability in response to treatment, as a single developmental trajectory did not accurately characterize change during treatment. Findings regarding pretreatment predictors of these trajectories of change during treatment were consistent with previous longitudinal and treatment studies. The present study demonstrated a reciprocal relationship between development of social and symbolic skills, such that higher skills in one domain predicted a better trajectory in the other domain. An effect of these skills on language acquisition in treatment for young children with ASD was also demonstrated. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Understanding developmental trajectories during early intervention has important research and clinical implications. Future research should focus on replicating the presence of specific developmental trajectories associated with treatment response and replicating important predictors of these trajectories (i.e., symbolic and social skills). The subset of children that did not show significant response requires further study, as specific profiles associated with limited response to treatment may help clinicians identify children who require greater intensity and/or duration of treatment, or who require a different approach. Alternatively, understanding which children are most likely to benefit from specific treatment approaches aids in understanding of which treatments work for whom. This line of research may ultimately contribute to treatment individualization for toddlers with ASD as trajectories of response to treatment are identified and associated with specific profiles. Findings may help clinicians predict response to treatment and ultimately tailor treatments for individual children.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation argues that certain late-medieval British travelers intended more than simply to journey from place to place.  Their travel writing reveals that they had other goals to accomplish, beyond the expected ones of seeing a new place or visiting a particular holy site.  I am using three traveler-authors and their works:  William Wey’s The Itineraries of William Wey (1458-62), Gerald of Wales’s The Description of Wales and The Journey Through Wales (c. 1191), and Margery Kempe, The Book of Margery Kempe (c.1436).  This study begins with two chapters devoted to the nature of travel and travel writing in the Middle Ages, and an introduction of the three travelers.  Why and how did people travel, and why did they leave written accounts?  I will address two important discussions in the field—the idea of curiosity as a motivator for medieval travelers, and the debate best described as “communitas vs. the individual.”  Chapters 3-5 will then address the individual authors.  While all three certainly traveled for religious reasons such as pilgrimage or Crusade recruitment, each had multiple objectives for having their travels committed to paper.  William Wey wanted to give helpful advice to others, and provide a substitute pilgrimage experience for those back in England who were unable to make the journey themselves.  Gerald of Wales was traveling with high-ranking churchmen to encourage the Welsh to go on Crusade, but his ultimate goal was that of self-promotion, both for his literary travails and his future employment opportunities.  Margery Kempe didn’t begin her travels with a specific goal in mind, other than to visit popular pilgrimage sites.  However, once abroad, she develops a female fellowship—something she often lacked at home, and something she did not find amongst her travel companions.  The conclusion will summarize my assessment of each author’s account, proving that each formed his/her identity through travel and travel writing.  I will also address what they ultimately gained or lost by writing their accounts.  Wey successfully guides future pilgrims, actual and virtual.  Gerald hopes to highlight his own worth, but never gains the position he desires.  Kempe is the most successful, finally finding a welcoming, feminine sphere.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This study explored the relationship between dispositional mindfulness, posttraumatic outcomes (i.e., stress and growth) and cognitive coping strategies (i.e., intrusive rumination, deliberate rumination, and positive reappraisal) that may support more positive posttraumatic outcomes.  In blending a literature base addressing posttraumatic growth with a literature base exploring mindfulness and positive reappraisal, it appears that dispositional mindfulness is uniquely situated to positively influence posttraumatic cognitions, recovery and growth.  The relationship between mindfulness, cognitive coping and posttraumatic outcomes was investigated in a sample (N=437) of university students given the high, traumatic exposure prevalence rate (e.g., 72%-92%) and the elevated rates of posttraumatic distress observed in college students (approximately 20% report clinical or subclinical levels of distress). Path analysis revealed that both dispositional mindfulness and the amount of schematic disruption associated with the traumatic exposure had significant direct and indirect effects on posttraumatic stress and posttraumatic growth.  Interpretation of the path analysis suggested three, broad paths: 1) An intrusive path linking traumatic disruption to posttraumatic stress through intrusive rumination, 2) A deliberate path linking traumatic disruption to both posttraumatic outcomes through deliberate rumination, associated with greater posttraumatic stress and greater posttraumatic growth, and 3) A mindful-reappraisal path linking mindfulness to both posttraumatic outcomes through positive reappraisal and both ruminative types, associated with reduced posttraumatic stress and greater posttraumatic growth.  Results suggest that dispositional mindfulness, the amount of schematic disruption following a traumatic exposure, and cognitive coping styles all affect posttraumatic outcomes.  As such, appropriately selected and implemented mindfulness-based interventions may facilitate recovery and growth in the aftermath of trauma.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Reading the Cosmos and Reading the Poem in Early Modern English Poetry, 1579-1674 explores the relationship between early modern cosmology and poetry in England, arguing that the way the heavens are treated in poetry relates to the way the process of reading is understood in that poetry. By considering a range of poetic works across a period of about a century, the dissertation demonstrates an early modern poetic connection between ideas about astronomy and about reading. The multiple viewpoints in astronomy and cosmology in this period form a part of a larger history of uncertainty about the heavens that offers the means for poetic exploration of ideas about perception, self-definition, and world-creation. The first chapter considers the related concerns with the human microcosm and linguistic indeterminacy in works by Spenser and Donne. The second chapter deals with the astronomical imagery for reading the gendered other in the lyric sequences of the Sidney family. The third chapter addresses Milton’s attitude toward cosmology as an analogue for his process of interpreting the Bible, the natural world, and the poem. The fourth chapter considers Cavendish’s presentation of the plurality of worlds in the context of her natural philosophy and her poetics. Taken together, these works reveal strong ties between cosmology and the concepts of writing and reading poetry, the self, and the world in early modern English poetry. This dissertation, then, adds to the body of knowledge about early modern reading and perception by connecting the early modern experiences of perceiving the written word and the physical world.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Darwin Walking Backward follows Nolan and Elsa Grey, estranged half-siblings, whose father is suspected of drowning himself off Leap’s Island. Their father was an eminent evolutionary biologist whose fall from grace led him to Leap’s, home of a new movement of scientists, called The Reversalists, who believe that evolution is running backward. The scientists live in the ruins of an old hotel, researching a population of Undowny Bufflehead ducks. Most people think The Reversalists are crazy, but when Nolan and Elsa travel to Leap’s to pack up their father’s belongings, they find the Reversalists’ beliefs have more to do with their own despair about the state of the planet’s health, contemporary culture, and the millennial generation than they do with anything scientific. As they search for the mysterious “Paradise Duck” their father referred to as proof his unpopular theories, Nolan and Elsa begin to suspect Dr. Grey has been murdered. I am interested in the use of innovative structures, and this novel unfolds along two alternating timelines, one forward-moving over the course of a week, and the other traveling backward, returning the two protagonists to their childhood, over the course of thirty years.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Daily fantasy sports games have recently emerged as one of the fastest growing segments associated with the sports industry. While traditional fantasy sports have long been associated with sport consumption, daily fantasy sports allow consumers to participate in games over a much shorter period of time than the traditional season long variety. Daily variety fantasy sports that operate over short time periods may appear to have more in common with traditional forms of sports gambling than traditional season long fantasy sports.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation is motivated by the differentiation of daily fantasy sports from sports gambling that has allowed the latter to economically flourish while the former remains confined to largely illegal markets in the United States. While the ability for consumers to gamble in the United States is regulated, many forms of legalized gambling exist. Sports gambling is, by contrast, heavily controlled. The federal laws restricting sports gambling to several states have been in existence for more than 50 years. While sports gambling is strongly opposed by most of the major U.S. sports leagues, several of these leagues have partnered with daily fantasy companies on the basis that the games present an additional way for fans to engage with the underlying sporting events. The sports leagues’ partnerships with daily fantasy providers are intriguing because of the leagues’ historical opposition to legalized gambling.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The archival and doctrinal legal research conducted for completion of this dissertation was undertaken to answer three questions. The first research question contains an examination of the role that the major U.S. sports leagues have had in testifying before Congress and advocating in support of the continued prohibition for sports gambling. The second research question guides an investigation into whether attributes associated with fantasy sports and daily fantasy sports were distinguished from the reasons cited for the opposition to legalizing sports gambling. The third research question addresses the issue of whether certain daily fantasy games may be offering prohibited financial products.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The research associated with this project contributes in a meaningful way to the present understanding of the interaction between daily fantasy sports and sports gambling. Additionally, the proposed framework may serve as an early step in the process of evaluating the benefits of regulating DFS and sports gambling in a manner that is common and familiar to the American public.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Pathological exercise (PE) is a common feature of individuals with eating disorders (ED) and represents a key maintaining factor of eating pathology. However, little is known about underlying mechanisms that maintain PE and whether these mechanisms are influenced by the occurrence of PE in the context of an ED. The present study tested hypotheses that women with PE would 1) experience exercise as more reinforcing, 2) show greater cortisol reactivity in response to exercise, and 3) that greater cortisol reactivity in response to exercise would predict greater increases in positive affect following exercise. Participants (N=64 women total; n=16 PE with ED, n=16 PE Only, n=16 ED Only, n=16 Control) completed a computerized progressive ratio (PR) task to earn running time on a treadmill as a measure of the reinforcing value of exercise. HPA-axis response to acute exercise was measured through salivary cortisol and changes in affect were measured by a self-report questionnaire. Participants provided four saliva samples and self-report ratings directly prior to and 0-, 20-, and 40- minutes after running for 30 minutes on a treadmill at 75% maximum heart rate. Results indicated that women with PE had significantly higher reinforcing value of exercise (p&lt;.001) and showed higher cortisol reactivity to exercise (p&lt;.001). Contrary to hypotheses, cortisol reactivity to acute exercise did not predict exercise-induced changes in affect in the full sample. Cortisol reactivity significantly predicted breakpoint on the PR task (p&lt;.001) in the full sample. Overall, findings provide preliminary evidence that women with PE may experience exercise as more rewarding than normal exercisers, which may be attributable to dysregulations in underlying biological mechanisms that influence its reinforcing value. Given limitations of the current study, future studies should use ecological momentary assessment to better understand factors driving associations between PE, reward, and dysregulations in HPA-axis activity in participants’ natural environment.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>While revenues have been increasing for a small percentage of National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) football bowl subdivision (FBS) programs, the majority (82%), have seen a larger increase in expenses due to an attempt to compete within the intercollegiate athletic arena, in what has been deemed an “arms race” (Edwards, 1984; Brown, Rascher, Nagel, &amp; McEvoy, 2010; Tsitsos &amp; Nixon, 2012). This arms race has led many universities to spend money to keep up with larger conferences where budgets can exceed $100 million. Since 2004, "median total expenses have increased by over 120.6 percent" (Fulks, 2015, p. 12). After adjusting for inflation this percentage is even higher, showing an increase of 131.5% since 2004.  Ticket sales and booster contributions have long been the mainstays of revenues for athletic departments (Fulks, 2015), with the continued increases in expenses there is a need to examine all avenues where potential revenues may exist. 	</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>One potential revenue source can be found in the student body. Researchers have suggested community can be created by intercollegiate athletics, providing a “rallying point” (Clopton, 2007, p. 103). This community benefit could also be known as a psychic impact (income) which is the emotional impact from having the public good of intercollegiate athletics on a particular university campus. Psychic impact is a form of positive externality, which is a benefit, produced by the intercollegiate athletics programs in this case which cannot be captured by those in the athletic department or university who sell tickets and accept booster donations (Brown et al., 2010). A public good is a good that is non-rivalrous and non-excludable by nature, meaning that more consumption by one individual does not limit the availability of the good to be consumed by another and the consumer cannot be excluded from consuming the good (Taylor &amp; Weerapana, 2010). Intercollegiate athletics exemplify this definition of public goods and since sports are a “socially-consumed commodity” (Sanderson, 1999, p. 189) there needs to be a way to measure the value of such an important commodity.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Public goods are non-market goods. It can be difficult to place a value on their consumption since there is not a market price. According to Lipton, Wellman, Sheifer, and Weiher (1995) there are direct and indirect techniques to measure the value of a non-market good. The indirect approach relies on observations of behavior to determine the value of a product or service to a consumer, where the direct approach is to ask a consumer how much they are willing to pay (WTP) to consumer the desired product or service. Indirect measurement includes such techniques as the travel cost method, random utility models, and hedonic pricing techniques. The contingent valuation method (CVM) is the direct approach to measuring an individual’s WTP. The CVM is a survey based method which elicits a hypothetical scenario for consumers to place a monetary value on the overall WTP by extrapolating the results from the survey sample to the target population. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>While the CVM has been used in numerous studies within the sport management literature (Atkinson, Mourato, Szymanski, &amp; Ozdemiroglu, 2008; Barros, 2002; Castellanos &amp; Sanchez, 2007; Drayer &amp; Shaprio, 2011; Fenn &amp; Crooker, 2009; Groothuis, Johnson, &amp; Whitehead, 2004; Harter, 2015; Johnson &amp; Whitehead, 2000; Johnson, Whitehead, Mason, &amp; Walker, 2007; Owen, 2006; Santo, 2007; Wicker, Hallmann, Breuer, &amp; Feiler. 2012), researchers have not attempted to measure the public goods generated for an intercollegiate athletics department by examining the WTP of college students to pay increased athletic fees to support their institution’s athletics programs. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This purpose of this dissertation was threefold: 1) First, to estimate the private consumption benefits current Florida State University (FSU) students derived from attending sporting events offered through the athletic department; 2) to estimate the public consumption benefits derived by current FSU students who do not attend sporting events; and 3) to estimate the total economic value (TEV) the student population of FSU assigns to the athletics department. An online questionnaire was modified from previous CVM literature to facilitate its use in a college athletics settings and with a sample of current college students. The survey underwent an examination by an expert panel and then a pilot test was conducted. Four research questions were examined and it was found that both respondents who did attend and those that did not attend FSU athletics sporting events did have a WTP to pay athletics fees, but their WTP did not match how much they currently pay in athletics fees. Additionally, it was found that those respondents who attend sporting events do have a higher WTP if they also consume the FSU Athletics Department through other means that are related to the public goods portion of the FSU Athletics Department. Finally, it was determined that the total WTP of the respondents is higher than the amount that students currently pay for athletics fees. Based on the evidence from the data analysis, it was found that: students do have a WTP to help support the FSU Athletics Department although it might not be to the amount that they currently pay in athletics fees; those who do not attend FSU sporting events do have an increase in their WTP the more they consume the public goods of the athletics department; and the total WTP is higher than the current amount the respondents pay in athletics fees.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Although active duty military families continue to be a strong presence in American culture, few family-level studies have been conducted that examine military family systems, processes, and outcomes for individuals who are connected to an active duty member. Using family systems theory as a guiding framework, this study utilized a multi-informant approach to explore the relationships between marital quality, parent-adolescent interactions, and adolescent depressive symptoms among a sample of military families with an active duty father. Based on the spillover hypothesis, this study expected to find that the level of marital quality reported by the active duty father and the mother would directly influence their adolescent’s depressive symptoms. It was also expected that the mechanism that links parental marital quality and adolescent depressive symptoms would be the interactions that characterize the parent-adolescent relationship, specifically the warmth and hostility that the parents display in the context of the parent-adolescent relationship. Participant families (N = 236) were recruited from a large military installation in the continental United States using flyers throughout the installation, radio and print advertisements, and advertisements in the youth centers on the installation. Participants completed online surveys and each variable was measured using standardized scales. This study examined marital quality using both adult participants’ responses to the Adapted Marital Quality Scale. To measure warmth and hostility displayed in the parent-adolescent relationship, adolescents’ responses to the Interaction Behavior Questionnaire were used. Finally, the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale for Children was used to assess the adolescents’ depressive symptoms. Correlations between variables were explored to inform the inclusion of control variables in the subsequent models.  Then, a regression analysis was conducted and a path model was fit to examine the relationships between the variables and how well the model fit the data. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Results of the regression analysis revealed that the direct relationship between marital quality and adolescent depressive symptoms was significant for the mother, but not the father. The path model demonstrated good model fit.  Findings suggest that there was a significant relationship between the marital quality of the mother (but not the father) and the warmth she displayed in the parent-adolescent relationship. Furthermore, there was a significant relationship between the marital quality of the father and the mother and the hostility that he or she displayed in the parent-adolescent relationship. There was also a significant relationship between the warmth displayed by the mother (but not the father) in the parent-adolescent relationship and adolescent depressive symptoms. Additionally, there was a significant relationship between the hostility shown by the active duty father (but not the mother) in the parent-adolescent relationship and the depressive symptoms displayed by the adolescent.  The warmth that the mother (but not the father) displayed in the mother-adolescent relationship was a significant mediator between the independent and dependent variable, marital quality and adolescent depressive symptoms.  Finally, the hostility that both the father and the mother displayed in the parent-adolescent relationship was a significant mediator between the independent and dependent variables, marital quality and adolescent depressive symptoms. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Findings indicated that the marital quality of parents in military families influenced adolescent depressive symptoms indirectly through the parent-adolescent relationship. The marital quality manifested in different ways for the mother and father. Maternal marital quality influenced the warmth displayed by the mother in the parent-adolescent relationship, and paternal marital quality influenced the hostility displayed by the father in the parent-adolescent relationship. Applications for clinicians, family life educators, and policy were discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>I urge here for a reconceptualization of such female protagonists’ embodiments of the trope of strong black womanhood that shows the benefit of troubling these rigid narratives of inclusion which have underwritten and, to wit, regulated black women’s purchase on the discourse. Using the works of Nella Larsen, Zora Neale Hurston, and Ntozake Shange, I propose that while, to be sure, the aforementioned characters do not match the physical expectations for membership into what I suggest may be called the cult of strong black womanhood, their performances of fitness, independence and control combine with their collective demonstrations of emotionally defensive postures, self-sacrificing decisions, and alternately demanding and passive performances to adhere to essential criteria of the strong black woman.  Even when these performances may, because of the characters’ class positionality and caste, be expected to fall instead alongside discourses of respectability, I propose that study of the women’s affective labor processes reveals an eschewing of vulnerability that is the key identifier of the archetype.  Such performances, I emphasize, are especially harmful as they inter-relationally interrupt and obstruct opportunities for connection, demonstrations of vulnerability and need among women.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Weight of a material and the system formed by such material is a critical factor for many applications. Traditionally, engineering designed porous structures, typically honeycomb structures, have been utilized for weight critical applications. The goal of this thesis work is to utilize the material with the lightest weight to fabricate a new type of foam that is not only lightweight and strong, but also electrically as well as thermally conductive and with tunable elasticity. A carbon nanotube (CNT) based nanocarbon foam was fabricated by using poly (methyl methacrylate) spheres as a template to create engineered pores. The junctions between the CNTs are secured using nanocarbon via the oxidation and carbonization of polyacrylonitrile. The resulting low density foam exhibits robustness in structure, high elasticity, thermal stability, corrosion resistance and is also electrically as well as thermally conductive. The strength of the foam is further boosted with the infiltration of PMMA polymer. The resulting composite foam is still porous and has higher mechanical strength. The electrical conductivity of the composite foam is not affected despite the presence of PMMA.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Since the discovery of the Gulf of Mexico, it has become an area of extensive exploration. The Gulf of Mexico harbors specific commodities that are essential in our modern economy.  Oil companies provided money and technology to find and study locations for oil exploitation. With the onset of seismic data acquisition, it was possible to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the formation and structure of this unique basin that is in constant dynamic disequilibrium, and facilitates hydrocarbon leakage. The natural seepage of oil and gas to the sea floor is of interest because these “leaks” expel methane which is potentially a significant factor in the global Carbon cycle. Determining the migration pathways through the sedimentary strata to the various primary conduits at the sea floor provides a comprehensive understanding of the large scale dynamic “plumbing system” in the Gulf of Mexico. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>One of the objectives in this research was to quantify the rate and volume of oil and gas released from two natural seeps in lease blocks GC600 (1200 m depth) and MC118 (850 m depth). Our purpose was to determine variability in bubble size and release rates at three individual vents and to estimate how changes in pressure affect bubble release rates. Observations with autonomous video cameras (VTLC) captured the formation of individual bubbles as they were released through gas hydrate outcrops. Image processing techniques determined bubble type (oily, gaseous, and mixed: oily and gaseous), size distribution, release rate, and temporal variations (observation intervals from 3 h to 26 d). One vent at GC600 (Birthday Candles) released oily bubbles with an average diameter of 5.0 mm (std. 1.30) at a rate of 4.37 bubbles s-1. A second vent at GC600 (Mega Plume) released mixed oil and gas bubbles with an average diameter of 3.9 mm (std. 1.19) at a rate of 103 bubbles s-1 (std. 24.6). A third vent at MC118 (Rudyville) released gaseous bubbles with an average diameter of 3.0 mm (std. 1.99) at a rate of 127 bubbles s-1 (std. 34.1). To quantify bubble release, a robust image processing technique was developed that is adaptable to the various environments found in deep-sea oil and gas vents.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para> </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Our second objective was to constrain the migration of hydrocarbons from the source rock to the sea floor. A compilation of data sets from the macro to micro scale were used to describe the overall sequence of hydrocarbon migration and discharge from ~15 kmbsf to the water column.  Geochemical similarities were found by fingerprinting oil samples from reservoir, active vents and sea-surface to show migration connectivity from source to seafloor. To support the geochemical data, measurements of fluxes and the magnitude of fluid flow indicators (e.g. bacteria mats, hydrate mounds, etc.) were compiled, and we have attempted to categorize and quantify the various processes that sequester hydrocarbons. Different stages of upward hydrocarbon flow were characterized by visual and morphological tracers. Varying reflectivity values in seismic and subbottom profile data delineate salt distribution, fault position, and acoustic blanking zones. Local geomorphological features such as hydrate mounds, carbonate hardground cover, and chemosynthetic communities, suggest passive/focused fluid flow. VTLC records and acoustic targets detected by swath mapping were used to determine the number of vents in the seep zone.  We used a systems approach to combine the various data sets at different scales and resolutions to quantify values for the hydrocarbon budget at GC600.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Finally, our third objective was to describe the type of benthic communities that frequented the vents in our study and to determine the evolutionary stage of the seep zone. Natural seeps provide a source of energy to chemosynthetic communities in seep areas. We used the autonomous VTLC that was deployed for extended periods of time for an “uninterrupted” view of the behavior of animals within this particular seep zone.  We observed a number of metazoans including ice worms burrowing in hydrate outcrops, fish feeding on thick bacteria mats, swarms of annelids, and curious eels and crabs visiting bubble streams. By analyzing the type of organisms within the seep zone, we could determine that these seeps were immature based on the community composition. More matured seeps would include more authigenic carbonate hard grounds, less focused fluid flow (bubbling) and increased abundance of mussels and possibly tube worms. Of particular interest was the sheer abundance of ice worms (~2.8 x 104 in GC600) that inhabit the gas hydrate outcrops and don’t seem to have any predators. Where they go once the gas hydrate dissociates is still an open question.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Four Movements in Search of a Composer draws inspiration from the play Six Characters</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>in Search of an Author by Luigi Pirandello. Rather than a character sketch of the six Characters</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>in this play, this piece centers around four moments from the play highlighting grand</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>philosophical and artistic ideas. The first and last movements form a pair centered around the</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>entrance and exit of the Characters. These metatheatrical moments from the play are represented</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>in the interaction between the wind ensemble and the brass sextet. The rehearsal of one play is</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>interrupted by the appearance of the Characters, causing the actors to stop as each notices the</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>characters. The piece being played on the stage by the wind ensemble in this composition is</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>influenced by the works for band of Stravinsky and Messiaen. The offstage brass ensemble</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>interrupts this with a march. I have used the motives from each of these to represent the</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>dichotomy of reality (work on stage) and fantasy (march) that appears throughout the play. The</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>ending of Six Characters in Search of an Author is quite complex, with the metatheater of the</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Characters’ story, the interaction of all in the present, and the overarching question of what is real</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>and what is fantasy all at work. After the actors and director leave, the remaining four Characters</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>(two died as their story was told) have the final scene. Three remain stuck in the theater while</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>one is able to leave. For the final movement of Four Movements in Search of a Composer, the</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>interplay between the march and the initial piece is at first reversed and then begins to blur, just</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>as what is reality and fantasy begins to blur in the play. As the wind ensemble finishes, three</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Characters (part of the brass sextet) continue looping a fragment of the march as if stuck, while</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para> v</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>the other one plays the altered chant that is part of the Messiaen-influenced work in the first</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>movement while moving through the audience and eventually exiting the hall. The second</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>movement of Four Movements in Search of a Composer centers around the idea that the</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>characters do not experience their story in a teleological manner (hence the difficulty in trying to</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>tell their story). Central to this movement is a six-note motive. Fragments of this motive build</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>into an aggregate before the motive is repeated and harmonized, cementing the “correct” order</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>into the listeners’ minds before the order is scattered, employing layers of the motive and/or its</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>harmonization forward or backward beginning at any point within the motive. The third</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>movement centers around the question of which is more real: the character or the actor. In this</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>movement, aleatoric blocks are set out with the indication that the conductor chooses the order in</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>which to cue the groupings of instruments. The blocks are created around particular intervals,</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>sonorities, or gestures in such a way that a different order is going to create a different</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>implication for the listener. For instance, the second block has one group focused around a minor</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>third and another around a major third. One order might hint at a major sonority moving through</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>an (014) sonority before becoming minor. Another order might begin with the (014) and overlap</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>with the other groups enough that the implications of major and minor never surface for the</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>listener. Four Movements in Search of a Composer is my musical implementation of the ideas</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>and moments of Pirandello’s play that grabbed my attention in my first encounter with the work.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Polyelectrolytes can be used in a variety of forms from Layer-by-Layer assembled thin films to spun polyelectrolyte complex as free-standing membranes.  The Layer-by-Layer methodology is used to adsorb oppositely charged polyelectrolytes to a substrate for use across a variety of applications depending on their construction and functionalization.  This process is achieved by the alternating solution deposition of positively and negatively charged polyelectrolytes with intermediate rinsing steps.  Applications of these thin films lie in biocompatible coatings, anti-corrosion surfaces, hydrophilic and hydrophobic coatings, and chromatographic applications among several others.  Polyelectrolyte solutions can also be directly mixed sans-substrate to produce polyelectrolyte complexes, which can be processed into extruded morphologies or dissolved in salt to form coacervates, which can then be spun into free-standing membranes.  Polyelectrolyte complex membranes have applications in ion selectivity and permeability as well as desalination.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	In this dissertation, poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC) and poly(styrene sulfonate) (PSS) are used to form polyelectrolyte complex (PEC) by solution mixing.  The PEC is then rinsed of salt and dried to produce a tough orange solid, which is ground into a fine powder and dissolved in KBr to produce polyelectrolyte coacervate (PECOV).  The coacervate phase exists between [KBr] 1.3-1.8 M, so 1.7 M KBr and 1.9 M KBr concentrations are studied using spin-coating to determine the behavior of a PECOV against a polyelectrolyte solution.  Using a specific set of parameters, spun films of PEC can be removed from an aluminum substrate for use as free-standing membranes.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	A different set of polyelectrolytes is used to study the ability of a PEMU to prevent both mammalian cell and bacterial adhesion to a surface.  The polyelectrolytes used are poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), with the latter being functionalized with benzophenone (Bp) and 3-[2-(acrylamido)-ethyl dimethylammonio] propane sulfonate  (AEDAPS) in different stages during buildup.  Benzophenone is used as a photocrosslinking agent to create a tough multilayer on which to build the zwitterion-functionalized layers.  Despite the superb ability of these multilayers to repel mammalian cell lines A7r5 and 3T3, the PEMU produced attracts bacteria in an accelerated fashion, creating an interesting contradictory behavior.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Production of PEMUs by Layer-by-Layer assembly is a widely used method and is well understood.  The kinetics of this polyelectrolyte sorption is not, however.  Using PDADMAC and PSS, rotating disk electrochemistry (RDE) is used to measure the rate at which 1.0 M and 0.1 M PSS adsorbs to a PDADMAC-terminated PEMU.  Six different narrow molecular weights are used at both concentrations to determine the behavior of PSS based on chain length.  Low molecular weight PSS is only diffusion limited by the solution and adsorbs to the PEMU quickly, while higher molecular weight PSS chains are hindered in their ability to adsorb based on the availability of extrinsic positive sites from excess PDADMAC as well as the rate in which they diffuse through solution.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to investigate what pre-service teachers focus on when reflecting on their mathematics instruction with the use of video clubs. Video clubs are groups where teachers meet and watch videos of their lessons and provide feedback to one another. The participants were pre-service teachers enrolled in an early childhood education program. The study was conducted during the fall semester within a mathematics methods course. Twenty-five students chose to participate in the study. The participants were grouped based on the grade level they were placed in for their field placements. There was a total of five groups who participated in the research. Only one of the groups was used in this study. The video club group used in this research included six pre-service teachers who volunteered to participate in this semester-long study. All the participants were placed in kindergarten classes for their field placements. Using qualitative research methods, the researcher investigated what pre-service teachers focused on when reflecting on their instruction as well as that of their peers, the quality of those reflections, as well as the perceived benefits of video club sessions. The data collected consisted of one micro teaching written reflection, two videotaped lessons, two written reflections, two revised reflections after video club session, and two transcribed video club sessions. The findings indicate that pre-service teachers focus on three main categories of teaching and learning classroom management, instruction, and understanding of students. Within each of these categories, themes emerged that illustrated how these participants viewed each category. When pre-service teachers reflected on classroom management their reflections included child blame, logistics and transitions, student engagement, and positive affirmations. First, pre-service teachers often make excuses or blame students for issues during a lesson. They also focus on logistics, mobility, and transition during their instruction and note these items in group discussions. Finally, they look at student engagement as a form of classroom management. When the focus of their conversation shifts to instruction the discussion is often surface-level, they focus on questioning as a tool to help themselves as teachers, not to help clarify student understanding. There is considerable conversation around assessment, but not to drive instruction, only as confirmation they have effectively taught a lesson.  When looking at instruction they try to make connections with mathematics but these connections are surface-level and provide little insight into math practices. The final areas that pre-service teachers focus on is the focus understating their students which included discussion on student prior knowledge and misconceptions of students and pre-service teachers. The quality of written reflections were descriptive and evaluative in nature. The video club conversation was analyzed for the substance of the conversation. However, the findings suggest that the conversation remains surface-level and often off task. The video clubs’ discussion evolved over the two sessions from logistical concerns to a greater focus on instruction. All the participants reported positive feedback on the video club process and watching their own instruction.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The production of direct photons in association with jets can be used to probe gluon parton distribution functions as well as to test perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics. This thesis presents the measurement of the triple differential cross section for photon plus jet evehts as a function of photon transverse momentum ($p_T^\gamma$), photon pseudorapidity ($\eta^\gamma$), and jet pseudorapidity ($\eta^{\textrm{jet}}$). The measurement is made using 19.7 fb$^{-1}$ of data collected by the Compact Muon Solenoid detector in proton-proton collisions at the center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. The kinematic regions probed are 40 $&lt;p_T^\gamma&lt;$ 1000 GeV, $|\eta^\gamma|&lt;$ 2.5 and $|\eta^{jet}|&lt;$ 2.5. These results are compared to next-to-leading order theoretical predictions.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Semiconductor spintronics is widely regarded as a viable pathway to overcome many of the physical limitations of the present micro-electronics technology.  Electrical spin injection into a semiconductor, coherent transport and manipulation of the injected spins in the semiconductor channel, and detection of the transported spins via another probe are indispensable ingredients of the proposed spin-based field effect transistors (spin-FETs), which may offer transformative new functionalities not present in a conventional FET.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The primary goal of this dissertation is to study spin transport and understand the spin dynamics in a semiconductor.  A most unique aspect of this research is the use a persistent photoconductor, Si-doped Al0.3Ga0.7As, as the spin transport channel material.  Utilizing the persistent photoconductivity of Al0.3Ga0.7As:Si, we can tune the carrier density of the spin channel in the device in situ by photo-doping, spanning a broad range from the insulating to metallic state.  This facilitates investigation of the spin accumulation and transport properties on one and the same sample over orders of magnitude variation in the carrier density in the spin channel.  Exploitation of the persistent photoconductivity circumvents the issues that arise when using multiple samples; we significantly reduce fabrication time required to make many replicas at differing doping levels, and more importantly, avoid sample-to-sample variations influencing the measurements. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>3-terminal (3T) and nonlocal 4-terminal (4T) Hanle measurements have been performed on our lateral devices with patterned Fe electrodes for spin injection and detection, and Al0.3Ga0.7As:Si as the spin transport channel.  The measurements were conducted over a broad range of carrier densities across the insulator-to-metal transition (IMT).  The bias current and channel carrier density dependencies of 3T and nonlocal 4T Hanle signals have been measured and systematically compared.  Although their magnitudes differ by about an order of magnitude, the 3T and nonlocal 4T Hanle signals exhibit broad similarities in many aspects, including their dependencies on the carrier density and bias current.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The specific resistance of the injecting junction plays a very important role in spin injection/extraction between a ferromagnet and semiconductor.  Using the measured channel resistivity and junction specific resistance, the experimentally obtained Hanle signal magnitudes could be compared with the expectations based on spin accumulation in the theoretical framework of Fert and coworkers.  In our devices with an interface of epitaxial graded Schottky junctions, the 3T Hanle magnitudes are in general agreement with the theoretical expectations.  Specifically, the experimental values are smaller than the theoretical expectation in the insulating state, attain good agreement in the vicinity of the IMT, and become greater than the theoretical values by several factors deep into the metallic state.  The observed discrepancies away from the IMT in our devices should be contrast with the results in spin devices with oxide tunnel barriers, where the 3T Hanle signals are often several orders of magnitude greater than the theoretical predictions.  Furthermore, in our devices, the 3T Hanle signals are consistent with an exponential spatial decay of the spin accumulation based on the nonlocal 4T Hanle measurements. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The spin lifetimes in the AlGaAs channel are determined from the 3T and nonlocal 4T Hanle curves, via separate fits to the Lorentzian function and the one dimensional spin drift-diffusion model.  The two approaches yield similar values of spin lifetime, from 2 to 4 ns, and similar evolution with the carrier density. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This comprehensive set of measurements covering large ranges of carrier density and bias current revealed broad and striking similarities between the 3T and nonlocal 4T Hanle signals in our devices.  The results provide strong evidence that the 3T Hanle measurements in devices structures like ours with an epitaxial Schottky junction are indeed manifestation of spin accumulation, rather than due to other spurious effects.  The research has shed considerable light on a number of pertinent issues in spin relaxation and spin transport in semiconductors. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The second line of research of this dissertation is to utilize the high-sensitivity semiconductor Hall magnetometry techniques to study the static and dynamic magnetic properties of InAs quantum dots (QDs) doped with Cr or Mn.  The goal of this research was to measure the magnetization of a small array of, or even an individual, QDs via an integrated micro/nano Hall magnetometer based on the 2-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure.  The experiment was expected to facilitate a direct correlation of the measured magnetic properties of the QDs with their structural/chemical characteristics, which may provide insight on the fundamentally important issue of the origin of ferromagnetism in diluted magnetic semiconductors.  A fabrication procedure was developed, which produced devices enabling Hall gradiometry measurements.  However, due to the persistent difficulty of producing ohmic contacts to the 2DEG while limiting the sample temperature, the signal-to-noise ratio of the devices was not adequate for measuring the magnetization of the QDs.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>How do sport consumption activities (i.e., sport participation, sport spectating, and sport media viewing) affect the subjective well-being (or happiness) of sport consumers? To fulfill the ethical creed of sport marketers and to effectively utilize ‘well-being’ as a marketing strategy, it is imperative to know whether and how sport consumption influences one’s psychological state. Learning the existence and degree of sport consumption’s influence on happiness is essential in laying the fundamental basis of sport consumer well-being research. Research on the mechanism of achieving happiness through sport consumption can be informative for sport marketers in deriving strategies to enhance the consumer’s benefits. However, the fundamental questions about sport consumer’s subjective well-being are not yet fully answered, calling for further research particularly in the sport spectating and sport media consumption contexts.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A research project was conducted based on the revised model of hedonic treadmill, activity theory, and need theory: (1) to investigate the influences of sport participation, sport spectating, and sport media viewing activities on one’s baseline and momentary fluctuation of subjective well-being, and (2) to examine ‘need fulfillment’ (i.e., fulfilling one’s needs for detachment-recovery, autonomy, achievement, and belonging) as the psychological process linking sport consumption activities to increased happiness. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A repetitive self-report based research project was completed to examine subjective well-being state and need fulfillment experiences in the three sport consumption contexts, and the link between need fulfillment and subjective well-being. Two pilot studies were conducted to construct scales for measuring subjective well-being and need fulfillment and to pre-test the data collection plan of the main study. The main study was conducted to test the relations among sport consumption activities, subjective well-being and need fulfillment. Data was collected based on ecological momentary assessment—that is, repetitive data collection took place on a panel of respondents via mobile phones during their daily lives, 2-3 times per week, over 9 weeks to capture perceptions of subjective well-being state and need fulfillment experience in relation to the type of activity engaged at the time of signal. A total of 2,746 responses were collected from 242 respondents. Multi-level structural equation modeling was conducted for the data analysis, with responses at level-1 and respondents at level-2.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Sport participation and sport spectating activities had positive influences on baseline and momentary fluctuation of subjective well-being, and was effective for detachment-recovery, autonomy, achievement, and belonging needs fulfillment. Both positive and negative influences of sport media viewing on subjective well-being state and baseline were found; detachment-recovery, autonomy, and belonging needs were fulfilled in the activity, while achievement need was not. Among the four types of fulfillment, autonomy and achievement needs fulfillment were identified as the most influential on subjective well-being state. Compared to non-sport activities (e.g., work, study, socializing, exercising), sport participation and sport spectating had positive, stronger and more comprehensive needs fulfillment and thus well-being effects; the effects of sport media viewing were positive (or less negative), stronger and more diverse than that of non-sport media viewing.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Based on the findings, sport participation and sport spectating are identified as activities beneficial for contributing to short- and long-term well-being, while the valence of well-being effects in sport media viewing is ambiguous. The notion of short-term well-being effects being accumulated and developing into long-term well-being effects through repetitive exposure aligned with the findings in the study, but a more rigorous study examining the causal relations is required. Detachment-recovery, autonomy, achievement, and belonging needs fulfillment are highlighted as key constructs explaining the well-being effects associated with sport consumption. Particular attention on achievement need fulfillment is warranted, for being an influential construct on one’s subjective well-being state that may cause positive as well as negative well-being effects in the sport media viewing context. Examining the moderating effects of psychological connection between sport consumers and one’s favored sport team is proposed, for better understanding achievement need fulfillment through vicarious experiences of sport spectating and sport media viewing. Practical implications are presented for effective fulfillment of the four psychological needs through sport consumption activities, and thus for better improved well-being. Limitations of this study and directions for future research are suggested.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This document is a compilation of two lecture recitals held on November 10, 2015 and April 27, 2016. Both of these recitals explored selected works performed by oboists written in the Romance genre. The lectures define stylistic characteristics distinctive to Romances composed in the nineteenth century. Musical analyses of selected pieces written from 1849 to 1988 are compared and contrasted with these typical features in order to highlight how composer’s asserted their unique style or how compositional conventions changed throughout history. Selections originally written for oboe and piano and published with the title of Romance is the focus of the latter lecture recital. In the former, Three Romances for Oboe and Piano, Op. 94 (1849) by Robert Schumann and Three Romances for Violin and Piano, Op. 22 (1853) by Clara Schumann are further explored to uncover musical evidence to prove the historical plausibility that Clara Schumann had written Robert Schumann’s Op. 94. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Robert Schumann’s Three Romances, Op. 94 is one of the most recognized works from the nineteenth century repertoire for oboe and piano. The Romances of Op. 22 have increasingly been borrowed by oboists. Due to the loss of the original manuscript there is conjecture, based on the historical events in the Schumann family, that Clara Schumann could possibly have penned the Op. 94. In an effort to find musical evidence to prove the veracity of this claim, the Op. 94 and Clara Schumann’s Three Romances for Violin and Piano, Op. 22 will be analyzed and compared. Furthermore, comparing these works shows how Robert Schumann and Clara Schumann influenced one another and what features distinguish the two composers from one another. This musical evidence, primarily the piano writing, does not support the likelihood that Clara Schumann wrote Robert Schumann’s Op. 94. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Examining the repertory for pieces composed for oboe and piano, with the title of Romance, since Robert Schumann wrote Op. 94 yields seven works written during 1849-1988. The pieces not written by Schumann exhibit departures from the earlier Romance genre that reflect shifts in compositional strategies. Many do share general characteristics found in Schumann’s Op. 94. Biographical information of the composer, premiere and publication details, musical analyses, stylistic comparison to Schumann’s Op. 94, and the performance challenges of each work will be discussed.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Informal processing has been a central feature of the juvenile court since its inception at the turn of the twentieth century. Taking many forms over the last century, one of the more common examples of informal processing efforts is juvenile diversion. Juvenile diversion is often plagued by issues of inconsistent implementation and definitional ambiguity. While proponents maintain that juvenile diversion programs operate in the best interests of the youth they serve, scholars have noted the potential for harms resulting from diversion. Civil citation in Florida is a prominent example of a contemporary, “smart justice” diversion program that attempts to balance the “best interests” of youth, with accountability for delinquent behavior. Despite their popularity and widespread promulgation, remarkably little is known about the ways in which civil citations are currently being used in Florida. The current research examines the effects of several characteristics of the offense and the offender on the use of civil citation. Multivariate analyses of use statewide, at the county-level, and between large counties, are presented. Additionally, semi-structured interviews were conducted with juvenile justice professionals aimed at understanding the ways in which civil citations are used. Results are consistent with prior scholarship on inconsistent implementation, and indicate significant variation in the ways civil citations are used throughout the state. Implications for research and policy are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this collective case study was to examine the different musical, social,</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>and pedagogical factors that affected how piano repertoire is selected and programmed for the undergraduate degree recital. Additionally, this study investigated the existence of what is deemed “standard repertoire” for the piano, and the possible reasons why these works are performed more often than others. The research was guided by a three-part framework of inquiry that examined the recital planning process from a student and professor perspective.  Additional focus was placed on the social dynamics of the collegiate private piano lesson, and the relationship that developed between professor and student.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The data for this collective case study were obtained through a descriptive analysis of</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>piano recital programs, a listening analysis of past student recital recordings, and semi-structured interviews with piano majors and professors (N=7) at a large Southeastern public university.  Student case study participants were chosen through a purposive sampling method, and interviews were transcribed manually. Transcripts were then coded using a three-part process that analyzed individual and cross-case themes. These interview transcripts were used to craft case study participant profiles.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The transcription and coding process yielded eight salient main themes regarding piano</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>repertoire selection that emerged from a cross-case analysis: making connections within the repertoire; influence of the university curriculum; satisfaction through effective performance order; the audience experience; collaborative learning model/choice with set conditions; freshman year: the vital foundation; standard repertoire as “functional repertoire”; and “filling the gaps.” These themes were used to address the original research questions. In addition, themes unique to each case study participant were also discussed. Based on these individual and cross-case themes, it was suggested that further research is needed investigating the repertoire selection process in a variety of different pedagogical settings, such as the non-major student or graduate piano student. It was also suggested that additional research is needed to determine how a work achieves “standard repertoire” status, both for piano and other music fields. Finally,</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>further research is needed investigating the role of the audience as active listeners and</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Biocrusts have been shown to affect the ecological conditions in a variety of habitats, involving abiotic mechanisms such as soil moisture retention, nitrogen-rich biomass additions, changing soil physical properties, as well as direct biotic mechanisms such as impeding seedling growth. In coastal dunes, low-lying interdune habitats experience occasional flooding, which promotes the formation of microbial biocrusts. While storm patterns are known to be effective drivers of coastal dune plant community composition, the interaction between microbial communities and vegetation in the context of storm patterns is not well understood. I investigated the role of biocrusts on native coastal dune community, how environmental conditions, particularly storm patterns, affect interactions between crusts and vegetation, as well as how the presence of crusts affects plant-plant interactions.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To explore correlative patterns between biocrusts, plants and abiotic factors in the field, I analyzed a long term dataset of a coastal dune plant community on St George Island, FL.  The presence of several plant species was correlated with crust, and included both negative and positive associations. Additionally, I found correlative relationships with crusts and total plant cover, as well as soil moisture; the latter supports previous research in other systems on the effects of crusts on soil characteristics. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To test the effect of crusts on plant species, I conducted a greenhouse experiment that simulated various environmental conditions, including several water and salt treatments, with and without biocrust in a factorial design. Crusts did have an effect on the growth and survival of some of these species, and this effect varied from negative to positive depending on the species. Additionally, I found trends in the data which suggest that crusts may interact with rain and salt, and this interaction may change the effect of crust on plant species in various environmental conditions. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Lastly, I performed a target-neighbor competition experiment using four dominant coastal dune plant species in a full factorial design to test the effect of crusts on plant-plant interactions. I found that the selected species often strongly compete, and these competition interactions vary among species. I also found a significant effect of crust on one species, Schizachyrium maritimum.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of the current study was to test the theory of action hypothesized for the Mathematics Formative Assessment System (MFAS) based on results from a large-scale randomized field trial. Using a multilevel structural equation modeling analytic approach with multiple latent response variables decomposed across student, teacher, and school levels of clustering, the current study found evidence of effects of MFAS that were consistent with the MFAS theory of action. First, assignment to the treatment condition was associated with higher mean student mathematics performance and a higher prevalence of small group instruction compared to schools assigned to the control condition—both of which are outcomes hypothesized to result from MFAS use. Also, a positive association between teacher-level mathematics knowledge for teaching and student mathematics performance was found in the current study, which is consistent with the interrelation of constructs specified in the MFAS theory of action. However, evidence of the particular linkages of MFAS use→teacher knowledge→classroom practice→student mathematics performance and the putative cascade of effects that would substantiate the mechanisms of change posited in the MFAS theory of action were not detected in the current study. Thus, positive effects of MFAS on teacher and student outcomes were substantiated; however, as to how the effects of MFAS on teachers transfer to improved outcomes for students remains to be empirically demonstrated. Based on my review of the results from the current study and consideration of the literature on formative assessment as it relates to the design of MFAS tasks and rubrics, I discuss a proposed modification to the theory of action that specifies the addition of a direct path from MFAS use to student mathematics performance, in addition to the indirect path currently specified.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In health promotion, while health messages may capture the attention of their target population, individuals seem unwilling to change their behaviors, especially when they are highly engaged in their current behaviors (Kunda, 1987; Weinstein, 1999). Self-efficacy has been one of the most crucial elements that facilitates health-related theories and predicts health attitudes and behaviors (Fishbein, 2000; Schwarzer &amp; Fuchs, 1996). Based on self-affirmation theory (Steele, 1988), a growing body of literature has examined that people can reduce defensive processing and increase message acceptance and adaptive behavioral changes (Harris &amp; Epton, 2009; Sherman &amp; Cohen, 2002; Silverman, Logel, &amp; Cohen, 2013). However, very little is known about what maximize a message’s impact on self-efficacy in self-affirmation. Therefore, this current study aims to explore whether and how self-affirmation may influence a person’s perception of own capabilities.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study investigated the self-affirmation effects using value affirmation manipulation for self-affirmation condition and journey control for control condition manipulation. The results indicated that self-affirmation increase message recipients’ self-efficacy toward the suggested behaviors, more positive attitudes toward the behavior and behavioral intention. However, when considered respondents’ existing self-efficacy as a moderation factor, affirmed people with greater initial self-efficacy tend to report more positive attitudes toward the suggested behavior than control group. Self-affirmation for participants with lower existing self-efficacy, however, did work negatively influence their attitudes toward the behavior. When considered recipients’ personal relevance to the behavior, affirmed participants with high relevance reported greater perceived susceptibility for the risk compared to non-affirmed participants.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Implications of the findings suggest that self-affirmation is highly likely to lead to message recipients’ adaptive responses, especially their perceived self-efficacy toward the suggested behavior. Also, other personal factors such as existing self-efficacy as a baseline belief or personal relevance toward the specific behavior can be a contributor of self-affirmation effects. This dissertation study found a strong predictive power of existing self-efficacy and personal relevance on message responses and behavior-specific cognition; thus, health practitioners should consider those personal factors when they develop health promotion messages for their target audience.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>A major challenge to the study of the structure-property relationship of carbon nanotube (CNT) networks is to characterize the complex nanostructure with complicated nanoscale contacts and pore structures. An image-based characterization methodology was proposed to extract CNT network information directly from scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of various CNT thin films to characterize critical topological factors including bundle size, diameter, and orientation from the CNT networks. This approach provided high-fidelity and fast analysis of CNT network structures with low false positive rate (FPR) of ~3% and ~90% accuracy in most of our case studies. We applied the new approach to study different networks of multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWNT), single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT), MWNT-SWNT mixed, and stretched MWNTs with different CNT alignments, which revealed the electrical conductivity-structure relationships of MWNT networks.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>On the other hand, controlling the transfer of electrical and mechanical properties of nanotubes into nanocomposites remains one of the major challenges due to the lack of adequate measurement systems to quantify the variations in bulk properties while the nanotubes were used as the reinforcement material. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) on thickness and conductivity measurements were conducted. By analyzing the data collected from both experienced and inexperienced operators, we found some operation details users might overlook that resulted in variations, since conductivity measurements of CNT thin films are very sensitive to thickness measurements. In addition, we demonstrated how issues in measurements damaged samples and limited the number of replications resulting in large variations in the electrical conductivity measurement results. Based on this study, we proposed a faster, more reliable approach to measure the thickness of CNT thin films that operators can follow to make these measurement processes less dependent on operator skills.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Tree nut and peanut allergies affect up to 1.4% US population. Upon exposure, sensitive individuals may experience adverse reactions, including fatal anaphylaxis, to tree nut and peanut allergens. Currently, there is no cure for food allergies. Strict avoidance of the offending allergens is the best defense for sensitive individuals. Consequently, it is important to develop reliable assays for food allergen detection. Several commercial polyclonal antibody (pAb)-based immunoassays are available for tree nut and peanut detection. However, the pAb-based assays often exhibit lack of specificity and robustness. The objective of the current investigation was to evaluate sensitivity, specificity, and robustness of monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for almond, cashew, hazelnut, pecan, and peanut detection. The tested ELISAs are sensitive (limit of detections and limit of quantifications &lt; 10 ppm) and reproducible (intra- and inter-assay variabilities &lt; 24%). The laboratory developed ELISA used a mAb (4C10) targeting a well-defined amandin epitope that is recognized by several almond allergic patients’ sera IgE. Compared to the MonoTrace assay, the mAb 4C10-based ELISA was comparable in assay sensitivity and was superior in assay specificity and recognition of a human allergy relevant epitope. The detection mAbs targeted antigens were stable and detectable in whole tree nut and peanut seeds subjected to autoclaving, blanching, frying, microwaving, and dry roasting. No cross-reactivity was observed in 156 food ingredients, each tested at 100,000 ppm except for the hazelnut kit (cross-reactive with pecan and English walnut) and the pecan kit (cross-reactive with English walnut and black walnut). Antigen recovery ranges for spiked and incurred food matrices were 81‒126% and 22‒161%, respectively. The assay results were in agreement with the allergen declaration of 180 tested commercial foods with the exception of one sample where undeclared hazelnuts were detected, two samples where undeclared pecans were detected, and one sample where declared pistachio was not detected. In conclusion, the mAb-based ELISAs are sensitive, specific, and robust for tree nut and peanut detection and quantification under the tested conditions.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to conduct a pilot study to evaluate parents’ perceptions of a music therapy mobile application aimed to promote calmer behavioral state and to improve sleep routine in children under the age of six. Participants (N = 7) were parents with children six years and younger who received a three-week trial period of a music therapy mobile application followed by an online survey to gather responses. Results revealed generally positive responses on perceptions of the mobile application. However, there was a low response rate that does not allow for generalizations. Further results and implications are discussed within the paper.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>A functional relation between two chemical species puts observational constraints on attempts to model the atmosphere. For example, adequate representation of these relations is important when modeling the depletion of stratospheric ozone by nitrous oxide. Previous work has shown a case where a linear functional relation is not preserved in the tracer transport scheme of the Higher Order Methods Modeling Environment (HOMME), which is the spectral element dynamics core used by the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM). Application of a certain simple tracer chemistry reaction before each model time step can test whether the scheme actually preserves linear tracer correlations (LCs) to machine precision. Using this method, we confirm previous results that, the implementation of the default shape-preserving filter of HOMME used in the transport scheme does not preserve LCs. However, since we prove that this limiter along with a few other limiter algorithms do in fact preserve LCs in exact arithmetic, we suggest that these limiter algorithms exacerbate the growth of roundoff error in elements where tracers have very different magnitudes. Nevertheless, we manage to put forth a limiting scheme that improves the tracer correlation problem. We also derive another new limiter that relies on multiplicative rescaling of nodal values within a given element. This algorithm does not rely on iterations for convergence and thus has the advantage of being more computationally efficient than the current default CAM-SE limiter. Results also show that the default limiter does not always introduce the lowest amount of $L_2$ error, which contradicts its purpose, since it was derived to minimize error in the $L_2$ norm.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Understanding new quantum phenomena and properties of new materials is the foundation of condensed matter physics. One can mention celebrated examples of integer and fractional quantum Hall effect, Aharonov-Bohm quantum interference effects, inventions of heterostructures and superlattices, and a recent discover of Dirac-like quasiparticles in atomically thin 2D crystals. Here we employ optical spectroscopy combined with large magnetic field and low temperatures to probe the electronic structure of several novel semiconductor materials. The discovery of graphene has opened the door to the study of other 2D materials. Here we focus on a new family of semiconducting layered 2D materials known as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), which have recently emerged as a new class of direct bandgap 2D semiconductors with two degenerate, but non-equality valleys at the +K and -K points in the Brillouin zone. Due to the broken inversion symmetry in monolayer TMDs, this valley degree of freedom can be selectively addressed by optical helicity, opening the possibility for valleytronic and optoelectronic applications. By performing valley selective photoluminescence measurements on TMDs we demonstrate the lifting of the valley degeneracy and valley polarization in an applied perpendicular magnetic field.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>One of the most remarkable properties of graphene is its linear dispersion. Once relegated only to the realm of theoretical exploration, the past ten years has seen an explosion in the realization of new Dirac-like materials in condensed matter systems. One of the most important of these new Dirac-like materials is HgTe quantum wells (QWs). Here, we report on Landau level spectroscopy studies of a series of HgTe QWs grown near or at the critical well thickness, where the band gap ￼vanishes. We observe a square root B dependence for the energy of the dominant cyclotron resonance (CR) transition over the broad range of magnetic fields, characteristic of Dirac fermions. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>While not in the same family of Dirac-like or 2D materials, metamorphic InAsSb alloys are a promising narrow gap semiconductors with bandgaps as low as 0.1 eV. New growth techniques now allow for the realization of bulk unstrained, unrelaxed InAsSb layers. Here, we report on the systematic study of the electronic properties of a series of InAsSb alloys over a broad range of Sb concentrations by infrared magneto-absorption and magneto-transport.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>K-12 schools are making the move to digital learning resources, and are increasingly integrating technology into the curriculum.  With training as both a teacher and an information specialist, the school librarian is in a position to help facilitate this transition to digital.  The purpose of this research was to examine the extent to which school librarians perceive that they are prepared to act in the role of facilitator, and to determine what factors contribute to those perceptions.  The study was guided by three research questions which explored school librarians’ self-perceptions of their technology leadership abilities, and how their school cultures and information worlds affect those perceptions.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	In this case study, I used both quantitative and qualitative methods: a survey and follow-up interviews. The participants in this research were all Florida K-12 school librarians.  In my analysis, I found that school librarians are largely prepared to act as technology leaders, but that there are many barriers to the enactment of that responsibility, many of which are related to a misunderstanding of the school librarian’s role in the school.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	This is an exploratory project.  Thus, additional research is needed into the factors that affect school librarian’s technology leadership skills enactment.  Specifically, research is needed at the national level to determine whether or not the results of this study translate to the larger population of school librarians.  Research is also needed into how the school librarian’s role can best be communicated to other school stakeholders.  Further, while this research begins to explore the information worlds of school librarians, more extensive studies are needed in order to continue to piece together the many facets of those information worlds.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Ek’ Balam’s ceremonial precinct offers what appears at first glance to be an interesting bricolage of architectural styles and anomalies.  In this dissertation I examine the amalgamation of styles through the concept of placemaking and argue that through placemaking the built environment at Ek’ Balam appears less unusual and more as a specific approach to meaning-making in the built environment.  This dissertation is a monograph on the site of Ek’ Balam that examines the architecture attributed to the dynastic founder, Ukit Kan Le’k Tok’ and how he and his polity constructed meaning through the use of and mixing of specific architectural styles.  I argue that the architectural landscape at Ek’ Balam introduced an important medium for this powerful discourse as a process of meaning-making at the inter-site and intra-site level.  Ukit Kan Le’k Tok’, meaning the “Father of the Four Hard Flints,” becomes a principal actor in the creation of place and meaning-making by selecting and combining various styles to craft a city that was altogether different.  The rulers of Ek’ Balam separated and divorced styles from their original geographic spheres, marginalized those forms to the periphery, and reformed them into a new aggregate ecology.  Most importantly, by gathering all of the known data about Ek’ Balam in one place we can better identify and appreciate how Ukit Kan Le’k Tok’ specifically appropriated and mixed styles to project a unique vision of his rule.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Placemaking refers to a particular strategy, both multi-faceted and complex.  In this dissertation I define placemaking as a process involved in the planning and design of ancient Maya cities, as well as the treatment and handling of the built environment, its masonry forms, texts, and visual representations, over time.  The notion of placemaking describes the relationships that people have to a specific place and the realization of those connections, as well as the relationships among people within the space of place formation.  Sometimes activities involved in forming, renovating, and representing a place are unremarkable and discreet while at other times these appear superbly dramatic, like those made at the site of Ek’ Balam under the reign of Ukit Kan Le’k Tok’.  What may appear to some as a minor, unremarkable site with an assortment of masonry forms, the architectural choices made by the dynastic founder at Ek’ Balam invested power in his reign and imagined on the most impressive stage the eternal reprise of his grandest moment – his rebirth as a divine ancestor through the symbolic jaws of the earth monster crafted in stone on the south-facing façade of GT-1. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Lastly, I argue based on oseteological, epigraphic, and iconographical evidence that Ukit Kan Le’k Tok’ arrived as a foreigner from the Rio Bec or Chenes heartlands and that the architectural landscape at Ek’ Balam reflects the network of relationships he maintained with the Northern Plains, the peninsula as a whole, and the Maya world further to the south.  In addition to the famous zoomorphic façade of GT-1 at Ek’ Balam, Ukit Kan Le’k Tok’ scattered features of the Rio Bec and Chenes heartlands throughout his city, including rounded corners, columns, and false stairs.  Not only do these elements reveal his place of origin, but they inscribe meaning on the built environment through Ukit Kan Le’k Tok’s relationship to distant pensinular cities.  In this dissertation I present Ek’ Balam and its built environment in its richness and complexity.  The architectural, artistic, and epigraphic evidence unearths the social and political relationships maintained by Ek’ Balam and its preeminent ruler, Ukit Kan Le’k Tok’.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>A person’s physical position relative to others is a scarcely investigated, yet potentially very powerful, variable that regulates social perception. This research suggests that people strategically position themselves either higher or lower, relative to observers, in order to manage observers’ social impressions. Four studies supported the prediction that women display a low relative physical position to highlight youthful features and to appear attractive whereas men display a high relative physical position to highlight their size and to appear dominant. The effectiveness of these strategies was confirmed in the final study that measured social perceptions of male and female targets who varied in their relative position. Findings demonstrate that, like the members of other social species, people use relative physical position to manage social impressions, though men and women do so in different ways. These impression management strategies may have deep ancestral roots, yet manifest themselves through contemporary human modalities (photographs).</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation investigates teachers’ views and uses of Hip Hop culture.  Many sociologists have used cultural capital theory to explain educational disparities among social groups.  Cultural capital theory posits that because schools value and reward dominant cultural capital, low-income students of color are placed at a troubling disadvantage.  Previous research has found that low-income, minority youth feel as though their non-dominant cultural capital is devalued within educational settings, especially by teachers.  Little is known, however, of the actual views teachers have in regard to non-dominant cultural capital.  In regard to teachers use of Hip Hop culture various studies have documented cases of Hip Hop being brought into classroom lesson plans by experts as a form of culturally relevant pedagogy.  However, most Hip Hop based education studies do not examine the experiences of in-service teachers.   </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	This work contributes to both the literature on cultural capital theory and the literature on culturally relevant pedagogy by exploring teachers’ views and uses of Hip Hop culture.  Data come from in-depth interviews with 24 secondary teachers serving in two low-income, high-minority schools.  Transcripts of interviews are analyzed through coding, sorting, local integration, and inclusive integration.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Findings reveal that while some teachers held positive views of Hip Hop culture (explaining how artists shed light on important social issues), the majority held negative views, expressing concern over how Hip Hop distracted students from school, broadcast sexist images and lyrics, encouraged illegal drug activity, promoted violence, focused on materialism, and spoke out against authority.  Teachers also believed that earlier forms of music were more positive than the newer music their students consumed. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	In regards to teaching, findings reveal that several teachers occasionally played edited Hip Hop music in their classrooms and brought Hip Hop into lesson plans with varying levels of success.  Several younger black teachers brought Hip Hop into their classrooms in continual and organic fashions, connecting course material to Hip Hop references.  Some teachers also relied on their knowledge of Hip Hop to implement effective classroom management techniques.  Factors that impeded Hip Hop’s inclusion into the classroom included teacher’s concern over content, administrative surveillance, and teachers not seeing Hip Hop as necessary to their pedagogy.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>What biological processes underlie self-control, such that this adaptive skill differs among people and appears to be functionally limited? The current research aims to answer this question by proposing that adenosine, an inhibitory neurotransmitter that helps to link the rate of energy expenditures to available energy resources in the brain, signals self-control depletion. Two studies were conducted to test the adenosine hypothesis, taking advantage of caffeine’s ability to block adenosine’s action. A first, correlational study furnished evidence for the hypothesis that people who can benefit most from a boost in self-control (i.e., who have lower trait self-control and higher demands for self-control at work) would consume and depend on caffeine to improve their performance in domains which require self-control more than people with sufficient self-control resources (i.e., who have higher self-control and lower demands for self-control at work). A second, experimental study using a self-control depletion manipulation tested whether caffeine directly improves self-control and counteracts ego depletion. However, Study 2 did not furnish support for the adenosine hypothesis. Implications and future directions are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to compare the levels of semantic complexity in children’s oral and written narrative language. This study focused on the narratives produced by students in the fourth grade (N=35) due to the high demand of narrative comprehension and production in the fourth grade curriculum. At the present time, the relevant literature is lacking a combined measure for the development of semantic complexity, with consideration of both vocabulary breadth and depth and performance in both communication modalities (oral and written narratives).  I examined whether the oral and written narratives of fourth grade students varied in lexical diversity (number of different words) lexical tiers (number of content words across tiers) and lexical maturity (number of metacognitive verbs). Levels of lexical diversity, and lexical maturity were similar across oral and written narrative tasks. Results showed there was a significant difference between modalities for lexical tiering, wherein more Tier 3 words were in written narratives than in oral narratives. Further analyses revealed children used a greater number of Tier 2 (domain general) words in their oral than in written narratives. These differences in vocabulary used across narrative modalities suggest fourth graders are able to differentiate lexical forms based on the language task, and can incorporate a range of domain general and domain specific vocabulary words within their narrative language production.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Symptoms of ADHD have been well observed and extensively discussed throughout the literature; however, classification of the disorder has recently taken on a new level of discrepancy as ADHD is now supported as a longitudinal condition that extends throughout adulthood (Barkley &amp; Murphy, 1998). Discrepancies regarding diagnostic procedures for adult ADHD coupled with recent changes in diagnostic criteria for the disorder have emphasized the continued need for further research pertaining to the diagnosis of ADHD in adults. This study utilized archival data to examine 162 college students diagnosed with ADHD with specific regard to the comparison of inter-rater reliability rates of the Barkley Adult ADHD Rating Scale - IV (BAARS-IV; Barkley, 2011) comparing DSM-IV-TR (APA, 2000) to DSM-5 (APA, 2013) ADHD symptom criteria. Inter-rater reliability of reported age of onset and total symptom values among informants and relevant descriptive data were also explored. Results indicated no significant increase in inter-rater reliability for DSM-5 symptom criteria for adult ADHD, and poor to fair inter-rater reliability among informant reports of age of onset and total ADHD symptoms. Implications regarding these results and the validity of ADHD diagnoses in college students were discussed.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Accurate vehicle classification data is fundamental to pavement design and road safety analysis. In addition, vehicle classification data is important for Florida Department of Transportation’s Transportation Statistics Office’s clients including consultants, researchers, designers, and planners who use the data to perform various analyses.  In the mid-1980s, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) developed a standardized vehicle classification system which was designed to meet the needs of many traffic data users. This resulted in the FHWA 13-category classification rule set presently used for most Federal reporting requirements. Furthermore, this serves as the foundation for most State vehicle classification reporting efforts.The Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) uses the FHWA F-Scheme to classify vehicles throughout the state highway system. This scheme relies mainly on the number of axles and the axle spacing, but on some Weigh-in-Motion (WIM) sites, vehicle weights are also used to improve classification. This thesis evaluates the performance of the Florida vehicle classification table of non-WIM sites using video data as the ground truth.This thesis has two main parts. Part I compares the performance of different data recorders that use FDOT vehicle classification table for WIM and non-WIM sites in classifying vehicles and evaluate the misclassification rates for each recorder. Part II evaluates the accuracy of the Florida vehicle classification table, determines the sources of misclassification, describes the changes recommended in the classification table to improve the classification accuracy, proposes and validates the improved vehicle classification table. This report will be of interest to Florida Department of Transportation and consultants, researchers, engineers, designers, and planners who require accurate vehicle classification information for planning, designing and maintenance of transportation infrastructures.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This paper examines a class of geometric tilings known as conformal tilings, first introduced by Bowers and Stephenson in a 1997 paper, and later developed in a series of papers by the same authors. These tilings carry a prescribed conformal structure in that the tiles are all conformally regular, and admit a reflective structure.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Conformal tilings are essentially uniquely determined by their combinatorial structure, which we encode as a planar polygonal complex. It is natural to consider not just a single planar polygonal complex, but its entire local isomorphism class. We present a case study on the local isomorphism class of the discrete hyperbolic plane complex, ultimately providing a constructive description of each of its uncountably many members.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Conformal tilings may tile either the complex plane or the Poincaré disk, and answering the type problem motivates the remainder of the paper. Subdivision operators are used to repeatedly subdivide and amalgamate tilings, and Bowers and Stephenson prove that when a conformal tiling admits a combinatorial hierarchy manifested by an expansive, conformal subdivision operator, then that tiling is parabolic and tiles the plane. We introduce a new notion of hierarchy---a fractal hierarchy---and generalize their result in some cases by showing that conformal tilings which admit a combinatorial hierarchy manifested by an expansive, fractal subdivision operator are also parabolic and tile the plane, assuming that two generic conditions for conformal tilings are true. This then answers the problem for certain expansion complexes, showing that expansion complexes for appropriate rotationally symmetric subdivision operators are necessarily parabolic.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The majority of veterans entering college today have served during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Coming from an all-volunteer military, this population has expressed feelings of social isolation and challenges adjusting to the changes in structure outside of the military.  For combat veterans, there can be physical and psychological wounds which present additional challenges.  Therefore, institutions of higher education are developing programs and services to support veteran’s transition and facilitate their social integration into college.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	This research studied the individual and social processes of a creative arts workshop for six student veterans at Florida State University.  Using qualitative methods from a phenomenological philosophical perspective, this study examines how the workshop facilitated the transition for student veterans and how they interpreted their life experiences through the creative arts.  Being a group workshop, symbolic interactionism was used as a conceptual framework in assessing their individual experiences.  Military uniforms were reprocessed into pulp and participants learned to make handmade paper from their cloth of personal significance.  They also used stencils made from personal images, transferring the image to their paper.  Following the workshop, their artwork was publicly exhibited in the university library with a personal statement written by each participant.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The participants responded positively to the experience, noting the meaningful connections they made with other student veterans and the personal significance of the work they created.  Learning a new craft, expressing themselves creatively, and displaying their work professionally strengthened their self-efficacy and sense of belonging and connection to the university.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Under international law when governments come to power through extra-legal means the governments of other states must decide whether to recognize the new government as a legitimate agent of the state, and we observe considerable variation over who recognizes the new governments, the circumstances under which recognition occurs, and even how long it takes to recognize new governments. This project studies the processes that drive recognition decisions. Despite attempts, mainly by legal scholars, to limit the discretion that third-party governments have in this regard, the institution of recognition has persisted over time. I argue that states use recognition as a political tool to weaken hostile governments and support amicable ones. In addition to these direct self-interested motivations I also posit that the nature of recognition, itself, shapes recognition decisions and encourages coordination among potential recognizers with regard to new governments. To support these suppositions I develop a theory that uses both international legal (IL) arguments regarding recognition and international relations (IR) concepts and speaks to both literatures. IR scholars, with few exceptions, have yet to study recognition in any detail, and to date there are no empirical studies of the recognition of governments. This project represents the first step in that regard, and I use an event history approach to empirically test how and when countries strategically recognize new governments. Consistent with my theoretical expectations countries do appear to use recognition to weaken their enemies, but do not seem to use recognition to bolster their friends. I also find support that countries coordinate their recognition decisions. Finally, I also conduct a case study of American foreign policy towards a series of coups in Haiti from 1986-1994. That case study provides further support for my theoretical expectations and provides a much fuller examination of the recognition process.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Success is often defined by the quality and effectiveness of an organization’s employees, and workplace design can be a primary driver in employee recruitment, satisfaction, and retention (Gensler, 2013). Since understanding employees is requisite in providing for employees’ needs and desires in the physical work environment, this study seeks to build upon the generational research by taking a more in depth look at employees through the lens of adulthood stage of life. The stages of life in adulthood are broadly defined as early middle and late adulthood (Levinson, 1978). With the demographics of the workforce shifting, this study focuses on employees in early adulthood as they make up the largest portion of the workforce population and have the most working years left (Fry, 2015). At a time with increasing pressures on the business bottom-line and a heightened awareness for employee well-being, many employers are turning to amenities to combat the digitalization of work, aid in attraction and retention, and improve employee satisfaction, health, and well-being (Smart Growth America, 2015). With a growing emphasis on workplace amenities and their role in supporting employee attraction and retention, this study explored the workplace amenity preferences of employees in early adulthood and how valued amenities can be provided in or near an existing high-rise office building.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	To identify the amenity preferences of early adult employees, this study’s methodology surveyed early adult employees currently working at a technology company located in metropolitan Washington, D.C. The survey addressed participants’ stage of life characteristics and their workplace amenity preferences. From this survey the researcher was able to identify the workplace amenities the sample population valued most. These findings informed programming and site location decisions to develop a design solution that illustrates how the most valued amenities can be provided to employees. With a shift towards a walkable, urban future and many companies relocating or opening new offices in urban locations, the design solution explored how the discovered amenity desires could be provided in an existing high-rise structure. With a better understanding of employees and their amenity desires, employers can make more informed decisions about office locations and amenity selections that support employees daily lifestyles and provide choice while also improving the fabric of our growing urban communities.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>My dissertation explores the Comité Pro Santa Cruz, a Bolivian rightwing social movement which developed to promote the political and economic interests of the eastern lowland department of Santa Cruz’s white and mestizo “elite” social groups (those of predominantly European descent who are also members of powerful political and business networks). I examine how in order to legitimate contemporary claims to political, economic, and territorial rights, the CPSC is constructing its own historical-geographical imaginary, one that describes a lengthy regional struggle for both recognition and autonomy from the Bolivian state, while simultaneously claiming a shared indigenous cultural and territorial identity with lowland indigenous peoples. My research posits that the CPSC established their discourse of identity by 1) manipulating language, 2) through use of both mainstream and social media, and 3) through depictions of space. My dissertation explores how each of these methods are engaged by the organization to achieve their greater political, economic, and territorial goals.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	In spite of their continued and growing importance throughout the region, as Perreault (2008) suggests, there has been little work by geographers on rightwing or elite social movements. Seeking to advance research on rightwing and elite social movements, my dissertation explores how the CPSC enacts its discourse in ways that attempt to naturalize racial, social, and spatial boundaries. My research employs Foucauldian discourse analysis through an examination of Bolivian Population Census and media data (with a predominant focus on social media), analysis of cartographic representations (both contemporary and archival), and data has gathered during personal fieldwork in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia. Underpinned by geographic literature on social movements politics and geographic mappings, my dissertation provides new ways of visualizing rightwing and elite discourse. I find that this type of analysis can broaden our understanding of cultural identity politics and how movements of both the left and right use identity to obtain political, economic, and territorial rights.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The polar regions of the world constitute an important sector in the global energy balance. Among other effects responsible for the change in the sea-ice cover like ocean circulation and ice-albedo feedback, the cloud-radiation feedback also plays a vital role in modulation of the Arctic environment. However the annual cycle of the clouds is very poorly represented in current global circulation models. This study aimed to explore the atmospheric conditions in the Arctic on an unprecedented spatial coverage spanning 70N to 80N through the use of a merged data product, C3MData (derived from NASA's A-Train Series).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The following three topics provide outline on how this dataset can be used to accomplish a detailed analysis of the Arctic environment and provide the modelling community with first information to update their models aimed at better forecasts.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>(1)The three properties of the Arctic climate system to be studied using the C3MData are sea-ice, clouds, and the atmospheric conditions. The first topic is to document the present states of the three properties and also their time evolutions or their seasonal cycles.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>(2)The second topic is aimed at the interactions or the feedbacks processes among the three properties. For example, the immediate alteration in the fluxes and the feedbacks arising from the change in the sea-ice cover is investigated. Seasonal and regional variations are also studied. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>(3)The third topics is aimed at the processes in native spatial resolution that drive or accompany with sea ice melting and sea ice growth. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Using a composite approach based on a classification due to surface type, it is found that limitation of the water vapour influx from the surface due to change in phase at the surface featuring open oceans or marginal sea-ice cover to complete sea-ice cover is a major determinant in the modulation of the atmospheric moisture. The impact of the cloud-radiative effects in the Arctic is found to vary with sea-ice cover and seasonally. The effect of the marginal sea-ice cover becomes more and more pronounced in the winter. The seasonal variation of the dependence of the atmospheric moisture on the surface and the subsequent feedback effects is controlled by the atmospheric stability measured as a difference between the potential temperature at the surface and the 700hPa level. A regional analysis of the same suggests that most of the depiction of the variations observed is contributed from the North Atlantic region.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The advancement of a service-dominant logic with the marketing literature, and its focus on co-creation brings into question the continued relevance of existing measures of service quality and value.  The three essays presented here begin to reexamine the existing measures found in the literature and proposes new conceptualizations and measures for service quality and value that are theoretically consistent with the co-creation proposed within the service-logic. An empirical test of the newly proposed measures is also provided to determine the role of co-creation in predicting customer satisfaction and key behavioral outcomes.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Most early modern playwrights exploit the tonal and representational advantages of prose on stage, and this is especially true of Shakespeare: with the exception of King John and Richard II, all of Shakespeare’s unassisted plays incorporate dramatic prose speeches as a complement to and deviation from dramatic verse. Yet despite the incontrovertible ubiquity of dramatic prose in Shakespeare’s works and on the early modern stage more generally, we currently lack the analytical and methodological terminology necessary to describe how Shakespeare’s prose is different from anyone else’s. This descriptive lapse becomes especially important when we realize that with the exception of 1 and 3 Henry VI, every play with a contested attribution to Shakespeare incorporates dramatic prose speeches.  My dissertation examines three separate but interrelated problems in early modern studies: what constitutes dramatic prose? What specific forms does it assume in Shakespeare’s canon? And can we differentiate Shakespeare’s dramatic prose from dramatic prose written by his contemporaries? Drawing on a sustained engagement with the dramatic prose of Shakespeare and his contemporaries, my project illuminates the critical and literary grounds for determining the unique characteristics of Shakespeare’s dramatic prose. The structure and scope of my analysis position this aspect of Shakespeare’s style on interconnected critical and computational trajectories with marked theoretical and empirical outcomes.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The field of cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) has greatly benefitted from improvements upon the integration of complementary structural determination methods and the development of high-throughput processing workflows aimed at producing high-resolution structures of proteins. Herein I will present a study integrating cryoEM with mass spectrometry and atomic modelling followed by two studies covering the development of a high-throughput cryogenic electron tomography (cryoET) workflow aimed at high-resolution cryoET.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The development and continued adoption of direct electron detectors (DEDs) over the past ten years has opened up new avenues for software development. DEDs have brought a substantial increase in detection efficiency over the entire frequency range relative to previous generation cameras, increasing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of electron interference patterns generated by thin, frozen-hydrated biological specimen. In addition to the increase in SNR, the rapid pixel readout of DEDs allows for multiple frames to be recorded per exposure. With these advances has come the ability to align frames together to account for beam induced specimen movement and the ability to account for structural degradation over the course of an exposure due to beam damage. The technique of tilt-series alignment by cross correlation in cryoET where the sample is tilted at increments during a single exposure then iteratively aligned had previously been limited for most samples by the relatively low SNR of CCD cameras. The increase in SNR of DEDs has allowed for robust tilt-series alignment by cross correlation, defocus estimation, and frame alignment. These hardware advances have paved the way for the development and optimization of cryoET processing workflows using cross-correlation based tilt-series alignment. High throughput, high-resolution cryoET workflow development will likely broaden the types of samples whose native or near-native structures have not yet been solved that are not amenable to single particle cryoEM often due to structural or compositional heterogeneity. Facilitating the determination of near-native protein structure and interactions with an improved cryoET workflow potentially allows for a better rational understanding of diseases and for more rational drug development.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In Chapter 1 of this dissertation, I will introduce the theoretical and practical aspects of cryoEM. In Chapter 2, I use the highest resolution cryoEM structure of the conformationally heterogeneous COPII cage, collected with a CCD camera, in conjunction with known crystallography structures of its constituents and differential hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectroscopy results to create a pseudo-atomic model of the whole cage. In Chapter 3, I introduce the integration of a semi-automated implementation of the Protomo correlation-based tilt-series alignment software into the Leginon/Appion software suite, allowing for high-throughput and standardized cryoET processing. In Chapter 4, I introduce a complete, streamlined protocol for sub-nanometer sub-tomogram alignment from grid preparation to complete structure. In Chapter 4, I also present an application of this protocol to the determination of the structure of Adeno-Associated Virus serotype DJ with a bound drug, Arixtra, to sub-nanometer resolution, exemplifying the accuracy of correlation-based alignment as being comparable to fiducial-based alignment.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>There has been an explosion in the use of experimental methods since the 1980s. This dissertation applies those experimental methods to various topics in public economics like tax evasion, crowding-out, labor supply, and cooperation. In chapter one I manipulate tax rates and whether students are capable of tax evasion in the laboratory. In joint provision settings, where public goods are provided through donations and tax revenues, these manipulations provide clean inference about the effects of tax evasion on crowding-out. Moreover, I collect measures of warm glow to estimate its relationship with contribution behavior across evasion settings. I find the usual crowding-out result when there is no tax evasion, however, I find complete crowding-out when tax evasion is possible. The collected measures of warm glow do not explain these results. The second chapter is co-authored with Robert White. In that chapter students complete real effort tasks in the laboratory for a piece-rate payment and we manipulate the shapes of these piece-rate earnings schedules. These shapes are intended to capture different features of the U.S. tax code when the loss of benefits (e.g. SNAP, WIC, Section 8 Housing, and Medicaid) are accounted for. We analyze how the shapes of these piece-rate schedules (as well as other behavioral factors (e.g. loss aversion, overconfidence, etc.) affect labor supply. We find that the piece-rate schedules that imitate ``notches" (or discontinuous jumps in the budget set) do reduce labor supply, however, this behavioral response to taxation is learned across rounds. Chapter three provides the first direct study of the ``restart effect" in public goods games. The restart effect is said to occur when there is an upward pulse in contributions to the public good following a stoppage in game play. I manipulate the language of the experimental instructions as well as the length of time prior to the stoppage in game play to search for facts about what supports the restart effect. I find that language in the instructions about when the stoppages occur promotes the restart effect. Finally, Chapter four presents evidence from a non-experimental project where data problems prevented useful findings about the relationship between competition and public service quality.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation addresses the creation of a unique, adaptable, and light-weight core methodology to address the problem of Soft Error Modeling and Simulation.  This core methodology was successfully tailored, validated, and expanded to work with a diverse cross-section of realistic memory devices, reliability techniques, and soft error event behaviors.  These devices were shielded by a mutually supporting trio of reliability techniques while under the threat of soft error events.  The techniques included in this dissertation are: (1) error correction codes, (2) interleaving distance, and (3) scrubbing.  The strike-times, soft error event types, and bit error severities of the Soft Error Events were stochastically estimated using publicly available research findings published from a variety of proprietary reliability data sources.  This proprietary data was gathered from certain secret vendor-specific computer memory devices.  Both logically-oriented and physically-oriented memory cell organizational perspectives were incorporated into the core-methodology that was tailored to create the Simulators implemented within this dissertation.  The failure probabilities of memory devices were calculated by the simulators that were designed and implemented within this dissertation.  The results of these simulations were validated for specific test cases against the published literature models.   </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This core methodology was applied to create scalable Simulators that were implemented utilizing a variety of soft error event behavioral characteristics, memory device design constraints, and reliability technique parameters.  This core methodology and the simulators created from its application may be utilized by researchers to address a variety of open research questions in the field.  An open research question was answered within this dissertation as proof of the effectiveness of the core methodology.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This particular research question concerned establishing the significance of Soft Error Event (SEE) topography by studying the impact of Topographically reflective SEEs on the overall failure probability and corresponding reliability of the simulated memory device over time.  To address this open research question, the Topographic 2-Parameter Weibull Soft Error (T2P-WSE) Simulator stochastically estimates the topographic strike-patterns of SEE severities based on the most commonly encountered Multiple Cell Upset shapes gathered by a commercial grade 3D-TCAD-based Neutron Particle Strike Simulation in a generic 45 nm SRAM (Static Random Access Memory) memory device.  Both the failure probability and reliability results generated by the Topographic 2-Parameter Weibull Soft Error (T2P-WSE) Simulator were shown to be significantly different from the Row-Depth-Only 2-Parameter Weibull Soft Error Simulator (S2P-WSE) when given equivalent inputs.  As documented within this dissertation, this conclusion was verified and confirmed from both a visual and statistical standpoint.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Topography was observed to play a significant role in the overall failure probability of the device.  It was concluded that the failure probability of the T2P-WSE Simulator was significantly reduced in comparison to the failure probability of the S2P-WSE Simulator.  As defined for a variety of input parameters, the S2P-WSE Simulator consistently over-estimated the failure probability of the device.  The reason for this outcome is directly related to the row-depth-only bit error severity assumption of the S2P-WSE Simulator.   </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The row-depth-only assumption forces every MCU SEE impacts the device to spread its bit errors in a fixed row-depth-only pattern as opposed to a more realistic topographic pattern incorporated such as the patterns encoded into the T2P-WSE Simulator for the 45 nm memory chip geometry.  This conclusion only served to reinforce the initial observation that when taking into account the spread of the bit errors, one would significantly reduce the overall failure probability for a memory storage device implemented with an interleaving distance architecture by taking into account its topographic shape.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The core methodology calls for the stochastic estimation of the strike-time, type, and bit-error severity that represent all simulated soft error events destined to impact the simulated device at some simulation time unit over the total simulation run-time.  These Soft Error Events will strike the device at the appointed strike-time and be mitigated by the chosen set of mutually supporting reliability techniques.  These reliability techniques include the following: (1) error correcting codes, (2) interleaving distance, and (3) scrubbing.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This core methodology was fitted to the Compound Poisson and a logical memory cell organization for the Compound Poisson Soft Error Simulator.  This core methodology was also successfully applied to the 2 Parameter Weibull Failure Distribution and a Physical Memory Cell organization.  Both CPSE and S2P-WSE Simulators proved equally capable in calculating the failure probability of any variety of simulated memory storage devices shielded by the three integrated reliability techniques under the Impact of these stochastically determined soft error events.  This failure probability over simulated time was utilized to evaluate all of the secondary results of the Core Methodology including such results as the Mean-Time-To Failure and Failures-In-Time Number at the conclusion of each simulation run.  All of the simulators presented within this dissertation were implemented within a Matlab programming environment.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Reversed phase liquid chromatography is a common analytical technique employed in a variety of fields as a core component in many developmental and validation methods.  Traditionally, this technique uses acetonitrile/water or methanol/water mixtures as the mobile phase to elute analytes of interest via differential partitioning to and from an embedded stationary phase.  These organic modifiers, however, are generally toxic and flammable.  This toxicity and volatility necessitates additional care in use and disposal compared to greener solvents.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In particular, the more commonly employed acetonitrile is moderately toxic and produces significantly more toxic substances upon decomposition (nominally carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide), which further complicates its disposal.  In addition, while methanol is less toxic, this modifier is more volatile and requires significantly greater concentrations for similar eluotrophic strength.  Ethanol, on the other hand, provides a greener alternative due to its low toxicity to both humans and the environment.  Furthermore, the eluotrophic strength of ethanol is comparable to the acetonitrile modifier, thus requiring smaller organic concentrations than methanol.  Ethanol's boiling point is also significantly greater than methanol's boiling point, thereby reducing the flammability risk versus methanol.  Finally, moderate increases in temperature are found to significantly reduce the several times greater viscosity of ethanol/water mixtures versus traditional mobile phases.  The application of higher temperatures also provides a secondary benefit by increasing the elution strength of the mobile phase, thereby reducing run times and, more importantly, 'organic waste'. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this work, high temperature ethanol/water mixtures were explored in-depth as a green alternative to traditional hydro-organic mobile phases.  Solvent strength comparisons revealed that high temperature ethanol/water mixtures have a broad range of eluting power that exceeds 60% ambient acetonitrile/water mobile phases without requiring greater than 50% ethanol content.  In addition, retention was demonstratively less sensitive to changes in temperature than to changes in organic content.  From an examination of the effect of these changes on the retention mechanism by linear solvation energy relationships, it was determined that temperature altered retention more by affecting the relative difference in the hydrogen-bond acidity while ethanol content largely changed retention by modifying mobile phase cavity formation effects.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>From a van't Hoff analysis of the thermodynamics of transfer for a methylene substituent, the structures of the mobile phase was revealed to differ considerably.  In particular, it was determined that the greater elution strength of the ethanol modifier is a result of a reduction in the favorable change in entropy by transfer of the analyte out of the mobile phase.  This observation implied that a mobile phase cavity around a non-polar analyte is more stable when employing ethanol as the modifier.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Finally, high temperature ethanol/water mobile phases were examined in the chromatographic approximation of pure water retention (log k'w) and subsequent estimation of the octanol/water partition coefficient (log P) via the Collander equation.  Linear solvation energy relationships were employed to compare the log k'w extrapolated systems based on high temperature ethanol/water, ambient acetonitrile/water, and ambient methanol/water mobile phases.  Based on the comparisons of the three organic modifiers, high temperature ethanol/water mobile phases were observed to provide the best estimation of log P.  This conclusion is based on a high Collander correlation of 0.978 and a near unity cos(θ) value of 0.998 between the LSER coefficient vectors of ethanol/water log k'w and octanol/water log P systems.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The aim of this thesis is to investigate the effect of environmental and traffic-related factors on the frequency and severity of highway crashes with a focus on different age groups including the aging populations. Existing studies in the traffic safety have not specifically focused on aging driver-involved crashes. Aging drivers are more vulnerable to the roadway crashes than other adult age groups due to their cognitive, physical and health limitations. This problem becomes more challenging due to the drastic variation in the traffic patterns that especially happen on the major highways. In this thesis, several data sets from different sources, such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Florida Automated Weather Network (FAWN), the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) and the United States Naval Observatory (USNO), are collected, refined and combined. With the aid of statistical correlation analysis and logistic regression, a top down analysis is performed in order to analyze the occurrence of crashes via a case study application on the I-95 highway corridor in the State of Florida. Using logit curves, a sensitivity analysis is carried out to quantify the effect of traffic volume on the crash frequency. In addition to the crash frequency analysis, factors influencing the crash severity are also analyzed in an integrated manner for two metropolitan areas in the City of Jacksonville and Miami, Florida.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Both frequency- and severity-focused analyses have led to several important conclusions. Results suggest that the variation in the hourly traffic volume significantly affects the crash occurrences for both aging and non-aging drivers depending on the geographical location; however, the crash occurrence for aging drivers is less sensitive to the flow than other age groups in congested locations. Results indicate that crash severity for all other age groups decrease on roadways with narrower shoulders and at night unlike those of aging drivers. Furthermore, driving at night on I-95 in Jacksonville seems to be problematic for both age classes whereas that risk is less for Miami locations. Higher roadway surface width also appears to increase the chance of having a severe crash for aging drivers. The DUI-influenced crashes have also been detected considerably high on the I-95 highway corridor in the City of Miami, Florida. This problem seems critical both in terms of crash frequency and severity. The proposed methodology can help transportation officials to understand the nature of the aging driver-involved crashes, and formulate better safety-oriented decisions.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This work’s objective is to apply the model predictive control method to the intelligent energy management layer of the Future Renewable Electric Energy Delivery and Management system. This allows for optimal power reference signals to be generated for all energy resources based on the system’s interest. The outputs of the model predictive controllers are the inputs of the lower level controls that manage power between load, generation, and storage. Consequently, those outputs regulate the frequency and voltage stability. Intelligent energy management solution needs to be scalable in its computation and communication efforts and be robust enough when faced with single points of failures to survive the inevitable device/link failures of the smart grid.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Utilization of renewable energy, energy efficiency, and diverse energy sources would cause substantial energy security and economic benefits. However, most renewable energy resources cannot produce power continuously due to the intermittent features. Therefore, an energy management routine is essential.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the Future Renewable Electric Energy Delivery and Management system, there are multiple distributed renewable energy resources and distributed energy storage devices. In the energy cell of this system, coordination of local load, generation, and storage on Solid State Transformer secondary for maintaining instantaneous power balance are required. A supervisory energy management takes care of energy cell’s task. Furthermore, with multiple types of sources and loads, the energy management of the Future Renewable Electric Energy Delivery and Management system turns into a distributed control problem. Advanced and new dynamic control needs to be employed within the smart grid for instantaneous management of real–time pricing, dynamic loads, renewable energy (solar, wind, etc.), energy storage, and microgrid management. Model predictive control is a suitable methodology for the purpose of optimal distributed energy management since it allows the control action (output) in the current time-step to be optimized while taking into account the future time-steps.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>As one of the leading causes of disease burden and disability in the world, Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a persistent and ever expanding financial and public health concern. MDD is quite prevalent in children and adolescents with life-long negative consequences. Although there are treatments available for MDD, they lack in effectiveness, and have a potential for enduing negative side effects. These conventional treatments are even less effective in pediatric MDD as more than 50% of these patients are deemed treatment-resistant. Ketamine (KET), a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, has recently shown great promise as a rapid-acting and long-lasting treatment for MDD, especially for treatment-resistant MDD. Unfortunately, the efficacy, functionality, and biochemical consequences of KET exposure during periods prior to adulthood are not known. Therefore, the following sets of experiments were designed to examine the antidepressant efficacy of KET during adolescence as well as the potential neurobiological mechanisms involved. To do this, behavioral reactivity to stress- and anxiety-eliciting situations and responsiveness to KET treatment were characterized in adolescent male rats and mice in chapters two and three. Data presented in these chapters demonstrated that KET is an effective antidepressant in adolescent rodents; however, the neurobiological underpinning(s) mediating these effects required examination. Recent evidence has shown that KET reverses the deficits associated with stress within major mesocorticolimbic regions such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC), Nucleus Accumbens (NAc), and hippocampus. However little is known about KET’s effect in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), which provides the majority of dopaminergic input to these regions. Therefore, the experiments conducted in chapter four were designed to examine the neurobiological underpinnings of KET’s antidepressant effects in adolescent male mice. More specifically, the biochemical and electrophysiological effects produced by KET treatment during adolescence were characterized within the VTA and its major projection regions, the NAc and PFC, respectively. Combined, the findings within this dissertation indicate that KET treatment produces antidepressant-like effects in adolescence, and that these effects are mediated, at least in part, by changes in intracellular signaling and neuronal activity within VTA dopamine neurons and its connection to the NAc. Lastly, in chapter five, the potential clinical implications as well as future directions of this work are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Although online searching for health information has grown in recent years, the massive amount and unstructured presentation of information make it difficult for users to find relevant data. Despite efforts to structure information resources online, the existing knowledge organization systems (KOS) have faced many challenges in coping with the quickly evolving databases, mainly due to the rigidity of the existing knowledge representation (KR) systems. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The goal of the current study is to provide a basis for enriching the existing KR systems in a user-centered way by leveraging online health information users’ KR practices to the existing structured KOS. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A social semantic approach was adopted as a theoretical framework of the study. This relatively new approach to KR seeks a way to impart the merits of two different metadata mechanisms: user-generated metadata (i.e., social tags) and ontologies with the aim of bridging the rich vocabularies of Web users to enhance ontology structures. Particular considerations were given to exploring semantic attributes and relationships between social tags and associated unstructured data in social media, based on the existing ontology structure ⎯ the Unified Medical Language System® (UMLS). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Two methods ⎯ text mining and content analysis  ⎯ were used to comprehend the language capabilities of humans along with the high speed processing ability of computers. A natural language processing tool was also partially used. A total of 341,720 descriptive tags from 50,263 blogs were collected from a social media site: Tumblr. The blogs and tags were used as representations of user-generated documents and descriptive metadata regarding health issues, which can be utilized by non-healthcare professionals.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In analyzing usage pattern, semantic categories, and latent relationships among the semantic categories found from user vocabularies in user-generated health resources, preliminary understandings on user’s ordinary online KR practices for health information and semantic structures were gained. The research suggests highly right-skewed vocabulary usage patterns in tags and terms in blogs. Thus, there were a few popular tags and terms. The semantic types identified in tags and in terms used in blogs showed similar distribution patterns. A few of semantic types were very popular while the others were infrequently used both in tags and in blog terms. The relationships structures among the identified semantic types showed health information users tend to associate various semantic groups of tags and terms to represent or describe their health issues. More complicated and strong associations were observed among semantic types in terms used to describe their health issues than those among semantic types in tags. The semantic types in tags and in blog terms were found to have many strong, direct, and close connections each other. Of those identified tags and terms, over half were covered by the existing ontology. When it came to the unmapped vocabularies, less than ten percent were directly related to health issues, showing possible inter-concept relationships to the pre-coordinated concepts in the existing ontology, that is the UMLS.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The combination of rich user vocabularies and ontological models could better correspond with health information behavior in reality. The findings of this research have various practical and theoretical implications for understanding information users’ KR practices and for promoting user-oriented knowledge organization or representation systems. The hope is to ultimately contribute toward improving the structure and access of online health resources by conferring richer collective intelligence on KR systems.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is a powerful tool to elucidate the structure and dynamics of membrane proteins and protein-lipid interactions. High magnetic fields increase EPR sensitivity and broaden its practice through increased time scale and g-tensor resolution. However, the application of high-field EPR is hindered by the lack of suitable techniques and methodologies. The focus of this work is to develop high-field and multi-frequency EPR methods for characterizing membrane proteins, with specific aims to investigate lipid-protein interactions of an antibacterial peptide (AA1) and HIV-1 envelope protein gp41. These methods include: i). A thin-layer cylindrical sample holder designed for studying low-yield biological samples at 94 GHz (W-band). The holder is non-resonant and operating in induction-mode for continuous wave EPR analyses. A concentration sensitivity of 2 µM was achieved for a spin-label standard and 20-30 µM for the biological aqueous samples, representing a ~10-fold enhancement compared to a cylindrical TE011 resonator on a commercial Bruker W-band spectrometer (Chapter 3). ii). Magnetic alignment of cholesterol-containing bicelles at high fields. Membranes with high cholesterol content are typical in mammalian cells and are important for biophysical studies mimicking native conditions, such as using aligned bicelles to study protein orientation in membranes.   In this study, field dependence of magnetic alignment of cholesterol-containing bicelles was investigated and enhanced bicelle alignment at high fields were demonstrated (Chapter 5). Other EPR techniques developed here include: 1) Membrane permeability analysis to assess membrane disruption by proteins; 2) Lipid lateral ordering induced by protein binding defined using EPR at 94 GHz; 3) A new application of EPR power saturation methods to determine membrane thinning. These EPR techniques were applied to define the molecular basis of the antimicrobial activity of AA1. The results show that the peptide selectively permeates and structurally modifies negatively charged bacterial-mimic membranes. In contrast, cholesterol-containing neutral membranes mimicking mammalian cells were minimally affected by the molecule. Based on combined EPR analyses, we proposed a “carpet-like” mechanism for the antimicrobial activities of AA1. The results provide implications for the development of effective AMPs with robust antibacterial activities against antibiotic-resistant microbes (Chapter 4). Additionally, magnetic alignment of bicelles was used to study the membrane bound region (MPERTM) of HIV-1 envelope protein gp41. Using a rigid spin-label–TOAC, the structural information of the MPERTM in membranes was determined by studying backbone dynamics, immersion depths and helical tilt in bicelles. The results indicate the existence of three separated helical segments of the MPERTM with different motional time-scales. The effect of lipid composition and cholesterol content on the conformation of the MPERTM in the membrane were also investigated (Chapter 6). In summary, we have demonstrated and further developed the applications of multi-frequency and high-field EPR in studying membrane proteins and lipid-protein interactions.</DISS_para>

Seeking to address a gap in the research, this study utilized a case study methodology to look at preservice teachers’ learning about the flipped classroom and designing lessons integrating technology as a way for a teacher education course to facilitate preservice teachers’ construction of their Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge. The participants were preservice English teachers taking an online English education course during Summer</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>2015. The researcher used a survey to purposefully select nine individuals with a range of self reported knowledge. Participants were then interviewed twice, had their course assignments collected and analyzed, and submitted three written reflections. The course that the participants took challenged preservice teachers to bring together their content knowledge, pedagogical knowledge, and technological knowledge to create flipped lessons videos and a series of lesson plans. The data showed that there was no pattern or stages of TPACK development. Participants saw potential for flipped learning to be useful in secondary English classes and that while participants wanted to use technology and teach digital literacies in their future classrooms, they also wanted their students to engage in traditional print literacy.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The present study investigated the meta-relations among common components of reading comprehension. The Simple View of Reading (SVR, Hoover &amp; Gough, 1990) posits that reading comprehension is the sum or product of linguistic comprehension and decoding. The meta- analysis presented here investigated extending the SVR using a two-stage correlational meta- analytic structural equation modeling (SEM) approach with added additional components of working memory, background knowledge, and reasoning and inference. A comprehensive literature search using terms related to reading comprehension and the hypothesized predictors produced a total of k = 155 included studies. Results of an expanded SVR model run on the full sample (n = 1,205,581) showed that none of the hypothesized added predictors accounted for additional variance beyond that accounted for by the SVR components of decoding and linguistic comprehension. Age was then considered as a moderator in these analyses. The correlation matrices were dichotomized into a younger (age &lt; 11 years) and older cohort (age &gt;= 11 years). The SVR model fit the data well for both the younger cohort and the older cohort. Whereby both decoding and linguistic comprehension were important in earlier grades, once decoding was fluent, only linguistic comprehension was a significant predictor of reading comprehension for later grades. Neither working memory, background knowledge, nor reasoning and inference made significant contributions to reading comprehension in the older cohort. For the younger cohort, reasoning and inference was a statistically significant predictor of individual differences in reading comprehension but the additional variance accounted for was trivial. The models accounted for approximately 60% of the variance in reading comprehension. Results are presented in the context of the development of reading ability in the early elementary years and implications for policy and practice are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), characterized by recurrent obsessions and/or compulsions, is a disabling psychiatric condition affecting approximately 2-3% of the population. Whereas several first-line treatments have been established (e.g., pharmacological and psychological), a substantial proportion of patients (40-60%) fail to experience symptom remission, underscoring the need for research in this area. One approach to increasing treatment efficacy is to target underlying risk factors or dysfunctions that may in turn improve outcomes. One such risk factor is anxiety sensitivity (AS) cognitive concerns. AS cognitive concerns reflects fears of mental incapacitation (e.g., “It scares me when I am unable to keep my mind on a task”). There is recent evidence that AS cognitive concerns is uniquely associated with various obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptom domains. However, questions remain as to whether reductions in AS cognitive concerns will lead to subsequent reductions in OC symptoms. The purpose of the proposed study was to investigate the efficacy of a brief AS cognitive concerns intervention on reductions in OC symptoms. The sample included 60 individuals with elevated OC symptoms and AS cognitive concerns. Individuals were randomly assigned (parallel, single blind) to a one-session AS cognitive concerns intervention (n = 30) or a health information control condition (n = 30) and assessed post-treatment, at one-week and one-month follow-up. Results indicated that the active intervention produced significantly greater reductions in AS cognitive concerns at one-week follow-up. Moreover, changes in AS cognitive concerns mediated changes in OC symptoms at one-month follow-up. Findings add to a growing body of literature indicating that brief AS interventions can effectively reduce symptoms of AS, and that reductions in AS, particularly the cognitive concerns dimension are associated with symptom improvement for various adverse outcomes including OC symptoms.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Oxide ceramics are materials with a wide range of properties. Insulators are most common, however semiconductors, strongly correlated electron materials, and even superconductors are all relevant oxide materials. Here we seek to synthesize novel oxide single crystal phases and study their properties using an alkaline earth metal flux technique. The specific flux techniques are new, and we will seek to understand the capabilities of these fluxes as a novel synthesis tool. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The use of a barium metal flux to grow single crystal oxides is rather counterintuitive, but is exemplified further with the growth of europium monoxide (Fm3 ̅m #225, Z = 4). Eu1-xBaxO single crystals (x = 0.01 – 0.25) are grown and studied for their ferromagnetic properties. A new oxide phase Ba2Eu¬2P2O (P4/mbm #127, Z = 2) has also been synthesized from the same method, and may potentially be studied as a ferromagnetic semiconductor based on preliminary observations. Other examples of single crystal oxide phases grown from barium metal flux includes Ba2TeO (P4/nmm #129, Z = 2), BaLn2O4 (Ln = La – Lu) (Pnma #62, Z = 4), and Ba3Yb2O5Te (P4/mmm #123 Z = 1). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The new crystal phases Ba3Ln2O5Cl2 (Ln = Sm – Lu, Y) are synthesized using a reactive barium metal flux. Single crystal x-ray diffraction is used to determine their structures with space group (I4/mmm #139, Z = 2) related to the Ruddlesden-Popper structure type. The unit cell dimensions range from a = 4.46(6) Å and c = 24.87(6) Å for Ba3Gd2O5Cl2 to a = 4.35(6) Å and c = 24.57(6) Å for Ba3Lu2O5Cl2 with the dimensions following the expected lanthanide contraction trends. The magnetic properties of these materials are studied and related to their structures.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The use of alkaline earth fluxes such as magnesium or calcium based fluxes are also briefly considered for their capabilities to produce novel mixed anion phases. A calcium flux is shown to produce the novel semimetals Ca4TeOH4 and Ca3Ca1-xEuxTeOH4 (I4/mmm #139, Z = 2), and highly reducing magnesium fluxes are shown to produce the divalent samarium Zintl phases SmMg2Bi2 ¬and SmMg2Sb2 (P3 ̅m1 #163, Z = 1).</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this dissertation, I explore retirement income using a sample of Black and White men and women over age 62 who draw Social Security. I examine three of the main sources of retirement income – Social Security, occupational pensions, and private assets – to understand gender and race variation, including the simultaneous effects of disadvantages experienced based on gender and race. I also explore a comprehensive set of explanations for gender and race variation, specifically experiences related to the paid labor force, family, and health. To guide this research, I draw on two perspectives: cumulative (dis)advantage and welfare state. First, I use the cumulative (dis)advantage perspective to explain how experiences in earlier life can contribute to – and magnify – inequalities in later life. I also draw on the welfare state literature to shed light on the ways labor force, family, and health experiences may contribute to retirement income, and how the welfare state can contribute to gender and race inequalities. Together, these perspectives shed light on gender and race differences in retirement income and possible experiences that contribute to explanations for these differences. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Using the 2010 data from Version N of the RAND HRS data file, I conduct bivariate and multivariate analyses, specifically mediation analyses and Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition regression analyses. My dissertation has three main findings. First, retirement income varies by gender and race, but race variation is more consistent and substantial. Second, explanations for gender and race variation in retirement income differ based on type of retirement income (e.g., occupational pension coverage), though labor force characteristics most consistently contribute to explanations. Third, explanations for race variation depend on gender and vice-versa, suggesting that experiences matter differently for White women, Black women, White men, and Black men.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The gendered allocation of time to household labor has important consequences for marital well-being. However, much of what is known about gendered patterns in housework and their consequences is derived from cross-sectional studies. Using five waves of data from the Americans’ Changing Lives Study (1986–2011/12), this study examines longitudinal patterns in housework and their influence in mid- to later life marital quality. Compared with previous studies, this research investigates how time in housework is patterned over the course of marriage, how age, cohort, and other time-use activities shape longitudinal patterns in housework, and how housework patterns influence marital quality in mid- to later life. In my first set of analyses, I use longitudinal latent class growth modeling (LCGM) to assess the number, shape, and sample percentages of women’s and men’s patterns in housework over the course of marriage and their subsequent effects on mid- to later life marital quality. Results from the LCGM for women show two housework trajectories for women: One pattern involves high and declining time in housework (52% of women), and the other is characterized by moderate and declining hours in housework (48% of women). Two housework trajectories are found for men: One pattern is characterized by moderate and increasing hours in housework (35% of men), and the other is distinguished by low and stable time in housework (65% of men). Although age plays a limited role in housework patterns, cohort effects emerge, with Baby Boom women having greater odds of having high/declining housework hours – a more gender-traditional pattern of time allocation -- over the moderate/declining pattern. In contrast, Baby Boom men have greater odds of having moderate/increasing housework hours – a less gender-traditional pattern of time-use – over the low/stable pattern. Other forms of time-use influence housework trajectory membership, with greater work hours emerging as the most consistent predictor of women’s greater odds of having a moderate/declining compared with the high/declining trajectory, and men’s greater odds of having low/stable compared with moderate/increasing time in housework. In the second set of analyses, results from longitudinal OLS regression models show an influence of housework trajectories on marital quality, with women who have moderate/declining housework having diminished marital quality, when compared with men who have low and stable housework hours over time. No differences in marital quality were found between women with high/declining and men with moderate/declining or low/stable housework patterns. Taken together, this research shows how individuals cluster in their allocation of time to housework over their lives and how distinctive patterns result in either heightened or diminished satisfaction with marriage in mid- to later life.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs or TMDCs) have garnered much interest recently due to their weakly layered structures, allowing for mechanical exfoliation down to a single atomic layer. As such, it is pertinent to re-examine the bulk properties of these materials in order to completely understand and predict what is happening in the few-layered limit. A large majority of these systems were first investigated in the 1950s and 1960s. As such, many of the current growth methods rely on these reports, making new growth techniques for lowering defects of importance as well. In this thesis, both topics are taken into consideration and discussed, though the latter remains to be investigated in much more detail and should be the work of future research efforts.  			</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Orthorhombic MoTe2 and its isostructural compound WTe2 were recently claimed to belong to a new class (type II) of Weyl semimetals characterized by a linear touching between hole and electron Fermi surfaces in addition to nodal lines. These compounds have recently been shown to display very large non-saturating magnetoresistances which have been attributed to nearly perfectly compensated densities of electrons and holes. Here, we present a detailed study on the temperature and angular dependence of the Shubnikov-de-Haas (SdH) effect in the semi-metal WTe2 and MoTe2.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In WTe2, we observe four fundamental SdH frequencies and attribute them to spin-orbit split, electron- and hole-like, Fermi surface (FS) cross-sectional areas. Their angular dependence seems consistent with ellipsoidal FSs with volumes suggesting a modest excess in the density of electrons with respect to that of the holes. We show that density functional theory (DFT) calculations fail to correctly describe the FSs of WTe2. When their cross-sectional areas are adjusted to reflect the experimental data, the resulting volumes of the electron/hole FSs obtained from the DFT calculations would imply a pronounced imbalance between the densities of electrons and holes. We find evidence for field-dependent Fermi surface cross-sectional areas by fitting the oscillatory component superimposed onto the magnetoresistivity signal to several Lifshitz-Kosevich components. We also observe a pronounced field-induced renormalization of the effective masses. Taken together, our observations suggest that the electronic structure of WTe2 evolves with the magnetic field due to the Zeeman splitting. This evolution is likely to contribute to its pronounced magnetoresistivity.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>For beta-MoTe2, high quality single-crystals were synthesized by flux in excess tellurium. We find that its superconducting transition temperature depends on disorder as quantified by the ratio between the room- and low-temperature resistivities, (residual resistivity ratio, RRR. Similar to WTe2, its magnetoresistivity does not saturate at high magnetic fields and can easily surpass 10^6%, with the superimposed Shubnikov de Haas oscillations revealing a non-trivial Berry phase of ~pi. The geometry of the Fermi surface, as extracted from the quantum oscillations, is markedly distinct from the calculated one. A broad anomaly seen in the heat capacity and in the Hall-effect indicates that the crystallographic and the electronic structures evolve upon cooling below 100 K, likely explaining the discrepancy between these recent predictions and our experimental observations.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In alpha-MoTe2, grown at lower temperatures in vapor transport, we focus on few-layered crystals mechanically exfoliated onto a 270 nm thick SiO2 layer. Previous reports found that the field-effect mobility of transition metal dichalcogenides TMDs tends to increase, reaching a maximum value when crystals are composed of approximately 10 atomic layers.  We show that the overall performance of a MoTe2 based field-effect transistor is comparable to similar devices based on MoS2 or MoSe2. But with an optical gap quite close in value to the one of Si and an enhanced spin-orbit interaction (since Te is a 5p element) suggests that this compound might be particularly suitable for optoelectronic applications in a complimentary range of wavelengths.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the case of MoSe2, we show that multi-layered (~ 10 atomic layers) field-effect transistors can display ambipolar behavior at room temperature when using a standard combination of metals, Au on Ti, for all the electrical contacts. The 4.33 eV work function of Ti is closely matched by the electron affinity of bulk MoSe2, 4.45 eV. This implies that the Fermi level of Ti is very close to the bottom of the conduction band of MoSe2, and therefore that one should expect a rather small Schottky barrier for electron conduction through the Ti:Au contacts. One extracts through Hall effect measurements, Hall mobilities in excess of 250 cm^2/(V s) for both holes and electrons at room temperature. These values are remarkable, since they are comparable or higher than most values reported so far for transition metal dichalcogenides at room temperature, but are obtained without the use of high k-dielectrics such as HfO2, doping, or of a particular combination of metals for the electrical contacts. Our results suggest that improvements in fabrication, and on the quality of the starting material (with a lower amount of defects) could make field-effect transistors based on few atomic layers of synthetic MoSe2 excellent candidates for complementary logic electronics.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Finally, we report on alloys of MoTe2 and WTe2, Mo1-xWxTe2, grown by a chemical vapor transport process with the goal of obtaining a phase diagram with respect to doping and temperature. These crystals have been analyzed for composition via EDS and investigated through high resolution transmission electron microscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and ARPES. Transmission electron microscopy images clearly show that through W substitution we are able to synthesize both 2H, trigonal prismatic, and Td, orthorhombic structures. As opposed to other reports, we find a phase transition from the 2H- to the Td-phase at 10 % W doping, much lower than expected. This structure is characterized by a linear arrangement of atoms, as opposed to a hexagonal pattern. In addition, through examination of monolayers via TEM, we find that the W disperses randomly amongst the crystal as opposed to forming grain boundaries. Given the crystallinity and quality of the material, mapping the phase diagram should be of relative ease, however this work is still ongoing. As such, the phase diagram has not yet been completed and remains unreported in this manuscript.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The development and experimental validation of a mathematical model for nanoparticle–based surface energy transfer (SET) between gold nanoparticles and fluorescent dye labels, has enabled biophysical studies of nucleic acid structure and function previously inaccessible by other methods. The main advantages of SET for optical distance measurements are that it can operate over longer distances than other similar methods, such as Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET), thus enabling measurements across biological structures much larger than otherwise possible. This work discusses the fundamental theory for the SET interaction and expansion of SET theory to account for multiple interacting dye labels and demonstrated on DNA and RNA in order to allow 3D triangulation of labeled structures. SET theory has also been expanded to core@shell structures which represent a new class of designer SET platforms with dramatically increased spectral windows; allowing for a multitude of dye labels to be used simultaneously over a broad range of wavelengths. Additionally, these designer nanostructures can incorporate the material properties of the core. So that , for example Ni@Au, can provide a SET measurement platform coupled with a magnetic moment for sample purification and manipulation. These efforts to develop and establish optical SET methods lays a foundation of a powerful methodology for biophysical characterization, and allows researchers to study biological structures previously too large or complex to be easily studied, such as the unknown tertiary structures of large RNA elements.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Despite contributing to our understanding of substance use among maltreated adolescents, research on this link has been limited by reductionist thinking and methods that do not accurately address the heterogeneity within these two complex multidimensional constructs.  This study addresses this issue through the use of a person-centered approach.  Specifically, this study draws data from the Longitudinal Studies of Child Abuse and Neglect to explore the utility of three latent class models in extracting meaningful information on the relationship between experiences of maltreatment and adolescent substance use (N = 902).  Model 1 examined the associations between latent classes of maltreatment and substance use, and whether sex differences exist across these associations.  Three classes of maltreatment were identified, labeled “No/low neglect”, “Severe emotional/physical/neglect”, and “Severe sexual/physical/neglect”.  Adolescents comprising the “Severe emotional/physical/ neglect” class were found to have the highest mean count of substances used over the last year, even after considering participants’ sex.  Model 2 examined the associations between latent classes of adolescent substance use and observed indicators of maltreatment, and whether sex differences exist across these associations.  Five classes emerged from this latent class model, labeled “Low risk users”, “Heavy users”, “Tobacco users”, “Heavy alcohol users”, and “Tobacco/Cannabis users”.  Almost all indicators of maltreatment increased the risk of being classified into the “Heavy users” and “Tobacco users” classes, which was consistent across male and female adolescents.  Lastly, Model 3 examined whether associations exist between the previously identified classes of maltreatment and classes of substance use.  Findings indicated that males comprising the “Severe emotional/physical/ neglect” class were more likely than those in the “No/low neglect” class to be classified in the “Heavy users” class compared to the “Low risk users” class.  Among female adolescents, those in the “Severe emotional/physical/ neglect” class were more likely than those in the “No/low neglect” class to be classified in the “Tobacco users” and “Tobacco/cannabis” classes, relative to the “Low risk users” class.  Taken together, findings demonstrate how a person-centered approach can assist with developing a more nuanced understanding of the complex relationship between maltreatment and adolescent substance use.  This study provides some explanation for the differences of substance use that exist within the general population of maltreated adolescents and draws attention to the need for selective prevention programming for this at-risk population.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Reputation greatly affects the daily work-related interactions and career progression of all individuals.  Depending on quality of an individual’s reputation, it has the ability to either generate or inhibit opportunities for success.  Despite the importance of understanding how reputation develops and functions, academic investigation into individual reputation is limited.  In particular, the role of stakeholder perceptions and how certain characteristics of stakeholders might affect these perceptions have received no attention.  Also, the high quality reputation research that does exist often uses a measure that neglects to capture a frequently discussed key dimension of reputation — prominence.  The purpose of this two study dissertation is to address these two needs (i.e., the role of stakeholders and the measurement of reputation).  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Study 1 developed a psychometrically sound measure of reputation.  The measure captures all three dimensions of reputation (i.e., performance, prominence, and character), and demonstrates convergent, discriminant, and criterion-related validity.  Study 2 utilized the newly developed measure to investigate the role of stakeholder perceptions in the development of focal individual reputation by testing a moderated mediation model of reputation’s antecedents.  Data were obtained from multiple sources in a large insurance sales based organization.  Results provide mixed support for the effects of stakeholder characteristics, but indicate that stakeholders do in fact perceive focal individual reputation differently.  Furthermore, the roles of political skill and objective performance both were found to play significant roles in the prediction of reputation, using the new reputation measure developed in Study 1.  The implications of the results are discussed, and directions for future research are proposed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Diabetes and depression are both highly prevalent within the U.S. and it is worrisome that these two conditions are related.  Several meta-analyses and studies using qualitative, clinical, and nationally representative cross-sectional quantitative data have shown that depression is associated with an increased risk of developing diabetes (Ducat et al. 2014; Lloyd, Hermanns, Nouwen, Pouwer, Underwood, and Winkley 2010; Katon et al. 2010; Mezuk et al. 2008) and/or those who are diabetic have a moderately increased risk of developing depression (Katon at al. 2010; Moulton, Pickup, and Ismail 2015).  Controversy exists as to which way the association may be stronger and whether these conditions are causally related.  Additionally, although research into the biological links between these diseases exists, little work has been done that examines the social conditions that link diabetes and poor mental health throughout the life course. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Using the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP), this dissertation examines the biopsychosocial connection between marital biography, mental health, and diabetes with an emphasis on gender differences.  I examine 1) how mental health and diabetes are associated cross-sectionally and longitudinally; 2) how marital biography impacts the relationships between mental health and diabetes; and 3) how social mechanisms influence the previously established relationships between marital biography, mental health, and diabetes.  Each relationship is examined for the women and men separately and compared to the overall sample.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Results add to existing literature by demonstrating that diabetes and depressive symptomology are associated cross-sectionally when each health condition is examined as the dependent variable.  Longitudinally, those who are diabetic report higher depressive symptoms over time than non-diabetics.  Results vary in magnitude and significance based on gender.  For women, those who were diabetic at baseline report higher depressive symptoms over time than non-diabetic women.  Results also contribute to the field by showing that marital biography impacts the cross-sectional relationships between diabetes and depressive symptomology.  Finally, results also demonstrate that social disconnectedness, social isolation, and perceived social stress mediate the association between diabetes and depressive symptoms.   The findings highlight the complexity within diabetes-mental health relationship and demonstrate the importance of understanding the biopsychosocial connection throughout the life course between marital biography, mental health, and diabetes.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The general purpose of this investigation was to study the differences between high-skill and intermediate-skill tennis players in gaze behaviors while performing tennis serve returns. Participants were asked to return 40 serves in the four different serve locations while wearing a mobile eye-tracker and their return performance was measured using a point system based on the ball’s first bounce that gave higher values to deep and angled returns. The study examined fixation’s onset and duration to four distinct locations: ball before bounce, the bounce area, ball after bounce, and impact zone. In addition, quiet-eye (QE) onset and duration were analyzed. Furthermore, the location of the racket-ball contact in relation to an egocentric frame of reference was calculated. Two-way and RM ANOVAs were used to test the hypotheses related to gaze behaviors. In addition, an analysis of coordinates and centroids were used to analyze egocentric gaze. Results indicated that high-skill players and shots classified as high score were characterized by fewer fixations of longer duration. Likewise, high-skill players displayed earlier QE onset and longer QE duration, in comparison to their less skilled counterparts. A comparison in QE between high-scores and low-scores shots revealed that the former were also characterized by an earlier QE onsets and longer QE. Pertaining to egocentric gaze, it was observed that high-skill players had a higher number of racket-ball contacts that occurred in central vision. Moreover, forehand and backhand racket-ball contacts were closer to the center in high-skill players, whereas intermediate skill players had racket-ball contacts further from the midpoint. Gaze behavior findings are discussed in the framework of the established relationship between QE periods, expertise, and performance. Egocentric gaze findings are discussed in relation to expertise-based differences in head stabilization and prediction of the ball-racket location. Limitations of the current study and suggestions for future studies are presented. To the author’s knowledge, this study is the first to analyze QE gaze behaviors in situ and the first to empirically test the role of egocentric gaze in tennis serve returns. Findings provide valuable insight into the relationship between gaze behaviors, QE periods, egocentric gaze, and expertise in a fast pace interceptive sports.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>A growing body of literature has begun to examine the transdiagnostic qualities of a variety of etiological and maintaining factors. Research suggests that intolerance of uncertainty (IU) is one such transdiagnostic factor that has been examined in various disorders including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), generalized anxiety disorder, as well as other internalizing pathology. A similar construct, intolerance of ambiguity (IA), has also been identified as a potential transdiagnostic factor. To date, IA has not been examined as extensively in clinical research, and while a theoretical distinction between the IA and IU has been made, it has yet to be examined in depth. Research suggests that uncertainty refers to future focused unknown elements while ambiguity relates to present oriented unknown. The present study sought to investigate this time-oriented distinction between IU and IA by examining the role of these constructs in checking behaviors. A student sample (N = 111) was recruited. Following completion of a questionnaire battery assessing OC symptoms, IU, and IA, participants completed a modified eye tracking task that had previously been associated with checking behaviors. This task included three periods; in the first period participants encoded the locations of letters in a grid, followed by the second period of a delay, culminating in a probe in which participants were asked whether or not a letter had appeared in the encoding grid (misleading vs. resolvable trials). This eye tracking task allowed for distinct blocks of trials, in which participants received the same amount of information in order to complete a trial. However, in the second block participants had the potential for future threat (a noise blast) if they responded to trials incorrectly. The difference in blocks provided a manipulation for the time-orientation of the unknown. Results indicated that in an unselected sample and when examined continuously, checking symptoms and intolerance of uncertainty were not significantly associated with most outcome measures from the eye tracking task. Higher intolerance of ambiguity was associated with more fixations and shorter duration of fixations during the encoding period. Limitations and future directions are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this research was to explore how a music therapy teaching for transfer intervention may impact inmate levels of executive function and perceived levels of stress. Sixty- four inmates were recruited to participate in the study. Participants were randomly assigned to either the experimental group or the control /wait list group. While the experimental group received music therapy, the control group received standard care during the five week intervention. Upon completion of data collection the control/wait list group received music therapy services. The experimental group received 10 ninety minute group singing music therapy sessions consisting of musical and therapeutic objectives. Musical objectives included vocal warm-ups, posture exercises, breath strengthening exercises, and learning a variety of choral pieces. Therapeutic objectives included lyric analysis, group discussion, movement, and transfer of learning through songwriting. A final concert was given for fellow inmates and staff.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Participant response to treatment was measured by Cohen’s Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function – Adult Version (BRIEF-A) self-report form. The BRIEF-A is further divided into two indexes labeled the: Behavior Rating Inventory (BRI) and the Metacognitive Index (MI). Together the BRI and the MI indexes indicate an individual’s level of executive functioning. The PSS is a ten-item self-report questionnaire measuring perceived stress within the last month.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Pre and post scale outcomes of the BRIEF-A indexes were compared utilizing a factorial ANOVA. Significant differences were found between and within groups indicating that the experimental group made greater improvements as a result of the intervention. Outcomes regarding perception of stress demonstrated no significant differences between groups, though both groups did exhibit lower levels of stress at posttest.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The present study examines a music therapy teaching for transfer protocol in the correctional environment on executive function and perceived levels of stress. Although research involving music therapy in the prison population is limited, outcomes of previous and current research demonstrate encouraging outcomes and warrant the need for continued exploration.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The advancement of technological innovations and global reforms for improving early warning systems as a key risk-reduction principle is transforming modern practices in risk communication. However, in the global context, this transformation varies greatly among regions, especially in less-resourced areas. The result is uneven preparedness that leads to unnecessary and major losses of life and infrastructure and property damage. How well governments in less-resourced regions are adequately prepared to achieve this technological and global homogenization is the vital question. Communication research on media innovations lacks examination of how well integrated disaster warning services are performing as critical components of public service. This dissertation takes these observations as its starting point and seeks to elaborate differential elements of governance that may influence capabilities of public agencies’ function in the communication of disaster warnings. One goal of this research is to fill the gap in disaster and communication scholarship and study the characteristic elements and uses of innovation by examining the accompanying challenges in less developed regions. Applying the concepts of governance and public service in studying disaster warning undermines the traditional bias that the challenges inherent in risk and crisis communication are primarily organizational.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The other more important purpose is to offer specific insights in three principal areas of innovations in the communication of warnings by: (a) understanding the dynamics of how media innovations occur in disaster communication practices; (b) elaborating the factors that promote or inhibit the development of such innovations; and (c) generating theoretical and practical propositions for improvements in public service delivery of disaster warnings through innovations. In the process of achieving these goals, a more specific understanding of the warning communication process among the various organizational units of public service systems in disaster management of the region studied was achieved.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	In this study, theoretical and methodological decisions were made on the basis of the central proposition guiding this evaluation: the communication of disaster warnings is a public service. Although global governance actors guide risk-reduction policy initiatives, they are enacted at the national and sub-national levels. The study explores the dissemination system of disaster warning in Pakistan, and Sindh. Its southern province is examined as a sub-national level and as a less-resourced, disaster-prone region. The insights from this case study can be applied to guide evaluative research further for similar regions where limited resources and capabilities to innovate warning systems exacerbate the situation and result in a substantial increase in losses. This study used a sequential mixed method evaluative research design. Initial findings were analyzed and integrated for holistic representation of findings. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The study draws conclusions from two key aspects in the uses and adoption of media innovation development in public service. The first is the variant approaches to innovations across each level of government. It found that, at the policy level, and considering the limited capabilities vis-à-vis the scope of transformation, the approach to innovation development is transitional. In view of the extent of discretionary authority and available support at the managerial level, the approach to adopting new technology is driven by each disaster experience. Depending on the expertise and resources available within the context of local agencies and communities, a hybrid form of innovation development is approached at the operational level that utilizes technology in the communication of warnings. Secondly, the aspect of a more balanced and unified policy design and the implementation of innovations. The study found that a risk-based and audience segmented approach in nationally defined policy imperative guides the transition from linear to a non-linear, or non-hierarchical, communication system; from traditional to networked communication modes; and from traditional (one-way) to advanced (two-way/interactive) communication tools in the communication of warnings. The study found that the policy and planning measures as well as managerial decision-making for innovation is geared only towards those risks that occur frequently in the region, such as floods and cyclones. For other risks, the managerial decision-makers develop new protocols and strategies to utilize new media and technology tools only when the risk is manifested and damages occur, such as the heat hazard in summer 2015. Importantly, the study observed that for emergency managers at the local district level, besides floods, and cyclones, the emerging risks also include civil conflicts, terrorist attacks, and other extreme natural hazards such as droughts, heat hazards, and flash floods for which no planning or new practices have been developed by the provincial authorities. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	 The study observed three major factors that affect both the approaches to develop an innovation and the kind of change it brings to the system. These are: cost, climate change, and contextual factors. The important implications of these findings suggest that while various cost variables and climate changes affect policy, plans, and subsequent practices adversely, the constantly advancing media and technological context of the region offers great opportunities to adopt potential media innovations for effective service delivery of disaster warnings. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The study also observed that role of both global and sub-national level actors in governance is significant in characterizing policy design and implementing specific plans for innovation in a warning system. While global actors have a key role in defining specific policy design and initiatives, regional actors at the sub-national level play a fundamental role in implementing plans. Given the meta-inferences, this dissertation proposes a scarcity-abundance framework as an extension of innovation scholarship in less-resourced regions for more even adoption of media innovation. It contends that context variables that characterize “abundance” can address the challenge of scarcity. The expanding outreach of media and telecommunication based industries in the region offer possibilities for government sector to counter the limitations towards successful innovations. For practical implications, policy adaptation to constantly changing media, climate-change, and technology for the viable adoption of media innovation can bridge the current gaps in innovation adoption.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Although prevalent, death by suicide is a statistically rare event – making it difficult to identify factors that can best predict behavioral risk and inform suicide risk assessment and management. Experimental tests of theories of suicidal behavior that delineate proximal dynamic and static risk factors are needed to better understand the causal mechanisms of suicidal behavior and prevent death by suicide. The interpersonal theory of suicide (Joiner, 2005; Van Orden et al., 2010) holds that lethal or near lethal suicide attempts occur as a result of the joint hopeless perceptions of thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness, and the acquired capability for suicide (i.e., fearlessness of death / increased pain tolerance). Although, cross-sectional and prospective studies provide evidence for the basic tenets of the theory (see Joiner, Ribeiro, &amp; Silva, 2012), no published experimental tests of the theory exist to date. Thus, the present study sought to develop and validate a novel laboratory manipulation of perceived burdensomeness and examine its interaction with acquired capability in predicting lethal approach behavior, as an initial and partial experimental test of the theory. 137 participants were randomized into an experimental burdensomeness or control condition that involved playing a virtual ball tossing game. We expected that the effect of laboratory-induced perceived burdensomeness would be particularly relevant when considered in the context of acquired capability. The interaction between condition and acquired capability (i.e., self-reported and pain tolerance) was examined using a behavioral approach task in which participants could choose to drink from a cyanide or sucrose labeled cup (i.e., a laboratory index of lethal approach behavior; Ribeiro, 2014). Results were partially in line with expectations. Future directions and implications are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Sexual violence is a major issue among students in college. In the past 20 years, researchers have made great strides contributing to the knowledge base of sexual violence and have begun discussing the myriad of outcomes and associations seen in victims/survivors of sexual violence. The present study, guided by stress and coping theory (Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984), adds to the growing body of research attempting to understand the scope of sexual violence in higher education by looking at sexual violence broadly and in a more nuanced way. Further, the present study examined the relationships among specific high-risk behaviors (heavy drinking, purging, suicide attempts, and deliberate self-injury) in a large, national sample of U.S. college men and women who have experienced different types of sexual violence (sexually touched without consent, attempted sexual penetration without consent, and sexual penetration without consent) in the last 12 months.  Additionally, the study explored whether sexual violence has a differential impact on male and female college students. Further, acknowledging the history of rape in the U.S. as intertwined with the oppression of black individuals, this study explored the role of race in the associations between sexual violence and high-risk behaviors. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A secondary analysis of National College Health Assessment data collected annually from 2011 to 2014, resulted in sample of 96,977 male and female college students. Four research questions (resulting in 32 hypotheses) were examined. A series of analyses (independent samples t-test, ANOVAs, and logistical regression) were conducted to test the hypotheses. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The results suggested that students in this sample who reported experiencing broad sexual violence were more likely to engage in high-risk behaviors (i.e., heavy drinking, purging, attempted suicide, and deliberate self-injury) when compared to those who did not report experiencing sexual violence, supporting all related hypotheses. Further, as the degree of sexual violence increased, so did the odds of engaging in three of the four high-risk behaviors (purging, attempted suicide, and deliberate self-injury). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The effect of gender was examined to determine whether men and women who experienced sexual violence had similar behavioral associations. It was hypothesized that being male would moderate the relationship between sexual violence and each high-risk behavior. These hypotheses were largely unsupported; however, there were a few instances where the more nuanced definition of sexual violence provided insight into male and female differences.  Men who experienced sexual violence were more likely to engage in purging behaviors, and men who experienced severe sexual violence were more likely to engage in suicide attempts. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Finally, the effect of race was examined to determine whether black individuals who experienced sexual violence were more likely to engage in high-risk behaviors than white individuals and other racial minorities. It was hypothesized that identifying as black would moderate the relationship between sexual violence and each high-risk behavior. These hypotheses were not supported, suggesting that being black did not significantly increase the odds of any high-risk behaviors compared to other minority and white individuals. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The present study adds to the body of literature of sexual violence on college campuses and provides further evidence that examining sexual violence in a more nuanced way has merit. Comparing the outcomes between sexual violence broadly and as the degrees of sexual violence provided insight into the relationships between each high-risk behavior and the impact that different types of sexual violence can have on an individual. Understanding that there are individual differences in reactions to diverse types of sexual violence has clinical implications. Victim advocates working with individuals immediately after and/or in the months to follow the sexual violence incident are in a particularly special position to assist victims in the coping process. This study demonstrated that generally, the likelihood of engaging in problematic coping increased as the severity of sexual violence increased. The study also provided valuable information regarding gender differences in associations between sexual violence and high-risk behaviors. To date, most of the research regarding male victims of sexual violence has a primary focus on documenting its existence. A strength of the present study is that it moved beyond reporting prevalence and demonstrated that male victims of sexual violence also have increased high-risk behaviors.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Acknowledging the problem of sexual violence in our society has been the first step. Understanding the specific behavioral associations of individuals who have experienced sexual violence is the second step. This is essential in order to help to effectively and responsibly inform victim advocates, health and mental health professionals, campus police, and Title IX investigators how to respond to victims of sexual violence given their unique needs and vulnerabilities.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Inundated by the blabber of talking heads, politicos, and advertisements? Ready to hear the voice of the Bard again? The speaker in the dissertation manuscript Falsetto asks the reader to turn down all the noise and trust him, a new prophet crying out in the desert (or crying out through your dessert, as it were). The speaker of these poems, then, steps into the tradition of poet-as-prophet, a tradition handed down from predecessors such as the Biblical writers, Edmund Spenser, William Blake, Walt Whitman, Allen Ginsberg, and others, as he guides readers through his search for meaning in relationships, music, and religion. But even as this speaker assumes that role, the manuscript and poems call into question that role as evident by the dissertation title, Falsetto, a beautiful but fake voice both confident and aware of its own construct. Indeed, the speaker is confronted with falseness and constructions in his search for meaning – the false idols, the falseness of internet relationships, and religion so true and so constructed it must be false.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The search for unity, structure, or large-scale coherence in post-tonal music has preoccupied music theorists for many decades. In this dissertation, I present a different approach that focuses on striking moments of juxtaposition in recent music through the lens of musical narrative. Carefully supported narrative interpretations can give us a way to unite analytical observations and interpret large-scale relationships between disparate musical events, and I explore one way that this can work in John Corigliano's Symphony No. 1 (1989), Alfred Schnittke's Concerto Grosso No. 1 (1977), and in Libby Larsen's downwind of roses in Maine (2009).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	In Corigliano's Symphony, I first explore the individual vignettes created by each of the first three movements, then consider the overall narrative trajectory of the symphony as a whole in my final discussion of the third movement and of the fourth movement. While the two inner movements fit into the paradigm associated with the ironic narrative archetype, the first and last movement do not fit this paradigm.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	In Schnittke's Concerto Grosso, I posit a narrative account of the piece that links the transformations of an expressive “sigh” motive with the narrative challenges of projecting a utopian past. I apply the concepts of denarration and disnarration (coined by literary theorists Richardson and Prince and extended to postmodern music by Reyland) both to clarify the relationships between contradictory musical events and to contextualize these events in my narrative account. Richardson’s “denarration” describes events whose inherent contradictions destabilize a story. Prince’s “disnarration” describes a fantasy or daydream that is clearly not part of the story’s plot. I initially interpret transformation of the sigh-neutralization motive as a denarration: a new narrative (in which functional harmonic syntax presides over the alternatives provided by microcanons and tone clusters) conflicts with the previously established narrative (neutralization and disruption of Baroque-style gestures). When an intensified version of the reversed motive appears in mm. 182–83 of the fifth movement, we might expect this gesture to likewise lead back to a functional cadence and the expressive world of nineteenth-century tonal harmony, but we instead hear the prepared piano playing over dense orchestral tone clusters. Ultimately, tonal closure is denied, and we come to realize that the possibility of musical expression through functional harmonic syntax was instead a disnarration.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Larsen's downwind of roses in Maine serves as an example of a non-narrative that encourages us to listen “in the moment.” Just as music can encourage a narrative interpretation in a variety of different ways, I first survey the possible ways that have been suggested for the trajectory of a “non-narrative,” then I use Larsen’s and Von Glahn’s descriptions of the work as points of departure for my analysis, in which a variety of conflicting trajectories defy interpretation as a traditional narrative.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This paper examines the Emerging Church Movement (ECM), a milieu of progressive evangelical groups focused upon the inclusion of postmodern ideas and concepts into evangelical Christian structures.  The argument in this paper is that, as a movement geared towards resistance to evangelicalism, the ECM is in fact working within a tradition of evangelical social organization.  In the first section, a historiographic review is conducted, focusing particularly on the way historians have used descriptions of conflict to describe and define evangelicalism in the twentieth century.  This reflection identifies previously unmarked connections between progressive evangelical organizations in the 1970s and 1980s with early ECM activities in the 1990s.  The second section of the paper offers a formal definition of the ECM, and works to highlight common ECM practices that have emerged as a result of the emphasis upon deconstruction and postmodernity.  From this perspective, the ECM is described as a milieu, in the tradition of sociologist Colin Campbell’s “cultic milieu,” on the basis of the presence of mysticism, seekership, and syncretism in ECM practice. The final section of the paper analyzes the ECM in conjunction with broader trends in American culture in the twenty-first century.  The effect the events of September 11, 2001 had on American culture are taken into account, and the connection between the growth of the ECM and the condition of being ‘post-9/11’ are considered.  Given the ECM’s stance on issues relating to authority, theological rigidity, and the politics of the Religious Right, the ECM, it is argued, was poised to find success, in terms of participation levels, in post-9/11 American culture.  In the conclusion, the decline of ECM activity is considered alongside the election of President Obama and the so-called “Rise of the Nones.”</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This work presents a comprehensive gamma-ray spectroscopic study to the higher spin structure of 31Si, including its excitation energies, spins, and branching ratios, along with the shell model discussions. 31Si was produced through the 18O(18O, alpha n) reaction at the beam energy of 25 MeV, which preferentially populates the higher spin states. The alpha particles from the reaction were detected in the Microball detector and the multiple gamma-ray coincidences were detected by GAMMASPHERE. The 31Si recoil energies and angles were event-by-event kinematically reconstructed by using the information of the energies and angles of the alpha evaporations detected by Microball. The kinematic correction led to a better Doppler correction and allowed us to discover 26 new states and 49 newly-observed gamma transitions in total. 15 gamma-decaying states above the neutron separation energy were identified, and two highest gamma-decaying states are at the energies 9323- and 9216-keV.  Spin and parity assignments are based on gamma-ray angular distribution analysis, DCO ratios analysis, branching ratio, and shell model predictions. For the positive-parity states predicted by the shell model calculations using USDA and WBP-a interactions agree well with the measured ones. But for the cross-shell states, the shell model calculations have RMS around 400-500 keV based on testing the lowest three measured negative parity states.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The increasing interest and gradual adaptation of a DC electrical distribution system by the US navy and smart grid designs has demanded a change to the structure of the traditional electrical distribution system. The development of the power electronics has led to faster-operating devices and the goal to achieve fault clearance in ~8 ms requires a need for an ultra-fast fault location and identification system. The traditional protection system used in AC power distribution is well-understood and applied over a radial distribution system but may lack sufficient response times for a constantly adapting, intelligent, looped distribution structure.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To assess the performance of the CFL system and to estimate the scaling of the CFL architecture, mathematical models are developed and are justified by supplementing with the actual testing results. This thesis presents a controller-hardware-in-the-loop (CHIL) testbed, interfacing RTDS with an industrial automation hardware, to demonstrate the methodology and to perform a comprehensive testing and analysis of a prototype of CFL system. The CFL system is based on ultrafast data communications and processing of sensor data to identify and determine the location of a fault in the medium voltage direct current (MVDC) shipboard power system (SPS). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The results of CHIL experiments demonstrate ultrafast fault detection and precise fault location operation of the CFL system on a fault current limited MVDC SPS for a line-to-line fault under different operating conditions of the SPS. Mathematical models describing the relationship like the frame size, decision time and the operating time of the CFL system were developed and verified with the results obtained from an implemented CFL system. Factors affecting the performance and scaling for a practical CFL implementations were identified and analyzed. The models and analysis in this thesis are supported by experimental validation.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Disorder has intriguing consequences for correlated electronic materials, which include several</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>families of high-temperature superconductors and resistive switching systems. In this dissertation,</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>we study the effects of impurities intertwined with correlations.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>First, we study impurity healing effects in models of strongly correlated superconductors. We</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>show that in general both the range and the amplitude of the spatial variations caused by nonmagnetic</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>impurities are significantly suppressed in the superconducting as well as in the normal states. We</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>explicitly quantify the weights of the local and the non-local responses to inhomogeneities and show</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>that the former are overwhelmingly dominant over the latter. We find that the local response is</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>characterized by a well-defined healing length scale, which is restricted to only a few lattice spacings</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>over a significant range of dopings in the vicinity of the Mott insulating state. We demonstrate that</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>this healing effect is ultimately due to the suppression of charge fluctuations induced by Mottness.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We also define and solve analytically a simplified yet accurate model of healing, within which we</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>obtain simple expressions for quantities of direct experimental relevance.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Second, we address the question of why strongly correlated d-wave superconductors, such as</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>the cuprates, prove to be surprisingly robust against the introduction of non-magnetic impurities.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We show that, very generally, both the pair-breaking and the normal state transport scattering</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>rates are significantly suppressed by strong correlations effects arising in the proximity to a Mott</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>insulating state. We also show that the correlation-renormalized scattering amplitude is generically</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>enhanced in the forward direction, an effect which was previously often ascribed to the specific</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>scattering by charged impurities outside the copper-oxide planes.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Finally, we provide the theoretical insights for resistive switching systems and show how impurities</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>and underlying correlations can play significant roles in practical devices. We report the striking</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>result of a connection between the resistive switching and shock wave formation, a classic topic</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>of non-linear dynamics. We argue that the profile of oxygen vacancies that migrate during the</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>commutation forms a shock wave that propagates through a highly resistive region of the device. We</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>validate the scenario by means of model simulations and experiments in a manganese-oxide based</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>memristor device and we extend our theory to the case of binary oxides. The shock wave scenario</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Biogenesis of eukaryotic ribosomes is a complicated process that needs to be highly coordinated and tightly regulated. The small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein particles (snoRNPs) mediate the first step of ribosome biogenesis by carrying out post-transcriptional modifications on the ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs). Maturation of eukaryotic snoRNPs requires a large network of biogenesis factors. The R2TP complex provides an essential scaffolding activity for maturation of the snoRNPs. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc) R2TP complex is comprised two AAA+ ATPases, Rvb1/2p, and two Hsp90 cochaperon proteins, Pih1p and Tah1p.  Though structures of the four components are largely known, how they assemble as an intact complex is completely unknown. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation focuses on biochemical and biophysical characterization of the R2TP complex and its client proteins using analytic ultracentrifugation, chemical crosslinking, and cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) methods. My studies show that the Pih1p-Tah1p heterodimer caps the Rvb1/2p heterohexameric ring through binding the flexible insertion domain of Rvb1p. Pih1p-Tah1p assembly is accompanied by remodeling of the insertion domain and enlargement of the Rvb1/2p ring, leading to an open platform for binding client proteins. My work further show that one of the client protein, Nop58p, is bound to the heteromeric R2TP complex prior to its assembly with the other box C/D snoRNP components. The known sensitivity of the insertion domain conformation to Rvb1/2p oligomerization and nucleotide binding offers a possible mechanism for the scaffolding and client releasing activity of the R2TP/Hsp90 system.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>After Felix Bloch’s observation in 1946 that nuclei inside an atom behave like a magnet, there were many people who got interested in this theory, which ultimately led to the discovery of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) technique. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), an extended application of NMR, has been used from then, at hospitals to scan human body parts. Since then, the development of MRI technique is being carried out in full swing. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>As we all know, there is a huge demand for better batteries in terms of performance, cost, safety and durability, which in turn has increased the research into energy storage devices for applications like Electronic gadgets, Electric Vehicles, Lightings, etc. Lithium Batteries, having one of the highest energy densities among other such batteries, is a better choice by default.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>              Until very recently, there was no technique except MRI [1], which could provide a 3 dimensional image of inside of batteries, without harming/opening them, which otherwise could destroy them. This thesis aims to explore a small avenue, into development of a coil and using it for imaging bulk metals and in that sense, presents the first images of Lithium Polymer Electrolyte Battery, using the MRI technique, to obtain information and provide insight about the Batteries as they cycle.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This study investigates the response of the extratropical jet to recurving North Atlantic tropical cyclones (TCs). A joint climatology of north Atlantic recurving TCs from 2007-2013 and Rossby waves on the extratropical jet is presented. Using a potential vorticity (PV) framework, Rossby wave breaking (RWB) and trough/ridge amplitude were quantified in order to evaluate jet characteristics downstream from recurving TCs. Additionally, the meridional PV gradient was evaluated to attempt to isolate a possible interaction mechanism. The extratropical jet is disturbed downstream of recurving TCs in the week following recurvature. RWB is made more likely in the week following recurvature, while suppression of RWB occurs at recurvature. Both ridge and trough amplitude increase downstream from recurving TCs in the week following recurvature, also supported by ridge amplification in composite PV anomalies. PV gradient modification remains unclear.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>People use heuristics, even though these produce wrong answers to problems. The present research tested an explanation for this seemingly irrational phenomenon. People use heuristics to preserve mental energy and avoid self-regulatory failures that occur when one’s mental resources become depleted (i.e., ego depletion). Three studies tested different hypotheses derived from this model. Study 1 found that people assigned to complete a depleting task (compared to an easy, non-depleting task) subsequently used more heuristics to solve word problems. Study 2 found that people assigned to use intuition (rather than controlled thinking) to solve the same set of problems were more likely to use heuristics to solve the problems. Crucially, using intuition also improved performance on a subsequent self-control task (the Stroop test). Study 3 found that people who merely anticipated a future effortful task (compared to anticipating no future task) were more likely to use heuristics to solve the problems currently in front of them. People high in trait self-control were especially likely to use heuristics in this apparently strategic manner. Surprisingly, however, people were seemingly unaware that they had adopted the strategy to use heuristics to save energy for the future. Overall, the results supported the idea that one reason for cognitive miserliness is to avoid ego depletion.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Given the expanding use of clinical registries for a spectrum of uses that range from quality improvement, clinical research, identification of the most effective treatments, post market surveillance of drugs and medical equipment, to the design of clinical trials for potential therapies, there is wide consensus that data quality undergirds the value of clinical registries for decision making (Davis, Nolan, Woodcock &amp; Estabrook, 1999). A growing body of IS research is aimed at studying data practices to support data curation and management in the milieu of big data, e-Health and e-Science initiatives. The products of such research enable comparisons of data practices across scientific disciplines and communities by characterizing the data and the data-related activities specific to a domain and context. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para> Through the lens of Stvilia, Gasser, Twidale, &amp; Smith’s (2007) generalizable Quality Assessment Framework, this exploratory case study examined the work organization and data practices of data curators for the American College of Cardiology (ACC)-National Cardiac Data Registry (NCDR) CathPCI Registry®, an observational, clinical outcomes registry and one of the largest, best established US cardiovascular registries. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Goals of this pragmatic, exploratory case study included: (1) extension of investigations conducted by Besiki Stvilia (2001, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2014, 2015), Hong Huang (2009, 2010) and Shuheng Wu (2014), through operationalization of Stvilia et al.’s (2007) Quality Assessment Framework, (2) exploration of the data curation practices and work organization in a clinical cardiac registry at the facility level, and (3) description of the CathPCI Registry activity system for post-dissertation development of a context-sensitive model of data quality criteria in a clinical cardiac registry, which ultimately, can facilitate performance outcomes assessment and clinical research to advance the quality of patient care.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The study supplies a depiction of typical CathPCI Registry data curation work that includes a conceptualization of the local Registry data quality structure. Conceptualization of data quality structure entails a typology of Registry data quality problems and corresponding quality assurance actions. The findings are embodied in a description of data work organization of the CathPCI Registry, including: roles of human, hospital-based data curators for the Registry; their data curation work practices; division of labor within the community of practice; types and sources of data quality problems encountered in curators’ use of the CathPCI Registry; some of the tools and strategies data curators use to manage data and to detect and resolve data quality problems; rules governing data curation work; and data curators’ perceptions about Registry data quality.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The increase of electric power demand for advanced weapons and combat systems in all-electric ships (AES) including electrical propulsions, electromagnetic rail-guns, lasers, radars, and sensors relies on future advanced integrated power systems. The U.S. Navy has predicted that future integrated shipboard power systems will be DC power distribution systems (DC microgrids). To achieve the system’s objectives or missions, power flows among distributed resources (DR) and load devices in these systems have to be properly regulated.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Therefore, the main objective of this dissertation is to control the power flows among distributed devices in DC microgrids. Control of the power flows in DC microgrids involves controlling the current sharing among DR and stabilizing the DC bus voltage. To fulfill these control objectives, voltage droop control has been utilized. However, there is a tradeoff between current sharing among DR and DC bus voltage stability when droop control is used in DC microgrids, as current sharing approaches set points, bus voltage deviation increases. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Previous studies have suggested using secondary control utilizing linear controllers to overcome the drawbacks of droop control. However, linear control design depends on an accurate model for systems. In many other applications, where the parameters of systems are known, the linear control techniques are superior. Nevertheless, the derivation of such an accurate model is challenging in DC microgrids because the noise and disturbances caused by the coupling between sources, loads, and switches in microgrids are under-represented. This under-representation makes linear modelling and control insufficient. Hence, the adaptive control is a worthy choice because of its ability to deal with the model uncertainty.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The robust adaptive control method developed and utilized in the Dissertation is based on model reference adaptive control (MRAC) because it provides DC microgrids the ability to deal with the uncertainty and ensures the system's stability. However, the main problem of the conventional adaptive method is that the high-speed adaptation results in a high oscillation of the transient response in adaptive systems. The limitations in the conventional method limit itself from applications. Thus, a new class of adaptive method based on the closed-loop reference models (CRM) has been suggested in literature to minimize the oscillatory effect of the conventional method, specifically for aircraft systems. Yet, the CRM with fixed adaptation gain still finds challenges in dealing with different operating points and is sensitive to noise and disturbance. Therefore, this research proposes a modified CRM for a robust response in the system. The first modification made is the integration of the normalization technique and parameters projection algorithm in the CRM. The next modification made is scheduling the adaptation gain for various operating points in the system. These modifications are proved to be stable following Lyapunov.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Finally, the application of the developed robust adaptive method in a distributed control framework to adjust the droop characteristics to satisfy both current sharing and DC bus voltage stability criteria in DC microgrids is proposed and analyzed. Simulation results and experimental validation on a 400 VDC microgrid show that the adaptive method precisely shares current between two DR and maintains the nominal bus voltage in various scenarios of islanded mode and grid-connected mode.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Taking up recent arguments associated with New Lyric Studies, contemporary genre theory, and historical poetics, this dissertation examines the trajectory of the dramatic element in twentieth-century poetry and its specific practice in the verse drama. Particularly, it argues that the persistent interest among twentieth-century poets in composing verse drama arises out of a resistance to what has been called the lyricization of poetry. By investigating the dramas of poets as diverse as Sadakichi Hartmann, T. S. Eliot, Gertrude Stein, Djuna Barnes, Robert Lowell, and Derek Walcott, among others, this study reconsiders poets’ engagements with the theater as endeavors vital to poetic, and not merely theatrical history. Through an examination of the poetic dramas of Hartmann and Eliot, I argue that the ways modernist poets deploy ritual are not merely anthropological, disinterested acts, but part of a larger interest in creating liturgical, actionable works of poetry, reforming our ideas of modernist interest in religious practices and communal experiences of poetry. Further, I argue that the verse dramas of Stein and Barnes help us to re-frame narratives of poetic subjectivity and repudiate the purported “death of tragedy” in a lyric age, developing a more full picture of poetry’s ability to engage with and present traumatic experience. In the final chapter, I demonstrate by looking to the verse dramas of Lowell and Walcott the ways that the verse drama challenges the lyric’s perceived a-historical status, finding in the theater a place for historical and political engagement. Thus, this dissertation addresses a current scholarly gap in the study of twentieth-century poetry by examining an oft-overlooked, yet vital form created during an era associated with the dominance of the lyric, and argues that by including verse dramas in contemporary accounts of poetry, we find a more fully-formed perspective of twentieth-century poetics and, particularly, the possibilities of poetic practice beyond the boundaries of the lyric.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Nesting distributions of animals vary from isolated individuals to large colonies of breeding individuals and they can be influenced by numerous factors, including environmental conditions, relatedness and social interactions. Parrots are one of the most threatened orders of birds. Factors that influence their nesting success in natural habitat have been the focus of previous research. However, these past studies operated in systems limited in nest sites, which may also have influenced population dynamics.  In contrast, the Bahama Parrot nests underground in abundant limestone solution cavities in the karst pine forest of Abaco Island, The Bahamas.  This situation allows exploration of environmental and social factors that may influence nest success and breeding productivity without the limitation of the availability of nesting site resources. The objective of this study is to investigate the causes and consequences of semi-colonial nesting aggregations in the Bahama Parrot, addressing the influence of local habitat, relatedness of nesting neighbors, social behavior, and success of neighboring nests. The results of this information can be used in the management of habitat and parrot populations on Abaco Island, The Bahamas.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The research was carried out on Great Abaco Island during the parrot breeding season (April - September) in 2010 – 2013.  Nests were found by traversing logging roads. A number of ecological features were measured around nesting cavities and unused limestone cavities with the same dimensions as parrot cavities to identify favored characteristics. Nearest neighbors were identified for a subset of nests.  Behavioral observations included time budgets of vocalization and movement to and from nests at focal and comparison nests (nearest neighbors and more distant nests) to determine if parrots were synchronizing behavior with close-nesting individuals. Predator simulations were conducted to elicit defense responses from focal and nearest neighbor nesting pairs. Using DNA collected from adults and chicks, I assessed whether spatially aggregated nests reflected kin clusters. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Bahama Parrots on Abaco were distributed in aggregated spatial patterns in the nesting area. They nested in cavities found in more open areas. One contributing factor for the nest distribution was the uneven distribution of limestone cavities.  Greater numbers of nests were found in areas with higher cavity concentrations. However, areas with high cavity concentrations but no parrot nests indicated that additional factors also were involved in concentrating nests in an area.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Relatedness did not influence the aggregated nesting pattern. Close nesting neighbors were not more closely related than nesting individuals at other nest sites.  No evidence of extra pair paternity was found within the small sample of nests that had full families sampled. However, genotypes of chicks raised in the same cavity in different years did provide support for the general belief that monogamous parrot pairs often reused the same nesting cavities over multiple years.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Distances between neighbors had no effect on vocal synchrony. When a predator was introduced to a nest, the vocal response by the nesting pair and the nearest neighbor nesting pair increased, however no other behaviors provided nest defense.  An effective defense against feral cats as predators was the predator control program carried out by the Bahamas National Trust. Nest success was higher in years with the predator control program underway. I did detect a relationships between nest success at a focal nest and its neighbor.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Finally, I reviewed the taxonomic status of the Cuban parrot (Amazona leucocephala) complex. My review suggested that the two Bahama populations of the Cuban parrot (Amazona leucocephala bahamensis) should be classified as separate species (Amazona abaconensis and Amazona inaguanensis) and that the two Cuban populations should be a single subspecies (Amazona leucocephala leucocephala). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>These parrots use limestone cavities in the ground in open pine woodland as nest sites, and areas with higher densities of these cavities are used to a greater extent. As populations are expected to increase due to the success of a predator control program, sites with high cavity density are expected to be prime habitat for new nesting individuals. I therefore recommend the continuation of the prescribed burning to maintain the open understory that these parrots select.  Furthermore, given the effectiveness of a current feral cat removal program in increasing nesting success, I recommend that predator control continue.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Suicide and self-injury are prominent issues among college students (Pristorello, Fruzzeetti, MacLane, Gallop, &amp; Iverson, 2012).  This manuscript seeks to explore the primary research question: Does mindfulness serve as a moderating factor for the relationship between recent self-injury and recent suicide attempts among college students?  Data collected in 2011 by the National Research Consortium of Counseling Centers in Higher Education was used for the current study.  The 2011 study yielded a sample of 26,292 college students from 75 different 4-year universities across the United States.  Participants completed a 79-item survey, which included the Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised (CAMS-R), demographic variables, and items related to suicide-related behaviors.  Multi-level modeling was utilized to explore the main research question, using mindfulness, self-injury, and demographic variables on the individual level, and participants’ schools on the second level of the model to account for any clustering of the data.  Results indicate that self-injury (X2 = 2167.26, p &lt;.001) and mindfulness (F = 146.19, p &lt;.001) are significantly related to suicide attempts, in the positive and negative direction, respectively.  As well, mindfulness significantly moderated the interaction between self-injury and suicide attempt(s) (β = .063, p =.034).  This manuscript suggests that mindfulness may be a beneficial element of prevention efforts for suicide, especially among those who have self-injured in the past.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Pine Barrens treefrog (Hyla andersonii) is restricted to three isolated (disjunct) regions in the eastern United States: New Jersey, North and South Carolina, and the Florida panhandle and southern Alabama. It is a seepage bog specialist and a species of conservation concern in each state in which it occurs. Previous work showed some differentiation among the three regions; however, these studies had small sample sizes, measured few variables, and/or did not include all three regions. Moreover, the only genetic study of H. andersonii, using allozyme data, did not resolve clear relationships among the three regions. Conservation management of this species requires a clearer understanding of how populations in these three regions may differ from one another and how populations within regions are structured.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To extend previous work on this species, I measured differentiation among regions using morphometric, acoustic signal, ecological, and genetic data. I developed 15 microsatellite markers and used targeted sequence capture to collect large-scale nuclear and mitochondrial genomic data to test models of its evolutionary history. It is hypothesized that the species shifted southward during the last glacial maximum (LGM) into one or more refugia, then expanded northward as the glaciers receded. Overall I find a strikingly concordant pattern in which the first axis of variation for each of the data types distinguishes populations along a latitudinal and longitudinal gradient and the second axis distinguishes the set of populations occurring in the Carolinas (CL) from those occurring in the New Jersey (NJ) and Alabama/Florida (AF) regions. I know of no comparable data set that displays such concordance among different types of data across so large a geographic range. The overlap in trait values (i.e. exchangeability) between neighboring regions, however, is substantial in all types of data, except genetic, which supports continued consideration of this taxon as a single species. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Using a phylogenetic framework with large-scale genomic data, I found that AF forms a single clade in both the nuclear and mitochondrial trees and that AF is sister to the rest of the Atlantic clade (CL, NJ). Climate models suggest that the distribution of the species has been repeatedly disjunct since at least the last interglacial, but probably even earlier given the genetic divergence time estimates. All three regions also showed little overlap in broad-scale (climate) environmental data, although niche modeling using climate data alone closely matched the known distribution. Fine-scale environmental data (abiotic and biotic) show greater overlap between CL and AF, with some divergence from NJ. I found some association of genetic and morphometric measures with ecological values, mostly for the broad-scale data. Projections for 2050 suggest habitat suitability will be greatly reduced in CL and AF, with only a small area of NJ available.  Finally, I found very different patterns of population genetic structure within each region. Little evidence for isolation by distance was found for all regions, suggesting isolation via environment or other factors may be important for connectivity between populations. The results of my research can be applied to the conservation and management of H. andersonii because it is the most comprehensive study of the species using both an ecological and evolutionary perspective across different temporal and spatial scales.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>An atmospheric model is coupled to a sea surface temperature algorithm that calculates the diurnal variability in order to understand the responses to near surface winds and boundary layer temperature, pressure, and moisture in the north Central Atlantic. 7-day case study simulations with diurnally varying sea surface temperatures and daily-constant sea surface temperatures are compared. With the inclusion of diurnal heating during the day, the local heat fluxes are increased and the surface pressure decreases. The extent of the surface-induced heating to the atmosphere is not necessarily restricted to the boundary layer depending on the atmospheric stability and the interaction with synoptic scale weather. The diurnal variations in sea surface temperature also induce positive and negative mean wind speed anomalies on the order of 0.5 m/s over the 7-day period. Hourly changes to the wind field, however, can exceed 3 m/s particularly where modifications to the regional weather occur. A comparison to geostationary data show that the sea surface temperature algorithm overestimates the warming on average, but this overestimation could be exaggerated from several factors including smoothing of the geostationary data.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We examine the spatial variability and data distribution of the wind field anomalies in response to the diurnal sea surface temperature gradients at hourly and daily time scales. The changes to the wind field on the first day of diurnal warming exhibit a linear, but temporally lagged response to the direction in which flow crosses the diurnal warming gradient. This trend was also observed on day 2, but does not exist for subsequent days after. It is thought that the larger amplitude responses of interaction with the synoptic scale (secondary feedbacks) dominate the distribution for areas in which we expect wind-sea surface temperature coupling.  The surface pressure gradient and Coriolis are deemed the dominant forcing processes in the model that generate the initial wind-diurnal sea surface temperature coupling response on the first day of the simulation. In order to understand the importance of interactive feedbacks of the wind and the diurnal cycle of sea surface temperatures, we compared the duration and amplitude of the diurnal warming produced in a one-way coupled simulation. The one-way coupled simulation allows the diurnal variations in sea surface temperature to influence the surface fluxes at the concurrent time step, but uses winds from a non-diurnally modified SST to calculate the diurnal warming of the sea surface temperature. As compared to two-way coupled simulations, the mean amplitude of the diurnal warming is larger and the duration is longer. This is one way to demonstrate that the integrated hourly feedbacks to the diurnal variability of sea surface temperature are important in producing an accurate duration and amplitude of diurnal heating over the day.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Russian Civil War is an incredibly complex topic that is frequently oversimplified to a Red vs White framework, where the Bolshevik forces face a perceived monolithic ‘White’ opposition. While this conceptualization can be useful, the reality is much more complex; various factions, some controlling far-flung territories or even no territory, formed and broke alliances with each other and fought furiously to achieve their ends. The ‘White’ forces are frequently presented as an amalgamation of different factions and armies that had differing, sometimes opposing, views. The typical view of the Russian civil war is clearly oversimplified, but recent scholarship attempting to reassess the Civil War has brought new insight and understanding to the conflict. In particular, the designation of certain White elements as ‘warlords’ has become more common. The warlord argument provides an alternative to the older, more traditional view of monolithic ‘White’ against ‘Red’ by showing that not all White commanders fought for the same ends, and many were motivated by selfish desires or goals. Similarly, since warlords tend not to work well together, it helps explain the disunity of the White movement. The warlord paradigm has its flaws, namely that the warlords of the Civil War were not common; in fact, the only commanders which truly qualified for the moniker were in the Far East, and barely participated in the Civil War. The warlord framework proves to be quite useless when applied to individual commanders of the White movement, and therefore a better means of reclassification is required. To that end, the White forces, after careful assessment of whether they are warlords, should instead be classified by new criteria. The result is a new dichotomy within the White movement: Western Whites and Eastern Whites. The dichotomy offered is based on orientation, rather than geography. Western White forces were focused on capturing Western Russia, specifically Moscow and Petrograd, while the Eastern Whites were more interested in consolidating their own power base in the Far East. The Western and Eastern White forces were nominally allies and anti-Bolshevik, but practically had very different goals and worked to achieve different ends. The Western Whites were the remnants of the Tsarist military elites, fighting to restore Russia and defeat Bolshevism, while the Eastern Whites were warlords in the employ of foreign powers primarily concerned with their own selfish ends. The main thesis of this work is that the warlord paradigm does not apply to most White commanders, and should be abandoned in favor of a broader Western/Eastern dichotomy.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Steven Conn recently argued that as museums change from warehouses of artifacts focused on public instruction to a different model of education by engagement, their emphasis on objects will become less necessary.  This dissertation directly engages with that idea and argues that for many local museums objects mean as much as they ever did, maybe even more.  My idea, the “currency of authenticity,” builds on two strands of scholarship.  One that traces the increasing commodification of history.  The other that local museums are just as worthy of study as national institutions.  Specifically, I analyze how smaller museums use material culture to convince their audience that their textual narrative and/or oral interpretation is just as truthful as its objects.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Using institutional records, newspapers, and oral histories, this dissertation examines how the Stephen Foster Museum and Florida Folk Festival, both in White Springs, Florida, and the Georgia Museum of Agriculture and Historic Village portray aspects of Southern culture.  Each of these places emphasizes different qualities, objects, or ideas as they construct their own brand of authenticity.  Simultaneously, these places also all emphasize their own kind of Southern identity, unique to their regions and the people they want to represent.  Their exhibits demonstrate that Southern heritage is vast, complex, and more diverse than some people understand.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The simulation and study of fluid properties and dynamics in a microgravity environment on the Earth’s surface is of great interest due to the high costs associated with conducting research in space. Cryogenic fluids like liquid helium, hydrogen, and oxygen have numerous applications in space travel and research. An understanding of their sloshing motion and general dynamics in microgravity is extremely valuable for maintaining proper orientation of spacecraft and proper cooling. The ability to study fluids with no surfaces in contact with their container allows greater flexibility in the study such fluid dynamics, and enables deeper research into quantum turbulence to be conducted. Simulating this microgravity environment on the earth is highly desirable, and may be achieved by using drop towers, acoustic levitation, laser levitation, zero-g planes, and superconducting magnets. The stable magnetic levitation of diamagnetic fluids against the pull of gravity on the earth’s surface may be obtained by generating a strong magnetic field and specific magnetic field gradient. Stability of a levitated liquid drop requires a potential minimum to hold the drop along a central axis, with a field magnitude increasing with increasing radial displacement. The NHMFL cryogenics lab obtained a unique cryostat containing such a magnet, which was used for hydrogen and helium levitation, but which was in disrepair. This cryogenic facility arrived with dozens of leaks and no documentation explaining its structure, functions, or the procedures necessary to use it experimentally. The purpose of this thesis work has been to develop a complete understanding of this cryostat’s structures and functions, as well as the refinement of procedures to properly cool it down and safely operate its magnet. A user manual has been produced to fully document the experimental setup and all necessary procedures. Because this cryostat was received in such bad condition, much time was also committed to the identification of all its mechanical failures, vacuum and gas leaks, and their full repair. Additionally, all supporting pumping systems and gas handling systems were designed, constructed, and documented to facilitate proper and safe operation. Documenting and developing this cryogenic system required extensive designs for external controls and modifications to the system as a whole.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In structural equation modeling (SEM), researchers use the model chi-square statistic and model-fit indexes to evaluate model-data fit. Root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), comparative fit index (CFI), and Tucker-Lewis index (TLI) are widely applied model-fit indexes.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>When data are ordered and categorical, the most popular estimator is the diagonally weighted least squares (DWLS) estimator. Robust corrections have been proposed to adjust the uncorrected chi-square statistic from DWLS so that its first and second order moments are in alignment with the target central chi-square distribution under correctly specified models. DWLS with such a correction is called the mean- and variance-adjusted weighted least squares (WLSMV) estimator. An alternative to WLSMV is the mean-and variance-adjusted unweighted least squares (ULSMV) estimator, which has been shown to perform as well as, or slightly better than WLSMV.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Because the chi-square statistic is corrected, the chi-square-based RMSEA, CFI, and TLI are thus also corrected by replacing the uncorrected chi-square statistic with the robust chi-square statistic. The robust model fit indexes calculated in such a way are named as the population-corrected robust (PR) model fit indexes following Brosseau-Liard, Savalei, and Li (2012). The PR model fit indexes are currently reported in almost every application when WLSMV or ULSMV is used. Nevertheless, previous studies have found the PR model fit indexes from WLSMV are sensitive to several factors such as sample sizes, model sizes, and thresholds for categorization.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The first focus of this dissertation is on the dependency of model fit indexes on the thresholds for ordered categorical data. Because the weight matrix in the WLSMV fit function and the correction factors for both WLSMV and ULSMV include the asymptotic variances of thresholds and polychoric correlations, the model fit indexes are very likely to depend on the thresholds. The dependency of model fit indexes on the thresholds is not a desirable property, because when the misspecification lies in the factor structures (e.g., cross loadings are ignored or two factors are considered as a single factor), model fit indexes should reflect such misspecification rather than the threshold values.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>As alternatives to the PR model fit indexes, Brosseau-Liard et al. (2012), Brosseau-Liard and Savalei (2014), and Li and Bentler (2006) proposed the sample-corrected robust (SR) model fit indexes. The PR fit indexes are found to converge to distorted asymptotic values, but the SR fit indexes converge to their definitions asymptotically. However, the SR model fit indexes were proposed for continuous data, and have been neither investigated nor implemented in SEM software when WLSMV and ULSMV are applied.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation thus investigates the PR and SR model fit indexes for WLSMV and ULSMV. The first part of the simulation study examines the dependency of the model fit indexes on the thresholds when the model misspecification results from omitting cross-loadings or collapsing factors in confirmatory factor analysis. The study is conducted on extremely large computer-generated datasets in order to approximate the asymptotic values of model fit indexes. The results find that only the SR fit indexes from ULSMV are independent of the population threshold values, given the other design factors. The PR fit indexes from ULSMV, and the PR and SR fit indexes from WLSMV are influenced by thresholds, especially when data are binary and the hypothesized model is greatly misspecified.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The second part of the simulation varies the sample sizes from 100 to 1000 to investigate whether the SR fit indexes under finite samples are more accurate estimates of the defined values of RMSEA, CFI, and TLI, compared with the uncorrected model fit indexes without robust correction and the PR fit indexes. Results show that the SR fit indexes are the more accurate in general. However, when the thresholds are different across items, data are binary, and sample size is less than 500, all versions of these indexes can be very inaccurate. In such situations, larger sample sizes are needed.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In addition, the conventional cutoffs developed from continuous data with maximum likelihood (e.g., RMSEA &lt; .06, CFI &gt; .95, and TLI &gt; .95; Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999) have been applied to WLSMV and ULSMV regardless of the arguments against such a practice (e.g., Marsh, Hau, &amp; Wen, 2004). For comparison purposes, this dissertation reports the RMSEA, CFI, and TLI based on continuous data using maximum likelihood before the variables are categorized to create ordered categorical data. Results show that the model fit indexes from maximum likelihood are very different from those from WLSMV and ULSMV, suggesting that the conventional rules should not be applied to WLSMV and ULSMV.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Establishing accurate processing models to characterize and study the suspension preparation for manufacturing carbon nanotube (CNT) thin films or buckypaper (BP) is a challenging task. Acquiring a fundamental understanding of quantifiable dispersion quality and time-dependent dispersion quality changes during and after the dispersion processes of CNT suspensions are critical for many suspension-based CNT manufacturing processes. In this research, a novel in-line dispersion quality monitoring system was developed. The monitoring was carried out using an integration of dynamic light scattering (DLS) and UV-Vis spectroscopy of a continuous flow during the CNT sonication dispersion process. This system can provide real-time monitoring of the quality of the suspension during the dispersion process and the stability of the suspension at post-dispersion stage. Monitoring the actual particle-size distribution can help determine the effective dispersion time and post-dispersion shelf life for potential use in process control and optimizing for scale-up manufacturing processes. We studied different CNT suspension systems, including MWNTs, SWNTs, graphene nanoplates, and their mixtures. For longer MWNTs with smaller diameters, the dispersion process achieved a steady agglomerate size around 100 nm with 40 minutes of sonication; for shorter and larger diameter MWNTs, due to their more packed agglomerate density, it took 60 minutes of sonication to reach the 100 nm agglomerate size. At the post-dispersion stage, the stability of CNT suspension showed nonlinear behavior due to the thermodynamic activity of CNT agglomerates. Under refrigerated storage condition, the increase of agglomerate size was reduced and the process of the CNT re-aggregation was prolonged by more than five times of the shelf life compared to the samples stored under room temperature. The study of dispersion of the carbon nanomaterial mixtures showed that MWNTs had helped the dispersion of SWNTs and graphene nanoplates throughout the sonication process to achieve a smaller agglomerate size after 75 minutes sonication. Quantitative quality baselines of the individual nanomaterials were established and used for controlling and optimizing the dispersion process and evaluating suspension stability. The dispersion mechanisms of different materials can be compared through the monitoring system.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The dissertation presents the mathematical formulation, experimental validation, and application of a volume element model (VEM) devised for modeling, simulation, and optimization of energy systems in their early design stages. The proposed model combines existing modeling techniques and experimental adjustment to formulate a reduced-order model, while retaining sufficient accuracy to serve as a practical system-level design analysis and optimization tool. In the VEM, the physical domain under consideration is discretized in space using lumped hexahedral elements (i.e., volume elements), and the governing equations for the variable of interest are applied to each element to quantify diverse types of flows that cross it. Subsequently, a system of algebraic and ordinary differential equations is solved with respect to time and scalar (e.g., temperature, relative humidity, etc.) fields are obtained in both spatial and temporal domains. The VEM is capable of capturing and predicting dynamic physical behaviors in the entire system domain (i.e., at system level), including mutual interactions among system constituents, as well as with their respective surroundings and cooling systems, if any. The VEM is also generalizable; that is, the model can be easily adapted to simulate and optimize diverse systems of different scales and complexity and attain numerical convergence with sufficient accuracy. Both the capability and generalizability of the VEM are demonstrated in the dissertation via thermal modeling and simulation of an Off-Grid Zero Emissions Building, an all-electric ship, and a vapor compression refrigeration (VCR) system. Furthermore, the potential of the VEM as an optimization tool is presented through the integrative thermodynamic optimization of a VCR system, whose results are used to evaluate the trade-offs between various objective functions, namely, coefficient of performance, second law efficiency, pull-down time, and refrigerated space temperature, in both transient and steady-state operations.</DISS_para>

      <DISS_content>
         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This qualitative study, which examines media representation issues of China’s Zhuang people and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous region, is based on a content analysis of the People’s Daily, the official media organ of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Using the Zhuang and Guangxi as a case study, I investigate CCP strategies of social control within the People’s Daily, advancing scholarship on the authoritarian utilization of media and minority-majority relations.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>My study features primary research as I provide quantitative data to support my qualitative analysis, concluding that the CCP, within the People’s Daily, strategically prescribes correct ideology and conduct through 1) distortion of reality through projections of power, and disproportionate representation of certain topical categories within the People’s Daily (Chapter Five), 2) distraction from sensitive topics through the displacement, or redirection, of readership’s attention (Chapter Five), and 3) prescription and modeling of correct behavior (Chapter Six). These strategies, I argue, are similar to the Chinese dynastic official texts used to instruct imperial women on how to behave. I not demonstrate in my study the CCP’s strategies in using media to shape thought and maintain social control over the Zhuang and Guangxi, but also explore Zhuang responses to the CCP’s disseminated messages (Chapter Seven). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>For the content analysis which serves as the basis of my study, I, along with statisticians at Florida State University’s Survey Research Laboratory, categorized all articles published in the People’s Daily from 1990-2015 with the keyword Zhuangzu (Zhuang nationality) into nineteen categories. The five largest were Local Politics and Policy, Development, Culture, Elections, and Interactions with Foreigners. Each category is illustrated in a figure which shows the shifting focuses of the CCP over time. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Through my original research, using the data retrieved from the People’s Daily, I construct a periodization in representation of the Zhuang and Guangxi, which I have chosen to organize by phases: “Phase One: Post-Tiananmen Restructuring (1990-1992),” “Phase Two: Deng’s Economic Developments Take Root and Bear Fruit (1992-2001),” “Phase Three: New Millennium, New Problems (1999-2006),” and “Phase Four: China’s Global Debut (2005-2015).” With this periodization, I provide a framework by which to understand twenty-five years of political and economic developments for the Zhuang and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, as I explore the dynamics of the CCP’s use of the People’s Daily for social control.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Then, I analyze in depth two phenomena found within the People’s Daily which apply specifically to the Zhuang people. The first is my comparative study between dynastic and modern texts, in which I relate Chinese imperial strategies of control over women and the CCP strategies of control over the Zhuang. I draw parallels between the use of exemplary citizens in official texts to model appropriate behavior, observing how dynastic women and modern Zhuang, each periphery peoples, were ‘managed’ and represented in similar ways by their respective central authorities. Finally, I further investigate the use of tourism as economic development, and culture as a commodity, at the urging of the CCP, among the Zhuang. After the previous chapters in which I focus heavily on the unidirectional dissemination of state messages, within this chapter, I illustrate the Zhuang expression of ethnic identity and agency in the context of ethno-tourism, while drawing comparisons with present day Native Americans within the United States, and their experiences at historic reconstruction sites. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The figures I provide, along with the periodization in which I interpret these figures, will prove to be a valuable resource for historians, anthropologists, and social scientists alike, advancing scholarship on the Zhuang as well as the CCP use of strategies within the People’s Daily as a mechanism of social control. My comparative analysis of the use of “Exemplary People” in dynastic and present day texts is an extension of this periodization, in that it offers a deeper analysis of the People’s Daily and its functions, while demonstrating the continuity of the Chinese central government’s strategy of modeling correct behavior within state-sanctioned texts. My exploration of ethno-tourism offers a look at the reception of government-issued media, as I shift my focus away from the source of the unidirectional messages, analyzing instead the responses of the supposedly passive recipients. Ultimately, my study is one of intersecting discourses and narratives as the Chinese state, and the society which it endeavors to mold by use of the media, together negotiate a mutual future.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This dissertation presents findings from a study of knowledge sharing and gaining via cameraphone photography by women who have undergone cesarean sections. Informed by authoritative knowledge, cameraphone photography, and a photo elicitation method known as photovoice, this research sought to understand how cameraphone photography allowed participants to provide a visual context through which empowering discussions about birth and the aftermath of their cesarean births could be explored. To discuss the relationship between authoritative knowledge and cameraphone photography, a theoretical model was created to highlight the ways knowledge is shared via cameraphones (Figure 1).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This model was created to illustrate the relationship between authoritative knowledge and cameraphone photography within the context of cesarean births in the U.S. Thirty adult women in the United States were recruited for participation in this study, all of whom had one or more children via cesarean birth. Participants were trained in the purpose of the study, the ethical decisions photographers make, and photographic techniques, and were given themes to address relating to knowledge sharing and gaining via their cesarean birth experiences. Analysis of these data indicates using cameraphone photography allowed participants to share details, and the knowledge they gained, of their cesarean births with other mothers who had also undergone cesarean deliveries. Further research is indicated, to continue to refine the Authoritative Knowledge Model of Cesarean Births, and determine its applicability to topics beyond birth.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Almonds are the number one tree nut produced in the U.S. and the number one consumed tree nut worldwide. Despite their economic, nutritional, and consumer value, almonds are among the top foods responsible for eliciting allergies in sensitive individuals. Amandin is the major storage protein and allergen in almond, accounting for roughly 70% of the total soluble protein content. Almonds are frequently subjected to heat processing prior to consumption which may potentially alter the structure and allergenic properties of amandin. The objective of this study was to determine how heat treatment influences the structure and immunoreactivity of amandin in thermally processed almond seeds. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Whole Nonpareil almond seeds were subjected to autoclaving (121°C, 15 psi, for 15 and 30 min), blanching (94°C for 5 and 10 min), frying (191°C for 1 min), microwaving (1000 W for 1 min and 500 W for 3 min), and roasting (140 and 160°C for 30 min each; and 168 and 177°C for 12 min each). Processed seeds were ground and amandin was isolated from defatted almond flour using cryoprecipitation at 4°C. Soluble protein content was determined by the Bradford and Lowry methods. Immunoreactivity was assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Western blot, and dot blot using two different murine monoclonal anti-amandin detection antibodies, 4C10 and 4F10. Structural changes were assessed using ultraviolet (UV) absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. Results are reported as mean ± SEM and one-way ANOVA was performed to compare means for difference. Post hoc analysis was performed using Fisher’s least significant difference at p ≤ 0.05.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>ELISA immunoreactivity was assessed by the ratio (R) = signal at 50% maximum signal of processed sample/signal at 50% maximum signal of unprocessed control. The range of R values for the tested processed samples were 0.36 ± 0.02 to 1.54 ± 0.10* for 4C10 (LSD=0.26) and 0.37 ± 0.05* to 1.23 ± 0.17* for 4F10 (LSD=0.21). Western blots and dot blots were consistent with ELISA results. Second-derivative UV spectroscopy was used to quantify tertiary stuctural changes through the determination of  derivative peak ratios between two successive peaks. The ratios ranged from 2.31 ± 0.44 to 5.67 ± 0.54. Relative fluorescence intensities (F/F0) ranged from 1.02 to 1.22.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The immunoreactivity of amandin in processed almond seeds as assessed by ELISA, Western blot, and dot blot varied depending on the type of processing treatment undergone. While immunoreactivity decreased under certain conditions, it was never eliminated, indicating antigenic stability of amandin towards thermal processing. Under certain processing conditions, changes in second-derivative UV spectra and fluorescence intensity were observed suggesting the occurrence of heat-induced structural changes.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>As the discovery of quantum mechanics signified a revolution in the world of physics more than one century ago, the notion of a quantum computer in 1981 marked the beginning of a drastic change of our understanding of information and computability.  In a quantum computer, information is stored using quantum bits, or qubits, which are described by a quantum-mechanical superposition of the quantum states 0 and 1.  Computation then proceeds by acting with unitary operations on these qubits.  These operations are referred to as quantum logic gates, in analogy to classical computation where bits are acted on by classical logic gates.  In order to perform universal quantum computation it is, in principle, sufficient to carry out single-qubit gates and two-qubit gates, where the former act on individual qubits and the latter, acting on two qubits, are used to entangle qubits with each other.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The present thesis is divided into two main parts.  In the first, we are concerned with spin-based quantum computation.  In a spin-based quantum computer, qubits are encoded into the Hilbert space spanned by spin-$\frac12$ particles, such as electron spins trapped in semiconductor quantum dots.  For a suitable qubit encoding, turning on-and-off, or ``pulsing,'' the isotropic Heisenberg exchange Hamiltonian $J {\bf S}_i\cdot {\bf S}_j$ allows for universal quantum computation and it is this scheme, known as exchange-only quantum computation, which we focus on.  In the second part of this thesis, we consider a topological quantum computer in which qubits are encoded using so-called Fibonacci anyons, exotic quasiparticle excitations that obey non-Abelian statistics, and which may emerge in certain two-dimensional topological systems such as fractional quantum-Hall states.  Quantum gates can then be carried out by moving these particles around one another, a process that can be viewed as braiding their 2+1 dimensional worldlines.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The subject of the present thesis is the development and theoretical understanding of procedures used for entangling qubits.  We begin by presenting analytical constructions of pulse sequences which can be used to carry out two-qubit gates that are locally equivalent to a controlled-PHASE gate.  The corresponding phase can be arbitrarily chosen, and for one particular choice this gate is equivalent to controlled-NOT.  While the constructions of these sequences are relatively lengthy and cumbersome, we further provide a straightforward and intuitive derivation of the shortest known two-qubit pulse sequence for carrying out a controlled-NOT gate.  This derivation is carried out completely analytically through a novel ``elevation'' of a simple three-spin pulse sequence to a more complicated five-spin pulse sequence.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the case of topological quantum computation with Fibonacci anyons, we present a new method for constructing entangling two-qubit braids.  Our construction is based on an iterative procedure, established by Reichardt, which can be used to systematically generate braids whose corresponding operations quickly converge towards an operation that has a diagonal matrix representation in a particular natural basis.  After describing this iteration procedure we show how the resulting braids can be used in two explicit constructions for two-qubit braids.  Compared to two-qubit braids that can be found using other methods, the braids generated here are among the most efficient and can be obtained straightforwardly without computational overhead.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>ABSTRACT</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Emergency message dissemination (EMD) in vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) becomes a hot topic due to the ever increasing concern on the road safety. When encountering unusual situations, emergency messages should be disseminated quickly to as many vehicles as possible in order to avoid any potential accidents. For this application, two basic requirements are low latency and high reliability [23]. In urban area, EMD application can be applied with roadside devices (e.g. using a base station to broadcast). But in the areas that infrastructures are difficult to be deployed and maintained, multi-hop broadcast is the main technique used in this application. However, multi-hop broadcast scheme leads to broadcast storm problem in dense traffic. Several approaches have been proposed to solve this problem. They can be classified as distanced-based, cluster-based, and probability-based approaches. In distance-based approaches, vehicles that farther from the source vehicle are selected as relay nodes in order to achieve a better cover area. In cluster-based approaches, each cluster has a cluster head which is used as the relay node. The cluster is self-organized and the cluster head is selected according to information such as vehicle's speed, direction, location, and antenna height. Both distance-based and cluster-based approaches require the maintenance of the network topology. For probability-based approaches, vehicles don't care about the network topology or their neighbors’ information. A vehicle decides its probability to broadcast based on the information contained in the received packet.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This thesis analyzes the existing protocols and points out the issues of the existing approaches. For the issues, we present a novel probability-based broadcast scheme that can inhibit broadcast storm, decrease the end-to-end delay, and guarantee that the emergency messages are delivered to most of the vehicles. The rest of the thesis is structured as follows. In chapter 1 we introduce the concept of VANET and remaining issues of the existing methods for EMD. The research problem in this work is defined and several related works are reviewed. In chapter 2, we analyze the probability-based protocol and proposed our protocol in detail. The typical probability-based protocol [13] uses a linear function to determine whether or not a vehicle should broadcast. However, it doesn't perform well in dense traffic in term of end-to-end delay. Our protocol uses an exponent function instead of the linear function in probability-based approaches. The simulation results show that our protocol can shorten the end-to-end delay in dense traffic without impacting the reliability. In chapter 3, we present the network model and simulation results, including the tools used for the simulation. Especially, key parameters of the proposed protocol are discussed. The simulation results as well as network performance analysis are presented in chapter 4. In chapter 5, we conclude this work. The remaining problems and future work of the proposed protocol are summarized in this chapter.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Soybean allergies are one of top eight types of food allergies, affecting ~ 0.4% children and 0.3% adults in North America. Soybean agglutinin (SBA) protein, also known as soybean lectin, is both an allergen as well as an anti-nutrient that reducing the nutritional value of soybean and soybean products. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The objective of this study was to obtain a validated methodology that is precise and accurate in the measurement of SBA while allowing minimally equipped laboratories to effectively conduct the analysis. A competitive ELISA was constructed and optimized by using rabbit anti whole soybean polyclonal antibodies (pAb) as primary Ab. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The constructed competitive ELISA was validated to have LOD of 0.063 ng/ml of soybean lectin in all tested samples. The ELISA is reproducible and accurate as CVs of all ELISAs tested were less than 24% and the average recoveries were within 15% of the actual value, which demonstrating accuracy of the assay. However, further investigate is needed to evaluating CV of the assay. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The validated ELISA method was able to detect and quantify the SBA in 20 soybean varieties and indicated that the natural variability of SBA is subject to the effects of genotype and environment. Moreover, the ELISA can detect the SBA content in thermal processed soybean, germinated soybean sprouts, and commercial soybean products. The results suggested that processing methods can affect soybean lectin immunoreactivity. Compare to the conventional hemagglutinating assay, ELISA is more sensitive and effective.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In conclusion, the constructed pAb-based competitive ELISA provides an efficacious detection and quantification for the soybean lectin.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This study contributes a critical geographic perspective to understanding possibilities and constraints for achieving more sustainable and just urbanization through New Urbanism, a market-oriented, Smart Growth approach consistent with the trend of deregulation of growth management in the US in recent decades. Six master-planned Florida New Urbanist developments were evaluated using mixed methods. Empirical analyses were conducted using geographic information system (GIS) tools to assess the "locational sustainability" of the developments in relation to the surrounding regional fabric, and census data were used to evaluate the racial and ethnic composition of residents. In addition, the study investigates whether greater public participation is linked to stronger sustainability outcomes and how a New Urbanist "brand" affected development processes. Finally, archival research is employed to uncover  development histories to enrich understandings of development processes and the role of New Urbanism from pre-development through siting and actual development. The findings show generally poor and patchy fulfillment of sustainability outcomes for the New Urbanist communities studied, with no single community scoring well for both locational sustainability and racial and ethnic population diversity. Communities where the strongest participatory processes were in effect prior to development exhibited better sustainability outcomes; however, for all six cases, siting and development decisions were driven by economic factors similar to those for conventional suburban developments. The findings suggest that rather than  focusing on particular styles of built forms, efforts be directed at promoting political and economic processes and policies that lead to more just and sustainable outcomes.</DISS_para>
