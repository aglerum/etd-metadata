            <DISS_para>This study presents for the first time, ecological relationships between coccolithophores and environmental conditions in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico. Cell densities of coccolithophores were determined in 598 samples taken from approximately thirty stations along three north-south trending transects at different depths within 0 to 200 m in the photic zone of the study area. An investigation of the absolute abundance of nannofossils in sediment cores taken from two sites in the DeSoto Canyon was also carried out.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The main coccolithophore (mostly Emiliania huxleyi) production was observed within the top 60 m of the water column. The coccolithophores tend to reach maximum abundances in the upper photic zone and were least abundant in the lower photic zone. The average cell density throughout the study period was 41,524 cells per liter. Highest cell density recorded was 412,183 cells per liter in April 2013 in the upper photic zone. Florisphaera profunda accounted for cell density peaks below 75 m down to 125 m water depth. Coccolith cell production decreased drastically below 100 m water depth. A total of 104 coccolithophore species were identified. The assemblages were dominated by E. huxleyi, Gephyrocapsa ericsonii, Florisphaera profunda, Umbellosphaera tenius, Calciopappus rigidus and Michaelsarsia elegans. These taxa individually or together comprised more than 75% of the total assemblages in more than 90 percent of the samples. Gephyrocapsa oceanica, Ophiaster formosus, Calciosolenia murrayi, the Syracosphaera species, and the holococcoliths were the next most common taxa.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The coccolithophore cell densities showed vertical and lateral variations as well as seasonal and inter-annual changes in abundance, diversity, and distribution during the study period. These variations were mainly related to changes in the thickness of the mixed-layer and the pycnocline.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The coccolithophore cell densities and cell density variability of the dominant taxa were compared with in-situ measurements of temperature, salinity, chlorophyll, oxygen, nitrate and phosphorus to show the effects of the water column parameters on the cell densities. The results revealed the presence of distinct species groupings and distinct ecological preference of the groups. Coccolithophore cell densities and those of the dominant taxa were mostly influenced by temperature and phosphorus especially in the upper photic zone and nitrate and salinity in the lower photic zone.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The assemblage compositions and abundances in the water and the sediments differ significantly.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Introduction - The Simple View of Reading (SVR) and the Not-so-Simple View of Writing (NSVW) are well established models of reading and writing, respectively. This study combined and expanded upon these theoretical frameworks of component skills of reading and writing using data from a multivariate meta-analysis of the overlapping indicators and predictors of literacy skills. Method - Data for this study came from a previously conducted meta-analysis of the correlations among component skills of reading and writing (Ahmed, 2013). A synthesized correlation matrix of 77 studies was fit to a joint model of reading and writing. The variables included rapid automatized naming (RAN), phonological awareness (PA), decoding/orthography (D/O), reading comprehension (RC), vocabulary/morphology (V/M), listening comprehension (LC), oral expression (OE), working memory (WM), non-verbal reasoning (NVR), spelling (SP), handwriting (HW), writing quality (WQ), and Curriculum-based (or count-based) measures of writing (CBM). The first class of models replicated and extended the Simple View of Reading. The second class of models was based on components of the Not-so-Simple View of Writing, but did not replicate this model, as the meta-analysis did not identify a well-defined construct for executive functioning. Finally, the last class of models examined the contributions of component skills to both reading comprehension and text generation, and tested whether relations among component skills and writing are mediated through reading. Results - The results supported the validity of the Simple View of Reading as originally proposed by Gough &amp; Tunmer, 1986, that reading comprehension equals the sum of two components (word reading and language comprehension). Results for the models of writing indicated that transcription emerged as an important predictor of writing, and working memory did not explain variance in writing. The models of literacy supported the role of text reading in writing, over and above the role of language and decoding. The results have implications for studying the development of reading and writing in the context of literacy rather than in the context of language.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Polyphenolic-rich fruits and vegetables have been shown to possess anti-inflammatory properties. Cornus officinalis (CO) are berries found predominantly in China and Korea and have been used in Eastern herbal medicine and tonics for over 2,000 years. Their main chemical components include phenolic acids and anthocyanins. There is a paucity of research exploring the anti-inflammatory properties of polyphenols extracted from CO, thus the purpose of this study was to investigate the inhibitory effects of CO extract (COE) on inflammatory molecules including nitric oxide (NO), cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&amp;#945;) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated RAW264.7 macrophages. CO was extracted using methanol and total polyphenolic content (TPC) was determined using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Macrophages were treated with different doses of COE (0, 50, 100, 200, 400 µg/ml) two hours prior to stimulation with 100 ng/ml of LPS. Medium was collected for NO and TNF-&amp;#945; analysis and the cytosolic fractions were collected to assess levels of COX-1 and COX-2. TPC of COE was 1,872.8 ppm with anthocyanins and chlorogenic acid being the most abundant polyphenols found in COE. COE at doses of 50, 100 and 200 µg/ml were able to significantly decrease NO levels in comparison to LPS with no significant decreases in TNF-&amp;#945; levels observed. COE at a dose of 400 µg/ml caused a 4.5-fold decrease, though not significant, in the levels of COX-2 when compared to LPS. No effects of COE were observed in the levels of COX-1. The results of this study indicate that COE is rich in polyphenols that possess anti-inflammatory properties suggesting that they may be an effective alternative and/or complementary therapy to prevent inflammation.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The land/sea warming contrast being greater than unity is a well-known phenomenon in response to anthropogenic radiative forcing. The land/sea surface warming asymmetry is essentially a result of the differing surface and boundary layer properties over the land and ocean as well as the differing cloud feedbacks. In this study, we analyze the surface temperature response over the land and ocean, using the NCAR CCSM4, to a transient 1% &lt;super&gt;yr&lt;/super&gt;-1 &lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt;2 increase at the time of the doubling. The contributions of the external forcing (&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt;2) alone and various feedbacks are diagnosed using the Climate Feedback Response Analysis Method (CFRAM). This study found that the external forcing warms the land and ocean surfaces approximately the same, which suggests that the feedbacks are responsible for the warming contrast. Furthermore, this analysis confirms that the principal contributor to the above-unity land-to-sea warming ratio is the evaporation feedback; however, the results also indicate that the sensible heat flux feedback, which favors a greater warming for the ocean, has the largest land/sea warming difference. Consequently, the findings uniquely highlight the importance of other feedbacks in establishing the above-unity land-to-sea warming ratio. Specifically, the cloud and ocean dynamics/heat storage feedbacks are key contributors to the maintenance of the land/sea warming asymmetry. The results of this study provide a more holistic understanding of the climate feedbacks and their significance to the land and ocean temperature responses, when the climate is forced.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Globally, species diversity is regulated by speciation and extinction, and regionally it is regulated by competition, niche, colonization, emigration, and extinction, and more locally, by environmental tolerance and species interactions which filter out non-adapted species based on intrinsic characteristics, or their Hutchinsonian niche. In this dissertation, I examined some of the mechanisms that govern biodiversity patterns in order to determine the main causes of uneven diversity in muroid rodent clades, the most diverse superfamily of mammals, comprising 28% of all mammal species. This extensive diversity, in addition to the remarkable eco-morphological adaptability which facilitated their colonization of all terrestrial biomes make muroids an ideal system to study this fundamental question in evolutionary ecology. In addition, the use of robust phylogenies that have recently been developed in muroids and non-muroid rodents makes the order an especially attractive model system to understand the process of mammalian adaptation to arid environments and the ecological interactions that shaped patterns of coexistence within desert communities, the second main goal of the dissertation. The use of a combination of molecular phylogenetics and geometric morphometrics allows for a robust investigation of general patterns that shape the ecological evolution of this group within and without desert habitats, warranting a reinterpretation of classical studies in evolutionary biology, desert ecology, and the traditional systematics of desert rodent clades.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Across two essays, this dissertation investigates how firms can develop goodwill in order to reduce negative impacts from failures.  Essay 1 uses the context of a service failure to introduce and examine the concept of "external service recovery."  Although past spillover research examines how negative outcomes can transfer from one firm to another firm, this essay examines conditions under which a service failure at one firm creates an opportunity to enhance customer evaluations of a subsequent firm.  Additionally, a new type of recovery paradox is considered, in which consumers have more favorable perceptions of a firm when there was a previous failure with a different firm compared with no previous service failure.  Results of three empirical studies suggest that firms can benefit from another firm's service failure, but only when the recovering firm is not affiliated with the failing firm.  Essay 2 extends the failure context from Essay 1 into broader corporate failures, such as a violation of employee rights or disregard for the environment.  It considers how corporate social responsibility (CSR) can inoculate the firm from customer dysfunctional behavior, such as theft or negative word of mouth.  Across three studies, Essay 2 demonstrates that CSR initiatives mitigate the occurrence of dysfunctional consumer behaviors, but only when CSR initiatives are congruent with the failure context (e.g., when an environmental CSR initiative precedes an environmental firm initiative, such as an oil spill).  Collectively, these two essays provide important extensions to our understanding of how firms can recover from failures, and deliver specific implications for how managers can both profit from other firms failures and mitigate the negative consequences from their own failures.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation traces the process by which American Lutherans used charity work, particularly the provision of social services to refugees, to enter mainstream American society in the middle of the twentieth century.  In the years following World War I, after Americanization campaigners branded them a suspicious and foreign element, American Lutherans began a significant reappraisal of their position in American society.  Illustrating the increasing secularization of American society during this period, Lutheran leaders downplayed their ethnic and theological differences to seek a closer relationship with the American government and participation in cooperative charity projects as a way to enhance their image with the American public.      </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>By the end of World War II, millions of Lutheran laypeople set aside their differences to support their church's role in the government's refugee resettlement program.  Church leaders encouraged their members to donate money, food, or clothing, sponsor refugees, and welcome them into American churches. They also lobbied for the inclusion of refugees in government programs that typically had citizenship and residency requirements, such as county poor relief.  In the process, they helped to create the parameters of the public-private partnership between government bodies and religious voluntary agencies that still exists today to assist refugees entering the United States.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Paratransit buses are custom built as the major vehicle manufacturer produces the custom built passenger cage installed on the chassis for the Paratransit bus. In order for these Paratransit bus members to be sufficient, they have to be evaluated for crashworthiness and energy absorption. This has prompted Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) to fund research for the safety evaluation of Paratransit busses consisting of crash and safety analysis. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>There has been a large body of research done on steel subjected to static loads, but more research is needed for steel applied under dynamic loading and high speeds in order to improve crashworthiness in events such as rollovers and side impacts. Bare steel Hollow Structural Section (HSS) tubing are used a lot as structural members of Paratransit buses because of their lightness and progressive buckling under loading. The research will be conducted on quantifying the tubing's behavior under bending by conducting static three point bending and impact loading tests. In addition to the bare tubing, plywood and fiberglass composites are investigated because they are both strong and lightweight and their behavior under dynamic loading hasn't been quantified. As a result, the main purpose of this research is to quantify the differences between the dynamic and static behavior of plywood steel composite and fiberglass steel composite tubing and compare these findings with those of bare steel tubing. The differences will be quantified using detailed and thorough experiments that will examine the composites behavior under both static and dynamic loading. These tests will determine if there are any advantages of using the composite materials and thus allow for recommendations to be made to the FDOT with the goal of improving the safety of Paratransit busses.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Tensile tests were conducted to determine the material properties of the tested specimens. Before the static and dynamic experiments are run to investigate the differences between static and dynamic behavior, Preliminary three point bending testing was conducted to determine the parameters for the final experiments. Static bending testing was conducted on the bare, plywood composite, and fiberglass composite steel tubing. The point of these experiments was to produce a Moment vs. Rotation plot to determine the specimens' maximum moments and their associated rotation, as that is when the steel buckles and fails. The dynamic three point bending experiments were conducted using the impact loading apparatus and had the same purpose as the static experiments. For both static and dynamic experiments, the performances of the different types of specimens were compared based upon their Moment vs. Rotation plots. This will determine the effect that the composite has on the rotation and maximum moment at which the tubing fails. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>After conducting these experiments, amplification factors were established for each specimen by comparing the maximum moment and their associated rotation between static and dynamic testing. &amp;#955; was calculated to quantify the ratio between the static and dynamic maximum moments. &amp;#946; was used to quantify the ratio between the rotation needed to produce the maximum moment between static and dynamic events. A small amplification factor denotes that material performs well under impact loading and the material doesn't experience dramatic change in behavior during dynamic events. Amplification factors were compared between the bare, plywood, and fiberglass composite steel tubing in order to evaluate the performance of the composites. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>After comparing the amplification factors of the different types of tubing, recommendations can be made. Fiberglass and plywood composite were shown to be valuable because it decreased the effect of dynamic forces as &amp;#946; was reduced by a factor of 2 in comparison to bare tubing. Based upon the amplification factors, it was recommended to use 14 gauge fiberglass composite tubing as Paratransit bus structural members because it was affected the least by dynamic loading.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Relatively neglected in the literature on law and society has been the growing racial disparity in imprisonment observed during the era of mass imprisonment and the considerable geographic variation in the magnitude of this disparity.  While some scholars have explored possible explanations for the observed racial disproportionalities during this period, they have focused on state-level patterns that mask significant within-state variation in the outcome.  What is more, although the few published studies examining contemporary racial disparities in imprisonment rates have documented several key correlates, they have not devoted systematic attention to the role of history in explaining the observed patterns.  This dissertation advances the theoretical and empirical literature on race and social control by examining both the historical origins and more localized social, economic, and political conditions that may explain racial disparities in imprisonment observed during the past several decades.  Specifically, the study develops and tests models of between- and within-county variation in the black-white imprisonment gap from the early 1980s through the mid-2000s.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para/>
            <DISS_para>The dissertation is organized around three overarching empirical questions related to county-level black-white disparities in prison admission rates.  First, what is the nature of the spatial distribution of county-level racial disparities in prison admission rates observed during the contemporary era?  Second, which social, economic, and political factors are most germane for explaining variation in racial disparities across American counties (within states) and over time?  Finally, are contemporary racial disparities in imprisonment observed since the 1980s also a reflection of historically embedded conditions (i.e., state lynching rates and historical levels of state racial disparities in imprisonment)?  These questions were examined using a panel dataset constructed to capture historical context and contemporary conditions for much of the mass imprisonment era.  The key dependent variable--the black-white gap in prison admission rates (the natural log of the non-Hispanic white imprisonment rate subtracted from the natural log of the non-Hispanic black imprisonment rate)--was constructed using geocoded data on prison admissions from the National Corrections Reporting Program (NCRP) and population data from the U.S. Census Bureau.  The two race-specific components used to compute this measure also were considered as outcomes to inform the findings observed for the black-white gap in prison admission rates.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para/>
            <DISS_para>Using methods of exploratory spatial data analysis, significant univariate spatial dependence of racial disparities in imprisonment was observed.  However, subsequent analyses indicated that this dependence was explained by the spatial distribution of theoretically germane explanatory variables.  Multilevel mixed model regressions revealed significant variation in the black-white gap in prison admission rates during the era of mass incarceration both across and within counties.  Drawing from the theoretical literature, several hypotheses were posed to explain this variability.  The results indicated some support for hypotheses drawn from perspectives of interracial contact, economic threat, and religious fundamentalism, but no support for those relating to the influence of conservative political environments on racial disparities in post-arrest criminal justice processing.  More specifically, interracial contact and relative economic conditions were found to have important implications for post-arrest decision-making.  Counties with relatively large and growing white populations exhibited significant increases in the prison admission rates of blacks, and decreases in the rates of white imprisonment, yielding greater black-white disparities.  Additionally, the black-white imprisonment gap was found to be significantly larger where black economic disadvantage was more prominent than white disadvantage.  The results also suggest that growing racial segregation in housing contributed to increased levels of imprisonment of blacks relative to whites, a finding consistent with notions that segregation promotes anti-black effect, which is then translated into greater social control against blacks.  Finally, no support was found for hypotheses drawn from partisan political perspectives; conservative political environments at the state-level were not found to play a significant role in explaining county-variation in black-white disparities in prison admission rates.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para/>
            <DISS_para>Findings from the analysis incorporating historical measures of social control yielded no support for the idea that the geographic distribution of contemporary imprisonment rates parallel historical lynching patterns.  However, the evidence does suggest that contemporary racial disparities may be a continuation of past imprisonment patterns.  Specifically, counties nested within states that exhibited greater black-white imprisonment rates in 1960 were found to have significantly greater black-white disparities during the contemporary era.  This appears to be a function of relatively low white imprisonment rates where black and white imprisonment rates historically were more equal.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para/>
            <DISS_para>Future research points to the need for greater attention to the national-level influences and local political conditions affecting post-arrest criminal justice decision-making.  Further, while it appears that historically rooted conditions may be relevant for explaining contemporary racial disparities, focused examination of how the social control of blacks has transformed throughout penal reform is necessary.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Understanding how organisms adapt to their environments is one of the fundamental goals of biology. However, delineating the exact relationships between genotypes, phenotypes, and fitness can be difficult in natural systems. Studying phenotypes that have both simple underlying genetics and direct effects on the survival of an organism can make the connections more clear.  The evolutionary patterns of snake venoms and the complete lack of alternative mechanisms of feeding and defense in venomous species makes them an ideal system for studying molecular adaptation and predator-prey coevolution. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In chapter one, I investigate the venom-gland transcriptomes of &lt;i&gt;Agkistrodon piscivorus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Agkistrodon contortrix&lt;/i&gt;, congeners that have different ecological niches from each other and previously characterized species.  Using these congeners as a model system, I will explore the roles of mutational process and selection in venom evolution.  I test the hypothesis that &lt;i&gt;A. piscivorus&lt;/i&gt; will show higher divergence and strength of selection in toxin gene expression patterns and more gene-family expansion than &lt;i&gt;A. contortrix&lt;/i&gt;, due the acquisition of an entirely novel dietary item (fish). Given current knowledge of the evolutionary arms race between venom composition and prey's resistance (Gibbs et al. 2013), &lt;i&gt;A. piscivorus&lt;/i&gt; is likely to have toxin gene paralogs that are under strong selection to adapt to a new diet. The test of this hypothesis will provide a direct view of molecular evolution and selection due to novel adaptation in an ecologically critically phenotype. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para> The extraordinarily broad diet of &lt;i&gt;A. piscivorus&lt;/i&gt; lends itself to the study of local adaptation, as the most common prey items are unlikely to be found across the entire range of the species. I will investigate the role of expression variation by conducting a detailed analysis of population-level adaptation across the range of a dietary generalist, &lt;i&gt;A. piscivorus&lt;/i&gt;. I will test for both ontogenetic and geographic differences in &lt;i&gt;A. piscivorus&lt;/i&gt;, focusing on the role of toxin expression variation between life stages and populations. Specifically, I test the hypothesis that &lt;i&gt;A. piscivorus'&lt;/i&gt; has population variation in venom composition tied to geographically-based prey availability, given the breath of diet in this species and the strength of selection on venom.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>When do rivalries between counties go to war during its rivalry period? This question has rarely been asked despite much research about the relationships between rivals as well as the factors surrounding the initiation and termination of their rivalry. This question is important in order to understand how to achieve peace during the rivalry period. I argue that political shock causes bargaining failure, leading to war between rivals. Political shock often results in different bargaining ranges caused by a lack of information and the uncertainty that a rival will keep an agreement. Three factors are proposed in my dissertation to explain how political shock increases the uncertainty of the bargaining range and incredibility of agreement which can lead rivals to war: a change of major power alliance; a pre-occupied major power alliance; and an irregular leadership entry. Each of these factors can stimulate drastic changes of the rivals' incentives and expectations within a short period of time. Rivals then become uncertain about what they should offer and demand in the bargaining process and whether their rival will keep the agreement. I use a multivariate logistic regression model. The anticipated result provides theoretical grounds to understand the peace and war during rivalry, not only for scholars but also for policy practitioners in rival countries.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The current study aimed to determine the efficacy of a group-format alcohol intervention (CHOICES) combined with personalized online feedback (Echeckup ToGo for Alcohol) in a sample of mandated students. An assessment-only control group was recruited from a research pool of peers. The risk range of both groups was limited to moderate risk for alcohol-related problems (AUDIT range 6-14). Assessments were conducted at baseline and a 3-month follow-up examining binge drinking outcomes (peak BAC and binge drinking frequency), as well as alcohol-related problems. MANOVA results indicated a null treatment effect and lack of a main effect for Condition or Time. Group differences were covaried in the MANOVA analysis including age, gender, year in school, and housing status. Baseline drinking was also covaried due to its significant relationship with binge drinking outcomes. Hierarchical Linear Regression analyses were conducted to examine whether Theory of Planned Behavior variables (Perceived Behavioral Control and Behavioral Intentions) mediated the relationship between the CHOICES intervention and binge drinking behavior outcomes.  The mediator model was partially supported in that the mediators were related to the outcomes. However, the lack of a treatment effect prevented full examination of the model.  Recommendations for future research are provided.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Intimates regularly attempt to motivate their partners to change their undesirable behaviors by engaging in confrontational partner-regulation behaviors. Although recent research suggests that such behaviors can indeed motivate partners to change on average, theoretical perspectives suggest that such behaviors may decrease the motivation of partners who are experiencing depression. A survey study of romantic relationships, an observational study of newlyweds, and a diary study of married couples provided support for this prediction. Across all three studies, confrontational partner-regulation behaviors were associated with more motivation to resolve problems among partners who were experiencing relatively few depressive symptoms, but less motivation among partners who were experiencing relatively more depressive symptoms. Further, Study 3 provided evidence for the mechanism of these effects-- relationship self-efficacy, or the belief that one can resolve relationship problems. Finally, the three studies additionally provided evidence that engaging in supportive and encouraging behaviors during problem-solving discussions was particularly motivating to partners who were experiencing more depressive symptoms. These findings highlight the fact that theories of communication will be most complete to the extent that they consider that interpersonal behaviors are not inherently beneficial or harmful; rather, their implications depend on qualities of the communication target.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Ever since professional wrestling made the transition from sport to spectacle, stereotypes have played a role in the show, traditionally as a narrative device that divides the wrestling world into heels (villains) and faces (heroes). In the past, as a regional product, wrestling promotions would appeal to the demographic of the region, placing their morals and ideology onto the hero. As wrestling has gone mainstream, that hasn't changed, but the audience has. No longer relying solely on regional ticket sales, but rather large, national mass media contracts and advertisers, professional wrestling now attempts to appeal to the white, masculine, neoliberal hegemony and in doing so perpetuates its ideology through stereotypes. Now, nearly every group outside of the majority culture is depicted by lazy archetypal portrayals meant to reinforce hegemonic ideology. This thesis, using the work of many political economic scholars, attempts to identify and describe portrayals of race in the WWE from a political economic perspective, focusing on the ideology dispersed by the messages within WWE content and the structural factors that encourage the portrayals. In attempt to do so, trade journals and popular press were examined, and WrestleManias 1-30 were analyzed using textual analysis to examine portrayals of race.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Research has demonstrated that parents' use of synchronous language, which is language that follows their children's focus of attention, is related to language development in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD; Haebig, McDuffie, &amp; Ellis Weismer, 2013a; Haebig, McDuffie, &amp; Ellis Weismer, 2013b; Siller &amp; Sigman, 2002; Siller &amp; Sigman, 2008). Furthermore, experiments demonstrate that professionals can teach parents to increase their use of synchronous language when interacting with their children (Aldred et al., 2004, 2012; Green et al., 2010; Siller, Hutman, &amp; Sigman, 2013). This investigation is part of the longitudinal Early Social Interaction (ESI) project and compared pre- and post-measures of parent synchronous language across two different intervention conditions that varied on intensity. A total of 82 children between the ages of 17 and 20 months of age and their parents were randomly assigned to either parent-implemented intervention (PII), which was offered in three individual sessions per week for 6 months, or information, education, and support (IES), which was offered in one group session per week. Findings revealed that parents in both intervention conditions significantly increased their use of synchronous language at similar rates after six months of intervention. Additionally, there was a significant time by treatment interaction for parent use of undemanding language indicating that the PII group increased their use of undemanding language over the course of intervention and the IES group did not. Additionally, significant relationships were observed between six-month levels of parent synchronous language and child outcomes measured on the Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scales (CSBS; Wetherby &amp; Prizant, 2002). Finally, parent use of synchronous language was significantly related to parent behaviors displayed in a home observation three months after collection of the clinic measure. Results of this study suggest that parents increased their use of synchronous language after participation in either intervention condition, both of which targeted parent synchrony. However, undemanding language may require more hours of training for parents to make changes during six-months of intervention. Furthermore, the findings of this study suggest that parent synchrony was not an active ingredient in mediating child change.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The application of music therapy with individuals with eating disorders and substance abuse disorders is existent, though there is a limited amount of research that exists in the current literature. Symptoms that are addressed in individual and group sessions for both populations are presented in this study.  The purpose of this study was to examine goals and interventions implemented by music therapists working with these populations.  This study is also aimed at examining the transition from the DSM-IV-TR to the DSM-5 and whether this has created any changes in music therapy sessions.  Data for this study was collected in the form of an online survey.  The American Music Therapy Association (AMTA) provided contact information for music therapists who work with individuals with eating disorders and substance abuse (N = 128); however, one contact information provided was marked undeliverable.  The researcher also asked professionals not registered with the AMTA who were known to have worked with the populations (N=11).  Forty-seven individuals responded to the survey, creating a response rate of 34%.  Of the 47 individuals who responded to this survey, 95.74% held the MT-BC certification; however only 63.89% held a job with a title of "Music Therapist."  Only 11.63% of respondents (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 5) reported working in a facility that specializes in eating disorders, while 34.88% of respondents (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 15) indicate working in a facility specializing in substance abuse.  Fourteen individuals (32.56%) indicated working with individuals diagnosed with eating and substance abuse disorders.  Suggestions for future research are made, as well as limitations of the study are presented.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>&lt;i&gt;Can't Go Back&lt;/i&gt; is the story of Martin Paris, a former cop-turned-private investigator, who is also a homosexual, living in Los Angeles in 1947. Written in the tradition of Noir detective fiction, the novel uses the conventions of the genre as well as the historical and social contexts of the postwar-era to explore ideas of sexuality, loss, fulfillment and time.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>A number of studies, including a 2010 study by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), have documented persistence gaps between the educational attainment of White males and that of Black males and Hispanic males among other racial/ethnic groups.  There is also evidence of a growing gender gap within racial/ethnic groups, as females are participating and persisting at much higher rates than their male counterparts (Aud et al., 2010).  This growing gender gap within racial/ethnic groups presents a unique problem for Blacks and for Black males in particular.  Research shows that Black males, unlike their counterparts, are entering college at a much higher rate than they are graduating from college yet the research further shows that when they participate in higher education, and when well-conceived and formalized support systems are put into place to promote achievement, Black males persist at a higher level (Bush et al., 2010).  Previous research on student persistence has indicated a number of factors, such as financial aid, socioeconomic status, lack of preparation, and lack of engagement contribute to the attrition of students in general, however, a gap remains in the current literature regarding how much of an impact these factors have on Black male students at predominantly White institutions.  Therefore, the purpose of the proposed study is to investigate the impact of engagement on the academic success of Black males at a predominantly White institution as compared to their counterparts at the same institution using the institution's data from the National Survey on Student Engagement (NSSE) in 2005, 2008 and 2011.  Findings from this research may help to identify specific factors and their impact on the persistence of Black males and may provide further research on the persistence of Black males at predominantly White institutions.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The following are the questions at the very heart of this dissertation. What is mothering and what are the roles and duties that mothering entails?  Who defines mothering?  What is hegemony and what are the constraints that hegemony places upon mothering within both the individual and systemic realms?  How are the roles of motherhood and mothering affected by hegemony?  How do people mother when they are under the constraints of hegemony?  To what means and resources do people turn in order to mother in the face of hegemony?  In sum: what is hegemony and how does it affect mothering on both systemic and individual levels?</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To answer these questions, this dissertation explores hegemony and mothering as they are represented within the work of two feminist novels and their respective motion pictures. Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale (1985) is a dystopian tale of patriarchal-state rule where state agents forcibly render female humans "national resource" breeders.  Toni Morrison's novel Beloved (1987) is the story of one woman and her quest to protect her children from the atrocious physical, sexual, emotional, and psychological abuses of white supremacists.  This dissertation exposes and theorizes various phenomenal and elemental components of hegemony, thus filling a gap in the current critical discourse; the dissertation then reveals how hegemony constrains mothering in both novels and their filmic adaptations.  As I argue that collusion is a main ingredient in the life-force of hegemony, it is relevant and necessary to explore collusion.  I examine how the characters within the novels--as well as how, at times, the authors themselves--unintentionally collude with socially existent hegemonies in their artistry via internal colonization.  I argue that, if the harms of internal colonization had been less and that also if the authors had been more aware of defaulted language and the importance of avoiding it, their novels may possibly speak more powerfully than they already do.   I go on to compare the difference in severity of collusion between the novels, while also engaging with canonical and recent criticism of these texts.  The majority of criticism has tended to collude with the problem I have identified; not only authors but also critics are trapped in defaulted language.  In addition, I theorize another hegemonic self-preservation phenomenon, which I entitle the wolf-in-sheep's-clothing effect.  This effect is a powerfully covert function  of both individuals' thought and of macro-societal perceptions and it is made all the more effective by being nearly undetectable.  Ultimately, while the examination of hegemony specifically pertains to the novels, it is worth considering that this theorization can be applied to all forms of hegemony.  I make the case that hegemony, no matter the form it takes (nationalism, patriarchy, white supremacy, etc.), has the same underlying formula.  In order to destroy hegemony, we must destroy it in all of its manifestations.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to conduct a music therapy session to determine the effect of music therapy interventions on mood elevation and reality orientation of patients with memory deficits. The Null hypothesis (H0) stated there would be no significant statistical difference between the conditions. All subjects (N = 30) consented to participate in a 30-minute individualized session to determine the effect of interventions on mood elevation and reality orientation. The subjects consisted of (n = 24) women and (n = 6) men. The study consisted of an experimental group (n = 15) and control group (n = 15). The experimental group participated in live music therapy interventions in an individualized session that included instrument-playing, lyric analysis and singing with age-appropriate, patient-preferred music.  For the control group, the subjects were asked to listen to recordings of the same music in an individualized session. Both the experimental and control groups were asked to complete identical pre-tests and post-tests. For the pre-tests and post-tests, the subjects were asked to rate their mood level based on a 7-point Likert-Type scale and to answer a series of three questions based on an adapted Mini-Mental Examination to assess reality orientation (Folstein, Folstein, &amp; McHugh, 1975). Mann-Whitney U statistical tests were used to analyze the data. The analysis of the pre-tests for reality orientation and mood elevation showed no significant statistical difference between groups. The analysis of the post-tests for reality orientation showed no significant statistical difference between groups and, therefore, the null hypothesis failed to be rejected. The analysis of the post-tests for mood elevation showed a significant statistical difference and therefore, the null hypothesis was rejected.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>While social media has garnered attention for its entertainment and market value, it has received less consideration for its contribution to transnational activism. In particular, we have yet to examine the practices of individual users away from the fun and lighthearted contexts with which social media is generally connected. This dissertation seeks to fill this gap through an examination that addresses the following question: How do protestors' uses of social media facilitate the garnering of transnational support in the context of a social protest movement? I answer this question through a fine-grained analysis of the use of social media by Egyptian protestor Gigi Ibrahim during the Egyptian Revolution that occurred between January 25 and February 11 of 2011, exploring four sub-questions. First, I ask: How do activists represent their local experiences of protest across digital social media interfaces? Then, I address the question: How does a digital social media interface facilitate connections between protestors' local experiences and their digital presence in a transnational context of social activism? This is followed by an examination led by the question: How are transnational audiences invited to participate in digital events of social protest? And, finally, this project acknowledges the limitations of the supportive relationships that Ibrahim forged across social media interfaces by asking: When transnational audiences take up protestors' invitations to participate, how do these protestors maintain transnational relationships with these audiences across a digital social media interface?</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The data set for this project examines Ibrahim's use of Twitter from January 15, ten days before the protests began, until the evening of February 11, when President Hosni Mubarak stepped down. This focus was chosen because of the highly visible use of social media by protestors during this Revolution and the explicit ways in which many of them, including Ibrahim, used these platforms to build supportive ties with transnational audiences. Beginning this data set 10 days before the protests began enables this dissertation to examine not only how protestors used social media during a transnational protest, but also how they used social media to prepare for these protests as well. This data was organized and filtered using an archive that I constructed using the OMEKA platform. This archive allows for a robust and multifaceted analysis of Ibrahim's tweets that acknowledges the many facets of these pieces of digital ephemera.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>My analysis of Ibrahim's nearly 900 tweets yields four key insights into social media and transnational protest. First, to secure transnational attention, Ibrahim created digital representations of her local, physically embodied experiences and then connected these representations across the digital social media interface to a mediatized context that she shared with transnational audiences who were also using Twitter. Second, Twitter's digital interface enabled Ibrahim to maintain key connections between the physical and digital spaces of the Revolution by forming what I refer to as a hybrid embodiment, a critical means by which she maintained these connections across the interface. Third, Ibrahim employed her hybrid embodiment to invite transnational audiences to form hybrid embodiments of their own as a result of their participation in the mediatized event of the Revolution, participation that she elicited through her creation of kairos across Twitter's digital interface. Finally, Ibrahim addressed the risk of cooptation by her Western audiences who formed hybrid embodiments as participants in the Revolution and threatened to use their support of the January 25 protests to reassert their own ostensible cultural superiority. Ibrahim addressed this risk through a process of disidentification wherein she reestablished not only the social and physical distance of these audiences from the Revolution, but also their complicity in the very acts of violence by Mubarak that Ibrahim and other protestors were trying to end.   	</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The contributions of this dissertation are threefold. First, this work expands our understanding of the processes that give rise to transnationalism in the context of digital activism. In particular, it reveals the discursive and nondiscursive tactics engaged by one protestor to extend the Egyptian Revolution from a national movement to a transnational one. Second, this project provides insight into the role played by corporeal bodies in transnational digital spaces. Within these spaces, the corporeal bodies of activists were not disembodied across the digital interface. Rather, these corporeal bodies were essential to Ibrahim's activism both on and offline. Finally, this project reveals digital interfaces as porous and fluid phenomena which, like the bodies that engage them, enable the intervention of actor-rhetors across multiple spaces simultaneously. As such, the digital interface becomes a location that informed Ibrahim's physical and digital, local and transnational, presences during the Revolution and, furthermore, enabled her to maintain both of these key presences as she went about the work of social protest and negotiated Mubarak's many forms of violence that sought to silence her.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The research in this study seeks to investigate the notion of flow theory and positive psychology and their correlating impact on the ability of people in a community setting to reach a higher level of flourishing by engaging in the creative arts. The study predicts that an observable positive change as recorded according to a scale that measures flourishing occurs when people engage in art therapy experientials. An introduction and literature review will be presented to aid in clarifying the source of inspiration for this study as well as supporting research that helped formulate the research design and methodology. Information describing how the data will be collected and analyzed will conclude the third section, explaining in detail the flourishing scale as well as other measures being used.  In the remaining chapters, the data collected from the study will be presented and discussed as they pertain to the research questions.  The study ultimately found positive improvement in the ability of the participants to reach a higher level of flourishing, experiencing more positive affect and less negative affect as a result of engaging in a series of 6 painting sessions.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Social contagion concerns, heterosexuals' fears about being misidentified as gay/lesbian, can lead to anxiety about and avoidance of interacting with gay men/lesbians and even public derogation of gay men/lesbians. Due to the risk of becoming the target of prejudice if misidentified, we argued that perceptions of others' prejudice would directly affect contagion concerns. Specifically, we hypothesized that exposing people to others' nonprejudiced attitudes can significantly reduce heterosexuals' contagion concerns as well as their anxiety about and avoidance of gay men/lesbians. In the first study, we demonstrated that perceptions of peer prejudice significantly contributed to contagion concerns, over and above one's own level of prejudice. In the second study, participants who were exposed to a nonprejudiced norm expressed significantly lower contagion concerns, anxiety about, and desire to avoid gay men/lesbians than participants exposed to a high prejudice norm. These results provide evidence that changing perceptions of others' prejudice can reduce individual contagion concerns.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This thesis is a collection of loosely interconnected short stories that examine identity through the lens of place and family. With an emphasis on the setting of Eastern Oregon, these stories span the United States and Canada. Each character encounters the regionally specific sport of ice hockey, its quintessential frozen landscapes in stark contrast to the desert that bore most of them. The rules and culture of an unfamiliar game dredge up long-standing feelings of familial alienation and geographical dislocation. Pop culture, mental illness, and religion are also of central focus, as well as the very act of storytelling. The characters shape their narratives to suit their needs through confession, revision, and even lies. For them, reconciling oneself involves answering the seemingly innocuous question of "where are you from?" A place and its collective past--or its illusions--binds them together. They must return to the beginning if they want to find a home.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Model random ethylene copolymers with ethyl branches are known to exhibit strong melt memory of crystallization even above their equilibrium melting temperatures. Seeds remain in the melt at high temperatures lowering the change in free energy barrier for nucleation, and hence increasing the crystallization rate. The seeds are molten ethylene sequences from the initial crystallites that remain in close proximity due to restrictions to diffuse and reach the initial copolymer random melt topology. We found that erasing memory of the prior sequence selection in ethylene 1&amp;ndash;butene copolymers requires temperatures around 25 degrees above the equilibrium melting. The ethylene 1&amp;ndash;butene data are contrasted in the present work with data of 1&amp;ndash;alkene ethylene copolymers with longer branches. The effect of branch length in melt diffusion is correlated with the range of melt temperatures where seeds survive and, therefore, with the strength of melt memory. Crystallinity developed prior to melting is experimentally demonstrated to strongly influence the melt memory effect of random copolymers by constructing more topological constraints in the intercrystalline region.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation encompasses an optical spectroscopic study of the temperature and magnetic field dependence of two magnetic materials with significant electron-electron correlation: antiferromagnetic MnTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and frustrated spin-dimer SrCu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; having a low-dimensional quantum spin structure. The first part deals with the nonlinear optical analysis of MnTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; using second harmonic generation (SHG) technique to understand its electronic structure and magnetic symmetry in the paramagnetic, antiferromagnetic and spin-flop phases.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Ilmenite MnTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is an antiferromagnetic oxide (&lt;i&gt;T_&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;=64 K) which possesses a spin-flop phase above the critical magnetic field of 6.4 T. It is thought to be ferrotoroidic and might have potential technological applications. We measured the second harmonic generation and linear absorbance spectra of MnTiO$_3$ and the 1.88, 2.41, 2.63, and 3.06 eV SHG features were identified as &lt;i&gt; d-d &lt;/i&gt; optical transitions from the &lt;super&gt;6&lt;/super&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;1g&lt;/sub&gt; ground state to excited states namely, &lt;super&gt;4&lt;/super&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;1g&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;super&gt;4&lt;/super&gt;G)$, &lt;super&gt;4&lt;/super&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;super&gt;4&lt;/super&gt;G), {&lt;super&gt;4&lt;/super&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;super&gt;4&lt;/super&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;1g&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;super&gt;4&lt;/super&gt;G)}, and &lt;super&gt;4&lt;/super&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;super&gt;4&lt;/super&gt;D), respectively. These narrow SHG peaks, which are red-shifted from the broad linear absorption peaks, can be ascribed to the zero-phonon lines (ZPL) in MnTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. We also estimated the crystal field splitting energy (&amp;delta;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) and the Racah parameters B and C. The SHG circular intensity difference (CID) we report, shows a significant distinction between the antiferromagnetic phase and the paramagnetic or spin-flop phase. SHG spectra in the paramagnetic phase, created by magnetic dipole transitions, showed a non-negligible CID due to the interference between the two &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;-type components of the nonlinear optical susceptibility. Inversion symmetry breaking in the antiferromagnetic phase allows &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;-type tensors, which when coupled to the existing &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;-type tensors, create a significantly strong CID in the low temperature phase of MnTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The CID in AFM phase remains the same through out the spectral region, compared to the CID in the paramagnetic phase which becomes negligible at the resonance frequency. The polarization dependence of the SHG in the spin-flop phase provided optical evidence that the spins canted from the &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;-axis toward the &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;-axis. These distinctions between the three magnetic phases could be useful for mapping 180$&amp;deg; antiferromagnetic domains in MnTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Temperature and magnetic field dependence of the optical reflectivity in SrCu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was measured from 1.4 eV to 2.17 eV. Optical reflectivity spectra of SrCu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; revealed a feature at 1.5 eV assigned as the energy gap for the charge-transfer excitation. With increasing temperature, the reflectivity edge became steep and shifted by 160 meV to the higher energy side. Strong spin-charge correlation in SrCu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; contributed to this significant shift since thermal lattice expansion alone cannot account for this anomalous behavior. Changes in optical reflectivity due to temperature (4-215 K) and applied magnetic field (0-35 T) were analyzed using a Curie-like model and it demonstrated that comparison between magnetic susceptibility and reflectivity changes at the band-edge was possible. The analysis also extracted the Weiss constant and spin-gap energy which matched up with those obtained from other prior measurements. We also observed a significant difference between temperature and magnetic field induced changes to the optical reflectivity and it was indicative of a multi-triplet excitation or cooperative interaction between dimer spin-excitations and band-edge charge carriers.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Raman spectroscopy of under ultra-high magnetic field (45 T) demonstrated the significant spin-lattice coupling in SrCu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Magnetic field dependence of the frequency of Raman modes demonstrated hardening of 203 and 458 cm&lt;super&gt;-1&lt;/super&gt; which was due to the modulation of intradimer superexchange interaction due to lattice distortion when the Cu-Cu near-neighbor distance and the corresponding bond angle are reduced when triplet states are formed with applied field. The frequency change also displayed plateaus similar to those in magnetization, thereby demonstrating a strong magnetoelastic interaction which facilitated the field-induced lattice distortion to probe the magnetic excitations in this low-dimensional frustrated quantum magnet. In addition, the significant difference between the Raman data and magnetization with respect to the early onset of critical field in vibrational measurement is also discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between perceived coaching behaviors and athlete burnout, and to investigate the mediation effects of psychological need satisfaction/thwarting and self-determined motivation on the relationship. Four hundred and eleven Korean collegiate athletes were active members of 19 different sports participated in the study. Their age on average was 21.37 years old (SD = 1.24), and they had 12.31 years (SD = 2.14) of experience in their sports. The participants completed seven questionnaires: a demographic questionnaire, the Korean version of Athlete Burnout Questionnaire, Basic Psychological Needs Scale, Psychological Need Thwarting Scale, Sport Behavioral Regulation Scale, Korean version of Controlling Coach Behaviors Scale, and short version of the Sport Climate Questionnaire.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The athletes perceiving that their coaches provided autonomy-supportive coaching had higher levels of satisfaction on all three basic psychological needs, intrinsic motivation, and autonomous forms of motivation, and lower level of burnout, whereas the athletes perceiving that their coaches provided controlling coaching had higher levels of psychological need thwarting, controlled forms of motivation and amotivation, and burnout. Psychological need thwarting mediated both autonomy-supportive and controlling coaching behaviors, and amotivation was the only mediation variable among all types of self-determined motivation on the relationship between perceived coaching behaviors, psychological need satisfaction/thwarting, and burnout.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Despite the limitations, the findings of this study may provide meaningful information for researchers in that this was the first study to simultaneously investigate all the relationships among perceived coaching behaviors, psychological need satisfaction/thwarting, self-determined motivation, and athlete burnout. The findings demonstrated the mechanism of all the relationships in terms of self-determination theory. From the applied perspective this may alert coaches to the importance of not providing controlling coaching environment. Moreover, sport psychology consultants may develop educational programs for coaches to learn importance of the perceived coaching behaviors and improve communication skills to understand how athlete perceive coaches' coaching behaviors. Sport psychology consultants also develop interventions for athletes to prevent or recover from burnout.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Because of the ways that students have internalized the values of institutional writing via high-stakes tests, it's not clear that the good intention of involving students in the negotiation of values can be realized: students may not know what their own values are. Given this context, this project examines whether such a pedagogical aim can be achieved by exploring students' capacity to negotiate rubric criteria. More specifically, I detail specific student-negotiated rubric-making practices connected to one assignment each from two first-year composition classes at Florida State University. My analysis is based on two interviews from each student: an introduction interview to discuss their definitions of writing and perceptions of rubrics, and an exit interview after the student has been assessed on the first assignment of the course with the student-negotiated rubric. I focus my attention on three dimensions of the presented issue: (1) the ways in which students express writing values, (2) what students value, and (3) the implications for whether and how we negotiate value in the classroom. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Through the case studies, I've discovered that students are implicitly operating with a personal theory of writing; this theory of writing can be uncovered when we observe the ways in which students express this theory: some students use metaphors of exchange to describe how writing is the act of "giving" something and "getting" something back; some students are aware of more rhetorical approaches to writing, but are unable to articulate those values because they have not been provided a language to do so; and some students are willing to sacrifice their own experiential values to privilege the prescribed values of the instructor in exchange for high grades or high scores.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Dora is a multiplicitous being who transcends time, space, and reality like a cubist painting. A fictional, literary character based on a once living woman, Ida Bauer, Dora is an amalgamation of Ida and of Freud, who published the sole account of Ida's case of hysteria. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>I will research the two most striking iterations of Dora Bauer -the casebook &lt;i&gt;Dora: An Analysis of a Case of Hysteria&lt;/i&gt; by Sigmund Freud and the stage play &lt;i&gt;Portrait of Dora&lt;/i&gt; by Hélène Cixous. My multimodal form of analysis encompasses three distinct modes. Through the first mode, metaethics, I aim to assess Freud and Cixous' arguments and ethics of representation, not to judge, but to reveal the validity of their potential motivations when viewed through each one's individual matrix of ethics. Through the second, Naomi Scheman's multiplicitous identity theory, I will investigate the signs of multiplicity in Dora's portrayal by both Freud and Cixous. Through the final mode of analysis, cubism as an art form in concert with Non-Euclidean geometry, I will reveal both Freud and Cixous' fourth dimensional quality of writing and of representation. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Metaethics, multiplicitous identity, and cubism can be modes of resistance, of therapy for the theatre. In concert with this thesis, I have created a rehearsal process in which the actors and I investigated these modes within the theatre. With Dora as our subject, we have created an experimental reading of Cixous' &lt;i&gt;Portrait of Dora&lt;/i&gt;, and we have written and composed an original play with music &lt;i&gt;The Dora Project&lt;/i&gt;. I will explain in the final chapter how we set about manifesting this scholarship on stage and what we encountered along the way.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Unplanned pregnancy is prevalent in the United States and has been linked to challenges for both mothers and their children over time. However, existing literature is limited by unrepresentative samples, retrospective reports of pregnancy intention, and lack of theoretical guidance. Studies have not yet identified mechanisms through which pregnancy intention is associated with children's outcomes, to sufficiently inform clinical practice. This current study addressed these limitations through inclusion of an at-risk sample of 224 first-time mothers from the Predicting and Preventing Neglect in Teen Mothers Study, assessing pregnancy intention during the third trimester of pregnancy, and testing mechanisms in the association between pregnancy intention and children's outcomes which were hypothesized by Family Systems Theory. The study also examined reciprocal associations among hypothesized mediators, including maternal depressive symptoms, parenting stress, and coparenting satisfaction. Mediation analyses revealed that both parenting stress and coparenting satisfaction when children were 24 months old served as mechanisms in the association between unplanned pregnancy and children's social-emotional competence at 36 months. Additionally, a cross-lagged longitudinal model suggested multiple pathways through which unplanned pregnancy was associated with children's externalizing, internalizing, dysregulation, and social-emotional competence at 36 months. Maternal depressive symptoms tended to predict later parenting stress which, in turn, was associated with later coparenting satisfaction and children's behavioral outcomes. Implications for future research are discussed, including collection of data from multiple respondents and assessment of pregnancy intention prospectively. Clinical implications for work with at-risk parents are also outlined. Specifically, the results suggest that early intervention with mothers experiencing unplanned pregnancies to specifically address depressive symptoms, parenting stress, and coparenting may serve to promote healthy outcomes among their children over time.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The natural systems that humans value and upon which we depend are under pressure. Yet too often humans appear trapped in denial, continuing to engage in harmful and unsustainable practices. Capitalism's necessary components of commodification and continual growth are primary drivers of both environmental degradation and our ability to blind ourselves to it or depict it as an inevitable "price of progress." This opens our economic system and the ideologies of consumption and commodification that underlie it to critical challenge.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The mechanism by which this system reproduces itself is an obvious focus of critics, who have pointed out that capitalism uses our informational and entertainment media as a "culture industry" (Jhally, 1989) to reproduce itself, thereby shaping our thinking and constraining our choices. Yet, as Jenkins and others have shown, this is not a one-way, hypodermic model of influence.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The multiuser virtual world Second Life represents the emergence of a somewhat new medium that is groundbreaking in its presentation of an immersively convincing world that visitors can inhabit and even co-create. SL tends to reproduce the ideologies of its builders and users, and its convincing nature creates a powerful presumption of reality and truth; it tends to be experienced as something as natural and inevitable as the real world. Because it is largely user-created, however, it is a place where ideologically-founded depictions of the natural world can be deconstructed regularly and habitually in the act of consuming them. It also offers a relatively democratized public sphere in which competing visions of reality can be experienced. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	I begin with a review of critical theory about the role of media in the formation and reproduction of ideologies about the natural world. Following an explanation of Remediation Theory--which provides insight into the way something as clearly artificial as a virtual world can be enthusiastically engaged as real--I also discuss the rhetorical power of images, followed by a discussion of "virtual nature" as it has been presented in various forms up to and including Second Life. I conclude a detailed study that entails both close readings of SL "builds" as well as interviews with its users and an examination of the way descriptions of these virtual constructions circulate out in other media.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>On average, people spend ninety percent of their time in artificial built environments. Moreover, four-fifths of people in developed countries reside and/or work in dense urban cities: man-made environments that weaken the opportunity for humans to connect with their natural environment. These environments are filled with ecological and sensory deprivation resulting in a weakened human-nature connection (Kellert, 2012). This connectedness however could be strengthened by the design industry, as design possesses the ability to promote this relationship through built environment solutions that encourage interdependency between people and natural elements.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>According to biologist Edward O. Wilson, humans are biologically interconnected with nature physically, psychologically, and spiritually. This deep affiliation with life is a complex process involving the promotion of mental health and well-being and has been defined as the "biophilia hypothesis" (1984). Stephen Kellert, Professor Emeritus of Social Ecology at Yale University, states that "[this] hypothesis proclaims a human dependence on nature that extends far beyond the simple issues of material and physical sustenance to encompass as well the human craving for aesthetic, intellectual, cognitive, and even spiritual meaning and satisfaction" (1993, p. 20). Therefore, biologically speaking, people's well-being remains highly dependent on the human-nature connection (Kellert, 2008), and many studies show how this connectedness often aids in the healing process.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Although a great deal of attention has been paid to optimizing healing environments, there is little published literature that directly integrates a healing environment with restorative environments -- environments intended to restore people from mental fatigue, ecotherapy -- nature-based methods of physical and psychological healing, and the application of biophilic design -- the integration of nature within the built environment.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Recognizing the need for restorative healing environments in urban settings where nature has been severely withdrawn from interiors and architecture and where mental fatigue is prominent, this project thesis proposes a design solution and environment that addresses that need. By integrating the two design models of biophilic design and restorative healing environments into one symbiotic framework and using this framework as a primary research filter, the thesis investigates biophilic design attributes and their perceived effectiveness as they pertain to the success of a theoretical restorative healing environment. Study results indeed indicate that the way in which biophilic attributes are integrated into the restorative healing environment influences their effectiveness. It showcases a design paradigm that promotes a symbiotic relationship between nature and the built environment while addressing humans' psychological, physical, and spiritual well-being and restore the human-nature connection that has been lost in the urban built environment.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>A six-group randomized experimental study was used to investigate the factors that are associated with a marriage and family therapist's decision to work with clients individually or as a couple when they present with intimate partner violence (IPV). Investigated factors included the type of IPV experienced by the clients, the therapist's accuracy in identifying the type of violence experienced by clients, and the therapist's experience with IPV in their own romantic relationships, as moderated by levels of differentiation. Participants included 275 members of the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy. A chi square test revealed that participants who received vignettes portraying situational couple violence were more likely to endorse couples treatment as the preferred treatment modality than participants who received vignettes portraying intimate terrorism. Additional chi square tests revealed that among participants who received vignettes portraying situational couple violence, those who were accurately able to identify the type of violence portrayed in the vignette were more likely to endorse couples treatment as the preferred treatment modality than those who did not accurately identify the type of violence. Additional analyses, however, suggest that accurate identification and appropriate treatment choice may be more difficult in situations in which intimate terrorism is taking place, especially when women are the perpetrators of this abuse. Logistic regression indicated that there was not a significant relationship between therapists' personal experience with IPV and endorsement of treatment type. In addition, differentiation did not moderate the relationship between IPV experienced in participants' own romantic relationships and their endorsement of couples treatment. The current study indicates that marriage and family therapists are likely to make IPV treatment choices primarily based on the type of violence experienced by the couple. It appears that IPV treatment choice is not influenced by personal experience with IPV, but rather by the therapist's accurate identification of IPV type and the gender of the perpetrator of abuse. These findings ultimately highlight the need continued education on IPV, IPV types, gender biases with regards to IPV, and the importance of taking safety into consideration when making treatment decisions.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The process of evaluating teachers has existed for many years and in a myriad of designs. Teacher evaluations are often a rating of instruction in a single observation. Teachers and other stakeholders strive to ensure that students are receiving instruction that promotes learning growth, so assessing those who provide instruction to students is essential.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the past few years, teacher evaluations are not only assessing classroom instruction, but are also measuring teachers' effects on student learning growth. In 2011, the Florida legislature passed the Student Success Act, which revised the requirements for teachers' annual evaluations. One component of the evaluation, the Florida value-added model (FL VAM), is a statistical model that computes a value-added score for teachers. This score represents the value added by a teacher to student learning.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>I investigated the new evaluation system from teachers' perspectives. Teachers from school districts across Florida completed a newly developed survey designed to gauge teachers' knowledge and perceptions about the new evaluation system. Evidence from my findings indicated that Florida teachers are willing to admit their lack of knowledge about FL VAM, and teachers, in general, feel negatively toward this assessment. As well, they lack confidence in the model to produce accurate value-added scores, and they are concerned that their scores may adversely impact their careers as teachers. Due to the rise in value-added assessment of teachers, research should continue to monitor the impact of this evaluation approach on teachers.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Approximately 4.4% of the adult population suffers from Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) (Keesler et al., 2010).  The identification of adults with ADHD can be difficult because the criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM; APA, 2013) were originally designed with children in mind.  Identifying high achieving college students with ADHD has proven even more challenging due to masked academic difficulties until later in life.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The specific population of adults in the college setting (college students) with ADHD are more likely to have protective factors such as higher cognitive abilities and previous academic success (DuPaul, Weyandt, O'Dell, &amp; Varejao, 2009; Glutting, Youngstrom, &amp; Watkins, 2005) than non-college ADHD adults.  Nevertheless, they tend to fall significantly behind persons in college who do not suffer from ADHD (Barkley, Murphy, &amp; Fischer, 2008; DuPaul et al., 2009; Heiligenstein, Guenther, Levy, Savino, &amp; Fulwiler, 1999) and those with ADHD have a higher dropout rate than those without ADHD.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>ADHD has been linked to deficits in Executive Functioning (EF) in the literature (Cortease et al., 2005; Kassubek, Juengling, Ecker, &amp; Landwehrmeyer, 2005; Koechlin, Corrado, Pietrini, &amp; Grafman, 2000; Lewis, Dove, Robbins, Baker, &amp; Owens, 2004; Monchi, Petrides, Strafella, Worsley, &amp; Doyon, 2006; Niendam et al., 2012; Stuss &amp; Alexander, 2000; Stuss, Alexander, Floden, Binns, Levin, &amp; McIntosh, 2002).  There is also evidence that EF abilities are not fully developed until around the third decade.  Both established theory and fMRI imaging support the idea of delayed development (Barkley, 2012).  Therefore, it is hypothesized that there will be a different set of characteristics for the college student population (average age 18-30) than an adult aged 30 or above. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Given that there are some weaknesses in traditional EF testing (e.g., EF and general intellectual level is somewhat correlated) (Salthouse; 1996, 2005), the Barkley Deficits in Executive Functioning Scale (BDEFS) was specifically designed to evaluate EF deficits in adult individuals with ADHD.  This is a new self-report measure identifying functional impairment in EF abilities with five factors.  The goal of this study was to provide further empirical support regarding the validity and reliability of the Barkley Deficits in Executive Functioning Scale (BDEFS; Barkley, 2011b). In addition to the five factors, this scale contains an ADHD-EF Index, which provides an estimate of the likelihood of a diagnosis of adult ADHD (Barkley, 2012b). To date, this scale has not been investigated for evidence of validity and reliability from an independent researcher.  Additionally, college students have not yet been studied (Barkley, 2011b).   Therefore, this study evaluated (a) differences in self- and other-reports on the BDEFS, (b) the relationship between the BDEFS scales and cognitive functioning, (c) the ability of the BDEFS to predict ADHD, and (d) the factor structure of the BDEFS with a college student population.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this study BDEFS self-reports were collected from 596 college students (with and without a diagnosis of ADHD).  The mean age of the participants was 20.5 years of age and most demographic variables were consistent with the statistics published for the university where the data were collected.   To evaluate the differences in the self-report form and the other-informant form of the BDEFS, a Pearson Correlation was conducted comparing self- and other-reports, using only the sample of students with a diagnosis of ADHD.  It was determined that there were statically significant correlations between the BDEFS-self form and the BDEFS-other form.  These correlations were also statistically significantly different from the correlations that Barkley found in his original study.  In addition, there were statistically significant differences in the means between the self- and other-informant forms, indicating that college students in general perceive their symptoms differently, and generally more impaired, than those around them.    Another Pearson Correlation was conducted to determine if the general intelligence of the participant was related to any of the five factors of the BDEFS.  Results indicated that there was an inverse relationship between intellectual ability and time management skills.  As time management skills decreased, intelligence increased.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>When investigating the ADHD-EF index, which is a scale used to predict adult ADHD, a discriminate analysis was conducted.  It was determined that a different set of items was needed to distinguish college students with and without ADHD than was needed to distinguish these groups in the adult population.  Finally, a confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to see if the same factor structure of the BDEFS held true for the population of college students.  Results indicated a moderate to good fit for the factor structure in the college student population.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>While additional support of validity is needed, the current study did provide additional evidence for the validity and reliability of the BDEFS.  A replication of the newly identified items of the ADHD-EF Index that are most predictive of adults with ADHD in the college student population is needed to provide additional support.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Past research has shown that humans possess implicit or unconscious associations which, when activated, affect subsequent behavior. In three studies, I demonstrated a novel implicit association held by some men, an association between women and birds. In Study 1, I provided initial evidence of a Women-Bird association and its autonomy from other common prejudice measures. In Study 2, I demonstrated two consequences for possessing a Women-Bird association: increased sexist hiring decisions and increased dehumanization of women. For my third study, I demonstrated a causal pattern, such that activation of the Women-Bird association caused an increase in dehumanization of women, sexist hiring decisions, and perceptions that a female candidate was incompetent for those who possessed the association. Mediation analysis indicated that activation of the Women-Bird association among those who possessed the association resulted in sexist hiring decisions because these participants perceived the female candidate as less competent.  These findings provide insight into a cause of bias toward women that should be accounted for when attempting to reduce discrimination toward women.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to explore multiple research questions related to foster caregiver protective factors, satisfaction with fostering, and intent to continue fostering.  First, the researcher identified what protective factors (i.e., parental resilience, social connections, concrete supports, and nurturing and attachment) foster caregivers report and to what degree.  Second, the researcher determined whether there was a significant relationship between the independent variables (protective factors) and the dependent variables (satisfaction with fostering and intent to continue fostering).  Next, the researcher examined whether child disruptive behaviors moderated or influenced the nature or strength of the relationship between protective factors and satisfaction as a caregiver.  Third, the researcher examined a second model of whether child behaviors moderated or influenced the nature or strength of the relationship between protective factors and intent to continue fostering.  The sample consisted of 155 licensed foster caregivers from across the United States.  Descriptive statistics (i.e., means, standard deviations, range, internal consistency, skewness, kurtosis, and bivariate correlations), multiple regression, and interaction effects in multiple regression were used to test the various relationships proposed in this model.  First, it was found that foster caregivers generally report a high degree of each protective factor.  Second, there was a significant relationship between protective factors and two domains of satisfaction (challenging aspects of fostering and confidence and satisfaction).  Third, child behaviors served as a significant moderator between some of the protective factors and two domains of satisfaction (challenging aspects of fostering and confidence and satisfaction).  Implications for future research, practice, and policy were discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>There is evidence to suggest that depression and the Apolipoprotein E e4 allele (APOE e4) may act together (i.e., synergistically) to disrupt neuropsychological functioning, which may in turn increase an individual's risk for cognitive decline.  The present study sought to determine whether depression and the APOE e4 allele interact to disrupt key areas of neuropsychological functioning and, in turn, increase risk for dementia.  The study used previously collected data from the Neuropsychological Outcomes of Depression in the Elderly Study (NCODE), which included a sample of clinically depressed older adults undergoing naturalistic treatment for depression and a sample of non-depressed community-dwelling elders.  Structural equation modeling was used to model the relationship between depression status (depressed versus non-depressed participants), APOE e4 (e4, no e4), and their interaction with various areas of neuropsychological functioning (e.g., episodic memory, executive functioning, processing speed).  We examined this relationship cross-sectionally and prospectively over a three-year period, as well as determined risk for dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and global cognitive decline.  We found that depressed, older, less educated, and non-White participants performed worse at baseline on a global measure of cognitive functioning and all areas of neuropsychological functioning, but we did not find a longitudinal effect of these variables.  We also did not find a significant main effect of APOE e4, and we did not find any significant interaction between APOE e4 and depression.  The challenges of testing for gene-environment interactions are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The structure of a tropical cyclone (TC) is a spatial representation of its organizational pattern and distribution of energy acquisition and release. This fingerprint depicts a specific phase in the TC's meteorological lifecycle, reflecting its past and potentially constraining its future development. For a number of reasons, a thorough objective definition of TC structures (especially at the TC core) and an intercomparison of their varieties have been neglected. This lack of knowledge impedes a fuller understanding of TCs, possibly signaling a key reason why TC intensity forecasts, despite numerical model improvements and theoretical advances, have been stagnant in recent years relative to track forecasts.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To improve the understanding and forecasting of tropical cyclones, this research aggregates known methods to identify structure and proposes expanded metrics of structural diagnosis. A 24 year record of limited operational core structure attributes - including aircraft reconnaissance measurements and estimates by operational forecasters - are examined and shown to tease the potential capability of TC structure to guide analysis and forecasting. To mitigate these data set limitations, a new global 26 year multi-platform dataset of satellite microwave imagery is gathered and standardized to facilitate an expanded climatological survey of tropical cyclone structures. New types of structure metrics are objectively developed using morphometric analysis techniques (i.e. size and shape analysis of TC features) based on known tropical cyclone critical features, thereby facilitating a comparison with operational data.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A climatology of TC core structures is presented, demonstrating the observed existence of intensity, size, and shape information in aircraft and satellite data. Composites of relationships between intensity and size metrics show preferred configurations that depend on a TC's structural state. While the newly defined structures provide additional dimensionality that is related to intensity, some TC size relationships are shown to be invariant with intensity. This comparative analysis of observed structural metrics provides further insight in understanding the relationship between TC structural features, to what extent they indicate intensity change, and what physical processes lead to their formation and decay.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>&lt;i&gt;The Calculation of Love&lt;/i&gt;, a novel, follows a precocious fourteen-year-old girl's first semester of high school. After watching her brother have sex with his pregnant teenage girlfriend, Mallory Shreckengost begins reading about the science of depravity. When her research uncovers a &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; article stating that violent sex criminals begin by spying and escalate into criminality, she decides she must diagnose herself as soon as possible. She seeks out a series of increasingly dangerous encounters with strangers, believing that the hunting lessons she's receiving from her grandfather will ensure her safety. Although she soon abandons her project out of boredom, she is outed by a classmate and must confront bullying online and in person and renegotiate her relationship with her family.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation is composed of three essays dealing with renewable energy generation and the demand-side management (DSM) of electric utilities.  The first two essays tackle small-scale and large-scale supply of electricity from renewable sources.  The third one looks into the implications of context and ownership form of electric utilities for DSM.  Understanding the politics and policy of renewable energy generation and the performance of DSM programs is the overall theme of this dissertation.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The first essay highlights the role of local governments in institutionalizing distributed renewable energy generation by leveraging their authority on land use to permit small-scale systems located at customer site. It examines the factors shaping policy adoption on distributed renewable energy generation through the lens of transaction-cost politics.  It teases out the political exchanges and the attendant transaction costs arising from adopting a policy on distributed renewable energy generation.  It examines the transaction resources that enable actors to overcome these barriers.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The second essay focuses on renewable energy generated by investor-owned utilities.  It examines the transaction costs salient to large-scale renewable energy generation in regulated and deregulated states.  It contends that renewable energy generation varies in the way the policy environment shapes the transactions of actors and the way they deal with transaction costs.   Transactions are specific to the characteristics and location of large-scale systems, the community being served, the political institutions present, and the policies being implemented.  Geographic Information System (GIS) is used to delineate the service areas of investor-owned utilities as spatial units of analysis.  Spatial regression analysis is applied to account for the idiosyncratic nature of electricity supply and the legacy system of vertically integrated utilities.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The third essay examines the contextual drivers that affect the performance of DSM programs, that is, the energy efficiency gains of municipal-owned utilities (MOUs) and electric cooperatives.  These factors include the demographic profile and housing stock that characterize the utilities' service territories, and the environmental constituencies, political support, and energy-related polices operating in those areas.  This essay complements existing literature on DSM and energy use, which has largely focused on rationalist models and pro-environmental behavior of individual consumers.  It also looks into how the ownership form of electric utilities affects the relationship between these contextual drivers and energy efficiency gains.   Focus is on MOUs and electric cooperatives since DSM programs generally reside in these utilities and are not implemented by third-party entities.  MOUs and electric cooperatives are similar in size and scope but differ in ownership form, governance structure, and internal controls.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation proposes a new theoretical approach to the study of coproduction; it does so by providing a refined definition of the phenomenon, and responds to two of the largest criticisms of the literature, and incorporating the impact of information on the rate of participation in programs considered coproduction. Included in this new theory is a detailed account of the role of the individual, the role of government and the interactions between the two in jointly producing a public good. This new conceptualization identifies three forms of coproduction: enabled, voluntary, and incentivized. Energy policy is used as an arena in which to test two of these forms of coproduction in an empirical analysis. This research suggests that information and the source of that information along with the monetary costs of participation are the largest barriers to participation in programs that result in coproduction and that the magnitude of these impacts changes according to the form of coproduction. The role of traditional media, newspaper articles, in providing information is examined through content analysis. I detail the impact that clusters of information from newspaper articles may have on policy participation. In addition, I examine participation in three programs offered by the City of Tallahassee. The programs that are examined in depth are a free energy audit program which provides information to customers about how to reduce energy consumption, the rebate program that offers one-time monetary payments that reduce the overall costs of updating appliances, and the low-interest loan program that incentivizes participation through a reduced interest rate guaranteed for the length of the loan up to five years. These three programs fall into two of the three categories of coproduction and are examined for their ability to produce the public good and the determinants of participation. These determinants help to examine differences between the groups of participants, the differences in motivations, the reliance on incentives, and the role of information in participation.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Myosin V, as a member of the myosin family, can "walk" along F-actin to transport many "cargos", such as mRNA and secretary vesicles, to its destination. This study is part of a research project that aims to understand the interaction between myosin V with F-actin through direct visualization of biochemical states of myosin V that bind weakly to F-actin and are thus conformationally heterogeneous. Because of its processivity, it's a good model to illustrate how myosin interacts with F-actin to fulfill its function (Chapter 1).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Specimens of full-length myosin V with F-actin were cryogenically vitrified to maintain the close-to-nature conformation. ADP·Pi was added into the solution to keep myosin V in the inhibited state in which the heads are folded back onto the cargo binding domain thereby preventing both heads from binding to a single actin filament at the same time. Electron Tomography rather than single-particle method was used because the relatively low affinity of inhibited myosin V to F-actin which makes the decoration far away from saturation. With subsequent sub-volume processing, ET can provide molecular-level information for relatively heterogeneous and/or sparse macromolecule complexes (Chapter 2).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>New strategies and methods for processing tomographic sub-volumes with</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>heterogeneity were designed to extract homogenous and meaningful class-averages.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>F-actin repeats with or without myosin V decoration were extracted to do the sub-volume averaging. Multivariate Data Analysis (MDA) and cluster analysis were used to deal with the heterogeneity issue. More homogeneous repeats were clustered into the same classes and corresponding class-averages were generated to improve signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Repeats with myosin V decoration were later identified and grouped together to get the conformational information. Focused classification was used to further separate different conformations of the bound myosin V (Chapter 3).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The new data processing methods present much conformational information of</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>inhibited myosin V on F-actin. The enumeration of bound myosin V shows that inhibited myosin V mainly is bound to F-actin with only one head. Analysis of the binding angle of the lever-arm with respect to the F-actin filament shows the lever-arm angle of most bound myosin V is not close to 90º, which means that most bound myosin might be not in the transition state. This could be due to Pi release after myosin V binds to F-actin such that Myosin V is in the rigor-like state, even though ADP·Pi is present in the solution. However, for some bound myosin V, the lever-arm angle is really close to 90º, which means the lever-arm is in the "up" position or that the myosin head is binding to actin weakly in a previously unidentified orientation. One explanation is that even though the binding to F-actin could accelerate the release of Pi, some bound myosin V might be still frozen with ADP·Pi during fast-freezing. In addition, copies of double-head bound myosin V were found. The existence of double-head binding requires that the two heads be bound to actin in different conformations; this could be because of random Brownian motion of the second head and subsequent collision. Further quasi-atomic models were built and docked into class-averages to determine the possible nucleotide condition and</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>procedure, with quantitative analysis and simulated data verification provides integrated and detailed structural information of inhibited myosin V on F-actin (Chapter 4). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Here we identified and characterized the conformation of inhibited myosin V bound to the F-actin filament. We found most inhibited myosin V bound to F-actin with one head. Also we found the lever-arm of most myosin V could be in a rigor-like position</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>In this dissertation, I examine juror decision making behavior in economic contexts using economic experiments and field data from a natural field experiment. Using these methods I am able to test if behavior conforms to traditional legal, psychological, and theoretical predictions. The first essay (chapter 2) studies the quantitative difference between two standards of proof used in the American legal system in an incentivized experiment. I find no difference in conviction rates but a large difference in errors committed by jurors. The second essay (chapter 3) explores a more general theoretical framework (with jury, voting, among other applications) which tests theoretical predictions in an environment where payoffs from decisions in a social learning setting are interdependent. Individuals deviate from equilibrium behavior in the same fashion as when such interdependencies are not present. The third essay (chapter 4) extends analysis a natural field experiment in Arizona courts and finds differences in juror behavior following a jury courtroom procedural change. I then providing some concluding remarks.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This project establishes how the struggles of modernist artists, such as James Joyce, Samuel Beckett, Franz Kafka, and Witold Gombrowicz create culture as an artistic experience, which happens in the political space in-between the artist and the audience. I argue that "politics" and "action" are necessary for this creation of culture to happen. Following Hannah Arendt's philosophy, "politics" depends on "action" and "action" is creation. At the same time, creation is evolution, in the Bergsonian sense. Following not only Arendt's philosophy but also Henri Bergson's philosophy of becoming, this dissertation explores how politics creates a culture through "action." Even though Bergson does not name action as one of his main concepts, such as durée, "action" becomes part of his philosophy regarding the struggle of the creative mind. For Arendt, "action" detaches life from a life of habit, or a life that rejects creation. Creation by these two philosophers is understood as freedom to create and to perform, and as openness to other possibilities within language, including its deformation and evolution all of them able to create a political scenario that, according to Arendt, disseminate differences. Thus, the existence of culture is only possible through politics.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Despite significant gains in healthcare design knowledge in the past few decades, sources suggest that designing built environments for ill children is an area needing further exploration (Bishop &amp; Said, 2010; Carney et al., 2003). A primary reason is that hospitalized children are a compromised population, and thus difficult to research directly. Further, known design criteria for ill adults may not be appropriate for children, as their physical size and cognitive ability are different from that of adults (Borgers, De Leeuw, &amp; Hox, 2000).  However, literature and guidelines on designing environments for healthy children exist, and these findings may provide knowledge assistive in shaping the design of pediatric healthcare facilities for child cancer patients. In order to examine this premise, this author's study combines literature from three areas - childcare facilities for healthy children, general healthcare facilities, and oncology - with the goal of creating guidelines for healthcare spaces that attend to a child's holistic well-being.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>One of the oncology studies gathered that researched the quality of life in cancer survivors (Ferrell, Dow &amp; Grant,1995) identified four general categories that contribute to the overall wellness of the cancer survivor: physical, social, psychological, and spiritual. It is logical to presume that these categories might also be used to help maintain balanced wellness during the cancer and cancer treatments. In order to verify this assumption, the author cross-compared this study with others (including those concerning healthy children and hospitalized adults) and noticed the significance of these four factors in other areas of research.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The author has used these four categories of human wellness as a means to address the presence and non-presence of holistic design factors within the built environment of a case study pediatric oncology facility. Based on additional research, actionable features were extrapolated from the four general factors into a set of design criteria for ten spaces within the built environment believed to contribute the largest impact among child cancer patients (the study's focus user population). These features were further organized into a checklist-style instrument referred to in this study as the "Holistic Design Criteria". In order to examine the utility and fit of these ideas, the criteria was first used to evaluate the present state of a single case study pediatric facility through observation and staff interviews, seeking to understand how the factors might already be incorporated or where they might be lacking. These evaluations were then cross-compared with four interviews with nursing staff members employed at the case study facility. Finally, the author used these original research findings to guide the hypothetical redesign of the case study facility, putting the criteria's findings into practice. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Through the completion of this study, it was revealed that the case study pediatric facility largely lacked built environment features that are believed to inspire spiritual and social wellness. The facility was found to contain some features that are believed to inspire physical and psychological wellness, such as patient-painted ceiling tiles (psychological) and sound-dampening surfaces (physical) throughout the fourth floor inpatient hallway. In order to supplement the loss, this researcher proposed increasing social and psychological wellness by altering the six inpatient rooms along the east edge of the northern hallway into three suite-style rooms which better accommodate large families. In addition, throughout the inpatient hallways, each portion of the inpatient rooms are grouped by a color and given an aesthetic identity within the hallway in order to increase a sense of community and identity for the patients (social, psychological wellness). This is created through focal ceiling drops and floor color changes in order to signal the entrance to an inpatient room. Within the inpatient rooms themselves, additional areas for personalization and self-expression have also been included (social, psychological wellness). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>It was also revealed through both interviews and observation that opportunities for psychological wellness through nature were difficult to access within the observed fourth floor wing of the hospital, mainly due to the site's current orientation and state, as well as the focus populations' health prohibiting them from coming in contact with plant life. As a result, the researcher proposes renovating the main hallway on the fourth floor to become a psychological escape for patients, medical professionals and families from throughout the fourth floor (psychological, spiritual wellness). The design proposal details expanding this hallway in three segments onto the asphalt roof covering the NICU below, and replacing a portion of the asphalt near the hallway with a low-lying rooftop garden. This way, patients can view nature and experience it without becoming exposed to the associated germs or contaminates (psychological, physical wellness), and the garden will also benefit the hospital by reducing heat reflectivity into the hallway (physical). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Through redesigning the facility to increase opportunities for physical, psychological, social and spiritual wellness among child cancer patients, it is the belief of this researcher that that the proposed design may support healing among the user population. Literature review proposes that holistic wellness design could be of benefit to this population, and the observation and interviews conducted in this study support this concept. It is the goal of this study to add to the body of knowledge for pediatric oncology design, as well as bring attention to and awareness of the potential benefit of designing for holistic wellness in pediatric oncology facilities.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Despite multiple bacterial infections causing widespread damage to the citrus, wine, and other fruit industries, there has been little attention paid to modeling the development and progression of the structures formed by the bacteria within these diseases. A biology primer describing the processes involved in biofilm formation will be followed by a description of bacterial infections within plants. To model these diseases a multiphase framework of partial differential equations will be used to examine the dynamic behavior and fluid/structure interactions of the biological system.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Perturbation analysis will be used to determine potential causes and tendencies of patterns developed by biofilm formed within microfluidic chambers. These patterns represent a dominant mode of instability within the system, and the model equations capture this instability through the use of dispersion relationships. Numerical simulations of the nonlinear system will follow that are consistent with linear results.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Further numerical studies will be used to investigate dynamics on a finite domain resembling the behavior of the system &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in planta&lt;/i&gt;. First, a simulation using a constant inflow velocity will be used to mimic the properties of biofilms grown in the lab. These simulations also include the effects of added material, such as calcium. Second, a constant pressure drop will be imposed on the fluid similar to the transpiration pressure experienced by the xylem fluid within the plant. In these simulations, the growth of biomass causes a decrease in the flux of fluid able to move through the chamber. These results may provide insight into the ability of biofilm to successfully occlude xylem vessels.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This dissertation investigates the determinants for scores in the EFW Area 2: legal structure and security of property rights. To fill out this gap of the existing literature on the determinants of the legal structure, I find that both the level and change in globalization and domestic development are positively associated with the level and change in the legal structure and security of property rights in the cross section and panel data analysis. Moreover, the level and change of political institutions exert a positive impact on the level and change of legal structure and security of property rights after controlling for globalization and domestic development. Furthermore, both the identity of the colonizer and the condition of the colony are one of the important determinants across colonies for legal structure and security of property rights. The post-independence states retain their colonial heritage, which affects the current legal structure and security of property rights.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Butterflies are an algebraic model of the morphisms of the homotopy category of crossed modules and were originally introduced by Behrang Noohi.  Crossed complexes are algebraic structures which generalize crossed modules.  The following dissertation is concerned with adapting butterflies to the full subcategory of crossed complexes called reduced n-crossed complexes.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>People need varying levels of assistance - specifically, solution-oriented information provided during practice - when learning how to solve problems.  This study examined the effects of different levels of problem-solving assistance on learning, mental effort, and time on task when learning proportional reasoning at the middle school level.  Proportional reasoning is an important skill that is both foundational to higher-level mathematics and used in everyday life.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To study assistance in this context, two different types of practice problems were presented to learners: worked examples and tutored problems.  The worked examples provided the steps and the answers to the proportional reasoning problems for the learner to review.  The tutored problems required the learner to solve each step of the problem.  While doing so, the learner received immediate, step-by-step feedback from an example-tracing intelligent tutoring system.  The learner could also receive a hint if requested.  The study had three conditions: worked examples, tutored problems, and a combination of worked examples and tutored problems. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>One hundred forty-three middle school students participated in the study.  Participants were randomly assigned to one of three treatment conditions: tutored problems (low assistance), alternating worked examples and tutored problems (mid-level assistance), and worked examples (high assistance).  Participants in the tutored problems condition needed to solve eight proportional reasoning story problems.  Participants in the worked examples condition were presented with eight proportional reasoning story problems that were already solved.  Participants in the alternating worked examples and tutored problems condition were first presented with a worked example, followed by a tutored problem.  In total, there were eight problems, four of each type.  The problems consisted of four isomorphic problem pairs, meaning the story problems and values were different, but the structure in which a learner solved the problem was the same.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The results showed a significant difference between the three treatment conditions on learning.  Learners in the worked example condition scored higher on the post-test than learners in the two other conditions.  There was not a significant difference on overall mental effort across conditions.  However, when analyzing the isomorphic problem pairs, there was a significant difference in the change of mental effort expended between problem 1 and problem 2 in the pair for pairs 2 and 3, but not for pairs 1 and 4.  There was also a significant difference on time on task.  Learners in the worked example condition took less time to complete the treatment problems than learners in the two other conditions.  Upon further examination in terms of time on task, there was also a significant main effect of treatment condition on time, a significant main effect on problem in the isomorphic problem pair, and a significant interaction effect.  In the tutored problem condition, time spent on the second problem in the pair was significantly less than the first problem in the pair.  In the alternating worked example and tutored problem condition, the second problem in the pair took significantly more time than the first problem in the pair.  In the worked example condition, time spent on the second problem was significantly less than the time spent on the first problem in the pair. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The limitations of the study focus on the duration of the study, the alignment of learning materials and assessments, the authentic learning environment, and the intelligent tutoring system environment, and may provide helpful guidance for other researchers who wish to conduct research in this area and for teachers who are interested in using an intelligent tutoring system in their classrooms.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The findings of this study have several implications for further research and classroom instruction.  Future studies might be situated in an authentic classroom setting, with the treatment embedded in the mathematics curriculum.  Additionally, the hint use data might be mined to learn more about how learners use the available assistance in the tutored condition.  One key implication for instruction is the usefulness of worked examples in situations with a compressed timeframe and novice learners.  Research considering these limitations and implications might provide educators with a better understanding of how to achieve the optimal balance of assistance in mathematics education for middle school students.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The deep-sea, soft-bottom habitat is considered the largest ecosystem on Earth, yet little is known about the biogeography of the infauna.  This dissertation examines the species' ranges of the meiofaunal taxon Harpacticoida (Crustacea:  Copepoda) and the macrofaunal abundance and similarity for the continental rise off the west coast of the United States.  Specifically, I examined these fauna at two depths (2700 and 3700 m) and at four latitudes (approximately 34 N, 37 N, 40 N, and 43 N).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To examine the species ranges of deep-sea harpacticoids, I used morphological and DNA-sequencing methods to assign individuals to species.  To do so, I had to first develop new primers for my target genes.  In the process of designing primers, I sequenced the complete mitochondrial genome, which is the eighth to be sequenced, of one species of shallow-water harpacticoid and ~75% of another (Chapter 2).  The two mitochondrial genomes were nearly identical to each other and were more similar to the mitochondrial genome of a Poecilostomatitoida (Crustacea:  Copepoda) than to the other Harpacticoida mitochondrial genomes.  Copepod mitochondrial genomes are highly rearranged, so this similarity among copepod orders supports studies that suggest mitochondrial gene arrangements could be used to reconstruct copepod phylogenies.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In addition to developing new primers, I had to develop an efficient DNA isolation method (Chapter 3) for individual copepods that would allow me to recover intact exoskeletons for morphological analysis.  With this method, I was able to recover intact exoskeletons suitable for morphological analysis 91.6% of the time.  The DNA isolated was stable for up to 32 months, and the nuclear 18S rRNA and mitochondrial cytb primers designed and tested amplified 96.6% and 96.3% of the individuals respectively.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Of the 160 deep-sea individuals with morphological, 18S, and cytb data that were used in the species' range study (Chapter 4), they were assigned to 54 species on the basis of congruency among the data.  Of the 45 species that had more than one individual, 13 had 1000-km-scale ranges and another 10 had 500-km-scale ranges.  These results were surprising because previous studies had suggested that morphologically identical but genetically distinct (cryptic) species were common for harpacticoids, so I expected the large (&gt; 1000 km) ranges reported for morphological studies were over estimates.  This study is the first to use morphological and molecular methods to assign deep-sea harpacticoids to species, and I found only one case of cryptic species and 18 cases of phenotypically diverse species.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In Chapter 5, I report macrofaunal abundance and similarity of the southern six stations and identify environmental variables the best explain variation among my stations.  I found that depth patterns in abundance were group-specific and that all groups either did not differ significantly with depth or decreased significantly with depth.  The environmental variables that had parallel patterns with those groups that did decrease significantly with depth were chlorophyll a and the stable isotope 15N, which are proxies for food.  Regional patterns were also group specific but no environmental variables showed parallel patters with regional differences.  Aplacophoran mollusks were the largest contributor to depth and regional faunal dissimilarity, and depth, 15N, and sediment particle-size distribution best explained the variation in the multivariate cloud of faunal similarity.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>School librarians' essential function of providing access to information, and instruction and guidance in its evaluation, use, production, and communication has endured over a century of change in education, technology, and society's access to and use of information.  What has changed is how school librarians perform their roles.  As the rate of technological change has accelerated, perceptions of school librarians' roles have not always kept pace.  School librarians may base their role perceptions on documentary sources, including professional standards, job descriptions, and performance evaluations.  School administrators may have different perceptions of school librarians' roles, based on their past experiences with school librarians.  When expected, perceived, and enacted roles differ, school librarians may experience role ambiguity and conflict.  With the number of school librarians in decline, those who remain may experience job insecurity.  Feelings of job insecurity combined with the pressure on schools to achieve more with fewer resources may cause school librarians to increase their role performance and experience role overload.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This research was designed to analyze how the roles of school librarians were represented in the performance expectations in the professional standards found in Empowering Learners: Guidelines for School Library Programs as compared to the performance expectations found in the job descriptions of school librarians in Florida, to determine what kinds of role performance were expected of school librarians in Florida that were not represented in the professional standards, and to determine to what extent the performance expectations on Florida's school librarians' job descriptions compared to the performance measures on their performance evaluations.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The researcher used qualitative content analysis to compared performance expectations from school librarians' professional standards to those in their job descriptions.  Performance expectations on the job description that were not represented in the professional standards were open coded and categorized.  The researcher used qualitative content analysis to compare the performance expectations on school librarians' job descriptions and the performance measures on their performance evaluations.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The researcher found that while performance expectations from all of the roles and guidelines in the professional standards were represented in Florida's school librarians' job descriptions, the most frequently represented role was that of Instructional Partner, and the most frequently represented guideline was Collection and Information Access; the former speaks to the future of the profession, while the latter represents its past.  Not all types of role performance expected of school librarians in Florida were represented in the professional standards.  Of the open coded performance expectations, those related to Library Operations and Services were the most frequently represented.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The analysis of agreement between school librarians' job descriptions and performance evaluations found that many of the evaluations had low rates of agreement with their corresponding job descriptions.  The researcher discovered half of Florida's school districts are using instruments designed for instructional personnel or support staff to assess school librarians' performance, instead of differentiated evaluations designed specifically for school librarians; nearly all of these instructional personnel or support staff evaluations had low rates of agreement with their corresponding job description.  The researcher also found that when the performance evaluation was newer and the job description was older, the evaluations tended to have lower rates of agreement.  A few performance evaluations had a greater number of performance measures than the job description had performance expectations; these evaluations tended to have lower rates of agreement.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The researcher proposed that school district officials may wish to implement several practices regarding job descriptions and performance evaluations, including establishing a revision cycle, where these documents are periodically reviewed and updated; changing revision practices, so that when either a job description or performance evaluation is updated, the other document is reviewed as well; and to ensure that there is a balance between the number of performance expectations and performance measures on the two documents.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study fills a gap in the research about school librarians' roles and performance evaluation, and creates a foundation for further research.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study examines the idea of escape in the lives and fiction of Kate Chopin, Edith Wharton, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Ernest Hemingway, addressing how these individuals embraced an ethos of escape that had continuously developed in Western society at least since the Enlightenment.  Specifically, it explores the disassociation, displacement, and angst characterizing aesthetic modernism, feelings greatly affecting these authors and shaping their literary characters.  As traditional life markers lost significance during the first quarter of the twentieth-century, authors (and their characters) found it more difficult to distinguish themselves in a world where previous value systems seemed dead and new beliefs powerless to be born.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The person of the expert witness presents several problems for rhetoricians. This thesis considers what resources are available for judges to decide between competing expert testimony over subjects where they themselves do not have expert knowledge. Applying Kenneth Burke's Pentad to the expert testimony and the written decision of Kitzmiller v. Dover, a 2005 case where experts disputed whether "intelligent design" should or should not be considered science, I argue that 1) there exist rhetorical features apart from subject knowledge which constitute the performance of expertise and 2) the judge's decision in this case relied more on how these features constituted a scientific ethos rather than on the propositional content that was disputed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Although "modernism" has been understood by many scholars worldwide first and foremost as a Euro-American, multi-faceted aesthetic movement, modanizumu ("modernism") has also been conceptualized by Japanese and Western scholars alike as a historical and artistic epoch in Japan. In previous scholarship on Japanese yougaku (art music in a Western style), modernism is almost always identified as a post-1945 phenomenon. Post-war Japanese musical modernism, however, has a prehistory written by Japanese artists and intellectuals in the early twentieth century, especially between 1905 and 1937 (the end of the Russo-Japanese War and the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War). The products of these "interwar" modernists have often been dismissed by post-war scholars as the vacant copying of contemporary Western styles, most especially in music. But Japanese artists in music and other creative fields reacted to modernity in a variety of noteworthy ways, while consciously positioning themselves within an international modernist culture. This dissertation demonstrates that while Japanese artists drew heavily upon Western styles they were also responding to and writing about internationalism, fragmentation of established arts organizations and their respective ideologies, substantial breaks from tradition, and the theorizing and practical development of innovative methodologies in their search for the artistic "new" at roughly the same time that Western artists grappled with parallel issues. In many cases the Japanese responded quite differently to these issues from their European and American counterparts. Ultimately I argue that interwar yougaku is another fruitful avenue for the study of Japanese modernism, alongside the expanding body of scholarship on Japanese modernism within other fields. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The primary focus of my project is on yougaku written by Japanese composers during the Japanese interwar era. I examine how several composers saw themselves and their music in relation to the broader context of Japanese modernism by examining their music, writings, and biographies. The music of these composers encompasses a variety of styles and mediums; it also reflects a hybridity that incorporated local traditions, so that the result was not mere imitation but hybrid creations that captured each individual composer's responses to specific conditions of his or her time and place. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>By bringing music to the forefront, I contribute to interdisciplinary discourse on Japanese modernism, a topic that has received increased attention over the past twenty-five years. I also address a lacuna in Japanese modernist studies: yougaku has received startlingly little attention in English-language scholarship on Japanese modernism. This lacuna is even more glaring because many scholars have discussed the influence that Japanese art and music have had upon Western modernism, but they have not considered the reciprocity of this process. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>While music reflects many of the same modernist values as other Japanese contemporary arts, it also presents differences that complicate current views of Japanese modernism. Many interwar Japanese groups and individuals claimed analogous Western movements as their major influences; as a result, it has been tempting to view Japanese creations as "Japanese versions" of these Western movements.  However, the artists within these movements desired to change fundamentally the direction of their nation's creative activities, not in a Western direction but in a new Japanese one.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The first two chapters of the dissertation provide broad historical and cultural context for my case studies of interwar composers. The Introduction considers multiple conceptions of "modernism" through close examination of key sources relating to interwar music and modernist aesthetics in various contexts. As this chapter demonstrates, interwar Japanese yougaku has not received the same attention as the literary and visual arts have in regards to Japanese modernism, especially in English language sources. Chapter Two reviews the history of Japan between 1868 and the late 1930s as it relates to music. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Each of my three case studies (Chapters Three, Four, and Five) focuses on one composer whose aesthetic stance and/or practical application of modernist thought reflected broader trends of the interwar era. Yamada Kousaku (1886-1965) served as an unofficial arts and music ambassador; he also represents an early generation of graduates from the Tokyo Music School and the shared practices of those graduates studying abroad in Germany. Unlike Yamada, Sugahara Meirou (1897-1988) was largely self-taught, and he did not travel to Europe until after the end of World War II. He championed modern French music, and his own works exhibit a Japanese neoclassical style. As a female composer, Yoshida Takako (1910-56) offers a completely different perspective on interwar yougaku. Through her roles a progressive composer and as a social activist, Yoshida emulated the Japanese "Modern Girl," an archetype closely associated with Japanese interwar modernism.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This current study investigated bilingual and second language (L2) lexical processing in sentence context. There is overwhelming evidence from bilingual word recognition studies to support the notion that both languages are active during lexical processing (e.g., Van Heuven, Dijkstra, &amp; Grainger, 1998; Dijkstra, Timmermans, &amp; Schriefers, 2000, etc.). While the `default' setting for lexical access may be non-selective in nature, there are instances in which lexical access is more selective. Past research found that bilinguals process more selectively when sentences are constrained for semantics. Other studies found that individuals use grammatical class information (i.e., noun or verb status) to guide lexical access. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>While it appears the semantic context of a sentence or word class effects may constrain selectivity, an often-overlooked dimension that could potentially affect selectivity is syntax. The current study examined how the cues of semantics and syntax interact and jointly affect lexical processing. In the first experiment, I investigated whether bilinguals and L2 learners processed words selectively or non-selectively in sentences constrained for semantics and syntax. The results showed cross-linguistic effects for intermediate L2 learners only. In the second experiment, I examined whether bilinguals and L2 learners showed sensitivity to grammatical class in sentences constrained for semantics. The findings showed that verbs were processed differently than nouns regardless of sentence context. The results from these experiments give implications for models of bilingual word processing, such as the Bilingual Interactive Activation+ (BIA+) model (Dijkstra &amp; Van Heuven, 2002).</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Since the year 2000, the number of golfers in the United States has steadily declined (National Golf Foundations, 2013). Coupled with an oversupply of golf courses and a sluggish real estate market, this drop has contributed to a cessation in domestic golf course development. This same failed model that incorporates golf courses as amenities to sell real estate is being reproduced in developing countries searching for an economic panacea. Golf courses are being developed in emerging nations for the primary purpose of financial reward, with minimal regard for environmental or social sustainability (Wheeler &amp; Nauright, 2006). The public is often led to believe that golf course development will create employment opportunities for the community, bring boundless fiscal returns in the form of tax revenues and increased tourism, and attract additional small businesses to the region (Lim &amp; Patterson, 2008). During my visits to Panama, I saw the beginnings of this unsustainable practice of golf course development being touted as an economic cure-all, all possible because of President Martinelli's free-market policies encouraging foreign development through free-trade agreements, relocation tax incentives, and limited restrictions on foreign capital.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Panama is an emerging country. Under current President Martinelli's tenure, Panama's poverty rate dropped from 33% to 26%, its unemployment rate declined from 12% to 4.4%, its literacy rate is 95%, while its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) index to debt ratio is 39.2% (Central Intelligence Agency, 2013). The country is currently expanding the Panama Canal (more than doubling its earning capacity), building a metro system in the capital city, and constructing an airport in the country's interior to provide tourists with convenient access to the new beachfront golf resorts and housing projects developed over the past ten years. The Club de Panama hosts the Buy.com Tour's first golf event of the season, positioning Panama as the golf</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>mecca of Central America. The political environment is primed for golf course development in Panama, foreign investors are being incentivized to relocate, and American golf companies have already established their presence.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>As I examined the economic, environmental, and social sustainability of golf course development in Panama and its effects on key stakeholders, the information I gathered via ethnography strongly points towards the Panamanian government's neo-liberal initiatives as a significant contributor to the growth of golf course development. Additionally, the results of the study lead me to the conclusion that stakeholders affected by golf course development do not benefit or suffer equally, as suggested by Orridge (1981) and Marsden (1995). The current U.S. model of utilizing golf courses as an amenity to sell real estate is not sustainable; in fact, none of the ownership models discussed in the literature are in themselves sufficient to ensure equal benefit to all primary stakeholders. In summary, golf continues to be a sport synonymous with capitalist societies; however, without the introduction of a more balanced alternative to golf course development and operations, many key stakeholders in Panama may be at risk should these facilities fail to provide their investors an adequate profit.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Although much research has been carried out to identify the demographic and psychological variables linked to distinctive attitudes toward persons with disabilities (PWD), no known research has measured the association between spirituality and attitudes toward PWD. In this study, a sample of non-disabled undergraduate and graduate university students was surveyed to measure for possible association. Ratings of spiritual involvement and beliefs and intrinsic spirituality were examined in relation to ratings in four attitudinal domains: inclusion, discrimination, gains, and prospects. Higher endorsement of spiritual involvement and beliefs was found to be significantly correlated with more favorable attitudes toward PWD for inclusion and prospects. Higher intrinsic spirituality was found to be significantly correlated with more favorable attitudes toward PWD for inclusion. A significant inverse association was also identified between higher intrinsic spirituality and more favorable attitudes toward PWD for gains. Differences in gender were also examined. Female students reported significantly more favorable attitudes toward PWD for prospects. Male students reported significantly more favorable attitudes toward PWD for discrimination and gains. Implications are discussed in light of the services provided to PWD by faith-based organizations.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The association between sexual minority status and poor mental health is well established.  However, despite the recent increase in studies investigating health disparities between heterosexual and sexual minority youth and adults, few consider the multidimensional and developmental nature of sexuality when assessing its association with mental health outcomes over various contexts and time.  The current study employed the use of complex methodology to assess human sexuality across multiple dimensions (i.e., sex, romantic/sexual attraction, romantic/sexual behavior, and sexual orientation/identity) and developmental stages (i.e., adolescence to adulthood) to assess between and within-group differences on outcomes of depression and suicidality.  The influence of interpersonal relationships (parental and peer) and contexts (school and community) on the association between sexual status and mental health outcomes were also examined.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In Study 1 latent class analysis was used to identify three groups in adolescence that varied in sexual status.  Group comparisons indicated that those who were same- or both-sex attracted reported higher levels of depression and suicide concurrently and at later developmental stages.  Proposed risk and protective factors did not fully attenuate differences in outcomes, although the cumulative influence of these effects mitigated differences for depression in early adolescence.  Repeated measures latent class analysis on indicators of sexuality from adolescence to adulthood (Study 2) identified five groups that varied in sexual status and sexual maturation and that were differentially related in suicidality and depression over time.  Groups identified by sexual minority status characteristics (same- or both- sex attraction or behavior, or nonheterosexual identities) were most at risk across time; however, these groups also demonstrated differences from one another.  Longitudinal associations with outcomes identified differential timing of risk, and the analysis of risk and protective factors indicated that youth contexts alter the association between sexual status and mental health outcomes.  When assessing the relationship between sexual status groups and trajectories of depression from adolescence to adulthood (Study 3) results indicated four distinct trajectories characterizing chronic low risk, early risk, later risk, and chronic high risk.  Findings indicated that groups characterized by sexual minority attraction, behavior, and identity were associated with later and chronic high risk trajectories from adolescence to adulthood when compared to heterosexual groups.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Together, results indicate both between- and within-group differences in sexual status and the subsequent association with mental health outcomes.  Investigation of risk and protective factors revealed that youth interpersonal relationships and environments act as both mediators and moderators of the relationship between sexual status and mental health, with more robust influences on depression than suicidality and on concurrent rather than longitudinal outcomes.  Implications for research, theory, programming, and policy are also discussed.  Overall, finding support previous sexual minority health disparities research but highlight the need for within-group studies to assess how differences among sexual minorities and their experiences contribute to mental health outcomes across the lifespan.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This study investigated the relationship(s) between deficits of executive functioning ability and mindfulness as measured by Barkley's Deficits in Executive Functioning Scale (BDEFS) and the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) respectively. ADHD is a disorder affecting millions of individuals, including children. Currently it is  the most diagnosed of all childhood psychological disorders with about half of those diagnosed continuing to experience symptoms into adulthood (CDC, 2010). The psychological construct of ADHD has been redefined recently by Barkley, opening the door for new conceptualization and treatment options (Barkley 2012). ADHD has been described as being synonymous with deficits in EF (Barkley, 2012). The current study's purpose was to evaluate the relationship(s) that exist between deficits of  EF and mindfulness as evaluated by two prominent measures. Findings of the current study suggest mindfulness is related to EF ability, regardless of ADHD status. Mindfulness, as measured by higher scores on the FFMQ, appears to predict fewer EF deficits, and lower total scores on the BDEFS. The current study also examined if gender or ADHD status might influence the relationship between ADHD and mindfulness and concluded that they do not. Finally, the study also evaluated if the FFMQ could predict ADHD status as accurately as the BDEFS. The research findings indicate that both measures are significant predictors of ADHD, with the BDEFS being slightly higher (77% compared to 66%). This study supports the notion that mindfulness training might represent a viable treatment option for those with ADHD.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Electrical power systems utilizing electromagnetic devices, namely those of electrical ships, are subject to nonlinearities from regenerative loads, distributed energy storage systems, and onboard loads such as air handling and fluid pumps. Thus, accurate and timely electromagnetic (EM) device models are required in order to fully assess the impact of such transient and/or nonlinear activity. Specifically, by exploiting an often overlooked technique, i.e. the magnetic equivalent circuit (MEC) modeling method, a solution of adequate granularity for the EM device may be attained while still obeying a faster time commitment when compared to the simulation standard for EM devices, the finite element analysis (FEA) technique. The Hardware in the Loop (HIL) concept synergizes with expedient modeling methods, potentially allowing a wider range of dynamics to be observed in large scale simulations or even tested hardware systems. By scaling down the next generation all electric ships integrated power system (NGIPS) to a power level suitable for an academic laboratory environment, the nonlinear effects of EM devices may be investigated via the HIL concept and the MEC modeling method, given that the runtime is acceptable. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This work proposes to develop a novel "real time" MEC (RT MEC) machine model, to ensure the aforementioned runtime. A switched reluctance machine (SRM) is used as a case study device due to both its inherent nonlinearity and it providing an ideal foundation for incorporating various characteristics of the MEC modeling technique. The proposed RT MEC concept will be implemented on a field programmable gate array (FPGA). The advantages of FPGA realization include the inherently parallel nature, a substantially cheaper real time (RT) platform when compared to computationally efficient FEA methods that require dedicated, elaborate resources and application specific hardware. Furthermore, FPGA realization provides a fully customizable solution in terms of numerical methods, time step, HIL interfacing and system expansion. The primary contribution of this work is the RT MEC methodology; more specifically, a high fidelity, real time platform exploited for dynamic SRM modeling, an undoubtedly nonlinear device. RT-MEC contributes higher accuracy and lighter computational loads when compared to commercially available modeling techniques adhering to similar time constraints; ultimately, this yields faster simulation times and more accurate HIL simulation or Power Hardware in the Loop (PHIL) emulations. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Further exercising the RT MEC concept, a variety of novel applications can arise that are uniquely capable of accentuating the nonlinear intricacies and effects assimilated into machine connected systems. Expanding, RT MEC can provide a state of the art tool useful for assessing overall system impact when subjected to electromechanical transients, control strategies and power electronics; providing pertinence and merit to the principal contribution. Potential applications include investigating the nonlinear effects of loading the NGIPS via a PHIL implementation, emulated via SRM winding pulses or utilizing SRM RT MEC models with large scale wind system simulations to study the impact an SRM motor type has on wind farm design.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The 14-3-3 family of proteins is implicated in the regulation of a broad range of key neuronal processes. Previous human and animal studies have provided evidence for an association between 14-3-3 proteins and schizophrenia. Here, I report the characterization of the 14-3-3 functional knockout (FKO) mice that perinatally express an isoform-independent 14-3-3 inhibitor peptide in the brain.  Fluorescent microscopy was first used to determine the specific transgene expression pattern in the brain for each 14-3-3 FKO founder line. Results from initial behavioral screenings of the 14-3-3 FKO founder lines identified a variety of behavioral changes in different lines and these alterations are also correlated with specific transgene expression patterns. Further behavior characterization revealed that certain 14-3-3 FKO mice exhibit a variety of behavioral changes that correspond to the core symptoms of schizophrenia. I show that these behavioral deficits may be attributed to alterations in multiple neurotransmission systems in the 14-3-3 FKO mice. In addition, administration of dopamine receptor antagonist drugs, such as clozapine or haloperidol, are sufficient to attenuate certain schizophrenia-associated behavioral deficits of the 14-3-3 FKO mice. Disruption of 14-3-3 proteins has previously been linked to improper neuronal development. Consistently, we identify global and region-specific reductions in brain volume and corresponding wet weights. Particularly, inhibition of 14-3-3 proteins results in a reduction of dendritic complexity and spine density in forebrain excitatory neurons, which may underlie an altered synaptic activity in the 14-3-3 FKO mice. Together, my data provide a link between 14-3-3 dysfunction, synaptic alterations, and schizophrenia-associated behavioral deficits.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The current study examined the efficacy of a specialized mental health court in reducing recidivism for severely mentally ill defendants with comorbid substance use disorders.  There is a wealth of research supporting the efficacy of mental health courts in reducing recidivism for those with severe mental illness; however, the benefit of these courts for individuals with severe mental illness and comorbid substance use disorders has received limited empirical attention.  A court database of defendants (n=514) who were enrolled in a traditional adversarial court or a specialized mental health court was examined in this study.  Recidivism was assessed across different outcome variables: frequency, severity, and length of time to reoffend.  When compared to participants in traditional adversarial court, enrollment in mental health court was associated with a greater length of time to rearrest and a reduction in the number of participants who were rearrested.  Group differences between those with and without comorbid substance use disorders who were enrolled in the mental health court were not found across recidivism outcome metrics.  Limitations and future directions for research are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Forecasting a univariate target time series in high dimensions with very many predictors poses challenges in statistical learning and modeling. First, many nuisance time series exist and need to be removed. Second, from economic theories, a macroeconomic target series is typically driven by few latent factors constructed from some macroeconomic indices. Consequently, a high dimensional problem arises where deleting junk time series and constructing predictive factors simultaneously, are meaningful and advantageous for accuracy of the forecasting task. In macroeconomics, multiple categories are available with the target series belonging to one of them. With all series available we advocate constructing category level factors to enhance the performance of the forecasting task. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We introduce a novel methodology, the Sparse Factor Auto-Regression (SFAR) methodology, to construct predictive factors from a reduced set of relevant time series. SFAR attains dimension reduction via joint variable selection and rank reduction in high dimensional time series data. A multivariate setting is used to achieve simultaneous low rank and cardinality control on the matrix of coefficients where $ell_{0}$-constraint regulates the number of useful series and the rank constrain elucidates the upper bound for constructed factors. The doubly-constrained matrix is a nonconvex mathematical problem optimized via an efficient iterative algorithm with a theoretical guarantee of convergence. SFAR fits factors using a sparse low rank matrix in response to a target category series. Forecasting is then performed using lagged observations and shrinkage methods. We generate a finite sample data to verify our theoretical findings via a comparative study of the SFAR. We also analyze real-world macroeconomic time series data to demonstrate the usage of the SFAR in practice.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Global demand for clean sustainable energy is growing with the planet's population.  While fossil fuels are the current standard, many are looking to the nearly endless energy supplied by the Sun.  Because of the potential cost benefit over conventional silicon solar cells, dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are a popular research topic.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In Chapter One, current fuel sources and cost as well as the present DSSC research are discussed. A description and explanation of DSSC device principles are also provided.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter Two provides an overview of the challenges for DSSC and ways these might be overcome: multichromophoric absorption, better charge injection, donor-acceptor charge separation.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In Chapter Three the synthetic schemes and methods for the dye molecules are discussed. Characterization of these dyes by 1H and 13C NMR and mass spectrometry are also presented.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In Chapter Four, individual dyes are assembled into Zinc-porphyrin***peryleneimide and zinc phthalocyanine***peryleneimide dyads in solution.  The dyads as well as individual dyes will be characterized in solution by UV-vis, NMR, and electrochemical techniques to measure the absorption, binding constants, and redox potentials.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter Five describes how DSSC are constructed from a dye coated working electrode, platinized indium tin oxide (Pt/ITO) counter electrode, and I&amp;#8722;/I3&amp;#8722; redox mediator.  The TiO2-coated F: SnO2 (FTO), working electrode was functionalized with supramolecular dyad systems in a two-step process.  Then Current/Voltage relationship and Incident Photon to Current Conversion Efficiency of the DSSC devices were measured. These measurements found that multichromphoric dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on self-assembled zinc-porphyrin***peryleneimide and zinc phthalocyanine***peryleneimide dyads exhibit higher device efficiency than individual dye DSSCs.  The novel ZnPc***peryleneimide system has the highest reported efficiency (&amp;#951; = 2.3%) among DSSCs made of supramolecular dyad chromophores.  Increased efficiency of dyad systems can be attributed to co-sensitization as well as vectorial electron transfer that lead to better electron-hole separation in the device.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter Six describes how the electron deficient 3,4,9,10-perylenediimide (PDI-12) selectively undergoes thermal ET from strong Lewis basic OH&amp;#8722; and F&amp;#8722; anions, but remains electronically and optically silent to poor Lewis basic anions, as ET and CT events are turned OFF. These interactions have been fully characterized by UV/Vis, NMR, and EPR spectroscopies. These results demonstrate the generality of anion-induced ET events in aprotic solvents, as long as the electronic requirements are satisfied.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Twenty to 30% of defendants undergoing criminal forensic evaluations have been reported to be malingering.  Given that the most common type of criminal forensic evaluation is the assessment of competency to stand trial, the assessment of malingering during competency evaluations is very important.  Most malingering literature focuses on psychiatric malingering (i.e. feigned psychosis), although in assessment of competency, the larger issue involves feigned deficits in factual or legal knowledge.  The relationship between intelligence and performance on malingering tests is also important because individuals with intellectual deficits may be incorrectly identified as malingering on these tests.  The current study used a sample of state psychiatric hospital residents who had been adjudicated incompetent to proceed to trial and several groups of students instructed to simulate malingering or incompetence.  It was hypothesized that adding an additional administration of the Inventory of Legal Knowledge (ILK) would improve the identification of individuals motivated to feign factual knowledge deficits.  The results of this hypothesis were supported in the student simulation sample but not in the hospital sample.  Further analyses attempted to identify an optimal cut-score on the ILK due to a recent critique on its psychometric properties and the results of these analyses differed by sample and by the independent criterion variables used to identify individuals malingering.  Finally, the current study examined the relationship between intelligence and performance on the ILK and indicated two items on the ILK which were correlated with intelligence.   Future directions and implications of this study are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation begins the important work of bringing living memorials, the spontaneous and everyday construction of memorials following in a tragedy, into the landscape of rhetorical theory. The value of investigating living memorials is considerable. First, living memorials enrich our growing understanding of human persuasion in the twenty-first century. Second, they suggest new practices of multimodality, illustrating how materials, not just words, can be used to advance social action. Finally, they contribute to our understanding of the construction of community as collaboration between human and nonhuman agents. Living memorials enhance not only our knowledge of rhetoric but also of the ways performance pervades everyday life, expanding the boundaries of what we consider rhetorical performances. With the goal of bringing living memorials into the landscape of rhetorical theory, this project advances four research questions: 1) What are living memorials? Given their diverse appearance, how might we characterize their nature? 2) What work do living memorials perform? In other words, what is their function(s)? 3) Given their nature and function(s), what insights do we derive from their evaluation? 4) Given their evaluation, what conclusions can we draw about what living memorials persuade into existence? To answer those questions, this project establishes a spectrum of living memorials based on a survey of extant memorial types. That spectrum ranges from living memorials that bleed into national memorials to living memorials that dialogue with vernacular and institutional agents to living memorials that are completely everyday. Then, with this spectrum as a guide, this study explores selected living memorials according to a three-part analysis based on a framework devised by Sonja Foss to explore visual rhetorical artifacts. That framework directs attention to nature, function, and evaluation yielding a rich array of insights on living memorials.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>     First, using a broad selection of memorials from across the spectrum, the analysis ascertained the nature of living memorials, identifying that polyvocal--a collection of many "voices"--is the organizing principle of living memorials, and it manifests itself in five ways: living memories manifest polyvocality in that they are instable, material, communal, interruptive, and self-authorizing. Together the terms that comprise the nature of living memorials challenge a discourse-based rhetorical theory by drawing attention to how different rhetorical elements function visually.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>     Second, enriching Foss's analytic of function with Aristotle's theory of discourse types, this project focuses on selected representative examples from key points on the spectrum. This dissertation uses Aristotle as the starting point for function because he organizes discourse forms according to social function, according to the action it is used to accomplish. The AIDS Memorial Quilt performs an epideictic function (Chapter three, "Individual Quilts, Collected Together"). The Quilt communicates a message of praise and blame and fulfills a purpose of communal education, an education oriented towards motivating future political action to alleviate the AIDS crisis. The NYC Ghost Bikes perform a function of deliberate rhetoric (Chapter four, "Ghost Riders"). Ghost Bikes share a deliberative emphasis on future action, transforming the site of the memorial from one of grief to one of protest--one that threatens mainstream automobile culture. The Caylee Anthony memorial performs a function of forensic rhetoric, albeit an everyday version of this Aristotelian discourse function (Chapter five, "(Unrealized) Justice for Caylee"). The community performs a forensic rhetoric of their own, to pursue justice on their own terms instead of according to the prescribed procedures of the official legal system. This project concludes that to varying degrees each living memorial possesses features of the other Aristotelian functions, revealing that these discourse genres are not as stable as previously conceived. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>     Third, the dialogue between living memorials and the Aristotelian topology offers key findings into evaluation, or the effectiveness of the text's ability to perform its function. For instance, the AIDS Memorial Quilt yields insights into a latent characteristic of epideictic rhetoric: revisionary (Chapter three). I define revisionary epideictic as a visual event where the primary purpose is to compare stories so as to amplify something the community needs to take up. Furthermore, the NYC Ghost Bikes require us to re-conceptualize the role of rhetor in deliberative rhetoric, a role that can be occupied by a nonhuman artifact (Chapter four). The things that make up our lives have value not only sentimentally but also have persuasive force of their own. Once we position the Ghost Bikes as speakers, they perform their work of providing counsel about a problem that needs to be addressed. Finally, the Caylee Anthony Memorial derives a forensic forum to match its function of everyday forensic rhetoric (Chapter five). In the shared creation of the memorial site, the community also shares in the construction of an everyday courtroom, a forum where they can discuss issues of justice and prevention. Together, the evaluation of living memorials reveals new applications of the Aristotelian discourse functions.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Finally, the combination of nature, function, and evaluation establish living memorials phenomena important to rhetorical studies. This analysis highlights four key implications. First, living memorials challenge public memory, identifying an alternative to what and who should be remembered. Second, living memorials transform Aristotle's tripartite typology, revising them in light of composing practices today particularly in terms of visual-material texts and revealing characteristics latent within the verbal speech genres. Third, living memorials shift our focus to the everyday sphere, to ordinary performances of the everyday. Finally, living memorials enact new practices of multimodality, particularly emphasizing the agency within the material mode, the ability to ordinary objects to enact social action.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Switched Reluctance Machine (SRM) is known for being one of the oldest electric machine designs. Unfortunately, it is usually assumed that this implies that the machine is outdated. However with the advent of microprocessors, the SRM has become a suitable option for a number of applications because the shortcomings of the machine can be mitigated with control. Compared to other machines, the SRM is more rugged, has a simpler structure, and is less expensive to manufacture. The machine has two control regions: when the speed of the machine is beneath a value called the base speed and when the speed is above the base speed. The base speed is the speed at which the back electromotive force (EMF) of the motor becomes substantial when compared to the source voltage. In both regions, the turn-on and turn-off angles of the machine can be used to control the machine. This thesis proposes a method of generating optimal turn-on and turn-off</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>angles.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>   The method presented in this thesis is concerned with finding the turn-on and turn-off angles needed to generate maximum torque per ampere (MTA). The strategy applies a particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique that searches for the angles that maximize the inductance of the SRM in order to achieve MTA. The inductance function was obtained via Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and experimentally. The method was applied to a 4-phase 8/6 SRM. The proposed strategy was found to be effective at both low speeds (beneath the base speed) and high speeds (above the base speed), but MTA could only be asserted for low speeds.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Psychopathic individuals are distinct from non-psychopathic individuals in affective, interpersonal, and behavioral domains. A hallmark characteristic of psychopathic individuals is lack of empathy. Gender differences have been identified with regards to psychopathy and empathy. The current study examined two factors of empathy, Cognitive and Affective Empathy, and employed a triarchic model of psychopathy, which included boldness, meanness, and disinhibition as the three factors (Patrick, Fowles, &amp; Krueger, 2009). The current study examined whether gender and/or gender roles moderated the relationship between the empathy and psychopathy factors. It was expected that gender roles, rather than gender alone, would moderate the relationship between empathy and psychopathy, such that masculine individuals would be deficient in empathy and endorse more psychopathic characteristics, whereas feminine individuals were expected to have more empathy and endorse fewer psychopathic characteristics. As expected, in the current study, females demonstrated higher levels of femininity, as well as empathy and cooperation, whereas males demonstrated higher levels of psychopathy (specifically boldness and meanness) and the propensity to look out only for their best interests and not cooperate with others. Further, masculine individuals demonstrated higher levels of boldness and meanness. Results from an Exploratory Factor Analysis, Canonical Correlation, and Hierarchical Regression indicated that affective empathy factors, rather than cognitive empathy factors, demonstrated the strongest negative relationship with boldness and meanness. Disinhibition demonstrated no relationship with either affective or cognitive empathy factors. Implications of these results are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Between 1973 and 1988, ASALA and the ARF waged a campaign of violence against Turkey and its citizens. These terrorist organizations killed approximately 90 individuals and wounded hundreds more through a combination of attacks that spanned North America, Europe, the Middle East and the south Pacific and targeted ethnic Turks, assets of the Turkish government, and Turkish business interests. By the early1980s, these two organizations earned reputations as the most dangerous, savage and mysterious terrorist group in existence. Armenian terrorism, however had virtually no chance of reaching its publicly stated goals. ASALA and the ARF demanded acknowledgement of the Armenian genocide; reparations for the families of the victims; and possession of eastern Anatolia. Contrary to their aims, the Turkish government was not going to revise their history, and the prospect of violating the territorial sovereignty of the Turkish Republic inconceivable. Yet, Armenian terrorism thrived for over a decade before abruptly fading away in the second half of the 1980s. Making use of the primary documents now available, this work will analyze the reasons why ASALA and the ARF took up arms in 1975, how they sustained themselves, and why they suddenly disappeared. It will argue that Armenian terrorist was the end result of a policy of aggressive nationalism based on anti-Turkishness that was introduced in 1959 used for short-term and local political gains. Recognizing the success of this new policy, the ARF continued to promote anti-Turkishness throughout 1960s and early 1970s. After witnessing the positive response to the increasing violence and the emergence of favorable international conditions, the ARF embraced violence as means to obtain their ultimate political goal: eastern Anatolia. At the very same time, three Armenian intellectuals and a young Armenian terrorist with experience in various Palestinian organizations were creating a new terrorist organization of their own, ASALA. ASALA and the ARF/JCAG operated for over a decade, and were able to sustain themselves because of the steadfast support of the Armenian diaspora for a terrorist campaign that killed Turks. The campaigns finally ended after the violence not only became an end in itself, but had turned the two groups against each other in an inter-group struggle that decimated their ranks.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Skid-steered robots are commonly used in outdoor applications due to their mechanical simplicity, high maneuverability, and robustness. The maneuverability of these robots allows them to perform turning maneuvers ranging from point turns to straight line motion under ideal conditions (e.g., flat terrain and powerful actuators). However, sloped terrain, terrain with high friction, or actuator torque and power limitations can limit the achievable turning radii. The aim of this research is to analyze and experimentally verify the dynamic and power models for skid-steered autonomous ground vehicles equipped with non-ideal (i.e., torque and power limited) actuators and moving on sloped terrains. In particular it investigates the ability of the proposed models to predict motor torques (including motor saturation), power requirement, and minimum turn radius as a function of terrain slope, vehicle heading, payload, terrain parameters and actuator characteristics.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The experimental results show that the model is able to predict motor torques for the full range of turning radii on flat ground, i.e., from point turns to straight line motion.  In addition, it is shown that the proposed model is able to predict motor torques (including motor saturation) and minimum turn radius as a function of terrain slope, vehicle heading, payload, terrain parameters and actuator characteristics. This makes the model usable for curvilinear motion planning tasks on sloped surfaces.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The research uses these results along with Sampling Based Model Predictive Optimization to develop an effective methodology for generating dynamically feasible, energy efficient trajectories for skid-steered autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) and compares the resultant trajectories with those based on the standard distance optimal trajectories. The simulated and experimental results consider an AGV moving at a constant forward velocity on both wood and asphalt surfaces under various loads. They show that a small increase in the distance of a trajectory over the distance optimal trajectory can result in a dramatic savings in the AGV's energy consumption. They also show that it is not difficult for distance optimal planning to produce trajectories that violate the motor torque constraints for skid-steered AGVs, which can result in poor navigation performance.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In addition, the research motivates and provides a methodology that integrates the robot's dynamic model and actuator limitations, and the terrain models with SBMPO to exploit the vehicle momentum as a way to successfully traverse the difficult terrains such as steep hills, mud, or stiff vegetation patches. These scenarios are particularly critical for smaller robots with torque and power limited actuators, which as experimentally shown in this research can easily fail to accomplish their tasks in these environments. In particular, the experimental results showing the efficacy of the proposed methodology are presented for a vegetation patch and a steep hill. Finally, a discussion of the necessary perception work to fully automate the process is included.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Further, for walking and running robots, analysis of the power consumption is particularly important for trajectory planning tasks as it enables motion plans that minimize energy consumption and do not violate power limitations of the robot actuators. The research here is motivated by the hypothesis that for certain regimes of operation (i.e., certain gait parameters), legged robots from the RHex family behave in a similar fashion to skid-steered robots while in general curvilinear motion. Hence, using the experience gained from skid-steered wheeled vehicles, presents models of the inner and outer side torques and power requirements for the XRL hexapedal robot. In addition, the applicability of the power model to energy efficient motion planning is illustrated for a walking gait on a vinyl surface.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The effect of perceived criticism from others is one potentially important risk factor for suicide that has received scant attention, despite decades of research on the role of criticism in the treatment and course of mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder, and anxiety disorders. The current study analyzed the unique effect of perceived criticism's association with suicidal ideation and attempts as well as its connection with the well-established suicide related constructs of thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, and the acquired capability to enact self-harm as described in the Interpersonal Psychological Theory of Suicide. Results demonstrated that perceived criticism is a significant predictor of suicidal ideation and attempts, above and beyond the role of mental illness. Further analyses demonstrated that the effect of perceived criticism on suicide ideation and attempts is fully mediated by the constructs of thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness. These results should be replicated in a wider sample and should be investigated as a factor to address in public and individual mental health treatment to help reduce suicide ideation and attempts.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Do regional human rights courts influence respect for rights? Conventional wisdom suggests that absent hard enforcement mechanisms, international legal obligations have little influence on state behavior. International human rights courts arguably represent legal bodies posing greater challenges to state sovereignty and greater constraints on state behavior than other international human rights legal mechanisms. As a result, the literature suggests that states are unlikely to delegate to these regional legal bodies and delegation only occurs when (rights-respecting) states expect little change in behavior. However, states have increasingly delegated authority to regional human rights courts over time and these regional legal bodies continue to experience unprecedented growth in activity. Despite growth in the authority and activity of regional human rights courts, we know relatively little about their effectiveness, or the extent to which regional human rights courts influence respect for rights. In this study, I argue that the executive, as the final authority on human rights policy within the state, plays a primary role in regional court implementation and effectiveness. While the executive faces various incentives not to adhere to adverse regional court decisions, the executive often also faces various incentives to adhere to adverse decisions of the court (by adopting or implementing a policy of respect for rights), which may trump executive incentives to evade adverse regional court decisions. In this study, I explore direct threats to executive political survival, including international and domestic pressure placed on the executive to adhere to adverse regional court decisions. I also explore indirect threats to executive political survival for failing to adhere to adverse regional court decisions, including expectation of adherence by the domestic legislature and judiciary, as well as executive expectation of civil society mobilization. I then empirically examine the role of threats to executive political survival in generating executive incentives to adhere to an adverse decision through a policy of respect for rights, or the effectiveness of the regional human rights court, using cross-national statistical analysis of regional court decisions in both Europe and the Americas.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The goal of this research is to describe and quantify the role of deep convection within the Strait of Malacca (hereafter referred to as the &amp;ldquo;Strait&amp;rdquo; a part of the Maritime Continent in Southeast Asia) on the long-range transport of ship emissions. It utilizes a combination of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model with a 2 km horizontal grid spacing and the HYbrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectories model (HYSPLIT 4). Results from the high-resolution WRF simulations are compared to the coarse-resolution (1&amp;deg; horizontal grid spacing) Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) data provided by the Air Resources Laboratory. World Wide Lightning Network (WWLLN) observations reveal that the Strait region has a pronounced diurnal cycle of lightning with a nighttime (1900&amp;ndash;0700 LT) maximum that is 2&amp;ndash;3 times greater in the Strait itself than the daytime (0700&amp;ndash;1900 LT) maximum on the surrounding landmasses. WWLLN observations also reveal that the Strait region has a seasonal cycle that is influenced by the Intertropical Convergence Zone and is out of phase with the Asian monsoon. April is the month with the most lightning, followed by October. Conversely, February is the month with the least amount of lightning. Therefore, these three months are the focus of this study. The Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research v4.2 is used to find an average emissions rate from ships within the Strait. A mass is assigned to each HYSPLIT particle in order to display a three-dimensional representation of CO concentrations.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>HYSPLIT results using WRF as the meteorological input reveal that more CO is transported to the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere (UTLS) during April than any other month. October is also efficient at transporting CO to the UTLS, but in smaller concentrations than April. CO transport during February is primarily in the lower to middle troposphere. The effect of model resolution is shown by comparing WRF-derived trajectories to GDAS-derived trajectories. The coarse-resolution GDAS-derived trajectories remain close to their point of release after 120 h. The high-resolution WRF-derived trajectories exhibit more horizontal and vertical transport than GDAS. Result of vertical mass flux calculations show that April has the greatest influence on the UTLS which is consistent with WWLLN lightning observations and a climatology of GDAS convective available potential energy within the Strait. April has the greatest hydrostatic instability of the three months studied, and therefore has the most lightning and deepest transport; October is second in this regard; and February is third.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to examine the shared and unique associations of sadness rumination and anger rumination and their links to depressive and aggressive symptoms in pre/early adolescents. Children, seven through fourteen years old, completed self-report measures of their response styles, depressive symptoms, and peer nominations of aggressive behaviors. Results revealed that anger rumination uniquely predicted aggressive and depressive symptoms, controlling for sadness rumination. In contrast to previous studies, sadness rumination did not predict depressive symptoms when anger rumination was controlled for. In addition, sadness rumination was negatively associated with aggressive symptoms. Gender did not moderate the relationship between any of the variables. An exploratory cluster analysis was also conducted to examine patterns of rumination and their associated behavioral correlates. The following groups emerged: general ruminators, high sadness ruminators, high anger ruminators, and low ruminators. Results revealed that general ruminators did not demonstrate comorbid depressive and aggressive behaviors.  Study limitations and future directions for research are discussed.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was threefold: (1) to determine if levels of teacher expressiveness (low, medium, or high) have an effect on ratings of teacher effectiveness, lesson content, and on student learning, (2) to determine if a relationship exists between ratings of teacher nonverbal behaviors and teacher effectiveness, and (3) to determine if a relationship exists between ratings of teacher expressiveness and teacher enthusiasm in the elementary general classroom. Three scripted videos were created of the same stimulus teacher presenting a music lesson to a hypothetical class of elementary-aged children. In the three videos, the stimulus teacher exhibited low, medium, or high levels of expressive nonverbal behaviors. Participants for the first phase of the study were 160 college students who were randomly assigned to one of three video conditions. Video conditions were based on the stimulus teacher's level of expressiveness: low (n = 55), medium (n = 54), and high (n = 51). After viewing the video, participants provided ratings on the teacher's effectiveness, expressiveness, enthusiasm, nonverbal behaviors, and lesson content. Participants for the second phase of the study were 114 fourth- and fifth-grade students who were randomly assigned to the same video viewing conditions: low (n = 42), medium (n = 37), or high (n = 35) teacher expressiveness. Following the video viewing, participants completed a 10-question Student Learning Assessment based on the video lesson content. Results of this study revealed that levels of teacher expressiveness had a significant effect on ratings of teacher effectiveness, with higher levels of teacher expressiveness resulting in higher ratings of teacher effectiveness. Levels of teacher expressiveness did not have an effect on ratings of lesson content, or on student learning. Results also revealed that (1) higher ratings of teacher nonverbal behaviors were significantly related to higher ratings of teacher effectiveness, and (2) participants equated teacher expressiveness with teacher enthusiasm.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to sequentially analyze and identify collaborative writing processes used to increase or decrease the quality of students' written arguments. The study's participants were 16 graduate students enrolled in an online course on inquiry and measurement. Every student worked on one team to analyze the arguments for using surveys and worked on one team to analyze arguments for using interview. A total of seven teams worked on the survey arguments; seven teams worked on the interview arguments. Each student worked with their team members using their team's own wiki to analyze and develop each argument for using surveys and interviews. The arguments produced by the students were scored by the researcher and a second coder to determine which processes performed by the consenting students produced the highest- and lowest-quality arguments. Results indicated that the collaborative writing process used by students working in teams to develop a high-quality argument in a wiki consisted of six action sequence patterns while teams producing a low-quality argument consisted of only two action sequence patterns. Given that the low-quality argument action sequences were also not observed in the processes used to produce the high-quality arguments, it is possible that these two action sequences have hindered or obstructed the processes needed to produce high-quality arguments. The findings indicate that specific action sequences and more structured collaborative writing processes may help to produce high-quality arguments. As a result, interventions should be directed at increasing the frequency of the action sequences found in this study to produce high-quality arguments which may assist students in writing higher quality arguments.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In the late 20th century, states began approving community colleges to offer four-year baccalaureate degrees, signifying the emergence of the community college baccalaureate (CCB) movement.  From 1989 to 2007, 16 states included in this analysis had at least one community college that was authorized to grant baccalaureate degrees.  In the early years, states offering CCBs saw modest expansion.  By the turn of the century, the number of states authorizing community colleges to offer baccalaureate degrees expanded rapidly.  Rationale for the CCB included: increased demands for baccalaureate degrees and credentials; unmet workforce needs; need for increased access to affordable higher education options; baccalaureate training in all state regions; pressures to meet state and national completion goals; overcrowding, stricter admissions standards, and rising costs to students and taxpayers at traditional four-year institutions.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The methodological technique of event history analysis was used to better understand the timing and occurrence of the adoption of the CCB.  The particular specification for this analysis was the Extended Cox model, where the dependent variable was the binary adoption of the CCB and the independent variables were grouped into five rival sets of hypotheses drawn and distilled from the literature: regional diffusion, fiscal and socioeconomic factors, higher education demand, governance structures, and political factors.  The analysis for this study was conducted using longitudinal panel data for 46 states from 1989 to 2007, and tested 17 hypotheses.  Data were collected from a variety of state-level sources, including the U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. Census Bureau, Integrated Postsecondary Education Data Systems, Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education, U.S. Department of Labor, Education Commission of the States, Klarnar's data set, and Council of State Governments.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study presents empirical evidence that the likelihood of state adoption can be explained by several conditions external and internal to the state.  Specifically, states with close proximity to previous CCB adopters, low tuition costs, low enrollment growth, low educational attainment rates, low labor force participation rates, consolidated governing board structures, board approval for CCB adoption, and non-Republican control of the legislature were more likely to adopt the CCB.  I found negative relationships between CCB adoption and median income, tuition costs, and professionalized legislatures.  Finally, there was no evidence to support the influence of fiscal health, university overcrowding, proximity to urban areas, previous adoption of articulation agreements, unemployment rates, community college-only boards, and Republican governors on CCB adoption.  This study fills a gap in the literature by approaching the evolution and rise of the CCB from an empirical perspective.  Building upon prior research, it adds a new way in which scholars and practitioners can think about the adoption of the CCB as a policy innovation in the U.S.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Upland forests in the southeastern United States (U.S.) were once dominated by the pyrogenic longleaf pine (Pinus palustris)-bunchgrass ecosystem that extended south from Virginia to Florida and west to East Texas.  Historical land management has reduced the dominance of this ecosystem and today it occupies less than 3% of its original range.  Restoration of the longleaf pine-bunchgrass ecosystem in the mesic flatwoods along the Gulf Coastal Plain of the southeastern U.S. has become a common habitat-recovery goal of public land managers, including those responsible for the Apalachicola National Forest (ANF).  This research project explores potential techniques to accomplish this goal.  There are three objectives: (1) to document changes in the extent of the longleaf pine-bunchgrass ecosystem in transition zones between the pine uplands and the hardwood wetlands of the ANF; (2) to test the importance of canopy retention in the transmission of fire across the landscape during conversion from slash pine (Pinus elliottii) plantations to longleaf pine forest; and (3) to test whether slash pine plantations can be successfully interplanted with longleaf pine seedlings.  Overall, the study involved interactions between longleaf pine and fire in the ANF of northern Florida.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Without frequent fire, the longleaf ecosystem can enter into what Lindenmayer et al. (2011) call, a "landscape trap," where ecological processes can no longer maintain the original forest type.  A comparison of recent and old (1937) aerial photographs reveal that 32,000 hectares [ha] (80,000 acres [ac]) of the wet, grassy flats on the edges of the pine flatwoods have been invaded by shrubs, to become a shrub-dominated community.  These shrubs, which are mostly titi (Cyrilla racemiflora and Cliftonia monophylla), have expanded primarily in sites with a greater than three-year fire-return interval.  Restoration of the longleaf pine-bunchgrass ecosystem appears to need a &lt;3-year fire-return interval if the processes favoring bunch grasses in the ground cover are to be maintained.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	For decades, forest managers in the southeastern U.S. have replaced natural longleaf pine communities with high-production slash pine plantations.  I contend that restoration of longleaf pine in slash pine plantations will require retention of a fraction of the current slash pine canopy to produce enough needle cast to carry ground fire through the stand.  In cooperation with the U.S. Forest Service, I monitored the results of 3 timber treatments in slash pine plantations.  These experiments found that removal of the canopy reduces fire transmission. When all canopy trees were experimentally removed, only 12% of the landscape burned; whereas, 80% burned with only 33% canopy reduction.  On the forest floor, partial retention of the slash pine canopy contributed ecological attributes similar to a longleaf canopy by promoting frequent low-intensity fires and creating ground cover conditions favoring herbaceous species.  Where ground cover was primarily herbaceous, mortality of longleaf seedlings from fire averaged 8%, while in areas dominated by woody-vegetation, the average mortality was 30%.  Canopy gaps also affected fire intensity and seedling mortality.  In the 33% canopy reduction treatment, 23% of the seedlings were killed by fire, while in the large gaps only 12% were killed.  Frequent low-intensity fires thus allow survival of the longleaf seedlings and promote herbaceous ground cover.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Land managers generally consider longleaf pine to be a shade-intolerant species; therefore, they design restoration programs to maximize the growth rate of seedlings.  In this experiment however, growth occurred in all canopy conditions.  In the large gaps, with three years of growth, the seedlings increased their root-collar diameter by 190% to a mean diameter of 26.3 mm, and 96% under the 33% canopy reduction to a mean diameter of 18 mm in the same three years.  In sum, while planting under the canopy does not maximize longleaf pine growth, it keeps a canopy, avoids clear-cutting, promotes fire, and allows ground cover restoration.  Interplanting in combination with burning is an effective way to restore longleaf pine and avoid the shrubland landscape trap.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study reexamines the unresolved American literary debate between traditional and experimental writing practices from the early twentieth century to today. By tracing what I consider to be the key episodes in this ongoing debate across three historical periods--The Modernist Moment, The Postmodernist Moment, and The Contemporary Moment--I demonstrate how this persistent antagonism is intrinsically linked to the construction and representation of American identity. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	I examine the origin of this debate by foregrounding "The Little Renaissance," a term I borrow from historian Arthur Frank Wertheim which he uses to describe the reconstruction of American culture that took place during the second decade of the twentieth century.  As the catalyst for this cultural upheaval, I cite George Santayana's 1911 lecture entitled "The Genteel Tradition in American Philosophy," which sets the terms of the debate for the first time by codifying the genteel tradition as the source of antagonism that engenders the proponents of the Little Renaissance.  Through an analysis of the major figures in this often-overlooked strand of modernism, including Van Wyck Brooks, H.L. Menken, and William Carlos Williams, I demonstrate the emergence of a tension between those who desire to forge new literary terrain and those who desire to recuperate received terrain, and most importantly I show how this tension explicitly converges on issues of national identity. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	I follow the thread engendered by the Little Renaissance to investigate its instantiation in William Gass and John Gardner's public debate in 1978 and the publication of Tom Wolfe's realist manifesto in 1989.  Using Andreas Huyssen's notion of an "alternative postmodernism" to examine arguments by writers such as Ronald Sukenick and Raymond Federman in comparison to John Barth and John Hawkes, I explore the intervening years between the Gass/Gardner debate and the Wolfe manifesto to uncover the diversity of approaches to experimental practices.  Of particular note in this section is my observation regarding the trend of the antagonism moving toward suppressing or diminishing the explicit connection to the construction and representation of national identity.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	I resume my examination of the debate as it manifests in the new millennium through the publication of three antagonistic essays--by B.R. Myers, Dale Peck, and Jonathan Franzen, chronologically--which attempt to recuperate values associated one hundred years earlier with the genteel tradition.  These essays provoke a host of heated rebuttals, led by a spirited proclamation by Ben Marcus defending the virtues of experimentation.  While various critics sound their exasperation over what they perceive to be yet another repetitive instance of an age-old argument, I demonstrate how this contemporary version of the debate resembles and deviates from previous versions. Most importantly, the issue of national identity seems to recede into the background in the twenty-first century.  While no longer explicitly visible in the same ways it had been in earlier versions of this debate, I contest that it remains an impactful subtext that continues to drive the debate.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Marital status significantly shapes individuals' psychological well-being, though more is known about its effect on negative than positive dimensions.  This study examines the association between marital status and psychological well-being across negative and positive dimensions, using data from two waves of the Midlife in the United States Survey (MIDUS 1995-1996 and 2004-2006).  Compared with prior studies, my research examines a more comprehensive set of indicators of psychological well-being: depression, autonomy, environmental mastery, personal growth, positive relations with others, self-acceptance, and purpose in life.  I further examine how the associations between marital status and these dimensions of psychological well-being vary by age.  I use three analytic samples to examine the cross-sectional associations and effects over time: Wave 1 sample (n=2,801), Wave 2 sample (n=1,737), and panel data containing respondents in both waves (n=1,657).  Although the results vary across the two waves and between cross-sectional and panel analyses, results of Ordinary Least Regression (OLS) models indicate that, compared with those in other marital statuses, married adults tend to have better psychological well-being, including less depression and greater self-acceptance and positive relations with others.  Differences among the married also are found, with remarried adults reporting more autonomy than continuously married adults.  Using the multiple-group structural equation modeling (SEM), the results showed that the association between marital status and psychological well-being only holds for middle-aged adults (45&amp;#8804;age&amp;#8804;60).  These findings of variation in the association between marital status and psychological well-being across not only dimensions of well-being but also age groups highlights the importance of further research examining sources of variation and explanations for them.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Satellite observations have revealed a small-scale (&lt; 1000 km) air-sea coupling in regions of strong sea surface temperature (SST) gradients (e.g., fronts, currents, eddies, and tropical instability waves), where the surface wind and wind stress are modified.  Surface winds and wind stresses are persistently higher over the warm side of the SST front compared to the cool side, causing perturbations in the dynamically and thermodynamically curl and divergence fields.   Capturing this small-scale SST-wind variability is important because it can significantly impact both local and remote (i.e., large scale) oceanic and atmospheric processes.  The SST-wind relationship is not well represented in numerical weather prediction (NWP) and climate models, and the relative importance of the physical processes that are proposed to be responsible for this relationship is actively and vehemently debated.  This study focuses on the physical mechanisms that are primarily responsible for the SST-induced changes in surface wind and wind stress, and on the physical implication on ocean forcing through Ekman pumping.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The roles that SST-induced atmospheric baroclinicity and boundary-layer stability play in modifying the surface vector wind in regions of strong SST gradients are examined with an idealized model.  Modeled changes in surface wind speed due to changes in atmospheric boundary-layer stability and baroclinicity are largely between -2.0 and 2.0 m s-1, which is consistent with past observational findings.  The baroclinic-related changes in the surface vector wind are found to have a largely linear dependence on the SST gradient, whereas the stability-related changes are highly non-linear.  The linearity of the baroclinic impacts matches that of the observed (satellite and in situ) SST-wind relationship.  This result suggests that the baroclinic-related mechanism is the leading factor in driving the observed surface wind response to strong open ocean SST fronts on scales greater than 25 km. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study shows that the baroclinic-related changes in Ekman pumping are significant (first-order) over a seasonal (2003 winter season) time scale and that the small-scale impacts are quite important over larger spatial scales.  These findings highlight the need to consider the small-scale SST-wind relationship even in coarser resolution model simulation, for which it may be feasible to parameterize because of the linear nature of the baroclinic-related effects.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Over time, some counties in Florida have shifted spending away from social services to public safety--despite increasing demands on local governments to provide social services--while others have not. This tradeoff between spending categories calls into question the responsiveness of local governments to its citizenry and its obligations to implement programs from the state. In a time of both increasing devolution from the state as well as economic conditions that force local governments to tighten their belts, the budgetary decisions that county governments make differ from county to county. This dissertation explores traditional explanations of budgetary tradeoffs, addresses the role that public sector unions play in local government decisions, and closely examines the differences between two counties and the "union advantage.".</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>ABSTRACT</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>School accountability is an issue that the American public has been confronted with since the publication of A Nation at Risk in 1983. This report commissioned by then Secretary of Education T. H. Bell offered a critical assessment of the American education system. During the past three decades following its publication, education practitioners, policy makers, parents and others have sought to promote strategies that they believe would improve the quality of public education.  One widely used strategy throughout our country is charter schools. Charter school advocates relish the fact that their use provided for greater school choice, autonomy and local control. This paper is designed to offer a glimpse into how a small central Florida town used charter schools to improve the quality of its public schools. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This limited quantitative study had two main foci. First, it sought to determine the correlation between student demographic factors and achievement for six schools, three charter elementary schools and three comparable non-charter elementary schools. Second, it sought to determine if there were mean differences in student achievement data for the two school types. The correlation test that were conducted in this study paired student demographic factors and achievement as well as school climate factors and achievement with the two school types. The findings showed there were no correlations between an entire cluster of demographic factors (Title I, disability, minority status, and English language learner) or school climate factors (teacher/administrator quality and school discipline) and reading and math achievement for the two school types. However, an examination of some individual demographic and school culture factors showed a different result.  Several examples of these findings included the correlation between charter school reading and school culture/climate-percentage- out of field teachers (p=.023, at p&lt;.05) and Percentage of new administrators (p=.003, sig. at p&lt;.01); the correlation between charter school math and school demographic factors-Percentage of ESE student (p=.037, p&lt;.05; the correlation between TPS reading and student demographic factors-Percentage of Title I students (p=.006, sig. at p&lt;.01). The result of the independent sample t-test showed charter schools out performing non-charter schools in both reading and math. The mean difference for the two groups were deemed not significant for reading (p= .134 when p&lt; .05) However for math the difference was significant (p= .03 when p&lt; .05). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>While the results are limited, focusing on the three elementary schools within the charter school system and three traditional public schools in the same district, the findings provide evidence that the town's commitment to improving the quality of their education system has not been in vain. The results of this study could be used as a foundation for the development of future studies which have as a central focus the improvement of the academic programs for this  and other charter school systems.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Materials with negative Poisson's ratio are referred to as auxetic materials. They are different from conventional materials in their deformation behavior when responding to external stresses. The cross-section of the materials widens in the lateral direction when being stretched in the longitudinal direction and becomes narrower when being compressed longitudinally. While a number of natural auxetic materials exist, most auxetic materials are synthetic. They show interesting properties and have potential in several important applications. Auxetic materials exhibit better mechanical properties than conventional materials such as enhanced indentation resistance, shear resistance, toughness, damping and energy absorption capacity, sound absorption, variable permeability and capability of producing complex curvature. These properties are beneficial in a wide range of applications including personal protective equipments, sound absorbers, packaging, smart filtration, drug delivery, tissue scaffolding, seat cushioning, etc.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A wide range of auxetic materials has been synthesized. They include different polymers, metals, composites and ceramics. Among these, auxetic polyurethane (PU) foam is one of the most widely studied types of auxetic materials. Auxetic PU foams are usually fabricated by altering the microstructure of conventional foams and the unusual mechanical properties originate from the deformation characteristics of the microstructures. Three most important processing parameters in fabricating auxetic PU foam that dictate auxetic behavior are processing temperature, heating time and volumetric compression ratio.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study addresses several important issues in the manufacturing and characterization of auxetic PU foam. First, an improved automatic measuring technique has been developed to determine Poisson's ratio of auxetic PU foam. The technique involves development of a Matlab based image processing program. The second part of the study includes an experimental design approach to identify significant processing parameters followed by optimization of those processing parameters in fabrication of auxetic PU foam. A split-plot factorial design has been selected for screening purpose. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) has been utilized to optimize the processing parameters in fabrication of auxetic PU foam. Two different designs named Box-Behnken and I-optimal designs have been employed for this analysis. The results obtained by those designs exhibit that I-optimal design provides more accurate and realistic results than Box-Behnken design when experiments are performed in split-plot manner. Finally, a near stationary ridge system is obtained by optimization analysis. As a result a set of operating conditions are obtained that produces similar minimum Poisson's ratio in auxetic PU foam.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>&lt;i&gt;Purpose&lt;/i&gt;: There is evidence to support the Motor Learning Guided (MLG) approach as a feasible and effective treatment for speech production impairments.  To achieve the next step in providing a solid evidence base, the current study compares the more recently developed MLG with an established treatment (Sound Production Treatment; SPT) in a randomized study of training novel speech in healthy adults. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>&lt;i&gt;Methods&lt;/i&gt;: Twenty native English speakers between the ages of 18-30 with no history of neurological, speech, or hearing disorder with less than 2 years of Spanish more than 2 years ago participated in this study.  Participants were randomly assigned to receive training of novel speech phrases using the MLG training protocol or the SPT training protocol. Target stimuli consisted of five Spanish "tongue twister" phrases.  A control set of five Spanish "tongue twisters" balanced for syllable length and target sounds were used to identify generalization of learning.  Three baseline measures were collected followed by four training sessions, a 1-week and 2-week follow-up.  Baseline, 1-week and 2-weeks post-training measures also included the control phrases to assess generalization.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>&lt;i&gt;Results&lt;/i&gt;:  Two-way repeated measure ANOVA's were performed to examine treatment affects both within and between groups.  There were statistically significant treatment effects for each training group and the pattern of learning for the novel speech targets was virtually equivalent between the MLG training group and the SPT training group.    The training effect was maintained, with no significant decline across the two post treatment measures.  Generalization, identified by performance on control set of phrases at baseline, 1 week and 2 weeks post measures was noted.  Specifically, there was a significant improvement over time however, the speech gains were not as great as the trained phrases and there was no statistically significant difference between groups. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>&lt;i&gt;Conclusion&lt;/i&gt;:  These two methods were effective in training novel speech utterances to our participants.  This further validates MLG as a treatment protocol offering good concurrent validity with an established treatment protocol (SPT). The primary purpose for comparing these two methods was to establish that both methods are effective treatments for individuals with motor speech impairment.  This preliminary investigation has provided an important step in that direction.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The education of African-American males has been challenging for decades as their academic outcomes continue to lag behind despite advances made by large school reform efforts. In recent years urban schools are focusing more attention on what we know about how students learn, promising practices for education reform, and how teachers can sharpen their skills to teach more effectively (Darling-Hammond, 2001; Marzano, 2000).  The purpose of this action research is to describe and understand the intersection of Hip Hop culture, teacher perceptions of African-American male students and the influence of culturally-relevant professional development on increasing student engagement.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>"Just be yourself." This seemingly banal platitude can mean any number of things, depending on the context in which it is to be done: I could be unique and distinguish a singular subject, I could behave as I normally would and embody "my coherent" identity, or I could intentionally express myself and the relationships that structure this in meaningful ways. I am seemingly free to dictate how I am and enact this appropriately, but this freedom hinges precisely on my conscious awareness and intent to be myself. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	In the context of dementia, a condition characterized in terms of Self-loss, this cliché becomes increasingly significant as the status of a person's consciousness becomes more ambiguous. A common observation about an individual with dementia is that music is one of the only remaining activities through which he or she continues to appear as a recognizable Self. But, what sense can be made of these curious phenomena?</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	In this dissertation, I use philosopher Slavoj Zizek's style of dialectical materialism and reading of Lacanian psychoanalysis in order to explore this problem of consciousness at the heart of the seeming paradox between musical activity and dementia. The purpose of adopting this approach is twofold. First, I aim to construct a parallax view of, or different ontology for, the real and virtual ways that music and dementia shape what it means to be yourself. In order to do this, I map the order of chapters according to the Lacanian triad of the Imaginary, the Symbolic, and the Real. The second aim is epistemological: by framing what was initially an ethnomusicological project in terms of psychoanalysis and philosophy, I have attempted to open up a new intellectual space for musicology, one which is based on a critical orientation to phenomenology and semiotics rather than a deliberately integrative one.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Today's societies are becoming ever more culturally diverse. A traditionally mono-cultural society, South Korea is in the midst of remarkably rapid changes that have made cultural diversity a widely discussed topic in education and many other fields. Though art educators in South Korea have adopted some of the longstanding multicultural approaches developed by other countries, cultural diversity issues in South Korean society must be examined in the context of the country's unique history and cultural values. Based on the assumption that art reflects life, this study used a pragmatically grounded contextual art criticism model to examine art dealing with cultural diversity by three South Korean contemporary artists whose work may function as a barometer of our social and cultural climate. For the data collection, the researcher takes a role as the critic and three artworks from each of the selected three artists were chosen as research objects. The works of the three participating artists were carefully and critically analyzed in their authentic context including document examination and personal interview. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The critical analysis revealed several themes related to increased cultural diversity in South Korean society today: the influence of media on cultural understanding, a self-centered view of culture, less access to authentic traditional culture, missing the uniqueness and originality of local culture, generalization and prejudice vs. individuality, and multicultural groups in South Korean society. Though the role and the direction of the gaze may differ for each of the artists studied, all share the conviction that art can change society. Because art education is a means to this end, implications for art education are included for those who wish to meaningfully incorporate cultural diversity issues in South Korea classrooms. The findings of the study and their analysis point to the ways art can function as a mirror and window on today's culturally diverse societies in South Korea and many other places in the world.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Approximately half of all cancer patients undergo cachexia, a paraneoplastic condition characterized by unintended weight loss, skeletal muscle atrophy, and impaired physical function.  Using a pre-clinical mouse model, we compared the effects of high-tension muscle loading (i.e. resistance exercise) and low-tension muscle loading (i.e. aerobic exercise).  We hypothesized that high tension exercise would: 1) ameliorate the adverse effects of cachexia on body composition, functional performance, and muscle size to a greater extent than low tension exercise; and 2) induce changes in gene expression profiles and muscle signaling events to favor protein synthesis and suppress protein degradation.  Twelve-month old Balb/c mice were initially assigned to control (n=16), low tension exercise (Low Ex, n=16), or high tension exercise (High Ex, n=16).  Mice in Low and High Ex groups performed wheel running and weighted ladder climbing, respectively.  Wheel running was implemented using a motorized wheel at speeds increased progressively to 7 m/min for 60 min/d, 5 d/wk.  To achieve resistance overload, mice were subjected to weighted ladder climbing 3 d/wk.  The initial resistance was 50% of body weight with 10% increases bi-weekly.  After 8 weeks of training, half of the mice in each initial group were given a subcutaneous injection of colon-26 (C26) tumor cells, followed by an additional 2.5 weeks of training.  Overall, 6 groups were studied including: 1) Control (n=8), 2) C26 (n=8), 3) Low Ex (n=8), 4) Low Ex + C26 (n=8), 5) High Ex (n=8), and 6) High Ex + C26 (n=8).  Body composition and function were evaluated before and after exercise training while the gastrocnemius and plantaris muscles were excised at sacrifice and analyzed by RT-PCR, western blotting, and histological techniques.  Two mice from the High Ex + C26 group (25%) met the endpoints for early euthanasia while all other tumor bearing groups completed the study.  For sensorimotor function, significant performance declines occurred in all groups except Low Ex + C26 (Control: -16%, p=0.006; C26: -13%, p=0.001; Low Ex + C26: -1%, p=0.769; High Ex + C26: -23%, p=0.003), with post-training values being greater in Low Ex + C26 compared to C26 (+12%, p=0.08) and High Ex + C26 (+20%, p=0.01).  Significant absolute strength declines were observed in all groups (Control: -7%, p=0.021; C26: -23%, p=0.001; Low Ex + C26: -14%, p=0.003; High Ex + C26: -19%, p=0.002), with lower post-values in C26 (-19%, p=0.004) versus Control but not in Low Ex + C26 and High Ex + C26 when compared to Control (p&gt;0.05).  When strength was normalized to body mass, significant pre to post reductions were observed in all groups (Control: -7%, p=0.01; C26: -21%, p=0.005; High Ex + C26: -10%, p=0.004) except Low Ex + C26 (p&gt;0.05), with lower post-measurements in C26 (-18%, p=0.02) but not Low Ex + C26 and High Ex + C26 when compared to Control (p&gt;0.05). Gastrocnemius mass was significantly smaller in C26 (-13%, p=0.004), Low Ex + C26 (-14%, p=0.002), and High Ex + C26 (-19%, p&lt;0.001) when compared to Control.  There were no differences in gastrocnemius mass amongst the three tumor bearing groups (p&gt;0.05).  Similarly, myofiber cross-sectional area of the gastrocnemius was significantly lower (p&lt;0.001) in C26 (1150.77 ± 82.85 µm2; -46%), Low Ex + C26 (1431.20 ± 132.24 µm2; -32%), and High Ex + C26 groups (1266.61 ± 114.86 µm2; -40%) when compared to Control (2118.15 ± 58.79 µm2).  No significant differences were noted between the three tumor bearing groups (p&gt;0.05).  There was an enlargement of spleen mass in C26 (+195%, p&lt;0.001), Low Ex + C26 (+114%, p&lt;0.001), and High Ex + C26 (+203%, p&lt;0.001) when compared to Control.  However, spleen mass in Low Ex + C26 was significantly lower than the other tumor bearing groups including C26 (-27%, p=0.008) and High Ex + C26 (-29%, p=0.008).  IGF-IEa mRNA abundance in the plantaris of High Ex + C26 significantly exceeded Control (+79%, p=0.016) while its expression in Low Ex + C26 (+62%, p=0.053) and C26 (+51%, p=0.066) tended to be greater than Control.  Regarding the myogenic regulatory factors, transcript levels of myogenin in C26 mice were not different from Control (p&gt;0.05); however, they were significantly greater in High Ex + C26 versus Control (+126%, p=0.036) and C26 (+150%, p=0.018).  Overall, these findings refute the hypothesis that resistance loading would provide the greatest degree of protection against cancer cachexia.  Given that 25% of High Ex + C26 mice became moribund before the end of the experiment, the possibility exists that high levels of muscle loading may contribute to declines in health.  The induction of myogenin by High Ex + C26 only, coupled with increased IGF-I expression provides some degree of support for this notion as it suggests that cachectic muscle exposed to high forces may be activating compensatory mechanisms to cope with the dual stressors imposed by tumor and mechanical loads that ultimately ends up being futile.  In contrast, low tension loading preserved physical function and possibly reduced inflammation, suggesting that aerobic exercise performed at a regular weekly frequency may contain therapeutic value for patients with cancer cachexia, albeit in the absence of muscle mass retention.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Educators today are increasingly interested in using game-based assessment to assess and support students' learning. The present dissertation study investigated how changing a game design element, linearity in gameplay sequences, influenced the effectiveness of game-based assessment in terms of validity, reliability, fairness, learning, and enjoyment. In this study, two versions of a computer game, Newton's Playground, with different degrees of linearity in gameplay sequences were compared. Investigation of the assessment qualities--validity, reliability, and fairness--suggested that changing one game element could significantly influence how players interacted with the game, thus changing the evidentiary structure of in-game measures. Although there was no significant group difference in terms of learning, participants who played the nonlinear version of the game showed significant improvement on qualitative physics understanding measured by the pre- and posttests. There was also no significant group difference in terms of enjoyment. Implications of the findings for future researchers and game-based assessment designers are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Over the course of the past 30 years, the bilateral investment treaty (BIT) has emerged as the single most important innovation in international law for the governance of foreign investment. In general, BITs are signed between a developed and developing country. Its purpose is to protect and promote foreign investment. This dissertation will explore the fundamentals of the BIT. First, I embed the BIT regime into the broader framework of international investment agreements. In doing so, it can be seen that the growth and prominence of the BIT regime is in large part due to the failure of multilateral attempts at agreement over the rules governing international investment. Second, I ask a fundamental question which missing in the literature: why do home countries sign BITs? This question enables me to explore the link between domestic politics and international phenomena. I find that interest group pressure and the partisanship of government, systematically influence the propensity of a home country to conclude a BIT. Finally, from the perspective of the developing world, I evaluate whether or not BITs do what they are intended to do - promote foreign investment? The literature on BITs and FDI has been inconclusive in this regard. I lend to the debate by suggesting that the relationship between BITs and FDI is not as direct as the literature has specified. Rather, the link is indirect. It's not the BIT, per se, which promotes FDI, but the BIT's ability to bind the host to its commitment. Some BITs are more credible commitments than others. I argue that a BIT's credibility varies in terms of the strength of the dispute settlement mechanism. Some BITs have strong mechanisms, while others have weak mechanisms. Thus, the stronger the dispute settlement mechanism, the more credible the BIT, the more foreign investment it will attract.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Binge Eating Disorder (BED) is a new full-threshold eating disorder diagnosis in the &lt;i&gt; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders &lt;/i&gt;, fifth edition (DSM-5).  While the research literature supports the overall inclusion of BED, the specific diagnostic criteria, particularly the required associated features of binge-eating episodes, have received little empirical attention. In addition, questions remain about gaps in the criteria, specifically the absence of a cognitive criterion focused on the undue influence of weight and shape on self-evaluation. Therefore, the present study sought to determine how the associated features of binge-eating episodes and the undue influence criterion predict the clinical significance of eating behavior. Distress regarding binge eating was used as the index of clinical significance. Secondary analyses of self-report (N=115) and interview data (N=61) from an epidemiological study of eating patterns were completed. A parallel data analytic strategy was adopted between both data sources, including the calculation of point biserial correlations, regression models, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The associated feature of &amp;ldquo;feeling disgusted, depressed, or very guilty after overeating&amp;rdquo; (American Psychiatric Association (APA), 2013) emerged as the best predictor of distress across both methods of assessment. However, the undue influence item was only a unique predictor of distress within the survey data. Across ROC curve analyses, three of five associated features emerged as the best threshold for predicting distress, and the undue influence item demonstrated clinical utility only in the ROC curve analyses of the survey data. Finally, in both the survey and interview data, the five associated features were found to have poor internal consistency reliability. The present study highlights the critical need for more stringent tests of the BED diagnostic criteria, as well as the need to examine new criteria that may be better able to detect clinically significant eating pathology.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The concept of sustainability is theoretically comprised of three distinct dimensions: environmental, economic, and social. Most public and academic discourse, however, focuses on environmental and economic sustainability to the neglect of social sustainability, which refers to a condition where an extended set of basic needs are met for all residents regardless of their race/ethnicity, age, religion, gender, socioeconomic status and/or level of ability and the highest possible level of social inclusion and participation in community life is promoted. While some scholars and policymakers have recently turned their attention to social sustainability, conceptualizing and assessing social sustainability is fraught with problems. In this dissertation, I develop a comprehensive social sustainability assessment framework that focuses on six key policy areas: housing, transportation, food, leisure and recreation, social cohesion, and identity and sense of place. I then incorporate data on Vancouver, Seattle, and Portland into the social sustainability framework in order to conduct a comparative analysis of the cities' relative degree of social sustainability. My analysis--which brings both qualitative and quantitative data to bear on 30 social sustainability criteria--indicates that Vancouver is ranked higher than Seattle and Portland in terms of social sustainability. I then adapt and use two sociological theories of policy development--institutional politics theory and power constellations theory, which tend to focus on the national or state level--to test which one better explains the differential level of social sustainability in the aforementioned cities. In short, I find that power constellations theory best explains why Vancouver has the most socially sustainable policies and programs, primarily due to the strength of organized labor and center-left political parties in the city. Overall, this dissertation contributes to research on social policy development and social sustainability and provides scholars and policymakers with a deeper understanding of the institutional and political determinants of social sustainability.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Studies on the timing of cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning initiation have been conducted for various regions of the United States.  There is evidence that in-cloud (IC) flashes often precede CG flashes by 10 or more minutes in the Great Plains. However, this difference in timing seems to decrease in more southern regions. This study analyzes the IC-CG timing issue within ~100 km of Kennedy Space Center, FL.  We track 75 discrete single-cell thunderstorms within the KSC domain.  Dual-polarimetric radar data overlaid with lightning data are analyzed using the Warning Decision Support System - Integrated Information (WDSS-II) software. Statistics were gathered for three CG initiation scenarios: 1) the first in-cloud flash in the thunderstorm cell, 2) the first 35 dBZ reflectivity at the -10&amp;deg;C altitude, and 3) the first 40 dBZ at -10&amp;deg;C.  Verification statistics such as probability of detection (POD) and false alarm ratio (FAR) were computed for each initiation approach.  The first in-cloud flash approach produces small lead times (4.8 min) and relatively poor verification statistics, namely a CSI of 75%, a POD of 85%, and an FAR of 15%.  The 4.8 min average time between the first IC and CG flashes appears too short to provide useful safety information.  The 35 dBZ method provides the greatest lead time (mean of 14.5 min) and compared to the first in-cloud flash method, has a higher CSI (85%) and POD (99%), and a slightly lower FAR (14%).  The 40 dBZ method has only marginally better statistics (88% CSI, 97% POD, and 9% FAR), but at the expense of 4 min of average lead time.  These results suggest that the 35 dBZ threshold at -10&amp;deg;C is the most operationally applicable for forecasting the first CG flash in Florida.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The concept of brand equity has been widely recognized as both an academic construct and an important business consideration (Aaker, 1991; 1996; Farquhar, 1989; Kamakura &amp; Russell, 1993; Keller, 1993; Gladden et al., 1998; Ross, 2006). The concept has been defined as the added value associated with a particular product that is accrued by a brand beyond the utilitarian or functional value of the product (Ambler, 2003; Simon &amp; Sullivan, 1993; Keller, 1993). Despite general agreement about the definition of brand equity, the measurement of it is not well established (Christodoulides &amp; de Chernatony, 2010; Keller &amp; Lehmann, 2006). A critical challenge in this regard is developing the means necessary to assess the intangible elements that comprise a consumer's determination of brand equity. By using the CVM--a stated preference technique for estimating and assigning non-pecuniary values that are contingent on a specific hypothetical scenario or description of the products-- to measure an individual's willingness to pay for tangible and intangible elements from sports products, the brand equity of both spectator sports and participant sports can be estimated. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	A primary goal of the current study was to examine the willingness to pay Price Premiums for a sporting event, and estimate the brand equity of the sport product based on the Price Premiums by utilizing the CVM. Three research questions were examined: (1) Whether there is a difference between customers' willingness to pay for a branded event (i.e., IRONMAN triathlon event) compared to corresponding unbranded events (i.e., hypothetical non-IRONMAN triathlon event), (2) What the customer-based brand equity of a branded sporting event is, and (3) What factors significantly influence the Price Premium of a sporting event. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	To examine the equity of the IRONMAN brand and a consumer's determination of brand equity, data were collected at two triathlon events. The sample size was 349 combining responses from the Half and Full distance events. I asked two sets of questions for a consumer's willingness to pay a Price Premium: one for the branded sporting event (i.e., IRONMAN triathlon event) and the other for the unbranded hypothetical sporting event (i.e., non-IRONMAN triathlon event). The difference between a branded and an unbranded sporting event represents a Price Premium. I concluded from the results of an analysis of variance assessment indicated there was a statistically significant difference in willingness to pay for IRONMAN branded events compared to non-IRONMAN branded events. That is, triathletes were willing to pay additional Price Premiums for IRONMAN branded events. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The aggregated Price Premiums for the target population were calculated to estimate the brand equity values based on the sport consumer perceptions. The equity of brand IRONMAN was approximately $102 million (Half distance) and $123 million (Full distance). To identify determinants that influence sport consumers' willingness to pay for one brand over the other, I proposed three potential regression models and tested them with through multiple regression analysis. Among ten Price Premium Determinants, Price-quality Inference, Brand Uniqueness, and Gender significantly influenced an individual consumer's willingness to pay a Price Premium. As the brand stands out, consumers were willing to pay a higher Price Premium. Also, as the degree that consumers believe an association between price and quality increases, their willingness to pay a Price Premium increases. Males tend to pay a higher Price Premium than Females. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	A significant contribution of the study is that this is a first attempt to estimate customer-based brand equity with the CVM, and an initial attempt to identify Price Premium determinants in the service-oriented product context. The dollar value of actual brand equity that is based on consumers' perceptions and evaluations may provide marketers and practitioners with several benefits such as a selling point for developing relationships with business partners, a starting point for business negotiations, and for leveraging partnerships (e.g., sponsors, media).</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This project explores the intersection of two relatively recent phenomena in the field of rhetoric and composition:  (1) the proliferation of undergraduate major programs in writing and rhetoric, particularly over the past decade, and (2) the increase in multimodal composing and the scholarship surrounding it.  While many in the field have made scholarly contributions to each area of inquiry, we have yet to investigate the ways in which multimodal composing is implemented within undergraduate major programs in writing and rhetoric.  This study attends to this exigence through a mixed methods approach that includes (1) administering a survey to 19 participating program representatives and (2) conducting case studies of three major programs in particular, each of which contains a different level of multimodal activity (low, medium, or high), is offered at a different institutional type, and is located within a different geographical region.  Both the survey and the case studies gather data about the ways those staffing undergraduate major programs in writing and rhetoric teach, assess, and support multimodal composing, and the macro- and micro-level portraits provided via the data offer the field a lens through which to view the ways that curricula attentive to multimodality are designed and implemented within undergraduate major programs in writing and rhetoric.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The author of this dissertation establishes an overarching framework of spectator emotion, proposes a research design, and provides initial evidence of the framework by multiple studies. In building the spectator emotion framework, an interdisciplinary perspective is applied to scrutinize the epistemological and ontological groundings of emotion; synthesize extant literature from various disciplines; establish the taxonomy of spectator emotion elements; and identify imperative variables for the initial research design. In this, the author highlights the role of emotion by taking viewpoints of positive psychology and experiential marketing. In regards to the empirical examination, (1) both psychometric and neurophysiological measures were assessed as a cross-referenced multiple measure of emotion; (2) main effect and interaction effect of lateralization and social facilitation is evidenced by utilizing EEG ERP measures; and (3) structural equation modeling of the spectator emotion framework is supported through a cross-sectional survey. Specifically, the experimental research of lateralization and social facilitation was designed to examine the mere presence effect in a spectator sport setting. Results indicated that (1) psychometric and neurophysiological measures of positive emotion showed convergent-related validity; (2) main effect of lateralization and interaction with social facilitation was significant; and (3) mediating effect of emotion between personal internal states (extraversion; team identification) and outcomes (subjective happiness; spectator behavioral intentions) was significant. Predictors explained 35.1% of variance in subjective happiness, 56.9% in emotion, and 66.5% in spectator behavioral intentions. Deconstruction of the correlational structure showed complementary mediation for the path from extraversion to subjective happiness which implies that there is a likelihood of omitted variables in the framework. Indirect effect via emotion contributed 66.93% of the total effect from team identity to happiness, 68.91% of the total effect from extraversion to spectator intentions, and 76.63% of the total effect from team identification to spectator intentions. Indirect effect from extraversion to happiness indicated only weak partial mediation by explaining 8.48% of the total effect. Overall, the author proposes the spectator emotion framework and provides supporting evidences through a multiple studies. Together, such elaboration is expected to serve as a stepping stone research in fostering the study of emotion in a sporting context.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Concert Choir has been the flagship choral ensemble of Stetson University, a private, liberal arts university in DeLand, Florida, since 1935.  The choir has traveled extensively throughout the southeast United States and twice abroad, serving as ambassadors for Stetson University.  This study documents Stetson University's early history, the first few decades of choral activity at Stetson University, and the complete history of the Concert Choir through the tenure of Milburn Price.  The study explores 1) the individuals, events, and institutions leading to the formation of the Concert Choir, 2) the philosophy and purpose of the Concert Choir, 3) the individuals, events and institutions that have shaped that philosophy and purpose, and 4) the ways in which the Spring Concert repertoire of the Concert Choir reflects the ensemble's philosophy and purpose.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The three major conductors of the Concert Choir, occupying 71 of the last 77 years, were Harold Giffin (1935-1972), Robert Rich (1972-1989), and Duncan Couch (1989-2006).  Giffin was responsible for combining the separate glee clubs into one performing ensemble, performing Handel's Messiah annually for twenty-five years, and instituting an extensive touring schedule throughout the United States.  The performances at the National Federation of Music Clubs (1939), New York City's Lincoln Center (1967), and the recording session that was broadcast coast-to-coast with NBC in Chicago (1953) were three of Giffin's tours that were most significant.  Rich was the first alumnus of the Concert Choir to be hired as Director of Choral Activities and conducted the ensemble for their first ACDA convention performance in 1974.  During his tenure, the High School Choral Clinic and Christmas Candlelight Concert, modeled after the English Lessons and Carols, were started and have continued annually throughout the scope of this study.  Couch grew the popularity of both the clinic and the Candlelight Concert, took the Concert Choir on two European concert tours, and cultivated collaborations with many professional orchestras.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study concludes that the Concert Choir is a choral organization influenced by the sacred a cappella choral traditions; however, it was not dominated by it.  This study further identifies that the development of the annual Christmas Candlelight Concert and spring tour were foundational for the choir's activities each year.  Documentation illustrates each director's willingness to accept this heritage and develop the Concert Choir accordingly throughout its history.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Every romantic partner possesses faults and will at some point act poorly during the course of a relationship. Such negativity can lead to conflict and even relationship dissolution. In order to protect their relationship, romantically involved individuals often engage in positive illusions and forgiveness--two maintenance strategies that can promote healthy relationship functioning and relationship longevity. However, few studies have examined the specific relationship motives that lead people to engage in these processes. If positive illusions and forgiveness serve as relationship maintenance strategies, then people should engage in them particularly when they are motivated to maintain their relationship into the long-term. Across two studies, I used priming procedures to manipulate relationship motives (long-term motives, short-term motives, and a neutral control) to examine their effect on positive illusions (Study 1) and forgiveness (Study 2). I predicted that the long-term motive prime (compared to controls) would promote positive illusions and forgiveness of the partner. I also tested interactions between condition and sex to examine whether a long-term relationship orientation would encourage men and women to display greater levels of positive illusions/forgiveness on those characteristics/transgressions that should be particularly important to their sex. My hypotheses were not supported; no effects of experimental priming were found. However, across studies I replicated previous work, finding that greater positive illusions and forgiveness were associated with greater levels of relationship satisfaction. Furthermore, in Study 1, I found an unpredicted sex by condition interaction, such that a short-term motive prime led men (relative to women) to display marginally stronger positive illusions, whereas a long-term motive prime led women (relative to men) to display marginally stronger positive illusions. Possible interpretations of this unpredicted finding, along with limitations of the current studies and possible future directions, are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This works provides atomic level molecular information regarding the self-assembled states of several designer nanofibers; nanofibers that have demonstrated utility in the fields of drug delivery and tissue engineering. The first self-assembling nanofiber of interest is MAX8. As the 8th iteration in the MAX peptide family, originally designed by Drs. Schneider and Pochan, MAX8 is believed to possess several unique properties making it particularly advantageous for medical applications: 1) a stimuli sensitive self-assembly mechanism, 2) a &amp;beta;-sheet rich hydrogel structure, and 3) shear-thinning characteristics followed by post-stress recovery of mechanical properties. The second self-assembling nanofiber of interest is SAF. Originally designed by Dr. Woolfson, SAF is another example of a unique de novo designed peptide possessing several advantageous features: 1) SAF only self-assembles when complementary peptides are mixed, 2) it forms an &amp;alpha;-helical rich nanofiber structure, and 3) the sequence can be modified at the amino acid level to produce self-assembling hydrogels. Though several design principles are utilized to produce functional nanofibers likely to adopt specific three-dimensional structures, the structural characterization techniques employed, such as TEM, FTIR, and CD, are best suited to bulk measurements of secondary structure; there still remains a lack of atomic-level measurements regarding the final nanofiber structures of both MAX8 and SAF. Here, solid-state NMR is utilized to obtain atomic-level constraints in order to probe the self-assembled nanofiber structures of MAX8 and SAF peptides.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>     Self-assembled MAX8 hydrogels were prepared according to established protocols in the literature and TEM was used to confirm nanofiber formation. Solid-state NMR techniques were used to probe the molecular structure of isotopically labeled samples. Specifically, CPMAS measurements were conducted on unlabeled peptides and fpRFDR measurements were conducted on uniformly &lt;super&gt;13&lt;/super&gt;C-, &lt;super&gt;15&lt;/super&gt;N-labeled samples to obtain precise chemical shift information, confirming the presence of linear &amp;beta;-strand secondary structure. DARR measurements were performed on uniformly &lt;super&gt;13&lt;/super&gt;C-, &lt;super&gt;15&lt;/super&gt;N-labeled samples to probe for contacts between spatially close yet sequentially distant atomic sites, indicating a contact between the V3 and K17 residues within a self-assembled nanofiber network. PITHIRDS-CT &lt;super&gt;13&lt;/super&gt;C-&lt;super&gt;13&lt;/super&gt;C dipolar recoupling solid-state NMR measurements were used to probe for spatial proximity between singly or doubly &lt;super&gt;13&lt;/super&gt;C-labeled samples. Combined, the PITHIRDS-CT measurements for several selectively labeled samples indicated that the spatial proximity between the V3 and V18 carbonyl sites was intramolecular, providing atomic-level proof of a closed &amp;beta;-hairpin in the self-assembled MAX8 nanofiber structure. Nuclear spin simulations were conducted to computationally predict PITHIRDS-CT results, and deviation from experimental data indicates that approximately 70% of MAX8 monomers are in a closed-hinge configuration.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>     Additional MAX8 nanofiber samples were synthesized to probe the arrangement of &amp;beta;-strands into &amp;beta;-sheets. PITHIRDS-CT experiments were conducted on a singly &lt;super&gt;13&lt;/super&gt;C-labeled sample at the V5 carbonyl site. Weak dipolar couplings were observed, consistent with syn &amp;beta;-sheets where &amp;beta;-hairpins align along the same edge of the nanofiber axis. REDOR solid-state NMR measurements, coupled with nuclear spin simulations, were used to evaluate the distances between isotopically labeled &lt;super&gt;13&lt;/super&gt;C and &lt;super&gt;13&lt;/super&gt;N sites within MAX8 nanofiber networks. Two sample were studied; both samples had 50% of the molecules labeled on the V16 nitrogen with the remaining 50% of the molecules labeled on either the V5 carbonyl carbon or the V3 carbonyl carbon. The experimental curve for the V5 sample was weaker than predicted by nuclear spin simulations for syn &amp;beta;-sheets while the experimental curve for the V3 sample was stronger than predicted by nuclear spin simulations for syn &amp;beta;-sheets. In both cases, the experimental curves were significantly stronger than would be expected for anti &amp;beta;-sheets. These results suggest that MAX8 nanofibers are polymorphic with approximately half of the molecules adopting the syn configuration with the other half adopting a syn configuration with a registry shift of 2. 2D DARR experiments were conducted on a sample uniformly labeled at the V3, T12, and K17 residues as well as a mixed sample having 50% of the molecules labeled at V3, T12, and K17 and the remaining 50% of the molecules labeled at V9. When these two samples are compared, the signal intensity for the interresidue crosspeak between the V3 C&lt;sub&gt;&amp;alpha;&lt;/sub&gt; and K17 C&lt;sub&gt;&amp;alpha;&lt;/sub&gt; for the mixed sample is attenuated by an additional 30% after normalizing to intraresidue crosspeak intensity. This attenuation suggests an intermolecular component to the interaction, consistent with syn &amp;beta;-sheets. 2D DARR results also indicate that the nanofibers are not in the syn-antiparallel or anti configuration due to a lack of V3/T12 crosspeaks. Estimations of signal-to-noise for this crosspeak, based on the observed strength of the V3/K17 crosspeak, suggest that the signal-to-noise attained would be sufficient to clearly discern these crosspeaks. The level of signal-to-noise, howeer, would not be sufficient to observe the expected crosspeaks between the V9 and T12 residues for a syn-parallel nanofiber. As a highly redundant sequence, it is not possible to develop a labeling scheme for solid-state NMR that would provide a positive contact for the syn-parallel configuration. Despite this, collective evidence strongly points toward this configuration as the dominate nanofiber structure within self-assembled MAX8 nanofibers. For this reason, we propose a molecular model that is a mixture of in-register syn &amp;beta;-sheets and syn &amp;beta;-sheets with a registry shift of 2. These &amp;beta;-sheets stack to form syn-parallel nanofibers with all &amp;beta;-hairpins aligned along the same edge of the fiber axis.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>     Self-assembled SAF&lt;sub&gt;AAQ&lt;/sub&gt; nanofiber networks were also produced according to the established protocols from the literature. TEM was used to verify the successful reproduction of hSAF&lt;sub&gt;AAQ&lt;/sub&gt; nanofibers. Contrary to several other SAF sequences, hSAF&lt;sub&gt;AAQ&lt;/sub&gt;p1 fibers were observed by TEM. Circular dichroism experiments were conducted on hSAF&lt;sub&gt;AAQ&lt;/sub&gt; individual components and mixed components. All three samples (hSAF&lt;sub&gt;AAQ&lt;/sub&gt;p1, hSAF&lt;sub&gt;AAQ&lt;/sub&gt;p2, and hSAF&lt;sub&gt;AAQ&lt;/sub&gt;) exhibited some degree of &amp;alpha;-helical secondary structure. The circular dichroism data is supported by CPMAS NMR results suggesting that the secondary structure of hSAF&lt;sub&gt;AAQ&lt;/sub&gt; does not change upon mixture of the individual components. The 2D NMR experiments fpRFDR and DARR were conducted on labeled hSAF&lt;sub&gt;AAQ&lt;/sub&gt; nanofibers to determine precise chemical shift information, evaluate secondary structure at the atomic level, and constrain the molecular organization of hSAF&lt;sub&gt;AAQ&lt;/sub&gt; molecules within self-assembled nanofibers. Peak positions obtained from fpRFDR NMR experiments conducted on a uniformally &lt;super&gt;13&lt;/super&gt;C-, &lt;super&gt;15&lt;/super&gt;N-labeled nanofiber sample are correlated with &amp;alpha;-helical secondary structure for all relevant &lt;super&gt;13&lt;/super&gt;C-labeled sites (K6 and L12 on hSAF&lt;sub&gt;AAQ&lt;/sub&gt;p1 and A4, E15, and I23 on hSAF&lt;sub&gt;AAQ&lt;/sub&gt;p2). DARR solid-state NMR measurements were conducted to probe for contacts between L12 residues on hSAF&lt;sub&gt;AAQ&lt;/sub&gt;p1 and I23 residues on hSAF&lt;sub&gt;AAQ&lt;/sub&gt;p2; this contact is predicted to occur only upon formation of a staggered heterodimer. DARR results clearly exhibit crosspeaks between these residues suggesting that the dominant structure within self-assembled hSAF&lt;sub&gt;AAQ&lt;/sub&gt; nanofibers is a staggered heterodimer, verifying the structure proposed by Dr. Woolfson.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Everyday stress is associated with negative maternal-adolescent relationship quality, which can impact adolescent mental and physical well-being. Guided by family stress theory, the purpose of this study was to test the associations between everyday stressors, open family communication, maternal social support, and maternal-adolescent relationship quality with a sample identified as at-risk for child maltreatment. Consistent with family stress theory, the resources of open family communication and maternal social support were hypothesized to be associated with the relationship between everyday stressors and maternal-adolescent relationship quality. The sample was from the Longitudinal Studies of Child Abuse and Neglect (LONGSCAN) and included 460 biological and adoptive mothers. Path analyses were used to analyze the direct and indirect relationships proposed in the model. In this sample, results demonstrated maternal everyday stress was negatively associated with later maternal-adolescent relationship quality. Additionally, maternal everyday stress was negatively associated with both open family communication and maternal perception of social support, while open family communication and maternal perception of social support were positively associated with later maternal-adolescent relationship quality. Based on these results, clinically addressing resources such as open family communication and maternal perception of social support would be beneficial for families in which there is low maternal-adolescent relationship quality. However, these results were based on a specific population and a secondary dataset; therefore future research would benefit from including additional respondents and measures.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Structural equation modeling (SEM) refers to statistical analyses of the relationships among observed and latent variables based on hypothesized models. In reality, proposed models are rarely perfect, specification search is conducted to correct specification errors between the proposed and population models. Both frequentist and Bayesian methods have strength and limitations in the estimation and specification search of SEM models. Estimation problems that arise from the violation of distributional and/or structural assumptions have not been thoroughly studied. Performance of specification search methods based on different theoretical framework has rarely been compared. Two purposes of this study were: (1) to investigate robust maximum likelihood (RML) and three Bayesian methods for estimating confirmatory factor analysis models under imperfect conditions, and (2) to compare modification index (MI) and Bayesian structural equation modeling (BSEM) in search of cross-loadings in factor analysis models. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>      Two Monte Caro studies were designed for model estimation (Study 1) and specification search (Study 2), respectively. Both studies replicated 2000 datasets for each condition. Design factors included sample size, factor structure, loading size, and item distribution. Study 1 analyzed both correctly specified and misspecified models. Results were evaluated based on model fit, parameter estimates, and standard errors. Study 2 searched for omitted 1, 2, and 4 cross-loadings in data generation models. The evaluation of results focused on the success of specification search and model evaluation. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>      Results showed that the frequentist chi-square test was more powerful than the Bayesian posterior predictive p-value test. Bayesian methods specified with appropriate priors provided accurate parameter estimates similar to RML even under moderate violation of SEM assumptions. Practically however, the selections of Bayesian priors on hypothesized models need to be exceptionally cautious, because they are likely to interact with sample sizes, data distribution, and degree of model misspecification. In specification search, MI generally provided higher model recovery rates than BSEM under the designed conditions. BSEM led to considerable false positive solutions as sample size increased if informative priors were not properly selected. However, MI is not always preferable. The study recommended that practical selections of Bayesian priors may be based on 95% parameter coverage. Future research will investigate the sensitivity of various Bayesian priors in specification search.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Mass incarceration has led to an increased interest in prison experiences and, specifically, their effects on inmate behavior.  Drawing on prior scholarship, this study examines whether the distance inmates are placed from their home communities influences their likelihood of committing in-prison misconduct.  This study tests three hypotheses.  The first hypothesis anticipates that distally placed inmates will engage in more in-prison misconduct.  The second hypothesis expects that the effect of distance on misconduct will be greater for younger inmates.  Finally, the third hypothesis predicts that social ties, measured by visitation, will mediate the relationship between distance and misconduct.  These hypotheses are tested using negative binomial regression modeling and data from the Florida Department of Corrections.  The models indicate a curvilinear relationship between prison distance and in-prison misconduct.  That is, the individuals incarcerated close to or far from their home communities are the least likely to commit infractions.  In addition, visitation only moderately diminishes this effect.  Finally, the effect of prison distance on misconduct is greater for younger inmates.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study aimed at examining the dispositional effects of the hot hand and psychological momentum beliefs on mental states such as self-efficacy, perception of control, and cohesion.  One hundred and seventy-six male and female participants who have athletic experience in basketball, volleyball, or baseball (NCAA, club, or intramural) were surveyed.  Revised versions of hot hand and psychological momentum questionnaires from past studies were used to measure a participant's level of belief in the hot hand and psychological momentum, respectively. The Physical Self-Efficacy Scale (PSE) was used to measure self-efficacy, a revised version of the Self-Control Scale was used to measure perceptions of control, and the Group Environment Questionnaire (GEQ) was used to measure team cohesion.  The aim of this study was to examine whether athletes who have strong beliefs in the hot hand and psychological momentum have significantly different levels of self-efficacy, perceptions of control, and team cohesion.  Also, it was examined whether skill level was related to any differences in beliefs. Results indicated that athletes with stronger beliefs in the hot hand exhibited significantly higher levels of self-efficacy. Belief in psychological momentum did not predict any of the dependent variables Also, high skilled athletes showed higher self-efficacy levels than low skilled athletes, and low skilled athletes showed higher levels of team cohesion than high skilled athletes. The results suggest that belief in the hot hand can be considered an adaptive belief that can potentially affect self-efficacy in a positive manner.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Land changes are complex and dynamic processes that involve the human and natural systems interacting over space and time to reshape the earth's surface. As a fundamental form of global environmental changes, land changes also hold wide-ranging significance for the functioning of the earth's ecosystem and the human society. However, understanding land change dynamics remains a major challenge for global environmental change and sustainability research. The primary objective of this dissertation research is to investigate the feasibility and applicability of integrating various geographic information technologies to improve the understanding of land change dynamics in a complex urban environment. Specifically, the following dimensions of land change science are examined: land change observation and monitoring, driving force analysis, and spatially-explicit modeling. Firstly, a stratified classification approach combined with sub-pixel analysis is developed to map various land use and land cover types in the heterogeneous urban area from medium-resolution satellite imagery. Secondly, remote sensing, GIS and landscape metrics are used in combination to characterize both the spatial characteristics and the nature of urban land changes. Thirdly, a multi-scale analysis is performed to explore the biophysical and socioeconomic driving factors of urban land use change at different spatial aggregation levels and across different spatial extents. Fourthly, given a wide array of existing land change modeling approaches, the theoretical and methodological foundation of these modeling techniques are reviewed and the outstanding issues are discussed in the context of global environmental change research. Lastly, an agent-based model is developed that is coupled with GIS-based spatial data analysis to simulate the residential development decision-making processes and the emergent land use patterns. Overall, this dissertation research has demonstrated the usefulness of integrating various geographic information technologies, such as remote sensing, GIS, and spatial modeling, in land change research. The technological integration also provides the foundation for the coupling of human and environment sciences in understanding land change as a coupled system. An interdisciplinary effort is needed towards more comprehensive research in land change that integrates theories, methods, and techniques in human, environmental, and geographic information sciences.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>A growing body of research has linked high distress intolerance (DI) to obsessions, but not other OCD symptom domains.  However, existing research is correlational and experimental studies are needed before causal determinations can be made.  Further, there is little research on domain-general DI interventions.  To address these gaps in the literature, a brief, computerized intervention aimed at reducing DI was developed and evaluated relative to a waitlist control in a sample with high DI (N=53). The effects of this intervention on obsession-relevant phenomena were also assessed.  Results revealed greater reductions in DI across self-report and behavioral measures in the intervention condition relative to the waitlist condition, as well as lower in-vivo urges to neutralize an intrusive thought; however, anxious reactivity to the intrusion and neutralization behavior were not affected.  Further, reductions in DI mediated the effect of the intervention on neutralization urges.  These results provide important evidence for the causal role of DI in obsessional phenomena, specifically in urges to neutralize intrusions, findings consistent with negative reinforcement models of DI.  Further, results revealed that DI can be reduced with a brief, computerized intervention, which has important treatment and dissemination implications.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Adolescents who become mothers during their teenage years are a population of concern due to the incidence and widespread impact of teenage motherhood across several areas of functioning.  In particular, parenting stress has been suggested to be an issue that is often experienced by adolescent mothers, as well as an issue that may have a negative impact upon other areas (Chang &amp; Fine, 2007; Larson, 2004).  However, previous research has noted a relationship between general support provided to an adolescent mother and reduced parenting stress (Devereux, Weigel, Ballard-Reisch, Leigh, &amp; Cahoon, 2009; Uno, Florsheim, &amp; Uchino, 1998); Whitson, Martinez, Ayala, &amp; Kaufman, 2011).  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Previous research has suggested that an adolescent's own mother, the father of her baby or her current partner, her friends, and her other family members are important and commonly received sources of support (Colletta, 1981; Devereux et al., 2009; Voight, Hans, &amp; Bernstein, 1996).  Similarly, emotional support, financial support, and infant caretaking support have been identified as important and commonly received types of support (Henly, 1997; Rhodes &amp; Woods, 1995; Spieker &amp; Bensley, 1994; Voight et al., 1996).  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>However, previous research on sources and types of support has been inconsistent and has largely not addressed their relationship to parenting stress.  The purpose of the current study was to address this gap in the literature by exploring the amount of Source and Type of Support Combinations received by adolescent mothers, as well as to identify which combinations of source and type of support are significantly related to reductions in parenting stress for adolescent mothers.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To accomplish this purpose, the scale utilized in Devereux et al. (2009) was modified to create the Source and Type of Support Scale, used in this study to measure the amount of Support Source and Type Combinations received by adolescent mothers.  Parenting Stress was measured with the use of the PSI-SF (Abidin, 1990).  136 adolescent mothers, defined as younger than 20 years of age with one or more children, were recruited both online and in person from schools, service programs, and agencies.  The mean age of participants was 18.4 years old, with an average of 1.2 children.  The majority of participants had successfully completed high school, were either married or in a dating relationship, and fell within the lowest brackets of household income.    </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Descriptive statistics were calculated to determine the amount of Support Source and Type Combinations reported as received by adolescent mothers.  Results showed that Emotional Support from all sources, as well as Financial Support and Caretaking Support from both Mothers and the Father of the Child or Current Partner were reported as the most often received support by adolescent mothers. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In addition, a multiple regression analysis was utilized in order to explore the relationship of the Support Source and Type Combination variables in predicting Parenting Stress.  The average Parenting Stress reported by adolescent mothers in this study fell at the 55th percentile.  Four of the Support Source/Type Combinations (Emotional Support from Mother, Caretaking Support from Mother, Financial Support from Father of the Child or Partner, and Emotional Support from Other Family Members) were found to be significantly correlated with Parenting Stress and were included in in the multiple regression analysis, explaining 16.3% of the variance in Parenting Stress.  In addition, increased Emotional Support from Other Family Members was found to significantly predict decreased Parenting Stress.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>While replication of the results with a sample more representative of the broader population of adolescent mothers is necessary, the identified relationship between Emotional Support from Other Family Members and Parenting Stress demonstrates the importance of providing this source/type of support combination to adolescent mothers.  Future research may expand upon this finding with applications to providing services to adolescent mothers.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this study, I explored possible effects of gesture height, specifically the location of the horizontal plane, on singer performance. Research questions for the study included: 1) Do singers change intonation, vibrato rate, vibrato extent, vibrato duration, and tone quality in response to gesture? 2) What are singer participants' perceptions of the effects of gesture on singing? 3) How do expert listeners rate individual and group performances in response to high and low gesture heights? </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Four stimulus videos were created that featured a conductor directing two verses of My Country, Tis of Thee. Two of the videos incorporated a high conducting plane, with the ictus between the clavicle and the chin of the conductor. The other two used a low conducting plane, with the ictus between the navel and the bottom of the rib cage. For each conducting height condition, the video included instructions for the participants to sing the excerpt on [di] or [d&amp;#596;]. Conductor facial expressions and cues were consistent between videos. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Participants (N = 48) sang the musical excerpt in all 4 conditions, in a counterbalanced order. Participants were all at least 18 years of age, majoring in music, with voice lesson and choir participation history. Participants were recruited from intact choirs in the College of Music, and signed-up for appointments in groups of 8, two singers per part, SATB. Participants were fitted with a head-mounted microphone apparatus and placed in a semi-circle facing the video screen. Both individual and group audio recordings captured performances in response to all video conditions. Participants completed a post-participation questionnaire regarding their perceptions of gesture in a general sense and in the specific task of this study. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	From the group performances, recordings were chosen via LTAS plots for analysis by a panel of expert listeners (N = 11). The listeners rated two group recordings; one group evidenced similar responses to the two gestural conditions (according to the LTAS plots), and one group demonstrated different responses to the gestural conditions. Four individual recordings were also rated: (a) a female performance exhibiting similar responses to gesture according to intonation and spectral center of gravity measures, (b) a female performance exhibiting different responses, (c) a male performance exhibiting similar responses, and (d) a male performance exhibiting different responses. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Acoustic analysis of individual performances revealed that singers sang slightly less flat in the high condition than the low condition, although there was an interaction with order: Participants sang less flat in response to the second gesture height they saw. No significant differences were seen in measures of vibrato rate or duration between gesture heights. Another order effect was evident in vibrato extent: singers reduced their vibrato extent in the second condition, but by a greater magnitude in the high-low order than the low-high order. No significant differences occurred in tone quality (spectral center of gravity) measures between gesture conditions. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Singers' perceptions of the effects of conductor gesture revealed that participants believe that gesture does affect singing, with dynamics, tone quality, and breath being the most frequently cited responses. The expert listener panel did not discriminate tone quality differences between gestural conditions of group performances or the individual female responses. Across the comparisons of male individual recordings, the expert panel rated the low gesture condition significantly higher in tone quality. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The present study neither corroborates nor contradicts pedagogical assertions of the effect of gesture on intonation and tone quality. The subjective nature of tone quality, and the difficulty inherent in its quantification, warrants further research. Implications and ideas for future study are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this paper I set out to problematize what the distinguished evolutionary biologist, Edward O. Wilson, has presented to a popular audience as his consilience worldview. Wilson's consilience worldview is a metaphysical framework that presumes the existence of an underlying unity in the knowledge gleaned from otherwise diverse modes of intellectual inquiry, and details a particular normative approach for its discovery by scientists.  After introducing Wilson's consilience worldview (WCW), I review philosophical and historical literature on the role that values play in scientific inquiry and explain how to understand WCW as a problematic bundle of prescriptive claims concerning the appropriate doing of scientific inquiry. Specifically, I examine deleterious implications for the study of human social behavior that result from attempted application of WCW in order to challenge Wilson's claim that WCW is the most profitable or promising research program to adopt in the study of human social behavior (what I describe as the `The Fertility Objection'). Then, I present an argument for why readers of Consilience should regard its central thesis, WCW, skeptically, as potentially deleterious to the process and aims of science (what I describe as the `The Scientific Integrity Objection').</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Do we really have as much control over our behavior as we think we do?  Might we be mistaken that our actions are ultimately up to us?  Some philosophers argue that recent scientific research shows that we don't have the control required to act freely (even when we think we do) and, therefore, we should not be held responsible for what we do.  This dissertation examines the scientific research that has been marshaled in support of such claims which I argue does not threaten our freedom and the control we have over our actions.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This work proceeds by looking at four broadly construed areas of research in psychology: situationism, self-control, automaticity, and conscious control.  I identify ways in which each research program has been used in an attempt to demonstrate that we do not have the control required to act freely.  One research program that has been of interest to the free will community in philosophy and psychology is situationism.  The results of situationism, which include demonstrating the behavioral effects of seemingly insubstantial situational features on our thoughts and actions, have been cited as a threat to our freedom of action on two fronts.   The first is that situationism indicates a widespread absence of awareness of the reasons for which we act.   The second has it that situationism actually disturbs some of our capacities to respond and react to reasons that are crucial for acting freely.  I make a contribution to the debate involving the first sort of threat by developing a taxonomy of types of awareness along two dimensions: objects of awareness in acting freely and ways of being aware in acting freely.  This allows me to evaluate what situationism demonstrates we are unaware of compared to what is required for free action.  I defend the claim that the lack of awareness involved in situationism doesn't appear to threaten our prospects of acting freely.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>I make a contribution to the debate involving the second sort of threat by defending the claim that situationism hasn't demonstrated that the general or specific capacities required for acting freely have been hampered to such an extent that we are rendered unfree even if most participants in the situationist experiments fail to exercise such capacities.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A second research program that has claimed to indicate a threat to our acting freely involves the study of self-control.  Psychologists have demonstrated that our capacity for self-control relies on a limited resource the depletion of which impairs subsequent attempts to regulate behavior.  I carefully examine this research and argue that while it may indicate an impairment in the degree to which we control our behavior, it is not diminished free will to such an extent that we are rendered unfree in a sense of lacking moral responsibility.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>I then look at research on automaticity that has been used to argue that we are not free and morally responsible.  Such research maintains that automatic processes can perform tasks once thought to be unique to controlled conscious processes.  This has led some psychologists and philosophers to conclude that there is little explanatory room left for conscious control and no need to posit free will.  I take a critical look at such experiments and argue that they do not show that consciousness plays no role in acting and that we nonetheless have a significant amount of control over our behavior.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Lastly, I look at Daniel Wegner's research on conscious control which is used to support the idea that our conscious will is an illusion.  I argue not only that his claims rest on a mistaken notion of what is required for free will, but that the scientific experiments do not warrant the conclusion that our conscious will is entirely inefficacious.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>ABSTRACT</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to examine the contribution of teacher performance and instrument modeling in the band classroom. Specifically, this study focused investigation on two sources of information: 1) undergraduate band students and their remembrances of band teacher performance in middle and high school, and 2) band teachers' current performance and modeling practices. The student population (N = 275) was undergraduate students enrolled in a performing band ensemble at a large southeastern university. In Part I of this study, student participants responded to a questionnaire asking them to describe circumstances in which their middle and high school band teacher performed and modeled on a primary or secondary instrument.  Most students remembered specific circumstances in which their band teacher(s) performed on an instrument and often described a social effect (i.e. inspiration, motivation) of such event. Students identified the name and location of their former band teachers to provide the band teacher population for further questioning.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Part II asked band teacher participants (N = 109) to complete a similar questionnaire regarding performance and/or modeling circumstances in the band classroom along with more specific questions regarding training, performance background, and instructional methods.  Similar to student responses, most teacher participants described the use modeling and its benefits for music teaching.  However, teachers primarily discussed pedagogical modeling methods with little intended social implication.  In Part III, questionnaire responses regarding modeling frequency were used to place teacher participants from Part Two into a high-modeling or low-modeling group, providing basis for selecting interview subjects (N = 5) for further, in-depth, information. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Differences between groups were found in pedagogical aspects of modeling instruction. Pedagogical and social reasons for modeling from band teachers were diverse, many of which were echoed in the teacher interview responses. Further results and implications are discussed in relation to music teacher training and the development of performance skills to enhance teacher effectiveness.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Bob Jones University Press (BJU Press) is a publishing house owned by the Greenville, South Carolina university of the same name. Fulfilling Bob Jones' mission beyond the college classroom, BJU Press prints a full K-12 educational program that spans all subjects and meets national core content standards. These materials are nationally circulated in homeschooling environments and conservative Christian private schools, a growing portion of America's educational landscape: according to a Department of Education 2009 report, enrollment in these schools represented 885,000 students. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Research in rhetoric facilitates our understanding of various discourse communities, especially those that appropriate the discourse of a separate community to forward an argument that runs counter to the purposes of the original community. An interesting example of this rhetorical strategy is BJU Press' educational philosophy called Biblical Integration, in which teachers are invoked to "call into question the secular assumptions of each subject and then encourage the student to rebuild the discipline from biblical presuppositions." Using this technique, teachers using BJU Press materials attempt to shape students' ideologies by teaching a literal reading of the Bible dictating a 6,000-year-old Earth. The most interesting subject area in which BJU Press deploys Biblical Integration is the natural sciences, wherein to achieve this goal, textbook authors must make two rhetorical moves: first, re-frame a biblical ideology as being equally scientific to its secular counterparts; and, second, argue for the superiority of a science based in the Bible.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This thesis analyzes a science textbook produced by BJU Press, exploring how the authors meet these exigencies. Specifically, I argue that the authors of the eighth grade title Earth Science both adopt and adapt the discourse of science in order to validate Evangelical Christian Science as being legitimately engaged in scientific endeavors.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Within the context of natural sciences, Biblical Integration is particularly compelling: in formulating an alternative view of science and arguing for its superiority over secular science, the authors at BJU Press are implicitly employing the discourse of Kuhnian scientific revolution, adding a layer of scientific credibility to their efforts by mimicking the historical progress of the sciences. In adopting a Kuhnian approach, the authors craft a hybrid discourse that blends science with scripture, working against the secular status quo of the sciences. Accordingly, to analyze this hybrid discourse, this thesis draws upon work within the rhetoric of science directly influenced by Thomas Kuhn.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This analysis is conducted via two case studies. The first focuses on the textbook's introductory chapter, highlighting how the chapter appropriates the epistemological practices of scientific research by presenting an overarching argument that forwards a threefold purpose: (1) establishing the purpose of Christian Science; (2) highlighting the inherently ideological nature of scientific epistemology; and (3) providing a dualistic definition that polarizes Christian and secular science. By emphasizing the ideological nature of science, the authors of this textbook create a rhetorical space in which they can articulate their alternative view of science as being theoretically valid. The second case study analyzes a discipline-specific application of Christian Science: two textbook chapters that focus on geology. When the textbook attempts to operationalize Christian Science, this view falls short of the standards of science due to Evangelical faith in the infallibility of scripture. Despite this shortcoming, these two chapters still employ strategies indicative of Kuhnian paradigmatic arguments: highlighting fundamental anomalies in scientific consensus and utilizing arguments from familiarity to gain audiences' tentative acceptance. In using these argumentative strategies, the textbook authors mimic scientific argument, but do not fully meet the criteria of science.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Approximately 10% of college students participate in Greek life each year, yet minimal research has been conducted on how these social experiences impact career development variables. The purpose of the present study was to examine the impact of Greek life membership on students' level of vocational identity, career decision-making self-efficacy, and goal instability.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Participants included 436 seniors, 231 non-Greek students and 205 Greek life students, attending a large public research university during the fall 2012 academic year. Two independent variables (group and gender) and three dependent variables (vocational identity, career decision-making self-efficacy, and goal instability) were explored in the present study, with level of engagement and grade point average serving as moderator variables. The Vocational Identity (VI) Scale from the My Vocational Situation (MVS), Career Decision-Making Self-Efficacy Scale--Short Form (CDMSE--SF), and Goal Instability Scale (GIS) were used to measure vocational identity, confidence in making career decisions, and goal directedness, respectively. Additionally, the Revised Student Engagement Questionnaire (Handelsman, Briggs, Sullivan, &amp; Towler, 2005) was adapted for the current study to assess student engagement levels. These measures were selected because of their psychometric properties and widespread use.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A one-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and a two-way MANOVA were utilized to examine the first and second research questions, respectively. To explore the final research question, a multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) was performed. Overall, the results found that individuals participating in Greek-letter organizations reported a higher sense of vocational identity and career decision-making self-efficacy as well as lower levels of goal instability compared to their non-Greek counterparts. Furthermore, group membership accounted for 4% of the total variance among the three outcome variables. After controlling for the covariate of engagement, the effects of membership in a Greek-letter organization remained significant for career decision-making self-efficacy and goal instability. However, strength of vocational identity did not significantly differ between the two groups after accounting for level of engagement. For each research question examined, gender had no effect. Limitations, implications, and areas for future research are also presented.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to investigate preservice students' awareness of cultural diversity during a required Introduction to Education course that includes a service learning component. As college students majoring in education, preservice teachers should be taught to acknowledge and appreciate cultural diversity.  There are many White, middle and upper class students, mostly women, who are attracted to teaching at the K-12 level.  However, many, if not most, of these students have limited experience in working with diverse student populations or their families.  It is imperative that preservice teachers become "transformed" during their education so that they emerge more culturally aware and culturally competent to understand the changing demographics of schools. The Introduction to Education course which includes a service learning component acts as an intervention. Such an experience can serve to showcase the realities of teaching to students who may have a utopian view of teaching and begin to ground them in the realities of daily teaching responsibilities. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study was a mixed method research design with a convenience sample. Descriptive statistics, manual coding and NVivo (version 10) software were used to analyze the data. Participants included students enrolled in one section of a required course, Introduction to Education, in the College of Education in a southeastern university. Data collected over the course of the semester included questionnaires, the Multicultural Survey, and comments from focus groups. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Research findings reveal that the service learning component of the Introduction to Education course had a positive impact on the respondent's awareness of cultural diversity. The emergent themes that the respondents indicated helped prepare them to be successful in a culturally diverse classroom were: classroom observations, observation guides, mentoring/tutoring and class activities. This research is significant to colleges of education as they seek to design effective teacher preparation programs.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Research to date has primarily focused on investigating help-seeking attitudes and intentions of the general public regarding mental health treatment, while neglecting an investigation of these factors for graduate students in the field of psychology. A review of existing literature on this topic uncovered themes regarding barriers and facilitators to seeking professional treatment for the general public and graduate psychology students. The current study sought to expand the existing literature base on the topic of help-seeking and professional concerns of the doctoral psychology student population. Participants included 318 graduate students from accredited doctoral programs in clinical and counseling psychology and combined programs from across the United States. A model of six predictor variables, including  gender, anxiety level, years of graduate training, history of help-seeking, knowing a colleague/student in one's graduate program who has sought help, and knowing a professor/supervisor/advisor who has sought help, was proposed and analyzed to determine its effectiveness in predicting help-seeking attitudes and professional concerns among doctoral psychology students. Help-seeking attitudes were assessed by performance on subscales from the Inventory of Attitudes toward Seeking Mental Health Services (IASMHS; Mackenzie, Knox, Gekoski, &amp; Macaulay, 2004)) while professional concerns related to help-seeking were determined by subscale scores on the Trainees' Attitudes Toward Seeking Psychotherapy Scale (TATSPS; Farber, 1999). Multiple regression analyses indicated that the model was significant in predicting all seven criterion variables (subscales from the IASMHS and TATSPS), and accounted for 9% or greater total variance for all but one criterion, need for self-sufficiency, in which the model accounted for 6.9% total variance. Analysis of the specific contributions of the separate predictor variables also demonstrated that level of anxiety, gender, history of help-seeking, knowing a colleague/student in one's graduate program who has sought help, and knowing a professor/supervisor/advisor who has sought help each made separate, unique contributions to the different criterion variables associated with help-seeking attitudes and professional concerns experienced by doctoral psychology students. Following an in depth description and discussion of the aforementioned findings, the limitations and implications for future practice and future research are also presented.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This dissertation has two aims. The first is to further expand the scope of composition studies to include examinations of contemporary and historical instances of composing processes and textual production. The second aim is to develop a two-pronged approach to those examinations, located in theories of agencement/assemblage, which accounts for the relationship between (a) agencements--configurations of tangible entities and intangible forces that heterogeneously converge in productive arrangements--that produce texts and (b) the texts, as assemblages of material and semiotic features, that those agencements produce. Toward these aims, this dissertation describes the production of picture postcards in the early twentieth century as complex, materially based multimodal composing; historicizes that composing as emerging from and responding to material, technological, cultural, and rhetorical contexts; and theorizes composing in terms of agencement/assemblage.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study of postcard production provides the field with one of the first in-depth examinations of the materiality of the postal medium, which, with hundreds of millions of cards mailed each year since 1907 in the United States alone, was immensely popular in the first half of the twentieth century. In an era without television, the internet, or even economically viable color photography, picture postcards were among the most vibrant and affordable means available for mass representation and long-distance communication. This study details their creation as resulting from richly complex processes that began with black-and white photographs and ended with vivid, full-color, ready-to-mail scenic views of Any-town, USA. These labor-intensive processes invited rhetorical intervention by postcard manufacturers who during the course of production made ethically confounding alterations to original images in numerous ways, for example, by populating otherwise empty storefronts with well dressed people and expensive cars; placing hotel buildings in more desirably picturesque surroundings; and changing the shapes of beach-lounging-women's bodies. Detailed specifically are the production processes of Curt Teich &amp; Company, of Chicago, IL, which at its peak was the world's largest postcard manufacturer. The study further focuses on Teich-produced cards that depicted scenes of Key West, Florida--the USA's southernmost city and a favored tropical island destination. These cards, designed and commissioned by Key West businesspeople and produced by Teich, touted the island's many attractions and were sold in local curio stores for mailing around the country and indeed the world. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The agencement/assemblage approach to studying the phenomenon of composition is developed in light of these processes of production in their historical and cultural contexts. The Teich company employees--with their machines, tools, paper, ink, and techniques--are positioned among Key West businesspeople and photographers in an agencement whose products were postcards, and those postcards are themselves regarded as assemblages of material components and semiotic features. Abstracted from this case, the agencement/assemblage approach is developed both as a method for studying historical composing practices, including practices of production, and as a theory that can inform new composing curricula and pedagogy. Composing is understood as productive action at the nexus of multiple entities and forces, and studying composition is reframed as a practice of mapping those entities and forces in relationship with one another.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation analyzes antislavery literature between the years 1830 and 1865. Antislavery activists often cast themselves as messengers, responsible for showing the truth about slavery to the American public. The changing print culture allowed abolitionists to spread their message in a way that was previously not possible, in the form of pamphlets, newspapers, novels, poetry, gift books, and children's periodicals. Within the pages of these works, abolitionist often relied on--perhaps appropriated--black authority to lend credence to their assertions, as the testimony from an ex- or escaped slave added a type of evidence unavailable to white abolitionists. Here, though, a problematic dynamic emerges: the use of black identity and authority to fuel claims against slavery's barbarism simultaneously undermines the agency and authority of the very people these works seek to liberate. This project examines the implications of using the already-commodified body of the slave in the fight to end slavery.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to find the perspective of music therapists working in a pediatric medical care facility on patients with disabilities. Total, there were 40 participants that fit within the parameters of the study. The researcher found the majority of the participants felt comfortable and prepared working with pediatric patients with disabilities, although many (98%) would be interested in further education on this topic. The participants all stated they had both developmental and medical goals for this population. However, most (90%) had some type of change in the way they approached their treatment plan for patients with disabilities. Other results from this study indicated music therapists saw other staff members within medical facilities treat patients with disabilities differently as opposed to those of typical development. Further research should be done in more detail regarding the above findings from this particular study. Limitations of this study included uncertainties regarding the email invitations sent to possible participants. Many responses indicated they did not fit within the parameters even though the researcher had them listed as working in the required setting for this study. Future research should aim for a larger and more accurate pool of participants.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation aims to make a case for the ecological relationship between portable writing technologies, everyday writing, and counterpublics, arguing that all three represent means by which we can foster more publicly&amp;ndash;engaged and technologically savvy composition practices in the composition classroom. I look at three different historical timeframes, focusing on a different portable composing technology in each period and analyzing the products of this technology. In each period, I focus on a community that forms around each portable technology, analyzing the relationship between portable technology, the compositions sponsored by this technology, and the counterpublics that are created as a result of this relationship.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In chapter two, I focus on the final decades of the nineteenth century, providing two examples of everyday writing fostered by the portable technology of the period: the small printing press. Here, I focus on two everyday writing communities: first, adolescent amateur journalists that called themselves &amp;ldquo;A&amp;ndash;Jayers&amp;rdquo; and, second, an adult hyper-masculine and hyper-sexualized community known as &amp;ldquo;Sporting Men.&amp;rdquo; I describe the textual products of these two communities that were created on small printing presses, pointing to how I see their compositions as &amp;ldquo;everyday.&amp;rdquo; Further, as a result of the use of the small press, and the everyday compositions created with this portable technology, I argue that both the &amp;ldquo;A&amp;ndash;Jayers&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Sporting Men&amp;rdquo; form counterpublics, and it is the everyday compositions and the composing practices of these counterpublics that stands in contradistinction from the curriculum at the time. Ultimately, I claim that the nineteenth&amp;ndash;century writing classroom represents a &amp;ldquo;bifurcated&amp;rdquo; space that was not equipped to foster the kinds of public writing that motivated these two communities to write, print, and circulate texts on their own. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	In chapter three, I move to the 1960s and 1970s to present examples of everyday composing that is both multimodal and mobile. Here, I focus on two communities&amp;mdash;known as &amp;ldquo;guerrilla television collectives&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;that were fostered by the newly available portable video recording technology: Broadside TV and Top Value Television. I describe the two examples of each community's multimodal compositions, underscoring how each community's approach to everyday multimodal composition supports the development of counterpublics in different ways. Further, this period also represents a moment of curricular reform in writing classrooms as well, particularly as the humanities felt increasing pressure to incorporate technology into their pedagogy. However, while several writing teachers did attempt to employ television technology in their classrooms, their approaches tended to replicate what Paolo Freire calls a &amp;ldquo;banking&amp;rdquo; model of education, with the television operating as an authoritative source of information and students passively consuming information. On the other hand, the example of the guerrilla television collectives present us with an alternative, enacting a kind of composing that comes closer to achieving the aims of educational reform ongoing at the time.  I claim that guerrilla television does so by fashioning an everyday composing that privileges the formation of critically engaged, local counterpublics. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	In chapter four, I move to the present day, arguing that such digital technology plays a role in the sponsoring what I call &amp;ldquo;everyday cyborg composing.&amp;rdquo; In this chapter, I will consider two kinds of contemporary mobile digital technologies that sponsor everyday cyborg composing: first, a hand-held, GPS-based device created by Parks Canada called &amp;ldquo;Explora&amp;rdquo; and, second, an iPhone app, named &amp;ldquo;Drift&amp;rdquo; that was developed in 2012. As demonstrated through these two portable technologies, everyday cyborg composing necessitates a rethinking of the relationship between composers and portable digital tools. Further, everyday cyborg composing suggests a recalibration of the discursive space of the public sphere; whereas publics and counterpublics have been seen as emerging from the circulation of visual-verbal texts, everyday cyborg writing designates, instead, a performance space secured through the circulation of bodies and their movements. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study adds to composition scholarship in three ways. First, this project informs our historical understanding of the intersection between everyday writing and technologies, especially the way in which different technologies have functioned as sponsors of everyday literacies. Second, this project continues and extends this disciplinary interest in the development of the &amp;ldquo;public&amp;rdquo; and the &amp;ldquo;public sphere.&amp;rdquo; If, as research in composition studies suggests, the communities in which composing occurs play a crucial role in how it unfolds and develops, exploring the intersections between &amp;ldquo;publics&amp;rdquo; and the everyday will aim to inform and, potentially, redirect our current classroom practices. Third, this project contributes to the discipline's continuing interest in how technologies foster composing practices, and my emphasis on &amp;ldquo;portable technologies&amp;rdquo; specifically aims to highlight how portability supports a specific kind of composition that is considered &amp;ldquo;amateur,&amp;rdquo; is frequently oppositional, and is grounded in the everyday experiences of composers.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Theory and research suggests that criminal courts operate as organized communities, where both bureaucratic influences and court actor action systems play an important role in case processing (Eisenstein &amp; Jacob, 1977; Eisenstein, Flemming, &amp; Nardulli, 1988; Flemming, Nardulli, &amp; Eisenstein, 1992; Nardulli, Eisenstein, &amp; Flemming, 1988; Ulmer, 1997). Specifically, these factors are expected to impact operational certainty within the courthouse and the efficient management of cases (Heumann, 1981; Pollitz Worden, 1990; Skolnick, 1967; Thompson, 197). While a significant amount of research focuses on the external and internal organizational influences placed on criminal courts, less attention has been devoted to the effect of workgroup interaction and influence (Hoskins Haynes, Ruback, &amp; Cusick, 2010; Nardulli et al., 1988; Pollitz Worden, 1995).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	In order to address this issue, the current study uses a sample of felony plea and trial cases from a courthouse in the Southeast to assess the impact of courtroom actors on certainty and efficiency in case processing, operationalized as the decision to plea and time from arrest to case disposition. The study (1) determines the extent to which familiarity, similarity, and influence among the judge, prosecutor, and defense attorney impact certainty and efficiency, (2) assesses whether there is variation in certainty and efficiency of case processing across actors, and (3) evaluates the impact of individual court actor characteristics on variation in case processing. Attending to the limitations of prior research, the study quantifies court actor interaction and influence, focuses on an earlier phase of case processing, links court actors to their respective cases, and determines the contribution of court actors to the guilty plea system.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The findings indicate that court actor familiarity and experience have important effects on certainty and efficiency in case processing. Additionally, variation in the decision to plea and time to disposition is detected across judges, prosecutors, and defense attorneys, and court actor influence is able to explain some of this variation. Contrary to expectations, the findings reveal that familiarity and influence of defense attorneys can hinder certain and efficient case processing. The implications of these findings and potential avenues for future research are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Initializing Coupled General Circulation Models (CGCMs) for routine seasonal ENSO prediction is currently an onerous task. This is one of the main reasons on why the CGCMs participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5), which represents the state-of-the-art in climate modeling, is infrequently used for routine seasonal prediction of El Niño and the Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the largest known natural variability that affects the global climate. In this work we propose a simple ocean initialization technique that can be adopted for any CGCM for seasonal predictability studies of ENSO.  The technique entails finding the best analogues from a long historical simulation of the CGCM to the targeted air-ocean initial state. Since this study is on seasonal ENSO predictability, the metrics chosen to pick the analogues were confined to a set of 4 variables in the tropical Pacific that were found sensitive to the Niño3.4 SST variations. They were Tropical Pacific SSTs, thermocline depth, time tendency of thermocline depth, and the zonal wind stress.  The multiobjective optimization technique was used to optimize the overall analogue match across the four variables giving equal weighting to each. This in effect uses the minimum root mean square difference between the targeted initial state and the model states to pick the analogue from the historical simulation of the CGCM that matched the targeted initial state.  The chosen analogues were then perturbed using empirical singular vectors to provide additional initial conditions to generate in total 12 ensemble members per seasonal hindcast. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The methodology for ocean initialization was first tested with the Cane-Zebiak model, a two layer reduced gravity ocean model coupled to a statistical atmosphere. We found that the methodology is sensitive to the length of the library generated from the historical simulation of the model and also on the fidelity of the model in simulating the ENSO. These toy model experiments also revealed the benefit of using a multi-variate metric to choose the analogues. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Before proceeding to conduct the proposed work with a CGCM, the CMIP5 historical simulations for the 20th century were analyzed for their ENSO simulation. The mean-state and ENSO variations were analyzed in both the atmosphere and ocean. It was found that most of the CMIP5 models exhibit cold (warm) biases in the equatorial (subtropical eastern) Pacific Ocean sea surface temperature that are reminiscent of the split inter-tropical convergence zone phenomenon. There is, however, a major improvement in the representation of the power spectrum of the Niño3.4 sea surface temperature variations which shows that, as in the observations, a majority of the models display a spectral peak in the 2-7 year range, have a near linear relationship with the displacement of the equatorial thermocline and exhibit a robust atmospheric response to ENSO variations. Several issues remain in the CMIP5 simulations such as erroneous amplitudes in the Niño3.4 sea surface temperature spectrum's peak and a width of the spectral peak that is either too broad or too narrow. It is also seen that most CMIP5 models unlike the observations extend the ENSO variations in the equatorial Pacific too far westward beyond the dateline and there is very little asymmetry in event duration between the warm and cold phases. ENSO variability forces a dominant mode of rainfall variability in the southeastern United States, especially in the boreal winter season. The CMIP5 exhibited a wide range of response in this metric with several displaying weak to non-existent, some showing relatively strong, and one indicating excessively zonally-symmetric teleconnection over the southeastern United States. Based on this study we choose to use the CCSM4, which displayed a reasonable ENSO simulation for our experimental seasonal hindcasts with the proposed ocean initialization strategy.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The seasonal hindcasts were initiated in beginning of March of each year from 1980-2012 follows from seeking a model state that minimizes the RMS difference in SST, zonal wind stress, thermocline depth and thermocline depth tendency from a 600 year continuous integration of the CCSM4 with the corresponding metric in the Global Ocean Data Assimilation (GODAS) of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). The four variables are jointly optimized by multi-objective optimization of the resulting root mean squared (RMS) difference curves, essentially minimizing the normalized RMS in all four parameters.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Some of the main highlights of our results from the seasonal hindcasts are:</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>i)	The deterministic skill as measured by the anomaly correlation of the monthlyensemble mean and observed SST anomalies in the Niño3.4 region at 9-month lead is 0.71.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>ii)	The probabilistic prediction of the Niño3.4 SST anomalies at 9-month lead for warm and cold ENSO events as measured by the area under the Relative Operating Characteristic Curve is 0.7 and 0.8 respectively. Likewise the brier skill score for warm and cold ENSO events at 9-month lead for Niño3.4 SST anomalies is 0.11 and 0.21 respectively.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>iii)	The global teleconnection patterns in SST, precipitation and 500hPa geopotential heights with Niño3.4 SST variations in the seasonal hindcast in Oct-November-December season (7 month lead) is reasonable.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>From these results we demonstrate that the proposed initialization strategy is viable to deploy many other existing CMIP5 models for either operational seasonal ENSO prediction or ENSO predictability studies.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This study examined the reasons choral directors take their ensembles to competitions. Choral directors (N=183) in ten states were surveyed to determine the reasons they and their students participate in competitions; the importance of competition participation to themselves, students, administrators, and parents; their preferences for award systems; their competition budget; the influence on their repertoire choices; and their required personnel for competition participation. Additionally, responses were compared by choir type (concert choir and show choir). Results indicated that educators participate in competitions in order to motivate students toward their musical achievement goals, while the educators' perceived their students prefer to attend competitions to attain ratings and recognition. Show choirs were shown to spend substantially more time and money on competition participation and attend twice as many competitions. Implications for choral music educators and areas for future research are addressed.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Acquired hearing loss occurs when one loses their hearing postlingually.   The condition is increasing as the world's population ages and is also increasing in younger adults as well.  Little quantitative data is available on how hearing loss affects spouses' or partners' intimate relationships.  Thus, the focus of this study is to explore how hearing loss affects spouses' marital adjustment.  Eighty-two couples participated and couple members individually completed surveys that provided the data for this quantitative study.  The statistical method used was stepwise multiple regression.  The study variables were: degree of hearing loss, sudden versus gradual loss, spouses' personality, perceived social support, and spouses' marital adjustment.  Use of assistive technology was tested as a moderator of the relationship between the degree of hearing loss and spouses' marital adjustment.  Also, perceived social support was tested as a mediator of the relationships between degree of hearing loss, sudden versus gradual loss, spouses' personality, and marital adjustment.  Perceived social support was the most significant predictor of spouses' marital adjustment and predicted higher levels of marital adjustment.  Presence of children in the home was significantly associated with lower levels of marital adjustment.  While use of assistive technology significantly predicted spouses' marital adjustment, it was not found to moderate the relationship between degree of hearing loss and spouses' marital adjustment.  Perceived social support was found to mediate the relationships between openness and marital adjustment and conscientiousness and marital adjustment but not for the degree of hearing loss, sudden versus gradual loss, agreeableness, emotional stability, or extraversion.  Implications for clinical practice are also presented.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Large numbers of military veterans are returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan with injuries and mental health issues.  In response to this the Department of Veterans Affairs offers many evidenced based treatments, however, these treatments mostly rely on verbal processing and are not able to help those who have difficulty talking about their experience.  Art therapy, and specifically, visual journaling, offers a potential to fill this void and help those who would benefit from a nonverbal treatment.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The following study provides a literature review relevant to the use of visual journaling with military veterans.  Current treatments that are offered to patients are reviewed.  The benefits of art making are discussed and studies on the benefits of art and writing and detailed.  Lastly, visual journaling and art therapy are discussed with an emphasis on studies demonstrating art therapy's usefulness with military veterans.   </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The study utilized a 6-week visual journaling curriculum developed by the author.  The journaling curriculum was focused on providing education and decreasing symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression and trauma.  The journaling curriculum was used to provide group art therapy at a therapeutic housing community for homeless veterans.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Completion of the journaling group, pre and posttest Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation - Outcome Measure (CORE-OM), and an individual interview were required in order to be included in the study; two participants completed the study.  The data from the CORE-OM was analyzed to determine change in overall score as well as the domains of life functioning, risk/harm, problems/symptoms, and subjective well-being.  The individual interviews were analyzed to determine themes.  The following themes were identified: self-knowledge gained via the journaling process, therapist qualities, individual versus group therapy, art making benefits, and art communicates the "real" me.  Although the CORE-OM did not show clinically significant change, the interviews revealed that the participants did benefit from their participation in the journaling group.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Several confounding variables affected this study including the common time-line with another study that was being conducted in the area, the conclusion of the group coinciding with the conclusion of the academic semester and the participants placing the study at a lower priority than their other appointments.  Due to the small sample size and the fact that both participants were receiving other mental health treatment at the time of the study, the results cannot be generalized.  The finding of results that are consistent with some results of other studies, and the benefit received from the participants indicates that the use of visual journaling can be beneficial to military veterans in recovery and further study is warranted.  Suggestions for future study include utilizing the visual journaling curriculum with a larger group of military veterans and utilizing the curriculum with individuals.   Additionally, suggestions for art therapists that wish to use visual journaling with their clients are included.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation aims to advance the understanding and applicability of nanotechnology through the use of nanoparticles as conjugated delivery agents. By providing multi-functionality of a nanoparticle and a nucleic acid therapeutic, such as DNA or siRNA, we are able to alter the cell to express therapeutics needed for disease states. Furthermore, by expanding our complex design we are able to apply these techniques to clinically relevant therapies, such as traumatic brain injury applications or treatment of multidrug resistant cancer cells through the use of mesenchymal stem cells and gliosarcoma lines, respectively.  Chapter 1 is a general introduction and provides background to the research described in the following chapters. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter 2 discusses the delivery by a nanoparticle platform provides a method to manipulate gene activation, by taking advantage of the high surface area of a nanoparticle and the ability to selectively couple a desired biological moiety to the NP surface. The nanoparticle based transfection approach functions by controlled release of gene regulatory elements from a 6 nm AuNP (gold nanoparticle) surface. The endosomal release of the regulatory elements from the nanoparticle surface results in endogenous protein knockdown simultaneously with exogenous protein expression for the first 48 h. The use of fluorescent proteins as the endogenous and exogenous signals for protein expression enables the efficiency of co-delivery of siRNA (small interfering RNA) for GFP (green fluorescent protein) knockdown and a dsRed-express linearized plasmid for induction to be optically analyzed in CRL-2794, a human kidney cell line expressing an unstable green fluorescent protein. Delivery of the bimodal nanoparticle in cationic liposomes results in 20% GFP knockdown within 24 h of delivery and continues exhibiting knockdown for up to 48 h for the bimodal agent. Simultaneous dsRed expression is observed to initiate within the same time frame with expression levels reaching 34% after 25 days although cells have divided approximately 20 times, implying daughter cell transfection has occurred. Fluorescence cell sorting results in a stable colony, as demonstrated by Western blot analysis. The simultaneous delivery of siRNA and linearized plasmid DNA on the surface of a single nanocrystal provides a unique method for definitive genetic control within a single cell and leads to a very efficient cell transfection protocol.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In Chapter 3, we wanted to understand the NP complex within the cell, and to look at the dynamics of release utilizing nanometal surface energy transfer as a molecular beacon. Transfection of cells to induce a specific protein expression profile forms the basis of engineered cell therapy treatments. The development of non-viral transfection approaches using gold nanoparticles (AuNP) as a gene carrier allows the implementation of advanced biophysical tools to follow the transfection cycle by utilizing nanometal surface energy transfer (NSET) molecular beacon methods coupled to delivery of a gene that induces a fluorescent protein. The change in photoluminescence of an appended dye following gene release from the AuNP surface within endosomes can be tempo-rally and spatially followed. The ability to correlate the release events with the protein expression event by simultaneously monitoring fluorescent protein production provides insight into package uptake, nanoparticle disassembly, and final gene expression. Employing AuNP transfection constructs and then monitoring the stages of the transfection cycle via NSET, indicates delivery of the constructs leads to gene release from the AuNP surface within the endosome followed by slow cytosolic diffusion. The slow diffusion is the limiting step for transfection and impacts the protein yield due to competing degradation processes. The experimental study suggests that the use of the AuNP delivery platform provides synergistic enhancement of transfection by delaying endosomal damage and increasing gene diffusion into the cytosol. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter 4 aims to improve the NP conjugate through the use of cell penetrating peptides (CPP) to Transfect Primary Cells. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been identified as having great potential as an autologous cell therapeutic to treat traumatic brain injury, spinal injury, as well as neuronal and cardiac ischemic events. All future clinical applications of MSC cell therapies must allow the MSC to be harvested, transfected, and induced to express a desired protein or selection of proteins to have medical benefit. For the full potential of MSC cell therapy to be realized, it is desirable to be able to systematically alter the protein expression in harvested MSC cells with high fidelity in a single transfection event. We have developed a bimodal delivery platform based on the use of a solid gold core nanoparticle that has been surface modified to produce a chimera containing a protein transduction domain (PTD) sequence to enhance cellular uptake and a linearized expression vector to induce protein production. The transfection chimera is observed to be an efficient inducer of protein expression following a single treatment of femur bone marrow isolated rat MSCs. Use of the neutral penta-peptide, Ku70, designed from Bax-inhibiting peptides in a 500:1 ratio to the linearized gene yields &gt;80% transfection efficiencies. The combination of being able to selectively engineer the NP, co-localize biological agents, and enhance the stability of those agents have provided the strong impetus to utilize this novel class of materials to engineer primary MSCs.	</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter 5 further develops this idea by using cell penetrating peptides are able to overcome the difficulties of drug transport resulting in improved efficacy of delivery. Research over the past decade has identified several of the key limiting features in multidrug resistance therapy applications, such as, cellular targeting, protection from multidrug resistant mediators and retention of intact and functional drugs. Cell penetrating peptides are able to overcome the difficulties of drug transport resulting in improved efficacy of delivery. Functionalizing the cell penetrating peptide onto the surface of a quantum dot, allows the capability of creating an individualized package for further downstream studies. Four distinct cell penetrating peptides, TAT, VP-22, Ku-70, and hCT (9-32), were utilized to study the different profiles in gliosarcoma lines (rat 9L) with varying resistances to one of the most prescribed drugs in treating glioblastoma in the clinic; BCNU. Results demonstrate that cell penetrating peptide uptake varies with the amount of drug resistance in the gliosarcoma lines, suggesting that although it is known that cell penetrating peptides vary among cell type, but also differ from a parent cell line with varying drug resistance. This study provides insight to developing functional nanoplatform delivery systems in drug resistant models.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of simultaneous lexical-semantic retrieval on parameters of gait in younger and older healthy adults. This simultaneous cognitive-linguistic loading has implications for alterations in ambulation and gait and has been related to risk for injurious falls in both normal and clinical populations with movement disorders. Two groups were compared; twenty healthy young (aged 20-40) and 20 healthy older (aged 50+) individuals, balanced for gender, with no reported history of communication, language, cognitive, physical and neurological movement disorders, participated in this study. Participants walked across a 16 foot mat while verbally retrieving members or exemplars of a given semantic category.  This task of lexical semantic retrieval also has been called generative naming or verbal fluency. The GAITRite Walkway System was used to record gait measurements and generate a Functional Ambulation Profile (FAP) score. The FAP score ranges from 0 to 100; the lower the score, the higher the risks for a serious fall with performance between 95 and 100 considered within normal limits. Participants performed three trials of walks; first, a baseline of walking with no speaking; second, walking while naming types of precious stones aloud; and third, naming types of diseases aloud. FAP scores, accuracy of responses and total number of responses were recorded and were compared across the two age groups. Results showed that the younger group had higher average FAP scores across all walking and talking conditions compared to the older group. Indicating that the older group had increased difficulty performing the speaking task while maintaining a safe gait. The differences were not significant when comparing age groups, however the significant differences in FAP scores within groups was exceptional. Thus, backing up previous research indicating that a medium or difficult lexical-semantic load can adversely impact gait and increase the risk for experiencing a fall.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>As the incarceration rate expanded in the late 20th century, social threat theory was increasingly utilized to explain this growing punishment trend. While primarily finding support, this research has gone only so far as to examine the incarceration decision and sentencing severity. It is a common practice throughout the United States to employ what is known as gaintime in order to reduce an offender's actual time served. As a result, sentence length frequently does not reflect the true punishment experienced. This study seeks to assess the role of racial, ethnic, and economic threat in terms of the previously unutilized measure of the punishment experienced, rather than the punishment prescribed. By means of HLM analysis, dynamic measures of percent black, percent Hispanic, and percent unemployed within Florida's 67 counties were assessed in terms of their relationship to individual level outcomes of sentence length, time served, and percent of sentence served for all Florida inmates admitted to prison between 1990 and 2010. While there were significant threat effects found for the primary outcomes of interest, they were in an unexpected negative direction. These results necessitate further exploration of both the processes by which growth in threat groups affects punishment outcomes, and also the aspect of actual time served in prison as a separate form of social control in the threat relationship.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This project investigates the factors that influence the decisions instructors in Florida State's English Department make about using or not using digital projects in their classes, and specifically how influential the English Department's composing infrastructure is on those decisions. The English Department's composing infrastructure includes material factors--such as computers and composing software and spaces like the Digital Studio and Computer Writing Classrooms--and immaterial factors--such as communities of practice and outlets for assistance with digital technologies. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To investigate these factors, I performed a case study with eight participants who represent the English Department's three major programs (Literature, Creative Writing, and Rhetoric and Composition) and two major faculty categories (teaching assistant and full time faculty). By collecting the instructors' curricula vitae and some of their course materials (syllabi from 2005 to the current semester, and assignment sheets), I was able to determine what types of digital assignments they gave their students. Afterwards, I conducted two interviews with the instructors to find out more about what factors influenced their decisions about including, or not </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>including, these digital projects in their classes. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study found that, in Florida State's English Department, the most influential factors on these decisions in are the instructors' communities of practice and their personal experiences </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>with digital composing. The communities of practice that the instructors belonged to, both in and outside of the university, can both encourage or discourage the implementation of digital projects </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>based on the community's perceptions of such projects. The instructors' personal experiences with digital composing--including digital compositions done by instructors academically and </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>personally--also play a role in these decisions. Instructors who have a system of support that encourages the use of digital projects, and provide pedagogical models to base their digital assignments on, are more likely to include digital projects in their own classes.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Biological systems show a reliance upon their capability to adapt limb stiffness as a means to achieve dynamically similar locomotion over a wide range of terrains. The versatility of robotic platforms falls short in comparison to their biological counterparts. One possible method to enhance the performance of these systems is to integrate a variable stiffness mechanism into the locomotive structure to aid in their adaptability. To date, many variable stiffness mechanisms have been designed, but they have multiple drawbacks. The current mechanisms are typically too slow to achieve rapid adaptations during dynamic locomotion or too large for implementation onto smaller platforms. It is desirable to have a variable stiffness mechanism that is able to achieve a large reduction in stiffness in the minimal amount of time. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This work focuses on the development process of a dielectric elastomer based variable stiffness mechanism as a replacement for traditional springs on a legged hexapedal robot. A simulation is developed assessing the stability benefits of an ideal variable stiffness mechanism actuated over the period of a single stride during dynamic locomotion. The design process is detailed and the characterization of the mechanism in terms of its magnitude for stiffness reduction, transient response to stimuli, and implementability is presented. The newly developed system shows up to an order of magnitude reduction in stiffness at an actuation frequency approximated at 10 Hz. The system is implemented onto an adapted version of the dynamic running robot, iSprawl, and its performance is characterized with respect to forward velocity. Reliability issues in the current manufacturing process pose a potential problem, but new methods are proposed to increase durability and repeatability of the mechanism. Finally, the next generation design for implementation onto a new platform is presented.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Many computational finance problems can be classified into two categories: estimation and prediction. In estimation, one starts with a probability model and expresses the quantity of interest as an expected value or a probability of an event. These quantities are then computed either exactly, or numerically using methods such as numerical PDEs or Monte Carlo simulation. Many problems in derivative pricing and risk management are in this category. In prediction, the main objective is to use methods such as machine learning, neural networks, or Markov chain models, to build a model, train it using historical data, and predict future behavior of some financial indicators.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this dissertation, we consider an estimation method known as the (randomized) quasi-Monte Carlo method. We introduce an acceptance-rejection algorithm for the quasi-Monte Carlo method, which substantially increases the scope of applications where the method can be used efficiently. We prove a convergence result, and discuss examples from applied statistics and derivative pricing. In the second part of the dissertation, we present a novel prediction algorithm based on hidden Markov models. We use the algorithm to predict economic regimes, and stock prices, based on historical data.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Anxiety sensitivity (AS) has become one of the most well researched risk factors for the development of psychopathology.  Research has found that the AS subfactor of cognitive concerns may be play an important role in PTSD, depression, and suicide.  Fear reactivity to biological challenges (or laboratory procedures that induce symptoms of anxiety) have long been used as behavioral measures of AS.  However, fear reactivity to these biological challenges correlates most strongly with AS physical concerns due to the induction of primarily physical symptoms of anxiety (e.g., racing heart, shortness of breath).  Brief computerized interventions have proven successful in reducing overall AS, although these interventions have also focused on the nature of physical symptoms of anxiety.  The current study (N = 59) investigated the relationship between fear reactivity to the induction of dissociative symptoms and AS cognitive concerns, as well as the efficacy of a computerized AS cognitive concerns focused brief intervention. The results demonstrated that individuals with higher AS cognitive concerns experienced greater fear reactivity to dissociative symptoms than individuals with lower AS cognitive concerns. Additionally, there was a significant effect of intervention condition such that individuals in the active treatment condition had lower AS cognitive concerns after the intervention controlling for baseline levels of AS cognitive concerns. The current study provides initial evidence of the utility of using fear reactivity to a dissociation challenge as a behavioral correlate of AS cognitive concerns. The current study also found successful amelioration of AS cognitive concerns though a brief computerized psychoeducation protocol.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>It is well established that the ovarian hormone estradiol exerts its diverse actions primarily via the two classic estrogen receptors (ERs), ER&amp;alpha; and ER&amp;beta;. While available data suggest that ER&amp;alpha; plays an important role (14, 15, 17, 21), the time course over which selective activation of ER&amp;alpha; inhibits food intake differs from that observed following similar administration of a non-selective ER agonist (estradiol benzoate) and thus requires further study. At present, the contribution of ER&amp;beta; to the estrogenic control of food intake remains equivocal. Thus, the goals of the current research were to investigate the time course over which selective activation of ER&amp;alpha; decreases food intake in ovariectomized rats and whether ER&amp;beta; is sufficient or necessary for estradiol's anorexigenic effect. Experiment 1 revealed that acute administration of the ER&amp;alpha; agonist PPT produced a rapid, dose-dependent decrease in food intake that was detected within 2 h and persisted for up to 21-h. In contrast, acute administration of a range of doses of the ER&amp;beta; agonist DPN failed to influence food intake. Experiment 2 revealed that DPN failed to modulate PPT's anorexigenic effect. Experiment 3 revealed that the anorexigenic effect of estradiol benzoate (EB) was not attenuated by co-administration of the ER&amp;beta; antagonist PHTPP. Experiment 4 revealed that the ER&amp;beta; agonist DPN reliably decreased anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze and that this action of DPN was attenuated by co-administration of the ER&amp;beta; antagonist PHTPP. These positive findings confirm the involvement of ER&amp;beta; in mediating estradiol's anxiolytic effect and provide critical evidence that the same dose of these compounds that failed to alter food intake in our feeding tests effectively targeted (activated or blocked) ER&amp;beta;. Taken together, these data demonstrate that PPT exerts a rapid anorexigenic effect that appears to occur with minimal or no delay. Because this time course appears to preclude the involvement of nuclear ERs, which function to alter gene transcription following a long (12-24 h) latency, PPTs rapid anorexigenic effect suggests the involvement of membrane ER&amp;alpha; signaling events. Additionally, our data provide compelling evidence that ER&amp;beta; is neither sufficient nor necessary for estradiol's anorexigenic effect. The null findings associated with DPN and PHTPP are not likely due to insufficient targeting of ER&amp;beta; as both drugs altered anxiety-like behavior, suggesting that appropriate doses were used to probe ER&amp;beta;'s involvement in the estrogenic control of food intake.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Military families experience numerous changes to their lives, including multiple and prolonged separations (Link &amp; Palinkas, 2013) and frequent relocations (Weber &amp; Weber, 2005). As a result concern has grown regarding the effects of these stressors on military families today, particularly for the two million youth in these families. This study sought to provide information regarding the stress process for military youth. Pearlin's Stress Process Model was used to examine the impact of social stressors on youths' outcomes with particular attention on context-specific stressors (Pearlin, Menaghan, Lieberman, &amp; Mullan, 1981). This model identifies three components to explain the development of stress in individuals: sources of stress, mediators of stress, and manifestations of stress (Pearlin, 1999). Mediators of stress are the linking mechanism between the sources of stress and manifestations of stress. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	To test this stress process model, a sample (N =1,036) of military youth from four military installations (three within the United States and one within Europe) was analyzed. The Family and Community Resilience Laboratory (FCRL) at the University of Georgia (UGA) collected the data from military youth, ages 11 to 18, with the goal of understanding the effects of the military lifestyle on youth well-being. An exploratory latent profile analysis (LPA) and subsequent analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests were conducted to address three primary research questions.  First, to what extent do the six primary dimensions of the Adolescent Coping Orientation for Problem Experiences (A-COPE) identify unique coping profiles for military youth? Second, to what extent do context-specific military (parental separations, frequent relocations and parental rank) and normative (minority status) stressors indicate an association with specific coping profile membership for military youth?  Finally, to what extent are the identified coping profiles associated with group differences in depressive symptoms displayed by military youth?</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Results of the exploratory LPA revealed four distinct coping profiles for military youth according to the identified model fit criterion, indicating that the optimal profile solution had been reached for the data. The profiles were labeled as the Low Coping profile, Medium Coping profile, Medium-humor Coping profile and High Coping profile. Youth in all four profiles reported engaging in low levels of maladaptive coping, thus the remainder of the discussion focuses on the adaptive behaviors used within the profiles. Members of the Low Coping profile engaged in all coping behaviors at low or infrequent levels. While those of the High Coping profile engaged in all of the coping behaviors relatively often. Members of the Medium and Medium-humor Coping profile reported scores that fell within the mid-range of the scale. However, the Medium-humor Coping profile differed as it had significantly higher scores on the subscale of Being Humorous.  The second step of the analysis investigated the association between context-specific and normative stressors and the identified coping profiles for military youth. Multinomial logistic regressions found no significant results for the context-specific variables of stress. Minority status was found to be the only significant stressor and indicated that minorities were more likely to be members of the Medium Coping profile than the High Coping profile when compared to non-minorities. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The final analysis conducted involved four one-way ANOVAs used to identify group differences in depressive symptoms displayed based on coping profile membership. Significant differences were found for each of the depressive subscales. Post-hoc analyses revealed that the general trend was that the High Coping profile reported the fewest depressive symptoms across all indicators.  More specifically, in terms of Somatic Symptoms, significantly higher scores were reported for the Medium and Medium-humor Coping profile than those in the High Coping profile. For the Depressive Affect and Interpersonal Problems subscales, the Medium Coping profile reported more depressive symptomology than the High Coping profile. For Positive Affect, the Low Coping Profile reported significantly lower levels of positive affect than all of the other profiles. Each coping profile demonstrated significant, unique associations to depressive symptoms with the High Coping profile demonstrating the best overall mental health. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Results demonstrated diverse coping patterns for military youth and these coping patterns are related to varying levels of depressive symptomology. Future research is needed to understand the development and trajectory of these coping behaviors and their long-term influence on mental health outcomes. Longitudinal research and the use of multiple reports by both parents and youth can be beneficial for further understanding of the stress process. For professionals who work with military youth, this information can be useful when developing interventions and prevention programs as the use of adaptive coping may serve to buffer against depressive symptoms. Military parents can also be provided with knowledge regarding behaviors that may serve as warning signs of maladjustment (e.g., the display of poor or infrequent coping behaviors).</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>On March 11, 2011, the Northeastern Area (Tohoku) of Japan experienced the largest earthquake and tsunami ever recorded in this area. Following the disasters, professional sports organizations conducted disaster relief efforts by hosting charity matches, visiting temporary housing areas (mentoring and listening to victims), creating awareness using different logos in/around the public areas, etc. These activities are considered corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives. CSR has been a popular topic in the sports world, but little attention has been paid to CSR activities following natural disasters. The purpose of this research was to assess the community members' responses to sport organizations based on CSR initiatives after a natural disaster. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The nature of this research was exploratory; interviews were conducted with individuals living in the geographic area directly impacted by the Tohoku Earthquake and Tsunami in Japan in 2011. The interviewees were also involved with the relief efforts to some extent. Through this research I explored the degree to which the recipients were aware of the relief efforts, the effects, and their attitudes toward the sports organizations/players. Based on the interview responses, the relief efforts by the professional sports organizations were well known, and the activities not only enhanced the image and reputations of the organizations and players, but also improved the recipients' psychological connections (i.e. familiarity, interest, and attachment) with the organizations and/or the players.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The ethnic and national melange that characterized the Pacific Northwest in the first half of the nineteenth century (Native Americans, Metis, Hawaiians, British, Americans, and French-Canadians all called it home) facilitated a wide range of local and trans-regional religious exchanges largely visible within the networks, resources, and methods of the area's foremost economy: the fur trade.  I argue that this trans-continental commercialism, sustained in part by the trafficking of furs in the colonial Northwest, integrated into its system of operations a hemispheric religious economy, whereby fur trade and religious transactions manifested as conflated economic performances within the larger scope of imperial expansion.  I explore a variety of religious encounters from the early stages of the trade to its collapse in the mid-century.  After establishing a historiographical and interpretative framework in chapter one, I highlight, in chapter two, the interplay between indigenous prophecy and fur trade imports from eastern North America and Europe, which included not only durable goods, but also theologies and moralities.  In chapter three, I underscore the role played by Hawaiian employees of fur trading companies in shaping a religious economy which linked the Northwest to a wider Pacific World exchange.  In chapter four, I dissect the region's leading trade organization, the London-based Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), and their exploitation of religion as a means of preserving a monopolizing control over all commercial activity in the area.  Lastly, in chapters five and six, I scrutinize the Protestant and Catholic mission economies, and their comparable yet contrasting forms of dependence on the capital of fur trading giants such as the HBC.  In the end, I suggest that the diffusion of religion into the "secular" - into the "commercial" and "ecological" - during the early nineteenth century set a precedent for the contemporary Northwest as the "None Zone."</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The underlying goal of this study was to answer the central question: How do teachers design for and implement their understanding of writing as a social practice in the classroom by way of assignments (text) and pedagogy (context)? Writing as a social practice is here defined as a function of the interrelationships among five key terms--context, community, audience, interaction, and circulation. I have chosen to focus particularly on two main processes of the social: interaction and circulation, what I call the social-in-action. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation has examined the role of the social nature of writing in terms of interaction and circulation in a single case study comprised of three scenes. These three scenes are second semester first-year composition courses. To answer the central question, I chose to look at a single assignment in each of the three scenes. This case study has shown that the social was enacted in each of the three scenes in what I refer to as mechanisms of the social. A mechanism of the social is the means by which a teacher enacted the social in terms of interaction and/or circulation in connection to a single assignment. Each mechanism took on a different role in the context of each scene in one or more of three ways: as extension, as enrichment, or as integral.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Each scene speaks to the social nature of writing; however, they do so in very different ways, and some are more visible to students than others. Based on this information, we can surmise that an enactment of the social makes integral to an assignment layered mechanisms of the social. Put differently, multiple mechanisms that speak to each other and play off of one another are structured into the design and implementation of the assignment. They are interrelated, and at their core exists a focus on writing.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>If students are to understand writing as a social practice and to engage in writing as a social act, these findings suggest that the strategic integration of multiple layered mechanisms is one approach that helps facilitate this kind of understanding and engagement.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>ABSTRACT</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The development of easily-accessible and densely-functionalized synthetic intermediates is a longstanding goal of the organic chemistry community. The use of transition metal catalysts has allowed many synthetic targets to be produced with minimal waste. Copper(I) has distinct advantages to its use as a catalyst for organic transformations, in that it is relatively cheap and non-toxic by comparison to other metals which see frequent use. Hydroboration chemistry, in particular, has seen some of these benefits, as copper(I) catalyst systems for hydroboration have been the source of much research in the past 15 years, enabling the production of a wide variety of complex boron-containing synthetic intermediates via addition reactions to unsaturated bonds. The research contained herein describes our efforts to improve the methods for functionalization of unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds using N-heterocyclic carbene-copper(I) catalysts.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The formation of chiral allylboronates via allylic substitution is an important class of reactions owing to the versatile products that result, which can be used subsequently to produce allylic alcohols, homoallylic alcohols as well as to form C-C bonds via coupling reactions. Previously, only a few examples of chiral allylboronates have been described by the asymmetric addition of boron, therefore this was designated a good starting point for our research into this area. Through the use of a copper(I) catalyst with a 6-membered N-heterocyclic carbene (6-NHC) ligand, we have demonstrated the ability to produce chiral allylboronates with a high degree of selectivity. Additionally, this system was found to be stereoconvergant, meaning that both the E and Z-isomeric starting materials resulted in products with the same absolute stereochemistry.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In addition to polarized allylic alkenes, we also investigated the hydroboration of alkenes which are strained but otherwise unactivated, a class of substrates understudied for copper-catalyzed hydroboration. Through the use of a 5-NHC ligand pioneered by Glorius, we were able to achieve the selective hydroboration of unfunctionalized strained alkenes in the presence of non-strained alkenes for a variety of norbornene and styrenic substrates.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In addition to the hydroboration of C-C double bonds, we then became interested in the addition of boron to alkynyl species to produce functionalized vinylboronates. Regioselective hydroborations utilizing copper(I) catalysis have been reported for terminal alkynes and for some internal alkyne systems, however propargylic substrates have been understudied and the ability to access any desired regioiosmer remains elusive. Our efforts have shown that boron addition to propargylic alcohols can be controlled by the careful selection of catalyst and O-protecting group. Specifically, we have demonstrated that the use of a 6-NHC-Cu(I) complex with a m-nitrophenyl propargyl ether results in selectivity for the alpha position with a high degree of selectivity. The use of a 5-NHC-Cu(I) complex to an unprotected propargylic alcohol produced the desired beta-borylated material, also with good selectivity. In this way we have been able to produce a variety of functionalized vinylboronates to which we then turned our attention.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In an effort to showcase the utility of these vinylboronate species, we have also developed an ate-mediated allylic substitution, or AMAS, which can produce tertiary allylboronates by the simple addition of organomagnesium reagent. A variety of Grignard reagents were employed, and it was demonstrated that the AMAS procedure is compatible with most functional groups that are stable under Grignard conditions. To showcase the synthetic viability of this procedure we performed a total synthesis of the sugar molecule methyl axenoside from entirely achiral starting materials. This natural product was synthesized in 9 steps with an overall yield of 10%.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Alzheimer's disease (AD) currently underlies dementia for tens of millions of people worldwide, and its occurrence is set to double in the next 20 years. The currently approved drugs for treating AD only marginally ameliorate cognitive deficits, and provide limited symptomatic relief, while newer substances under therapeutic development are potentially years away from benefiting patients. Melatonin (MEL) is a potent antioxidant, can prevent toxic aggregation of Alzheimer's beta-amyloid (A&amp;#946;) peptide and, when taken long term, can protect against cognitive deficits in APP transgenic mice. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To study the effects of melatonin on brain mitochondrial function in an AD model, APP/PS1 transgenic mice were treated for one-month with melatonin.  Analysis of isolated brain mitochondria from mice indicated that melatonin treatment decreased mitochondrial A&amp;#946; levels by two to fourfold in different brain regions. This was accompanied by a near complete restoration of mitochondrial respiratory rates, membrane potential, and ATP levels in isolated mitochondria from the hippocampus, cortex, or striatum.  When isolated mitochondria from untreated young mice were given melatonin, a slight increase in respiratory rate was observed.  No such effect was observed in mitochondria from aged mice.  In APP-expressing neuroblastoma cells in culture, mitochondrial function was restored by melatonin or by the structurally related compounds indole-3-propionic acid or AFMK.  This restoration was partially blocked by melatonin receptor antagonists indicating melatonin receptor signaling is required for the full effect. Therefore, melatonin receptor signaling may be beneficial for restoring mitochondrial function in AD, and preservation of mitochondrial function may an important mechanism by which long-term melatonin treatment delays cognitive dysfunction in AD mice. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>However, while melatonin is presumed to provide neuroprotection via activation of the two membrane-bound, G-protein-coupled melatonin receptors (GPCR; MTNRs), some data indicate that MEL acts intracellularly to protect mitochondria and neurons by scavenging reactive oxygen species. Therefore, I sought to determine whether the genetic deletion of the MT1 and MT2 receptors (encoded by the MTNR1a and MTNR1b genes respectively) obviates MEL's neuroprotective actions in the A&amp;#946;PPswe/PSEN1dE9 mouse model of AD (2xAD). Beginning at 4 months of age, both AD and control mice either with or without both MTNR receptors were administered either MEL or vehicle in their drinking water for 12 months. Behavioral and cognitive assessments of 15-month-old AD mice revealed receptor-dependent effects of MEL on spatial learning and memory (Barnes Maze, Morris Water Maze), but receptor-independent neuroprotective actions of MEL on non-spatial cognitive performance (Novel Object Recognition Test). Similarly, hippocampal and frontal cortex amyloid plaque load and serum A&amp;#946;1-42 levels were significantly reduced by MEL in a receptor-independent manner, while MEL reduced cortical antioxidant gene expression in a receptor-dependent manner. These findings demonstrate that long-term MEL significantly reduces AD neuropathology and associated cognitive deficits in a manner primarily independent of the two GPCR melatonin cell surface receptors.  Furthermore, melatonin receptor activation combined with non-receptor dependent mechanisms provides the clearest benefit, both cognitively and molecularly. Future identification of direct molecular targets for MEL action in the brain should open new vistas for the development of better AD therapeutics.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The present investigation tested the hypothesis that people with individualistic cultural orientation favor an experience of standing out, whereas those with collectivistic cultural orientation prefer an experience of blending in as a means to meet the need to belong. In Study 1, more often than Koreans, Americans recalled an incident of standing out when they were asked to think about an experience of social acceptance. In contrast, Koreans recalled an experience of blending in more than did Americans. In Study 2, highly independent participants favored a situation in which the self stands out. Those who were highly interdependent, however, preferred a situation in which the self blends into others. In Study 3, regardless of cultural orientations, rejected participants deviated from the cultural defaults more than those in the neutral control condition. Taken together, individualists differed from collectivists in preference for standing out versus blending in as a means to cultivate the sense of social acceptance. However, following recall of intense experience of social exclusion, the cultural differences decreased or even trended toward the opposite direction to those in the neutral condition.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation explores how modern physiological studies and cognitive theory can yield new readings of medieval art objects in the form of embodied responses by medieval viewers. Cognitive theory is useful for understanding the dynamics, or interactivity, between medieval viewers and objects. The mechanics of cognitive reception occur at a physiological level; thus, integrating studies of how the human brain visually processes art objects allows us to understand reception as an embodied response. This dissertation uses cognitive theory as a methodology to investigate three bodies of artwork: thirteenth-century Apocalypse manuscripts, secular ivory mirror cases from fourteenth-century France, and select folios from the fourteenth-century cleric Opicinus de Canistris. The paper not only assesses the value of cognitive theory in understanding the reception of medieval art but also predicts potential audiences, rather than universal ones, for each body of work. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In Chapter 2, I investigate how medieval viewers may have perceived images of the Dead Whore of Babylon from thirteenth-century Apocalypses. The depiction of the Whore as a woman instead of a city in Revelation 19 is limited to a few manuscripts. Contrary to scholarship that suggests that this image of the Whore would disengage a medieval audience, I argue that medieval viewers may have had a sympathetic or empathetic response to the Whore's image. I cite scientific studies involving the human brain's response to body position and eye contact as evidence of an embodied response in this chapter. An empathetic response could potentially override the totally negative characterization of the Whore in the text of Revelation. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In Chapter 3, I argue that viewers would have had individual, variable embodied responses to the male and female figures on secular ivory mirror cases. The narrative reference of these objects is highly ambiguous, so I suggest that viewers would have assessed the dynamic between male and female figures based upon their degree of eye contact or lack thereof. Scholarship discusses the relationship between these men and women based upon a theoretical assessment of `the gaze," while I apply scientific studies to uncover its physiological implications. Here, cognitive theory allows us to understand the mechanics behind reception and the highly individual interpretations by medieval viewers. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter 4 investigates the role of text and textual schemata as navigational devices that encourage embodied responses in medieval viewers. The textual and visual components of fol. 24r are too complex to speculate about the general medieval reception of the image, so I construct a hypothetical cognitive map for a limited audience comprising learned men. Scientific studies demonstrate that motor neurons allow a viewer to conceive of Opicinus's work as an artistic device that could lead to a spiritual embodied response.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>I conclude that, when properly applied, scientific studies and cognitive theory are useful tools for understanding the physiological aspects of the reception of medieval art objects by medieval audiences. Each type of art object demands different studies and applications of cognitive theory. In addition, the embodied responses of medieval viewers are always hypothetical because an individual viewer's cognitive map, or unique understanding of the world, always mediates the brain's physiological responses. Despite the fact that embodied responses are ultimately subjective, physiological and cognitive studies allow art historians to hypothesize about medieval reception in new terms.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>DNA replication in eukaryotic cells follows a temporal order that is consistent from cell cycle to cell cycle and is correlated with the spatial organization of DNA in the nucleus. This "replication-timing program" is conserved in evolution, shares dynamic relationships with cell-type-specific properties of chromatin in multicellular organisms, and is disrupted in many human diseases including cancer. Despite these intriguing associations, over 50 years of research has yet to uncover any biological significance for a replication-timing program and little is known about how the program is determined. This dissertation combined various approaches designed primarily to determine whether any determinants of replication timing are encoded in the DNA sequence and to understand the nature of such putative regulatory elements. The collective work demonstrates the existence of DNA elements that sufficiently direct human-specific replication timing in a mouse background, and a neural-specific switch in replication timing at an otherwise constitutive locus in the mouse genome. Minor differences in DNA sequence such as single nucleotide polymorphism or small insertions or deletions had no detectable effect on replication timing, while rearrangements of large chromosome segments or site-specific insertion of certain bacterial artificial chromosomes exhibited a dominant regulatory effect on replication timing in ectopic contexts. In addition, perturbations to replication timing that were associated with genetic rearrangement and cancer were shown to align with changes that occur during normal development and with topologically-associating chromosome domains, demonstrating that stable structural subunits underlie the regulation of replication timing. Further dissection of DNA fragments sufficient to direct replication timing should help to uncover the trans factors responsible for executing the replication-timing program and will hopefully provide insight into the significance of replication timing for cell function and disease.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>High temperature superconducting power cables have the advantage of high current density and low losses over conventional cables. One of the factors that affect the stability and reliability of a superconducting cable is the distribution of current among the tapes of cable.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Current distribution was investigated as a function of variations in contact resistance, individual tape critical current (I&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;), and index (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;)-value of individual tapes. It has been shown that besides contact resistances, variations in other superconducting parameters affect current distribution. Variations in critical current and &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-value become important at low contact resistances. The effects of collective variations in contact resistances, individual tape I&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-values were studied through simulations using Monte Carlo method. Using an experimentally validated mathematical model, 1000 cables were simulated with normally distributed random values of contact resistances, individual tape I&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;s, and &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-values. Current distribution in the 1000 simulated cables demonstrated the need for selecting tapes with a narrow distribution in the superconducting parameters to minimize the risk of catastrophic damage to superconducting cables during their operation. It has been demonstrated that there is a potential danger of pushing some tapes closer to their I&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; before the current in the cable reaches its design critical current.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Mathematical models were also used to study the effect of longitudinal variations in the tape parameters on superconducting cable using Monte Carlo simulations. Each tape of a 30 meter long, 3 kA model cable with 30 tapes was considered to have longitudinal variations in I&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, and n values for every 1 cm section, thus generating particular standard deviation in I&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; for all 3000 sections of each tape. The results indicate that the apparent critical current and index value of the cable are reduced by a certain percentage depending upon the extent of variation in the characteristics along the length of the tapes.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation investigates place ethos, a crucial component of rhetorics on place: visual and verbal texts that construct specific geographical locations. Through examining rhetorical representations of place, we can better understand the interplay of environments and occupants in order to enact sustainable, ethical practices in our living and teaching contexts. Drawing on Aristotelian and Isocratean descriptions of ethos as based both in text and community, this study argues that place ethos is a dynamic rhetorical strategy that contributes significantly to rhetorics on place by shaping how we perceive places through texts.  To demonstrate the contribution of place ethos to rhetorics on place, this study examines place ethos as constructed through interrelated representations of Reconstruction era Florida, a time of regional re-imagining, as stakeholders constructed competing visions to draw Northern tourists and entrepreneurs to the southern state.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>My line of inquiry in this project includes the following key questions: 1) How do classical models of ethos apply in contemporary critical study of rhetorical character construction, and how might these models be expanded? and 2) How is ethos constructed verbally and visually for a place, and how do these constructions complement and challenge each other? I address these questions through a rhetorical analysis of discursive and visual texts designed to reconfigure postbellum Florida as an attractive destination for Northern tourists in the 1870s.  As a way into understanding how a variety of materials can together function to build a place ethos, I examine nineteenth-century travel guidebooks, stereoscopic photographs, and Harriet Beecher Stowe's Florida-themed essay collection, Palmetto Leaves. The critical framework that serves as a lens to analyze place ethos in these texts is a hybrid classical model of rhetorical ethos drawing on the Aristotelian triadic notion of ethos as arete, phronesis, and eunoia, and Isocratean notions of community-shaped perceptions and practices of goodness. This analytic lens reveals that widely circulated nineteenth-century Florida travel texts, both verbal and visual, construed Florida as a paradisiacal getaway for reform-minded Northerners; at the same time, these texts build conflicting arguments about the role of Northern action in Florida commercial and moral development. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Through applying a hybrid classical model of rhetorical ethos to a specific socio-historical context, this study extends our understanding of rhetorics on place, which circulate as texts of places that can interact and effect a place through visual and verbal representation.  The study finds that verbal rhetorics on place build a place ethos through multiple descriptive components, which act together persuasively, and that visual rhetorics on place build a place ethos through multiple textual components acting together with viewing practices and technologies.  Additionally, the study finds that rhetorics on place, with co-dominant visual and verbal aspects, construct place ethos through visual-verbal interplay, and that this construction can be relationally understood to other eth&amp;#275; in and related to the text.  These three iterations of place ethos are not mutually exclusive, and provide multiple, overlapping options for exploring the dynamic of place ethos in action with all of its contradictions.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The implications for this study are fourfold.  First, the study extends how we understand the rhetoric of place, or the rhetorical power of a location's material composition, through the conception of rhetorics on place, or the textual artifacts that influence, create, and interact with perceptions of a place.  Second, this study introduces the concept of place ethos, a complex rhetorical structure that significantly contributes to rhetorics on place by constructing character for a location.  Third, in tracing the rhetorical work of verbal and visual representation, this project illuminates the multiple strategies by which place ethos emerges.  Lastly, the dissertation holds implications for rhetorical ethos more widely, as it participates in a contemporary move to extend the reach of ethos by dislodging its conventional position directed by an individual rhetor and into a more dynamic, interactive rhetorical world.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation is an account of conservative social movement activism.  Conservative political projects are characterized by advocacy of market-centric state policies.  Conservative social movement activism is one variety of conservative politics distinguishable by the focus on the inclusion of more voices in democratic institutions.  As a subject of academic research contentious politics in general and social movements in particular have spawned far-reaching and well-developed dialogue (see edited volumes by Aminzade et al. 2001; Leitner, Peck and Sheppard 2007; McAdam, McCarthy and Zald 1996a).  Social scientists from the disciplines of Political Science, Sociology, History, Anthropology and Geography all contribute a wide array of theoretical constructs and methodological applications for a truly multi-disciplinary discussion on the topic. Noticeably underrepresented in this corpus of work is attention to conservative contentious politics.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>What follows is a case study of Tea Party activism as a variety of conservative contentious politics.  This study approaches the role of Tea Party activism during the 2010 election cycle in what is arguable the height of Tea Party influence in United States' politics.  One of the locations where the influence of Tea Party activism was most evident is Tennessee.  The question at the center of this project is how did Tea Party activism during the 2010 election cycle shape scalar politics in the Tennessee Republican gubernatorial primary?  By applying MacKinnon's (2011) scalar politics to public speeches made by the Republican candidates for governor in Tennessee, I find that Tea Party activism effectively increased the scale of movement participants' influence in state politics.  I conclude the candidates made normal the role of Tea Party activism in campaigning for public office in Tennessee.  The implications of this study point to new fields of inquiry into contentious politics specific to electoral politics.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In the ever-developing field of media, the primary manner in which users access, interact with, and use media is continuously becoming more physical in nature. As greater physical demands are placed on the user, the means through which users control media continue to shift from the use of a traditional control device (i.e. keyboard, mouse, gamepad, etc.) to the use of the body. This use of the entirety of the user's body both allows and obligates users to move with greater effort and freedom: the degree to which a user moves determines the final outcome of the media. As the amount of bodily movement required of the user continues to increase, it becomes critical to focus on the relationship between bodily movement and media. In view of these circumstances, this dissertation reconsiders movement, taking into account the physical aspects of the movements initiated through the actions of the users' bodies as they engage with selected forms of movement based media. Relying on various theories concerned with movement, dance, kinesiology, media, and culture, this rethinking of movement renders the methods necessary to identify and define the relationship between bodily movement and media, and to consider what impact this relationship may have on further studies of media and culture.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Converging evidence suggests that acute states of overarousal (namely, agitation, insomnia, and nightmares) are commonly observed prior to near-lethal or lethal suicidal behavior. Yet, there has been very little research evaluating theory-driven explanations of these phenomena.  The intention of the proposed project was to address this gap in the literature by drawing from and extending the tenets of the interpersonal theory of suicide (Joiner, 2005; Van Orden et al., 2010), which suggests that most individuals will be discouraged from engaging in suicidal behavior because of its fearsome nature.  For most individuals, the prospect of engaging in potentially lethal suicidal behavior will elicit some degree of arousal.  We expected that the effect of arousal would be particularly relevant, however, when considered in the context of the acquired capability for suicide.  A total of 191 participants were randomized to an arousal induction (500-mg caffeine) or placebo control condition. All participants then engaged in a behavioral approach task designed as a proxy for suicidal behavior, which involves assessing approach motivation toward a potential lethal stimulus. Main analyses examined the independent and joint effects of acquired capability and arousal on approach motivation. Secondary analyses considered whether the effects would be better understood in the context of factors thought to contribute to suicidal desire. The influence of depressive symptoms on the relationship between arousal and suicidal behavior as well as the effects of arousal on pain tolerance were also examined within exploratory analyses. Results were partially in line with expectations. Findings are considered within the context of the broader literature, providing insight on directions for future research further elaborating our understanding of the nature of the relationship between overarousal and suicidal behavior.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>International students face deeper and more complicated transitional issues in addition to the "normal" transitional issues that student-athletes face (Boyer &amp; Sedlacek, 1986; Hechanova-Alampay, Beehr, Christiansen &amp; Van Horn, 2002). The process of transition from one culture to another is known as Acculturation (Castro, 2003). The role of gender, academic classification (time at the U.S institution), length of time in the U.S., and sport type, are examined in this study to elucidate their effects on the acculturation process. Questionnaires were used to examine participants' acculturation integration, orientation, acculturative stress and social support. Many mixed reviews in the current literature were echoed in the current study with few statistically significant results for the demographic variables investigated. Attention is drawn to the study design and complex nature of culture studies as avenues necessary to be reviewed when reconsidering this topic (Castro, 2003). This investigation of acculturation is of great interest for coaches, athletic administration, and athlete support professionals who seek to work and further support this growing population of international-student-athletes (Connell, 2007).</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Sports officials experience moderate to low amounts of stress, which can affect the outcome of games, seasons, and officials' careers. Furthermore, officials' report that the criticality of game situation (situation criticality) is one of the major sources of stress they experience. Situation criticality is comprised of score differential (i.e., more pressure in close games) and time remaining in a game (i.e., more pressure as time expires). Surprisingly, there is a lack of research examining the association between situation criticality and officials' stress level. However, previous research has indicated that situation criticality impacts athletes' stress levels (Bar-Eli &amp; Tenenbaum, 1998a). Thus, the present study explored the effect of situation criticality on officials' stress levels. Specifically, high school basketball officials were given a survey packet containing game situations that vary in criticality (i.e., score differential:  &gt; 6, &lt; 6, and tied game; time of game: two minutes into the first half, last two minutes in the first half, last two minutes in the second half). For each game situation (a total of nine) officials completed the Stress Appraisal Measure (SAM). The SAM includes a measure of overall stress level as well as the officials' appraisals of the stressor. Results revealed that situation criticality has an effect on officials' perceived stress levels. Officials' perceived stress levels increased as score differential decreased and as time remaining in the game decreased. In addition, officials reported that a tie game at the end of the second half was the most stressful situation presented. Both threat and challenge appraisals were positively correlated with perceived stress. Furthermore, results indicated that threat appraisal had the greatest impact on overall stress level. These findings indicate that officials' stress levels fluctuate within games depending on score differential and time of game. This finding should encourage officials to manage their stress, possibly through their appraisals, to improve performance and job satisfaction. Additionally, this finding can impacts the training of officials in the management of stress as well as potential rule changes that reflect the increased situational demands on officials in critical situations (e.g., expanded instant replay).</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Currently, few scansorial robots exist that are capable of operating on rough exterior surfaces. None of these platforms have, as of yet, been able to achieve high speed dynamic climbing on these surfaces. This thesis shows that through the use of compliant micro-spines, a miniature dynamic climber, BOB, is capable of climbing dynamically at high speed on rough exterior surfaces. A new manufacturing method for micro-spines is examined. The effects of micro-spine arrays onto a dynamic climber are examined and how the micro-spines affect compliance, roll, and yaw. Methods to mitigate the effects of these dynamic motions are also examined and presented.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>A fundamental need of human culture is to eat, and therefore to have food available to its citizens. Unfortunately, agricultural and distribution practices have reduced many communities to "food deserts" where healthy, fulfilling food is scarce (Walker, 2012). Present agricultural methods that evolved from the Industrial Revolution consume copious amounts of fossil fuels from planting to shipping operations, only to generate interminable amounts of unhealthy processed foods. Current industrial farming methods used have had unintended consequences on public health, local economies, and substantial negative impacts of the earth's ecosystems (Despommier, 2010).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Many agree that present food distribution channels and farm-to-fork methods require an overhaul in order to preserve limited natural resources for future generations. The future may be the concept of the urban farm. Food distribution channels and procedures are central to the success of this new idea and therefore serve as the main focus of this study. With an effective distribution process, harvested food from vertical farms allows opportunities for food related stakeholders to invest their business operations within the facility's campus and continue to thrive and serve their customers. The purpose of the study was to discover how the built environment could support a new food distribution system that increases access to healthy food.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	In the first phase, the study examined the yearly baseline amount of vegetables necessary to feed approximately 10,000 residents located within .5 miles (walking distance) and one mile of the project's hypothetical location. Using USDA daily recommendation guidelines, the researcher found that the hypothetical urban farm could produce food for 940 of the 10,000 people per year in the study area by farming ten floors at 6885 square feet each on a 365-day cycle. In addition, she discovered that 700 of the 10,000 people living in that area were considered Low Income (LI) and Low Access (LA) by the USDA, meaning that they faced economic challenges coupled with transportation hardships in getting to the nearest supermarket. Therefore, the researcher proposed that the vertical farm could potentially produce at least enough food to fulfill the needs of the most vulnerable population, those considered Low Income (LI) and Low Access (LA) by the USDA Food Access Research Locator (2012). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Second, the study examined the forces at play that would affect a successful urban food distribution system. Hypothetical food stakeholders were queried through a pre-questionnaire, a design charrette, and a post-questionnaire to determine how the workflow efficiencies of an urban food hub would be most effectively designed to provide success for its stakeholders' businesses. These hypothetical stakeholders included farmers, a restaurateur, farmers' market managers, grocery store representatives, and community food related advocates.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The research questions were filtered through the framework of four of Peña and Parshall's concepts from Problem Seeking, An Architectural Primer, (2001), specifically 1) Priority, 2) Relationships, 3) Communications, and 4) Neighbors.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Some of the major emergent themes that resulted from the research component of this thesis were as follows:</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>*	Food brokers are necessary for small, local farmers and were missing presently from local food distribution channels; </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>*	The educational component in teaching both children and adults about healthy food preparation was critical in combatting some of the problems associated with food challenges; and,</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>*	Public perception of a vertical farm and urban food hub would drive its type of users. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>With this information, the researcher knew that it was important to address these themes in the design process. The ultimate goal of the vertical farm and urban food hub was to make it successful for its food stakeholders while being inclusive to all members of the community, regardless of economic status.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	With that information, a solution was devised that included the renovation of two existing buildings. The first was a multi-story, 100,000 square foot, hexadecagon structure where the lower floor became a Market, a Food Broker's Office, and a Seed Library. The first floor was made into the Eatery with an exterior K-12 Teaching Garden. The second floor was designated as administrative support, facilities operations, and a plant nursery. In addition, the third through twelfth floors became the growing space for the vertical farm that supported these distribution outlets. Parking area on the site was allotted as space for a recurring farmers' market.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The second building, a one-story 5000 square foot structure became a Shared-Use Kitchen for start-up food entrepreneurs to launch their food businesses. This building also included area for a Studio Teaching Kitchen that the general public could attend cooking demonstrations.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	This study found that the success of a new food distribution system is dependent in part on the physical architecture that supports its new needs in an economically viable way for these vendors and their consumers. Planning spaces for growing food, in addition to the supporting areas that facilitate its distribution, provided options in progressing toward a more sustainable future. These measures can then address challenges that range from obesity and malnutrition to environmental preservation.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>It is not uncommon for a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I school to have an athletic apparel contract (AAC) with an established athletic apparel company. These relationships have evolved over time to the point that the AACs seem to have become institutionalized in collegiate athletics. Institutionalization refers to the repetition of organizational arrangements (Washington &amp; Patterson, 2009) to the point that it exists as a `norm' within a culture. While there are certain benefits to these contracts, there are also associated risks. AACs often include clauses requiring every student-athlete at the school to wear brand name apparel for practice and competition, regardless of satisfaction with the product. Considering volleyball is typically a non-revenue generating sport at many NCAA Division I schools, student-athletes are often required to wear a certain type of shoe due to contract restrictions. Problems may arise if the sponsored shoes do not meet the needs, specifically the health and safety needs, of the student-athlete. Coaches are often involved in the selection of the teams' shoes, while athletic trainers must manage any medical consequences resulting from ill-fitting shoes. Given the notion that AACs have been institutionalized in the collegiate athletic setting, including restricted shoe selection, this study was conducted to gain insight into the factors influencing volleyball shoe selection. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The study was qualitative and involved semi-structured interviews with 11 volleyball coaches and athletic trainers in the Southeastern and Atlantic Coast athletic conferences. For purposes of data analysis, the researcher utilized the four dialogic moments as described by Markula and Silk (2011): recalling, listening around, close reading, and representing self and others. Results were presented according to coaches and athletic trainers, separately. Factors identified by coaches were the evidence of dissatisfaction, general benefits of a school's AAC, insufficient volleyball shoe options from sponsors, and medical concerns. Factors identified by athletic trainers included medical concerns, general benefits of a school's AAC, and insufficient volleyball shoe options from the sponsor. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In general, results of this study supported the notion that AACs have become institutionalized in select NCAA Division I volleyball programs through the development of volleyball teams being a dependent beneficiary from their school's AAC. While the sponsored brands met participants' expectations in regard to the quantity of volleyball shoes provided, the sponsored brands did not meet participants' expectations regarding quality. Overall, participants were willing to overlook these negative concerns for the benefit of their athletic department as a whole. The subject matter adds value to the sport management profession by providing sport managers, Division I schools, and athletic apparel sponsors a perspective on the sponsor-school relationship as it pertains to athletic apparel contracts, but further research into other sports' shoe selection processes, as well as the student-athletes' and sponsored brands' perception of the effect of an AAC is needed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Microwave reactors offer convenience in sealed tube, high temperature reactions that can lower reaction time, increasing the value of certain synthetic procedures. Benzylation of alcohols, carboxylic acids and arenes using 2-benzyloxy-1-methylpyridinium triflate (BnOPT) translates smoothly from conventional heating to a microwave-heated method in trifluorotoluene in at 120 °C. Use of BnOPT avoids typical highly acidic and highly basic conditions of Benzylation, and compared to the analogous reaction in an oil bath is completed in 20 minutes as opposed to 24 hours.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	In addition to shortening reaction times, 2-benzyloxy-1-methylpyridinium tetrakis(3, 5-bistrifluoromethylphenyl) borate (BnOPB), an analog of BnOPT, strongly supports the existence of microwave effects in homogeneous solutions despite widespread skepticism. Inspired by several unexplained observations in the area of microwave chemistry, we hypothesized that microwave effects would most likely be observed with a thermally-activated, highly polar (microwave-absorbing) reagent dissolved in a largely nonpolar (microwave transparent) solvent. Applied microwave energy is selectively absorbed by BnOPB leading to Friedel-Crafts benzylation of the solvent (toluene or xylene) that is not dependent solely on observed bulk temperature and which cannot be reproduced in an oil bath. A reflux-controlled reaction circumvents the fallibility of temperature probes which demonstrated an enhanced reactivity in a microwave reactor versus an oil bath (36% versus 67% after 30 minutes). We have coined the term microwave-actuated organic reactions: reactions for which there is clear benefit under microwave-heated conditions as compared to an oil bath reaction of the same temperature. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Though using a solvent's physical property of boiling point, our data and conclusions are still met skeptically. In a debate style series of essays in Angewandte Chemie International Edition, we defended our work providing further data to support our conclusions and pointing out fallacies in the opposing essay denouncing our work. Three main points were addressed in our rebuttal essay: 1) our conclusions were misstated by the opposing author, 2) our experiments were inappropriately replicated and 3) the text of the authors essay and their supporting information are inconsistent with one another. Each of these points is addressed in full detail below, but the biggest issue raised by Kappe, et al. was that our refluxing toluene temperature was actually higher than literature-reported boiling point under microwave-heating, which could certainly undermine our conclusions. A quick analysis of the boiling point using a NIST-calibrated fiber-optic probe under several conditions proved to liberate us from these claims.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	It is clear to us that microwave effects exist, yet our desire to distance our work from the controversy associated with the nebulous terms of "microwave effects", "athermal microwave effects" and "specific microwave effects" has led us to develop a new term: microwave-specific thermal effects (MSTE). We define MSTEs as reactivity enhancements that are thermal in nature, but cannot be replicated outside of a microwave reactor. It is our belief that selective absorption of microwave energy by BnOPB in nonpolar solutions creates a temperature differential between the bulk solvent and the solvent cage surrounding the reagent. Reactivity should thus be based on the temperature of the microenvironment surrounding the reagent, not the bulk solvent temperature.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Having shown that MSTEs exist, it became our goal to begin quantifying the extent of their effect. First order kinetic plots were created from conversion data of xylene to benzylxylene in the presence of BnOPB at varying temperatures from which Arrhenius plots were derived. An activation energy of 30.2 kcal/mol and a pre-exponential value of 9.64 x 1013 sec-1 were calculated. In conjunction with the Arrhenius equation (k = Ae(-Ea/RT)), kinetic data allows us to relate how observed changes can affect different varaiables of the Arrhenius equation that may approximate the extent of observed MSTEs. Best results were obtained using external cooling of a reaction vessel heated at high microwave power where we observed about a seven-fold increase in reaction rate under microwave heating. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Success was shown in demonstrating MSTEs in another reaction: the conversion of allyl p-nitrophenyl ether to 2-allyl-4-nitrophenol by Claisen rearrangement. The system was examined under constant temperature, constant power and pulsed microwave heating. Constant temperature conditions nearly completely hid MSTEs. MSTEs were clearly observed under constant power conditions showing about a 4-fold rate enhancement. Best results were observed under pulsed microwave heating which showed about a 9-fold rate enhancement.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Spherical regression explores relationships between pairs of variables on spherical domains. Spherical data has become more prevalent in biological, gaming, geographical, and meteorological investigations, creating a need for tools that analyze such data. Previous works on spherical regression have focused on rigid parametric models or nonparametric kernel smoothing methods. This leaves a huge gap in the available tools with no intermediate options currently available. This work will develop two such intermediate models, one parametric using projective linear transformation and one nonparametric model using diffeomorphic maps from a sphere to itself. The models are estimated in a maximum-likelihood framework using gradient-based optimizations. For the parametric model, an efficient Newton-Raphson algorithm is derived and asymptotic analysis is developed. A first-order roughness penalty is specified for the nonparametric model using the Jacobian of diffeomorphisms. The prediction performance of the proposed models are compared with state-of-the-art methods using simulated and  real data involving plate tectonics, cloud deformations, wind, accelerometer, bird migration, and vector-cardiogram data.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Depression is associated with subsequent dementia in older adults, and two distinct, but not mutually exclusive, hypotheses have been suggested to account for this relationship. The "glucocorticoid cascade hypothesis" posits depression over the lifespan damages the brain, particularly the hippocampus, increasing risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The "prodrome hypothesis" suggests vascular episodes affect underlying neurological processing, giving rise to both late-life, prodromal depressive symptoms and cognitive deficits. Evidence to date does not conclusively support one hypothesis over another. We examined age of depression onset among a sample of clinically depressed patients age 60 and older to better understand the mechanisms of this association. We predicted early-onset depression (EOD; &lt;age 60) is consistent with the glucocorticoid cascade hypothesis and would be associated with greater rates of AD and impairment on neurocognitive tests sensitive to AD over time. We also predicted late-onset depression (LOD; age 60+) is consistent with the prodrome hypothesis and would be associated with greater rates of vascular dementia and impairment on neurocognitive tests sensitive to vascular dementia.  Hypotheses were tested using second-order latent growth curve modeling (n=204) and regression analyses (n=485). Contrary to hypotheses, LOD as opposed to EOD was associated with greater rates of dementia and AD, as well as impaired episodic memory, a domain affected in early AD. Sixteen percent of LOD versus 4% of EOD patients developed AD. Results suggest at least some subtypes of depression occurring for the first time in late life (LOD) are associated with increased risk for dementias such as AD.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Research suggests that intolerance of uncertainty (IU) may be a maintaining factor for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Cognitive models contend that information-processing biases play an etiological role in anxiety. One such bias can occur at the stage of information-processing when stimulus information is interpreted and evaluated, with anxious individuals being more likely to display a threatening interpretation. Interpretation bias modifications (IBMs) seek to alter automatic interpretations and have been shown to lead to reductions in symptoms for anxious populations. IBM as a potential treatment modality may also be more efficiently utilized by addressing transdiagnostic, cognitive factors. The present study investigated the utility of a novel IBM in addressing threatening interpretations of ambiguous situations.  Further, the present study proposed that in reducing threatening interpretations of ambiguous situations, the IBM would affect performance during an in vivo checking task as well as symptoms related to IU when uncertainty was induced. A student sample with elevated checking symptoms (N = 64) was recruited. Following completion of a questionnaire battery assessing OC symptoms and IU, participants were randomly assigned to a single-session of positive interpretation training (reducing threat-related biases) or a control training group.  Afterwards, bias for interpreting uncertain situations as threatening or safe was measured.  Subsequently, participants engaged in a behavioral stove-checking task, during which anxiety and urge to check were measured as well as an uncertainty induction during which state IU and current anxiety were measured. Results indicated that participants in the positive interpretation training condition demonstrated a lower bias in interpreting these situations as threatening, relative to the control condition.  The positive training condition led to lower peak anxiety during the checking task and lower current anxiety during the uncertainty induction relative to the control condition.  Further, these effects were fully mediated by differences in threat-related interpretation bias.  These findings provide initial support for the utility of IBM in addressing symptoms of compulsive checking and IU.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>In this work, we study the phenomenology of direct photon production using theoretical predictions at next-to-leading order with threshold resummation up to next-to-leading- logarithmic accuracy . By analyzing the global data sets of direct photons, we have found a good agreement between the theory and the data for a wide range of energies (&amp;#8730;s = 23 GeV up to 7 TeV) if we exclude the data from E706 experiment. We have study the potential impact of direct photon data on parton distribution functions using Bayesian reweighting approach. A reduction of 10% around 0.3 &lt; x &lt; 0.6 is observed in the uncertainties of the gluon distribution.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The overall objective of this dissertation is to enhance understanding of the role of social networks in creative systems and new product development. Two essays examine the effects of local and global social network characteristics on key marketing outcomes. Conventional team configuration strategies encompass descriptive measures, such as demographic and functional variables, to achieve a team configuration comprised of cross-functional diversity. However, systems theory suggests that social networks are an important contextual component of team performance. This research identifies key network characteristics that impact team performance in creative contexts such as new product development. Findings suggest that social networks are an important factor in team configuration, and ultimately in downstream team performance outcomes. As marketers evolve into leaders of new product development teams, creative teams, and sales teams, the insights from this body of work will have important practical implications.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The first essay establishes the baseline effects of team social network characteristics on product quality, customer satisfaction, and financial performance. Findings demonstrate that social network characteristics are an important component of team configuration. In the context of creative industries, significant effects were found between team network characteristics and marketing outcomes. Interestingly, results demonstrate that the commonly held belief that cohesive teams increase team performance does not necessarily hold in creative contexts. The work uncovers the ripple effect internal team structures can have on the performance of creative products, even in cases of remote services, where the customer does not directly interact with the team. Thus, the findings contribute to the body of scholarly work on teams and social networks, and they offer insights for practitioners regarding the costs and benefits of highly connected and highly cohesive teams. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	In the second essay, employing the systems theory of creativity, the examination of the structural mechanisms impacting team performance deepens to include the effect of team leaders. Specifically, it examines the effect of "heavyweight" leaders on team performance as measured by product quality assessments and customer satisfaction. Team leader clout is found to have a significant effect on third-party product quality assessments, impact the availability of financial resources, and offset the negative effect of high cohesion on team performance. Moreover, a curvilinear relationship between cohesion and product quality assessments is identified, suggesting that moderately cohesive teams outperform teams with low or high levels of cohesion and providing clarity to the negative effect identified in essay one. This work, therefore, extends the insights in the first essay and sheds additional light on the impacts of social networks on team performance, including the distinct effect of team leader networks. Taken together, the two essays offer insights for managers of new product development teams, sales teams, and teams engaged in creative processes where novelty, innovation, and originality are valued.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to identify current practices and expectations associated with pitch discrimination ability as well as assess the effectiveness of a model intonation training program.  Specifically, this study was implemented in two phases.  Phase one sought to discern current tuning procedures and intonation training techniques in use by K-12 school directors  (n=273) and collegiate band directors (n=55), as well as identify expectations of incoming collegiate music students.  Two questionnaires were developed and distributed to a national sample to gather information related to the tuning process.  In phase two, available teaching texts and empirical literature were reviewed to develop an intonation training program.  The program was implemented over six weeks with students enrolled in a middle and high school band program.  Two equivalent additional sites were utilized as a control group.  All participants (N=47) were assessed using an identical pre- and post-test.  The test was comprised of three tasks.  The paired-comparison task asked participants to identify if the second note of each pair was in-tune or out-of-tune, the tuning task asked participants to tune their instrument to three stimulus timbres, and the final task was performing a brief melodic example.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Reviewing results from phase one, it appeared school directors believed it was somewhat important to tune everyday while collegiate directors felt it was very important to tune everyday.  When tuning, most directors appeared to favor a "bottom-up" approach beginning with the tuba.  While school directors identified F and Bb as their initial tuning note(s), collegiate directors identified A and Bb as their preferred initial tuning note(s).  Often cited in-class teaching techniques included working with a tuner, vocalization, and practicing with drones.  Outside of the classroom, directors asked their students to work with a tuner and complete intonation-tendency charts.  While a majority of collegiate directors (65%) indicated they taught their ensembles differences between systems of temperament, a majority of school directors (54%) elected not to teach this concept due to time concerns or less-experienced ensemble members.  Additional sample-specific questions were utilized.  A significant majority of school directors believed intonation instruction should begin in beginning band or earlier as part of an elementary music course.  Collegiate directors appeared to expect incoming music students to posses a high-level of pitch discrimination ability and successfully operate the mechanical and physical tuning aspects of their instrument.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Phase two results from each task of the pre- and post-test were reviewed to determine the effectiveness of the researcher-designed intonation training program.  No significant differences were found between conditions on each task indicating the program was not effective in developing participant's pitch discrimination abilities within the treatment period.  However, several findings corroborated prior research.  Both latency and accuracy responses to the paired-comparison task significantly improved when stimuli deviated greater than 20-cents.  Additionally, an interesting effect was found when comparing results by deviation magnitude and deviation direction.  Though a tolerance for sharp intonation has been noted in prior literature, results from the current study indicated sharp stimuli were identified significantly faster than flat stimuli when deviated greater than 20-cents.  Reviewing results of the tuning task, participants were significantly more accurate when tuning during the post-test than during the pre-test.  As no significant differences were found between conditions on the tuning task, the increased level of tuning accuracy may be the result of musical training or task familiarity.  Additional findings in the melodic task indicated unison intervals deviated less than other intervals.  Implications for teacher education, as well as suggestions for further research, are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Within the field of criminology, there is no shortage of theoretical perspectives.  While these theoretical perspectives are quite diverse, they do share a common thread: an exclusive focus on social factors that contribute to criminal behavior.  Despite the limited explanatory power of both classic and more recent criminological theories, an overt sociological focus persists within criminological theory.  In direct contrast, the biosocial perspective offers a more comprehensive explanation of behavior, with a focus on both biological and environmental influences.  Despite the contributions of the biosocial perspective in elucidating the underlying etiology of antisocial behavior, there is currently a paucity of theories which can be effectively situated within the biosocial perspective.  In an effort to spark theoretical development within the biosocial perspective, this dissertation proposes a biosocial integration model which allows for various forms of theoretical development and integration.  In addition, four mainstream criminological theories--rational choice theory, social learning theory, classic strain theory, and social bonding theory--were empirically examined using genetically sensitive research designs in an attempt to fit such theories within the biosocial perspective.  The results revealed three key findings.  First, nearly all (more than 80 percent) of the measures examined in this dissertation were significantly influenced by genes.  Second, while multivariate regression models identified a large number of significant associations between key theoretical concepts and antisocial behavior, many of these associations fell from statistical significance after controlling for genetic and shared environmental influences.  Third, even after controlling for genetic influences, some theoretical concepts were significantly associated with antisocial behavior and substance use.  Additional models revealed that several theoretical concepts also significantly moderated genetic influences on the examined outcomes.  The findings are contextualized within the extant literature and suggestions for future research and theoretical development are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Prior research has documented a general decline in children's learning value and self-concept (i.e., expectation for success), beginning in the first years of school. Students who demonstrated patterns of low academic value and low academic self-concept often tend to perform poorly in school (Gans, Kenny, &amp; Ghany, 2003). In the present thesis work, the author further investigated children's self-concept (i.e., expectation for success) and task-values by asking students to rate themselves in math and reading, compared to the others in their class. Student ratings were then compared with teacher report to determine if student overestimation predicts his or her self-concept and value in both reading and math. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This is a quantitative study, based on a sample (n = 173) of students within four counties in the southeastern United States. The subsequent quantitative data analysis was conducted by utilizing correlational analyses, regression analyses, and path analyses.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 154 in the western equatorial Atlantic cored Paleocene - Holocene strata at Site 929 on the Ceara Rise. The calcareous nannofossil biostratigraphy of the Oligocene - lower Miocene sequence at Hole 929A is a necessary compliment to shipboard analysis. The analysis of Hole 929A samples presented here yielded 9 biozones defined by 10 nannofossil datums. Of these datums, two first occurrences (FO) and eight last occurrences (LO) were distinguished according to the Martini (1971) Zonation scheme. Based on quantitative analysis 21 genera and 79 species were identified in this section. The assemblages have abundances from rare to very abundant with moderate to good preservation and overgrowth on the lower Miocene discoasters.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The Ceara Rise and the analogous Sierra Leone Rise are located on opposite sides of the equatorial Atlantic Ocean and are bounded by the same fracture zones. The Ceara Rise is on the western side, whereas the Sierra Leone Rise is in the eastern side. The two sites, Site 929 and Site 366, on these two rises were correlated via their nannofossils. However, because of poor preservation at Site 366 the zonal boundaries between NN3/NN2, NN1/ NP25, and NP22/NP21 are not well detailed. The relative abundance (%) of the total assemblages and their sedimentation rates in the western equatorial Atlantic were also calculated, and those for Hole 929A were generally higher.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation examines American-Egyptian relations from 1962 to 1967 during the Yemeni civil war. The central question that is raised here is: how did Nasser's security and political dilemma cause a breakdown in American-Egyptian relations and contribute to the outbreak of the Six Day War in June 1967? Based on archival research in Israel, the West Bank in Palestine, the United States, and Great Britain, I argue that Gamal Abdul Nasser did not pursue a strategy of confrontation with the United States in the 1960s, but was in fact responding to a security and a political threat or dilemma he faced in the Middle East and in Egypt. As he confronted this security dilemma, Nasser's solutions ran counter to America's strategic goals for the region. My research found that the collapse in relations took place at a crucial moment for Nasser. While he was dealing with the break in American-Egyptian relations, Nasser was also confronting his political enemies in Egypt. At the same time, he was challenged for the leadership of Arab nationalism by conservative Arab regimes (Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Libya) and by the Ba'athists. The implications for Egypt and the United States were disastrous for it led to a break in relations between them and eventually resulted in the May Crisis in 1967 that preceded the Six Day War.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>In this dissertation, we build a compartment model to investigate the dynamics of spread of dengue fever in both human and mosquito populations. We study the demographic factors that influence equilibrium prevalence, and perform a sensitivity analysis on the basic reproduction number. Among several intervention measures, the effects of two potential control methods for dengue fever are estimated: introducing &lt;i&gt;Wolbachia&lt;i&gt; to the mosquito population and introducing vaccines to the human population. A stochastic model for transmission of dengue fever is also built to explore the effect of some demographic factors.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Frequently researchers base their decisions and interpretations on conclusions drawn from data analyses, but what happens when the data used in the analyses are collected from unreliable instruments or surveys?  The instrument may include a particular question that invokes different interpretations based on group membership, thereby placing one of the two groups at an unfair disadvantage.  Another challenge occurs when the size of the sample under investigation (i.e., number of respondents or participants) is unavoidably small, adding more uncertainty to parameter estimates.  Over the past 50 years, researchers have suggested many different approaches for identifying problematic questions (i.e., items that are biased), but no consensus has been reached as to which method is best.  In addition, selecting appropriate methods becomes even more challenging when smaller sample sizes are involved (Lai, Teresi, &amp; Gershon, 2005).  This dissertation presents the findings of a study introducing a new method for identifying DIF and potentially biased items.  The study explored the use of the Item Information Curve (IIC) as a weighting strategy (i.e., Weighted Area Method - WAM) to the area between Item Characteristic Curves (ICC) as a way to identify problematic questions.  Through thousands of simulations, the performance of WAM was compared to two other commonly used methods for detecting DIF - the Mantel-Haenszel approach (Mantel &amp; Haenszel, 1959)  and the Rudner's Area method (Rudner, 1977).  The results show the effects of sample size variations on identifying modeled DIF items, and the opportunity for future Differential Item Functioning (DIF) analyses using WAM.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Beginning January 18, 2011, proposals submitted to The National Science Foundation (NSF) must include a supplementary Data Management Plan (DMP) of no more than two pages. The NSF DMP requirement has significantly redefined the role of scientists, researchers, and practitioners in the United States of America (USA) by presenting the opportunity to engage in effective data management planning and practices for current and future use. In order for data to be useful to research, science, scholarship, and education, data must be identified, described, shared, discovered, extended, stored, managed, and consulted over its lifecycle (Bush, 1945; Lord &amp; Macdonald, 2003; Hunter, 2005; JISC, 2006; UIUC GLIS, 2006/2010; NSF, 2011).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Within the scope of this research study data management planning is defined as the planning of policies for the management of data types, formats, metadata, standards, integrity, privacy, protection, confidentiality, security, intellectual property rights, dissemination, reuse/re-distribution, derivatives, archives, preservation, and access (NSF, 2011). The management of data includes analog [physical], digitized [made electronic] &amp; born digital [no physical surrogate] data. NSF's data management plan requirements have incentivized the development of a multitude of programs, projects, and initiatives aimed at promoting and providing data management planning knowledge, skills, and abilities for NSF data management plan requirements compliancy. Without the specification, clarification, &amp; definition of key concepts; assessment of current data management practices, experiences,  &amp; methods; interrelationships of key concepts; and utilization of multiple methodological approaches, data management will be problematic, fragmented, and ineffective. The accomplishment of effective data management is contingent on funders, stakeholders, and users' investment and support in Infrastructure, Cultural Change, Economic Sustainability, Data Management Guidelines, and Ethics and Internet Protocol (Blatecky, 2012, p. 5) across organizations, institutions, &amp; domains.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>One of the goals of the researcher "is to select a theory or combine [multiple theoretical perspectives] so they resonate with the guiding research questions, data-collection methods, analysis procedures, and presentation of findings" (Bodner &amp; Orgill, 2007, p. 115) within a conceptual framework that "places its assumptions in view for practitioners" (Crotty, 1998). The introduction of the Conceptual Framework for Analyzing Methodological Suppositions (Burrell &amp; Morgan, 1979: Morgan &amp; Smircich, 1980: Morgan, 1983, Solem, 1993) to gather competing approaches and paradigmatic assumptions for multiple paradigm integration and crossing via interplay (Schultz &amp; Hatch, 1996) is an attempt by the researcher to build theory from multiple paradigms through Metatriangulation (Lewis &amp; Grimes, 1999), a theory-building approach. Within this study, the Data Asset Framework (DAF) is framed as a sequential mixed methods explanatory research design (Creswell and Plano Clark, 2011) and applies social science research to facilitate scientific inquiry. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study is to investigate the data management and curation practices of scientists at several research laboratories at the Florida State University and select scientists associated with the National Science Foundation (NSF) EarthCube project. The goal of this research is not to provide extensive literature review to prove the need for effective data management practices but to provide empirical evidence to support current data management and curation practices. Within the scope of this dissertation, data management and curation practices will be generally defined as the effective aggregation, organization, representation, dissemination, and preservation of data. Data refers to analog and digital objects, databases, data sets, and research data. For purposes of discussions in this study, data is both singular and plural.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Data management and curation practices include four key concepts: (1) data management planning, (2) data curation, (3) digital curation, and (4) digital preservation. Literature review suggests that these key concepts when applied with relevant standards, best practices, and guidelines can assist scientists in ensuring the integrity, accessibility, and stewardship of research data throughout its lifecycle. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The combination of the conceptual framework for analyzing methodological suppositions (Burrell &amp; Morgan, 1979; Morgan &amp; Smircich, 1980; Morgan, 1983; Solem, 1993), Metatriangulation (Lewis &amp; Grimes, 1999), and the Data Asset Framework (DAF) (JISC, 2009) contributes to the development of an interdisciplinary conceptual framework model concept capable of addressing the data management and curation issues common across disciplines. For the purpose of this dissertation "research data are being understood as both primary input into research and first order results of that research " (ESRC, 2010, p. 2).</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Stress predicts alcohol use but less is known about the role of racial discrimination, a chronic and ubiquitous stressor, as a risk factor for underage drinking among Black youth.  While most studies examine race/ethnic differences when exploring underage drinking outcomes, there is a need to understand within-group differences on the stress-alcohol use link in order to focus alcohol prevention and intervention efforts.  Thus, this study sought to identify homogeneous subgroups of Black youth based on their experiences of racial discrimination by their teachers and peers in middle and high-school and assess whether these subgroups differed on alcohol-related outcomes in emerging adulthood.  Latent transition analyses (LTA) was performed on racial discrimination indicators derived while youth were in the 8th and 11th grade.  Findings demonstrated 3 distinct subgroups of youth.  Youth in the Teacher-Peer Perceived Racial Discrimination (PRD) group were characterized as having high probabilities of experiencing racial discrimination from both teachers and peers.  Those in the Teacher PRD group had high probabilities of experiencing racial discrimination from teachers and a low probability of experiencing racial discrimination from their peers.  Finally, youth in the No PRD group had low probabilities across all racial discrimination indicators.  Males were more likely to be in the Teacher-Peer and Teacher PRD groups compared to females.  Youth in the Teacher-Peer PRD group consumed significantly more alcohol than the other groups, whereas, the Teacher PRD group experienced significantly more alcohol-related consequences.  Parents' strategies on how to deal with racial discrimination were not significant protective factors for youth within any group.  Implications of the study suggest the need to reduce race-based stress within the school context as a form of intervention and prevention of underage drinking among Blacks.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation provides an exploration into the intricate relationship between the emotional volatility extant during spectator sport consumption and consumer memory for marketing stimuli.  Emotional activity is measured across two dimensions (i.e., emotional arousal and valence), and an experimental methodology is implemented that allows for the competition of several theoretical predictions deriving from a variety of domains pertaining to the effect of volatility within each dimension upon consumer memory.  Regarding the arousal-memory interaction, these predictions include (1) the arousal enhancement hypothesis, which predicts a comprehensive improvement in memory due to the presence of emotional arousal, (2) the cognitive resource allocation model, which predicts a comprehensive decline in memory due to the presence of emotional arousal, (3) the peripheral neglect hypothesis, which predicts the enhancement of memory for temporally, conceptually, and spatially central information and impairment of memory for peripheral information due to the presence of emotional arousal, and (4) state dependent memory, which refers to the phenomenon that memory relies upon a consistency in psychological contexts across encoding and retrieval.  Regarding the valence-memory interaction, three predictions were tested:  (1) positive valence effect, which refers to the prediction that emotional valence is positively related to probability of recall, (2) selectivity for valenced stimuli, which refers to the tendency to selectively encode/retrieve information with a non-neutral affective tone, and (3) state-dependent encoding, which refers to the tendency to selectively encode information with an affective tone that is congruent with one's current emotional valence state.  This research provides support for a state-dependent view of the emotion-memory relationship.  Recall patterns also approximated those predicted by the peripheral neglect hypothesis.  The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are provided</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation involves the relationship between market structures and innovation, with an eye to implications for antitrust. The first chapter considers whether more competitive market structures encourage more cost-reducing, process innovation. Markets with realized costs of production closer to their cost frontier are said to be more x-efficient. The chapter concludes that more competition reduces x-inefficiency but may actually increase the welfare loss from x-inefficiency. The second and third chapters ask whether the feasibility of product innovation affects the likelihood of price collusion. It is hypothesized that when product innovation is less feasible, price collusion is more likely. The second chapter provides some anecdotal evidence for this conjecture, but demonstrates the difficulties of empirically testing the conjecture. The third chapter reports laboratory experiments which support the conjecture.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This purpose of this dissertation is to identify how journalist and newspaper publisher Almena Davis Lomax (1915-2011) attempted to persuade her Los Angeles Tribune readers to accept her vision of a better United States through her editorials and columns. Utilizing African American women's rhetorical theory and grounded theory, this rhetorical biography examined selected Tribune editorials and columns obtained primarily from the online database "African American Newspapers, 1827-1998," accessed through the Florida State University and Florida A&amp;M University libraries. This database included 150 issues of the Tribune, from Sept. 6, 1943 to April 22, 1960. Specific years included were 1943, 1944, 1946, 1958, 1959, and 1960. Although the database did not include all issues, the available editions spanned the approximate length of the newspaper's publication (1941-1960). I supplemented the database's editions with several issues from 1945, 1955, and 1956 available from the Almena Lomax Papers at Emory University Library's Manuscript, Archives, and Rare Book Library. I thus conducted a convenience sample of extant editorials and columns in my analysis. Additional primary sources, which help shed light on Lomax's life, were obtained from the California State University-Fullerton Oral History Program (oral history of Lomax) and MARBL (interviews with Lomax and non-Tribune writings of Lomax's). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>From the online database and MARBL, I analyzed Tribune editorials written by Lomax labeled "Editorial What-Not," "More Editorial What-Not," "Political What-Not," "More Political What-Not," and "How `Bout This." For each of the selected writings, I completed a data sheet based on Tippens' (2001) general guidelines, with modifications: 1. Column name, date, and page number; 2. Main topic; 3. Main theme; 4. Subtheme(s) (if any); 5. Argument/Claim; 6. Specific rhetorical tools.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Once a data sheet was recorded for each editorial/column, all writings were then grouped chronologically. Within each of these time periods, I used the grounded theory approach and close reading to identify any themes and subthemes common in Lomax's available writings during the time period. Within each theme/subtheme, I then identified the most frequently occurring rhetorical tools, the best examples of Lomax's use of each tool, and my own argument as to how these tools functioned within that theme/subtheme(s). Each analysis chapter also included a critical argument I suggested as to how Lomax's rhetorical tools may have functioned within the time period under consideration to advance her arguments/claims within her Tribune editorials/columns. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>1943-1956</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>During the Tribune's beginning and middle years, based on available editorials/columns, Lomax was primarily concerned with sociocultural issues and politics/civil rights. When addressing sociocultural issues, Lomax mainly employed self-disclosure and personal anecdote as rhetorical tools; when dealing with politics/civil rights, she engaged a variety of rhetorical means in her attempts to convince her Tribune readers. According to Kohrs Campbell (1986), Lomax's "authoritative," confrontational tone and style would have constituted a "masculine" form of discourse, though with some "feminine" elements (namely the privileging of personal experience, metaphorical language, and narrative modes of development); I suggest, however, that Lomax, as an African American woman, embodied a distinct rhetorical tradition whose features should not be evaluated in relation to an alien, superimposed standard of femininity, but should instead be assessed by its own merits as an entity unto itself (Royster, 2000; Davis &amp; Houston, 2002).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>1958</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In 1958, Lomax appeared to be mainly preoccupied with politics/civil rights, but also sociocultural and personal concerns. Her Tribune editorials/columns dealing with politics/civil rights were largely characterized by name calling and/or inventive, as well as a sarcastic, cynical, and/or patronizing tone. Those addressing sociocultural issues featured mainly ethos as the primary rhetorical tool, and those concerned with personal issues most frequently utilized personal appeals, personal anecdotes, and ethos in her efforts to influence readers. Overall, her efforts to persuade her readers at this time through these means may have functioned rhetorically as her attempt to reinforce her desired persona as not only a knowledgeable and independent-minded journalist, but also as a worthwhile human being, despite her mental and emotional struggles.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>1959-1960</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In 1959-1960, Lomax appeared primarily concerned with issues of political leadership, and, to a lesser extent, politics/civic rights and personal issues. Although Lomax once again primarily utilized her favored rhetorical tool of cynicism in her available editorials/columns of 1959-1960, she also used whatever rhetorical means she found appropriate to meet her aims, especially when addressing politics/civil rights or personal issues. This variety of tools arguably functioned rhetorically to advance Lomax's stance as a capable, wise (especially in light of her eminent contested move South), and knowledgeable journalist, mother, and human being.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>A positive correlation between sea surface temperature (SST) and wind stress perturbation near strong SST gradients (&amp;#916;SST) has been observed in different parts of the world ocean, such as the Gulf Stream in the North Atlantic and the Kuroshio Extension east of Japan. These changes in winds and SSTs can modify near&amp;ndash;surface stability, surface stress, and latent and sensible heat fluxes. In general, these small scale processes are poorly modeled in Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) and climate models. Failure to account for these air&amp;ndash;sea interactions produces inaccurate values of turbulent fluxes, and therefore a misrepresentation of the energy, moisture, and momentum budgets. Our goal is to determine the change in these surface turbulent fluxes due to overlooking the correlated variability in winds, SSTs, and related variables. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para> 	To model these air&amp;ndash;sea interactions, a flux model was forced with and without SST&amp;ndash;induced changes to the surface wind fields. The SST modification to the wind fields is based on a baroclinic argument as implemented by the University of Washington Planetary Boundary&amp;ndash;Layer (UWPBL) model. Other input parameters include 2&amp;ndash;m air temperature, 2&amp;ndash;m dew point temperature, surface pressure (all from ERA&amp;ndash;interim), and Reynolds Daily Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (OISST). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Flux model runs are performed every 6 hours starting in December 2002 and ending in November 2003. From these model outputs, seasonal, monthly, and daily means of the difference between &amp;#916;SST and no &amp;#916;SST effects on sensible heat flux (SHF), latent heat flux (LHF), and surface stress are calculated. Since the greatest impacts occur during the winter season, six additional December&amp;ndash;January&amp;ndash;February (DJF) seasons were analyzed for 1987&amp;mdash;1990 and 1999&amp;mdash;2002.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The greatest differences in surface turbulent fluxes are concentrated near strong SST fronts associated with the Gulf Stream and Kuroshio Extension. On average, 2002&amp;mdash;2003 DJF seasonal differences in SHF, LHF, and wind stress over the Gulf Stream are 3.86 &amp;plusmn; 0.096 W/m&lt;super&gt;2&lt;/super&gt;, 6.84 &amp;plusmn; 0.186 W/m&lt;super&gt;2&lt;/super&gt;, and 0.032 &amp;plusmn; 0.0008 N/m&lt;super&gt;2&lt;/super&gt;, respectively. In addition, smaller flux differences covering large expanses of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans are non&amp;ndash;negligible for most upper oceanic applications sensitive to multi&amp;ndash;decadal changes. Due to these non&amp;ndash;linear processes, average changes in surface turbulent fluxes are not zero.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>As director of the War Relocation Authority Photographic Section, Tom Wesley Parker (1907-76) produced hours of unedited footage and several completed films, which were integrated into an expansive World War II propaganda program in a period that has become known as the "Golden Age of Propaganda." On March 18, 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt had formed the WRA, a civilian agency that was responsible for the forced relocation and incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II. In addition to overseeing the incarceration camps, part of the WRA's stated mission was to document every step of the removal process by means of printed materials, posters, photographs, and films. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This thesis contends that Parker's  films constitute a particular strand of cinematic domestic propaganda, a category of visual media thus far underdeveloped in scholarly literature. By synthesizing the discourse of propagandized media with critical film texts, I develop a framework to understand the WRA films' considerable place in the complex narrative of visual rhetoric in America. Furthermore, I reveal how these films demonstrate the WRA's conscious effort to investigate cinema's formal and communicative limits in America's burgeoning industrial society. In particular, I explain how in Japanese Relocation (1942) and A Challenge to Democracy (1944) Parker synthesized cinematic techniques and rhetorical devices from a myriad of non-fiction film genres, including social documentaries, educational films, and newsreels. In doing so, Parker devised a form of filmic practice that simultaneously recalled the history of social documentary films, simulated wartime reportage, and engaged with both the anxieties of postwar resettlement and the desires of an emergent American consumer culture.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>What is at stake here is not only an acknowledgement of the films' significant position as domestic propaganda, but also their engagement with entrenched notions of nationality, and their participation in visual tropes of modernism and modernity. I conceptualize the WRA films as performing the task of regulating or reshaping the Japanese American citizen to satisfy existing anxieties about post-war resettlement and urban-industrial expansion. Moreover, the WRA films take part in an effort in the mid-twentieth century to institutionalize an array of visual media for propagandistic aims, and, most striking, the WRA films depict a conflict between visual culture and politics that is as relevant today as ever. Thus, this thesis lays the groundwork for a more nuanced formal and conceptual analysis of this genre of nonfiction film.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Dynamic pricing has become one of the most popular pricing strategies of developed online shopping environments and provides efficiency for both providers and consumers in the service industry. Spectator sport providers have recently adopted dynamic ticket pricing (DTP), which is a type of dynamic pricing and discriminated prices, as a result of DTP, may lead to perceptions of unfairness, especially during the early stages of its adoption. The aim of the current research was to develop a conceptual framework based on relevant consumer psychology theories, including distributive and procedural justice, equity, and social comparison theories, in order to empirically investigate the formation and influence of perceptions of price fairness.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Four categories of questions corresponding to a given scenario were employed via a questionnaire to collect data: predictors of price fairness, perceptions of price fairness, behavioral intentions, and demographic sections. Participants who define themselves as current or potential sports consumers were selected using a convenient sampling method in a face-to-face mode. After verifying the items using exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and structural equation modeling (SEM) was performed to examine: (1) the influence of predictors of price fairness (i.e., magnitude and temporal proximity price difference, perceived nonmonetary sacrifice, and price setter fairness) on perceptions of price fairness; (2) differences in degrees of influence on perceptions of price fairness between the two groups of price fairness predictors (i.e., similar other-reference and self-reference group) depending on comparison targets; and (3) the influence of perceptions of price fairness on behavioral intentions. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Using SEM the hypotheses were tested. First, magnitude of price difference was strongly and negatively associated with perception of price fairness, while temporal proximity positively influence the fairness perception. Also, price setter fairness was positively consistent with perception of price fairness. Furthermore, it was found that created perception of price fairness was negatively correlated with self-protection and revenge intentions, although the fairness perception positively effects repurchase intentions.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The current research was expected to contribute to the soft landing of DTP in the spectator sport industry by providing critical information of factors determining price fairness judgment, and the effects of perceptions of price fairness on behavioral intentions for better understanding of DTP for both researchers and practitioners.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study articulates the reinvention of rewriting in postmodern fiction from the 1980s to present, focusing particularly on the writings of Zadie Smith, Jeanette Winterson, and Emma Tennant.  These three authors have made history and their characters' personal and political engagements with the past and the rewriting of previous narratives and works of fiction central features of their own fiction.  Postmodernism, with its belief in the instability, and essential sameness of history and literature, has enabled writers to blur the factual and the imagined. What Smith, Winterson, Tennant and many other contemporary women writers seek to explore is the present's relationship with the past and the inescapability of the historical in the contemporary, while using theories of intertextuality problematize the concept of authorship. Particularly for the woman author and reader, there is an imperative to deconstruct the gendered assumptions of literature and, in doing so, find a new potential for women's literary production.  While contemporary women writers of historical fiction and their various agendas resist neat categorization, what these writers have in common is their self-conscious project of problematizing the very nature of the authored and authorized character of historical narrative.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This work implements inverse methods in various polymer characterization problems. In the first topic, a new approach is proposed to infer the comonomer content using Crystaf method considering and quantifying the associated uncertainty.  In the second topic, a comparison is carried out between various rheological probes (methods) to determine their sensitivity in long-chain branching (LCB) detection and measurement. In the last topic, an open-source software is implemented to infer continuous and discrete relaxation modulus.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Mindfulness techniques have been used in the field of psychology to decrease anxiety and depressive symptoms in clients since the late 1970s, and previous research has reported the  effectiveness of these interventions (Khoury et al., 2013). However, the addition of music to mindfulness techniques is only beginning to be experimentally tested in the field of music therapy. This study attempted to determine if a live music-accompanied mindful body scan would decrease the anxiety symptoms and increase the mindful awareness of older adults residing in three different assisted living facilities in Tallahassee, Florida. Twenty older adults participated in this study, of which ten received the live music-accompanied body scan intervention twice over a period of one week and ten were in the wait-list control group. Of the twenty older adults, eighteen were female and two were male. The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) were given as pre- and post-tests to both groups. Both the experimental and control groups' scores significantly decreased on the BAI, W = 100, &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; = 2.36, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = .018, but there was no significant difference between the groups, U = 40.5, &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; = 0.68, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &gt; 0.49. A comparison of the experimental condition participants' scores on the BAI found a significant difference from pre-test to post-test, rs = 0.72, &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; = 2.95, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.02. Scores on the MAAS for both groups showed no significant difference from pre- to post-test, U = 58, &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; = -0.57, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &gt; 0.57. The significant decrease in scores on the BAI for both groups does not implicitly suggest the use of mindfulness-based music listening. It does indicate that participation was a factor in decreasing anxiety for the experimental group, and that taking the test itself was a factor for the control group. Further research should be conducted with larger groups to determine the efficacy of these techniques over a longer treatment period, and perhaps mindfulness techniques could be taught for long-term self-management of anxiety, as well.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Constructing generative models for functional observations is an important task in statistical function analysis. In general, functional data contains both phase (or x or horizontal) and amplitude (or y or vertical) variability.  Traditional methods often ignore the phase variability and focus solely on the amplitude variation, using cross-sectional techniques such as functional principal component analysis for dimensional reduction and regression for data modeling.  Ignoring phase variability leads to a loss of structure in the data, and inefficiency in data models.  Moreover, most methods use a "pre-processing'' alignment step  to remove the phase-variability; without considering a more natural joint solution.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation presents three approaches to this problem.  The first relies on separating the phase (x-axis) and amplitude (y-axis), then modeling these components using joint distributions.  This separation in turn, is performed using a technique called elastic alignment of functions that involves a new mathematical representation of functional data.  Then, using individual principal components, one for each phase and amplitude components, it imposes joint probability models on principal coefficients of these components while respecting the nonlinear geometry of the phase representation space.  The second combines the phase-variability into the objective function for two component analysis methods, functional principal component analysis and functional principal least squares.  This creates a more complete solution, as the phase-variability is removed while simultaneously extracting the components.  The third approach combines the phase-variability into the functional linear regression model and then extends the model to logistic and multinomial logistic regression.  Through incorporating the phase-variability a more parsimonious regression model is obtained and therefore, more accurate prediction of observations is achieved.  These models then are easily extended from functional data to curves (which are essentially functions in R2) to perform regression with curves as predictors.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>These ideas are demonstrated using random sampling for models estimated from simulated and real datasets, and show their superiority over models that ignore phase-amplitude separation.  Furthermore, the models are applied to classification of functional data and achieve high performance in applications involving SONAR signals of underwater objects, handwritten signatures, periodic body movements recorded by smart phones, and physiological data.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The management of solid waste is a major environmental concern in the United States. Waste tire rubber forms a major part of this problem and a rather severe one since tire rubbers are not biodegradable hence its disposal into landfills are of great concern. This research primarily focused on finding the best way of producing paving concrete with the use of ground tire rubber as a component material. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Tests on rubber concrete were performed in two stages. Preliminary tests were performed using both 40-mesh GTR and 3/8-inch rubber chips (RC) to replace fine aggregates and coarse aggregates respectively by weight in the concrete mix. This stage of testing considered zero to 40 percent GTR replacement of fine aggregates by weight at 10 percent increment and for zero to 30 percent RC replacement of coarse aggregates by weight at 10 percent increment.  Observations from this stage guided the formulation of a second and final stage of testing which involved only zero to 20 percent GTR replacement of fine aggregate by weight at 5 percent increment. The mix design for this stage involved the use of water reducers, air-entrainer and fly-ash. In addition to concrete mechanical property tests, coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), plastic shrinkage and drying (free) shrinkage tests were also conducted. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para> Results from preliminary tests indicated that GTR and RC concrete specimens were of relatively low strength, improved toughness and showed more elasticity when compared to normal concrete specimens. The final stage of laboratory testing however showed improved strength characteristics, with the initial observations of improved toughness and low modulus of elasticity still evident. Coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) test results did not show significant difference between mix-types, with the range of results falling within the typical limit for normal concrete. Plastic shrinkage test results showed that the inclusion of GTR helped in reducing plastic shrinkage cracks in concrete. Preliminary results at the second stage testing on drying shrinkage using 10% GTR concrete indicated a reduction in free shrinkage when compared to the control specimens.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Since the early 1980's, there have been significant institutional efforts to support student success in the first year of college, most notably in the form of the contemporary first-year seminar (Greenfield, Keup &amp; Gardner, 2013). Colleges and universities have also devoted significant resources and engaged in other innovative efforts to improve the first year of college such as establishment of learning communities (Levine-Laufgraben, 2005) and creation of themed clusters of courses (Tinto &amp; Goodsell, 1993). While there is a significant body of research on the first-year experience, single program studies dominate the literature on student success in the first year of college (e.g., Lenning &amp; Ebbers, 1999; Stassen, 2003, Padgett &amp; Keup, 2011; Porter &amp; Swing, 2006) and the vast majority of studies focus mainly on empirical measures of student success as outcome variables, such as retention rates, grade point averages (GPAs), and graduation rates (Pascarella &amp; Terenzini, 1991, 2005; Purdie, 2007; Sadler, Cohen, &amp; Kockesen, 1997; Sidle &amp; McReynolds, 1999; Somers, 1995; Tinto &amp; Goodsell, 1993).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Consequently, the purpose of this study is to compare the impact of participation in a first-year experience (FYE) course, a living-learning community (LLC) or a freshman interest group (FIG) on both the levels of student engagement and the academic success of first-year students at Florida State University. This study followed the traditional model of causal-comparative research and used both multiple regression and logistic regression analysis. Student engagement was measured based on the NSSE Benchmarks of Effective Educational Practices that include: 1) academic challenge, 2) active and collaborative learning, 3) student-faculty interactions, 4) enriching educational experiences, and 5) supportive campus environment.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The study found that participation in FYE did not have a statistically significant impact on any of the five measures of student engagement that define the benchmarks of effective educational practices. However, after controlling for all other variables, participation in a LLC had a statistically significant positive impact on three of the five measures including active and collaborative learning, student-faculty interactions, and enriching educational experiences. Participation in a FIG, after controlling for all other variables, had a significant positive impact on one of the five benchmarks of effective educational practice, participation in enriching educational experiences.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Research question two focused on academic success metrics such as first-year grade point average, credits earned in the first year of college and retention of students to a second year of study. Multiple regression analysis indicated that participation in FYE, LLC or FIG, had no statistically significant contribution to first-year grade point average. Multiple regression analysis indicated that while participation in an LLC or FIG did had no statistically significant contribution to credits earned in the first year of college, participation in a first-year experience seminar had a statistically significant negative contribution. Lastly, while the logistic regression model for retention had statistically significant predictive capacity, the analysis demonstrated no change in odds of being retained if students participated in FYE, LLC or FIG.  The results of these findings supported the literature that demonstrates the positive influence of participation in living-learning communities but called into question the effectiveness of the first-year seminar at the study site.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>One year of first-grade Good Behavior Game Plus (GBGP) intervention has been linked to long-term academic outcomes including higher test scores and greater likelihood of high school graduation (Bradshaw, Zmuda, Kellam, &amp; Ialongo, 2009).  This study investigated potential mechanisms through which these benefits were produced, specifically examining proximal and distal mediators, including academic skills, social relations, and self-perceived academic competence.  To better understand how the GBGP intervention affects boys versus girls, this study examined sex as a moderator of GBGP outcomes.   This study further investigated if the proposed mediators account for sex differences in GBGP outcomes (i.e. mediated moderation) and if the mediators of GBGP outcomes differ depending on students' sex (i.e. moderated mediation).  Results revealed that seventh-grade academic skills were significant mediators of twelfth-grade academic outcomes; however, no proximal mediators of seventh-grade academic benefits were uncovered.  Sex differences were detected in first- and seventh-grade reading performance, and first-grade reading significantly mediated the sex differences in seventh-grade (i.e. mediated moderation).  Furthermore, seventh-grade reading scores mediated twelfth-grade reading for boys but not for girls, indicating moderated mediation.  Overall, these results support previous research showing that prior academic skills are most predictive of later academic performance (e.g. Duncan et al., 2007).  It is important to note that without uncovering proximal mediators of GBGP effects, there remains a missing link in the chain of mediation.  Additional research is needed to determine the initial mechanisms through which the GBGP intervention leads to its academic benefits.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to: (1) investigate the perceptions and differences between the effective skills and behaviors music education professors taught in their classes, and (2) determine what effective skills and behaviors their students learned. Participants were undergraduate music education majors (N = 125), and their respective professors (N = 13), enrolled in music education methods courses, which included Choral Methods, Elementary General Music Methods, Secondary General Music Methods, and Instrumental Methods during the Spring 2014 semester. All participants were presented a survey listing 40 effective teaching behaviors, music skills, and personal skills/behaviors, outlined by Teachout (1997). Methods course professors and their students were asked to rate, using a three-point Likert-type scale, which skills and behaviors had been taught and which skills and behaviors had been learned and improved upon during the specific methods course.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Overall, the results of this study indicated that general methods course professors rated Teaching Behaviors and Personal Skills/Behaviors higher than ensemble methods course professors. Conversely, ensemble methods course professors rated Music Skills higher than general methods course professors. In addition, for each of the three categories, Teaching Behaviors, Music Skills, and Personal Skills/Behaviors, methods course professors and their students did not agree upon the skills and behaviors that were taught, nor did they agree upon the skills and behaviors that were learned and improved. Implications for these results include the suggestion for methods course professors to specifically address the skills and behaviors they perceive are important for their students to learn.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The poems in this series seek to relocate Valmiki's Hindu epic The Ramayana to a contemporary, American voice. The confessional tone and the focus on Sita as a primary character seeks to marry the speaker to the epic, to personalize and universalize the transcendent, ages-old story. In a simultaneously productive and destructive vein, reinventing Sita becomes imperative for the primary speaker. She written into her scenery as well as psychology, wondering what has been learned in the years since Sita was swallowed up by the earth and instead of Indra's bow, our speaker is manhandling a hand-me-down acoustic guitar. The dreams here are palpable: how does one grow out of the earth, into a mountain, along the lip of a heaven-hell, and then return to the earth? What are the metaphorical implications for a new generation of American female poets, for Sita, and for our speaker? These poems seek to explore these questions, but not fully resolve them.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The aim of this dissertation is to respond to a collection of conceptual and scientific threats to compatibilist accounts of free will, particularly reasons-responsive views. Compatibilists hold that free will is compatible with the truth of determinism.  Some compatibilists also claim that some actual agent at least sometimes acts freely, where it is true that she acts freely in virtue of her satisfying a specific set of control and epistemic conditions. These conditions often include the possession of certain capacities, such as the capacity to recognize reasons for acting and to act on the basis of those reasons. First, I address two pressing philosophical objections to the adequacy of compatibilist accounts of free will: Are reasons-responsive accounts of free will too permissive in their class of free agents? Must reasons-responsive theorists - and compatibilists more generally - concede that some agents who are manipulated or intentionally designed by others are none the less acting freely and morally responsible for their actions? I then survey a widely proposed scientific threat to compatibilist accounts of free will - and to any account of free will that requires the same basic capacities as compatibilists do: Even if the compatibilist account accurately captures the basic capacities that an agent requires to act freely, does neuroscientific work on practical decision-making and action production limit - or worse, speak against -- our actual exercise of free will, as compatibilists conceive of it? I argue that the compatibilist need not yield to these philosophical challenges to the adequacy of their accounts of free will and to their claim that some actual agents act freely, sketching plausible compatibilist-friendly reasons to doubt the potency of each challenge. Finally, I argue that the extant incompatibilist accounts of free will suffer from a previously undiagnosed, serious problem: that there is an irreconcilable tension between the way in which philosophers motivate the incompatibilist ability to do otherwise and the way in which they formally express it. I conclude by offering a diagnosis for the future of the free will debate given the arguments advanced.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In recent decades, rapid globalization has led to an upsurge of interest in global health initiatives. Mental health in particular has received increased focused, as research demonstrates that nearly 14% of the global burden of disease can be attributed to psychological disorders (Macfarlane, Jacobs &amp; Kaaya, 2008). Art therapists are among the increasing number of healthcare professionals traveling to address these needs. However, despite the growing presence of U.S.-trained therapists visiting other countries, clear ethical guidelines for working in these settings are lacking. This absence of parameters creates an ethical dilemma for the field of art therapy: those who lack the skills and resources to provide culturally appropriate treatment in a global context risk negatively affecting the well-being of the populations they serve. The purpose of this study was to develop an initial set of ethical guidelines to inform the practice of art therapists that work and volunteer in economically-challenged countries and regions (ECCs). Art therapists who work abroad and publish on cross-cultural issues were interviewed to develop insight into the experiences of art therapists working in these settings. A survey was then developed and distributed via social media in order to assess the considerations that art therapists should make to offer ethically and culturally appropriate interventions to ECC populations. Thematic analysis and descriptive statistics were utilized to uncover important themes in data, and to create a list of 20 guidelines to inform the work of art therapists in ECC settings.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation investigates transfer and markedness in bilingual and L2 Spanish stop-rhotic sequences (e.g., the `br' in brisa `breeze'). It also examines the phonetics-phonology interface in Spanish. To this end, it explores the production of these sequences in two different experiments. Experiment 1 compares the production of these sequences by 6 Spanish monolinguals and 6 Spanish-Basque bilinguals. Experiment 2 does so for 25 L2 learners and 5 native Spanish speakers. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Acoustic analysis of these sequences revealed that Spanish-Basque bilinguals produced trills 5% of the time whereas Spanish monolinguals did not have any trills. Additionally, fricative rhotics and coarticulation accounted for 35% of L2 realizations, but were not present in the native Spanish speaker dataset. These findings indicate a role for transfer in both bilingual and L2 phonological acquisition, although it is more prevalent in the L2 learner dataset. This is in line with the Speech Learning Model (Flege, 1995), which posits a stronger role for transfer amongst late learners (i.e., L2 learners) than early learners (i.e., Spanish-Basque bilinguals). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In order to examine the role of markedness in bilingual and L2 phonological acquisition, this dissertation investigates the role of sonority in bilingual and L2 Spanish syllable structure. To do so, it proposes a sonority hierarchy for rhotic variants based on their specifications for voicing, intensity and continuancy. According to this hierarchy, approximant rhotics are the most sonorous, followed by taps, trills and fricative rhotics. Therefore, approximant rhotics were expected to be the most common realization followed by taps, trills and fricative rhotics. Although Spanish monolinguals adhered to this expectation, the other groups did not; taps were the most common realization for Spanish-Basque bilinguals, L2 learners, and native Spanish speakers and fricative rhotics were more common than trills for Spanish-Basque bilinguals and L2 learners. These results suggest an interaction between transfer and markedness, consistent with Major (2001). They also reflect dialectal differences in native Spanish speakers.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Finally, this dissertation explores the phonetic-phonology interface in Spanish in two ways. First, it investigates the function of svarabhakti vowels, vocalic elements of variable duration that emerge between consonants, in Spanish stop-rhotic sequences. For the most part, the findings support a dissimilatory role for svarabhakti vowels in this context (see also Colantoni &amp; Steele, 2005). Second, in order to examine the impact of gestural timing in Spanish stop-rhotic realization, it considers the role of the sounds surrounding the rhotic (see also Bradley &amp; Schmeiser, 2003). The results can be explained in terms of different degrees of gestural overlap for all groups except L2 learners, which may be due to a strong role of transfer.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>An increasing number of applications require the use of high temperature superconductors (HTS) such as (RE=Rare Earth) Ba&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7-x&lt;/sub&gt; (REBCO) coated conductors [1]. HTS conductors show particularly great potential for high field magnets applications[1] due to their high upper critical fields[2], But several groups have shown that REBCO coated conductors are prone to delamination failure[3][4][5]. Under relatively low transverse stress the HTS film separates from the substrate and the conductor degrades [6]. This is problematic due to high transverse stresses that occur in fully epoxy impregnated solenoids wound with this conductor. Application of thin walled heat shrink tubing introduces a weak plane around the conductor, preventing delamination degradation [7]. However, manual application of the shrink tubing is impractical, requiring three operators limited to insulating 100 m lengths or less of REBCO conductor.  The high risk of damage to the conductor, also associated with this process, shows the need for a mechanized process. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Strict guidelines for the capabilities of the mechanized process were set: a single operator must have the capability to insulate continuous 200 m lengths of REBCO conductor with a minimum insulation rate of 50 m per work day.  This thesis presents the ideation, prototyping, and construction of such a mechanized insulation process.  Results of prototyping yielded an insulation rate of 100 m per work day with two operators, and the capacity to insulate 130 m of REBCO conductor [8].  Local critical current test indicated that no damage is caused to the tape from the insulation process [9].  A final mechanized Shrink Tube Insulation Apparatus (STIA) was developed, increasing the conductor length capacity to 450 m and reducing the number of operators to one.  Due to unforeseen motor and tape tension issues, modifications to STIA were required, which increased the number of operators to two.  Through a collaborative effort between the Applied Superconductivity Center (ASC) and the Kyushu University in Japan, a continuous 200 m length of Fujikora produced REBCO conductor was provided, to be insulated by STIA.  An insulation rate of 100 m per work day was achieved with two operators.  In the latter of the paper, current work to rectify the issues causing the need for two operators is presented.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Prior empirical research has shown that a large proportion of a city's total crime arises from a relatively small number of locations within its jurisdiction.  Drawing from results of research on the distribution of crime in a handful of cities, scholars have suggested that this dramatic "concentration" of crime is likely to be comparable in cities across the U.S.  Although evidence from existing research is compelling, there are theoretical reasons to believe that the concentration of crime may not be as invariant as suggested in the past.  Additionally, the traditional measures of concentration utilized in prior research fail to account for how tightly clustered these high-crime places are within space, leading to a relatively ambiguous definition of the term concentration.  Finally, there are theoretical reasons to believe that accounting for the concentration of crime may add to our knowledge on the factors which contribute to the between-city difference in crime.  To date, this possibility has not been explored in prior research. Thus, our knowledge of the concentration of criminal activity and its consequences remains relatively limited.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To expand our knowledge on the concentration of crime, this dissertation addresses two primary research questions: (1) Does the concentration of crime vary across cities?, (2) Does variation in the concentration of crime have a significant impact on between-city differences in crime?  These questions are answered by first exploring the variation revealed from two measures that reflect slightly different dimensions of concentration (i.e. evenness and clustering), disaggregated by crime-type, for a relatively large sample of American cities.  Subsequently, the study assesses the effects of these measures on between-city difference in city crime rates.  Tract-level crime data drawn from the National Neighborhood Crime Survey, a multicity database on crime in 91 cities from across the country, provided the information from which the measures of concentration and clustering were created.  In combination with city-level data on socioeconomic and demographic characteristics drawn from a number of sources, the impact of crime's concentration on city crime rates was then examined in an empirical context.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Results indicate that the concentration of crime is not as invariant as suggested in prior research.  Additionally, multivariate analyses indicate that greater concentration of homicide is associated with lower homicide rates.  Similar findings are observed for robbery, though in this instance conclusions are sensitive to model specification and sample composition.  No significant link is found between concentration and crime rates for assault and burglary.  The implications of the results of this dissertation for theory and research on the concentration of crime and aggregate crime rates are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Smart materials are materials that exhibit field-coupled material behavior in response to external stimuli. One example is photomechanical materials that are able convert light energy into mechanical work. Light is a unique form of energy for adaptive structures. Light allows for time, wavelength, intensity, and polarization control. A material that can convert light to work would ideally take advantage of these characteristics. Azobenzene is a functional group that changes its molecular shape when exposed to certain wavelengths of light. This molecular shape change can cause an overall macroscopic shape change when the azobenzene is synthesized with a polymer network (azo-LCN). In this thesis, blocked stress measurements show that irradiated azo-LCN experience photochemical and thermomechanical stress. Total stress is dictated by thermomechnical stress at higher light intensities. Photomechanical stress a larger portion of total stress at lower light intensities. The thermomechanical stress occurs on the order of tenths of a second, whereas photomechanical stress is on the order of minutes to hours. A stronger understanding of the distinctions of photochemistry and heat is determined using solid state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance(NMR). NMR measurements show that heat alone does not cause a conformational change, but light irradiation causes a molecular structure change that is most likely associated with {\it{ trans-cis}} isomerization. Isolating photochemical and thermal effects is an important step in functionalizng azo-LCN. The data in this work shows that decoupling may be possible by controlling time and intensity of the reactions.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Digital libraries must support the existing and emergent communities they serve, lest social opportunities to seek, use, and share information and knowledge become diminished compared to physical libraries. Despite many calls for a social view of digital libraries and the rise of social informatics and sociotechnical systems research, there is continuing need to examine how digital libraries support communities and facilitate collaboration. This research improves our understanding of the organizational, cultural, collaborative, and social contexts of digital libraries, conceptualizing social digital libraries to include content, services, and organizations, with a focus on facilitating information and knowledge sharing. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A sequential mixed-methods design, drawing from the tenets of social informatics and social constructionism, explores and describes two cases of social digital libraries, LibraryThing and Goodreads, under a theoretical framework focusing on Star's boundary object theory and incorporating Strauss's social worlds perspective and Burnett and Jaeger's theory of information worlds. This framework conceives of social digital libraries adapting to the local needs of many communities, reconciling and translating meanings across them; supporting coherent norms, types, values, behaviors, and organizations; serving as sites and technologies for information behavior and activities; and supporting convergence of broader communities around their use.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Content analysis of messages in five LibraryThing and four Goodreads groups, a structured survey of users, and semi-structured qualitative interviews with users identifies three roles LibraryThing and Goodreads play, as boundary objects, in facilitating and supporting translation, coherence, and convergence: (a) establishing community and organizational structure; (b) facilitating users' sharing of information values; and (c) building and maintaining social ties, networks, and community culture. Potential implications for digital library design and practice include highlighting translation processes and resources; providing user profiles and off-topic spaces and encouraging their use; taking a sociotechnical approach that tailors technology and community features to the right audiences; and facilitating the establishment of shared structure, values, and ties and boundary spanning activities. Further research on social digital libraries and in social informatics and information behavior should examine deeper facets of these roles, other digital libraries with less overt social features, and other ICTs in light of the processes of coherence and convergence, taking a boundary-sensitive view of information phenomena in community and collaborative contexts.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This study sought to investigate the relationship between SCT and ADHD in a two groups of college students. One group consisted of 121 participants who were clinically diagnosed with ADHD.  The other group was a non-diagnosed control group which consisted of 102 participants who were recruited from general university classrooms. Students diagnosed with ADHD endorsed a significantly higher number of SCT symptoms compared to the control group. Additionally, within the group diagnosed with ADHD, the strongest significant relationship was between symptoms of SCT and symptoms of inattention.  The relationship between SCT and symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsivity was non-significant. There were no significant gender differences in SCT symptoms in either group. The number of SCT symptoms needed to be at or above the 95th percentile in the group diagnosed with ADHD was nine and in the control group it was five symptoms. Informant differences were investigated in the group diagnosed with ADHD and the results indicated that the self-reported score for symptoms of SCT was significantly higher than those reported by an informant rater. SCT was significantly related to symptoms of anxiety and depression. The strongest relationship was between SCT and depression. The relationship between SCT and two timed measures of cognitive functioning was investigated. The results indicated that SCT was not significantly related to a measure of reading fluency or visual matching. This is the first known study to date to have explored the relationship between ADHD and SCT in college students. Recommendations for future research are made.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The exploration and understanding of new states of matter resulting from reduced dimensionality and electron correlations has been at the forefront of condensed matter physics research for decades. The goal of this dissertation is to study the magnetotransport properties of several electronic materials including strongly correlated electronic systems (EuB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and manganites), 2D and 1D disordered superconductors, and magnetically-doped topological insulators. The central aim of the research is the study of emergent phases, phase competition, and phase transitions due to disorder, magnetic and electronic interactions, and dimensional confinement in these materials. The activities are of fundamental interest in the basic physics of magnetism, superconductivity, magnetoelectronic and spin-dependent transport, and they may produce new insights on several pertinent and longstanding open questions in condensed matter physics. The results may also have practical implications for potential applications in spintronics and superconducting micro- or nano-electronics devices. In the past few years, the surface states of topological insulators have attracted intense interest. The unique properties of the surface states provide a fertile ground to explore emergent phenomenon, such as Majorana fermion-like excitations and quantum anomalous Hall effect. They are also considered attractive candidates for spintronic devices with pure spin current that can be controlled by electric field. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para> Hall effect and magnetoresistance measurements were performed on single crystals of the semimetallic ferromagnet EuB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and thin films of anisotropically strained ferromagnetic perovskite La&lt;sub&gt;0.67&lt;/sub&gt;Ca&lt;sub&gt;0.33&lt;/sub&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (LCMO). Unusual nonlinear features in the Hall resistivity are observed in both materials. Specifically, in the paramagnetic phase at any given temperature, the Hall resistivity in both materials is found to exhibit two linear regions with a distinct change in its slope at a well-defined magnetic field. The nonlinear Hall effect does not stem from the conventional anomalous Hall effect. Rather, the switching field increases with increasing temperature but they always correspond to the same magnetization. It is inferred that both EuB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and LCMO undergo a magnetic field driven percolative phase transition. Thereby, the switching of Hall resistivity at a constant critical magnetization is interpreted as a signature of the percolative phase transition and electronic phase separation in the paramagnetic phase. Moreover, in the strained LCMO thin films, a peak in the (negative) magnitude of Hall resistivity is observed near the magnetic phase transition. The appearance of the peak is correlated with the emergence of the antiferromagnetic insulating ground state induced by the anisotropic strain. An analogy is made to the giant Hall effect observed in composition driven percolative granular metal films. The peak in the Hall resistivity of LCMO is thus identified as a result of the enhancement of the Hall coefficient near the percolation point, which is a manifestation of magnetic field driven percolative phase transition in an insulating electronic background.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para> Magnetotransport measurements on low dimensional superconductors and topological insulators were carried out in a customized dilution refrigerator which hosts an assortment of &lt;i&gt;in&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;situ&lt;/i&gt; capabilities, including film growth, sample rotation, electrical measurements, and magnetic impurity deposition. Those&lt;i&gt;in&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;situ&lt;/i&gt; capabilities enabled a systematic study of the superconductor-insulator transitions in low dimensional superconducting systems, and led to the discovery of giant enhancement of superconductivity by a parallel magnetic field in ultrathin Pb films. The enhancement effect has a clear thickness and magnetic impurity dependence. The mean field H&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; of the amorphous Pb films can be enhanced by more than 13% over the zero field value. A similar but weaker effect is also observed in the LaAlO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; heteroepitaxial interfacial superconductor. We found the enhancement effect depends on the strength of the spin-orbit coupling of the material: the stronger the spin-orbit coupling, the larger the enhancement effect. There is currently no theoretical model that would account for all aspects of the observed enhancement effect. In this dissertation, several theoretical scenarios will be discussed and compared with the experimental results, and the constraints on a viable theoretical model imposed by our experiments will be described.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The incremental &lt;i&gt;in&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;situ&lt;/i&gt; magnetic impurity deposition was employed for a systematic examination of the evolution of the spin-helical surface states of a 3D topological insulator in the presence of increasing spin-flip scattering. Hall effect and magnetoresistance measurements were conducted on Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and (Bi&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in the presence of electrostatic gating and magnetic impurity. We will focus on (Bi&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, since its Fermi level lies within the bulk band gap without the application of a gate voltage. Ambipolar field effect is observed on (Bi&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; implying effective tuning of the Fermi level and identification of the surface transport in the topological transport regime. Cr atoms were quench-condensed onto the sample surface. Our results show the Cr effectively yields electron doping and reduces the gating efficiency. The weak antilocalization (WAL) effect is found to be surprisingly robust against the magnetic impurity; the cusp-like negative magnetoconductivity remains even at the highest Cr concentration and no apparent weak localization was observed as expected from the theoretically predicted gap opening at the Dirac point. Our analyses reveal an unusual loss of the electron density due to the Cr deposition, which possibly results from the local gap opening by the random magnetic moments. Possible mechanism of gap opening at the Dirac point and the transport manifestations will be discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation is centered on indexing, searching, and mining methods for large-scale and high-dimensional visual data. While the processing to such data has been widely acknowledged to be difficult, the problem becomes more serious when we encounter "big data'', which has shifted the focus of many problems in computational science. There are urgent requirements of new approaches to processing the huge collections of visual information, e.g., images/videos on the Internet.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The study first investigates difficulties of similarity search in high-dimensional spaces, and presents a new model of local intrinsic dimensionality that better fits to similarity search problems, e.g., the nearest neighbor search. Then it turns the focus to discussions of the advantages and the problems when various structured vector quantization applying to the large-scale visual data processing. While many structured vector quantization models can be found, this study is focused to three families of them, including product quantization (PQ), residual quantization (RQ), and tree-structured vector quantization (TSVQ). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The main contributions of this work can be seen in following pipelines: 1) Two novel methods have been proposed to tackle a problem that exists in RQ for decades, and they have been used to improve residual k-means trees for scalable clustering, and to optimize two most advanced ANN search systems; 2) a new inverted index has been proposed for fast approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search; 3) a systematic framework has been proposed for repetition mining in long video streams; 4) a tree embedding PQ model has been proposed to improve PQ codes quality for ANN search. The experimental results have shown the proposed methods are substantially better than the existing solutions in terms of trade-off among speeds, memory usage, and accuracy.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>ABSTRACT</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>My dissertation explores the complicated role of "illegitimacy" in shaping the thoughts of three contemporary Chinese diasporic writers (Hong Ying, Ha Jin, and Ma Jian) and two diasporic intellectuals (Rey Chow and Shih Shu-mei). Similar to an illegitimate person who can hardly become a full member of a family or community, a diasporan can never quite belong to a host society. I thus use illegitimacy to highlight a keen sense of crisis of the diasporic subject who feels that his/her sociopolitical existence and its articulation are challenged as being inauthentic and ungrounded due to his/her displacement from the native land. Despite their different backgrounds and outlooks, the several writers in my study have shared the same experience of struggling with the anxiety that I term illegitimacy, whether literally, figuratively, or a combination of both, which is reflected in, as well as informs, their literary and critical works. However, they all strive to resolve the issue of illegitimacy through the act of writing. They raise new questions, change perspectives, challenge conventional moralities as their literary and philosophical visions evolve. The issue of illegitimacy, as a driving force, motivates as well as restrains these writers in constructing their literary and academic careers.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Polyethylenes with halogen substitution at a precise distance along the methylene backbone are unique models to study the effect of nano-structured chain-defects on folding and crystallization of polymers. Prior work has shown that the halogen is accommodated in the crystal disrupting the unit cell symmetry and crystallization proportionally to the halogen's size. Packing of the Chlorine units in the crystallites of polyethylene with Chlorine substitution on every 15th backbone carbon was found to undergo a transition which is kinetically controlled within one degree of undercooling. On crystallization from the melt at temperatures &lt; 53 °C the chains pack in an all-trans planar conformation (Form I) with layered crystalline chlorines that present some longitudinal disorder as demonstrated by FTIR. The crystals formed at higher temperatures pack in a non-planar herringbone-like structure (Form II) with a TGGT....TG'G'T backbone conformation around the substitution, while conserving the trans packing of the methylene sequence. The analysis of the FTIR spectra for the rocking-twisting progression in a broad range of crystallization temperatures is extended here to a series of polyethylenes with Cl substitution every 9th, 19th and 21st carbons. The FTIR dispersion curves are analyzed in reference to the behavior of n-alkanes with length equivalent to the length of methylene sequence between Chlorines. The unique polymorphic transition found in the system with Chlorines between 15 carbons, is also found in all members of the series, making the planar and non-planar packing with respect to undercooling a general feature of crystallization of polyethylenes with Chlorine substitution. The polymorphic transition temperatures and temperature range of coexistence of both forms are analyzed as a function of increasing Chlorine in the series.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Wireless networks have been widely adopted in homes, offices and public hot spots. Two problems with wireless networks are the limited range and unavoidable packet loss. Much effort has been investigated in these problems, such as packet relaying based on node cooperation and diagnosing the cause of a packet loss; these existing solutions require modifications either to both the packet transmitter and receiver or to the physical layer. We revisit the problems and propose ubiquitously compatible solutions in medium access control layer - L2Relay and Locora. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>L2Relay is a layer 2 packet relay protocol that can improve the performance and extend the range of the network. A L2Relay device overhears the packet transmissions and may retransmit a packet on behalf of the access point or the node if no ACK is overheard and if it is in a better position to retransmit the packet than the original sender. L2Relay exploits many layer 2 functionalities such as carrier sense. L2Relay encompasses unique solutions to link quality measurement, rate adaptation, relayer selection, while maintaining low overhead. One important feature of L2Relay is its ubiquitous compatibility, i.e., it is compatible with any Wi-Fi devices, such that one or multiple relayers can be installed in any network easily without any modifications to the AP or nodes.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Locora, which stands for Loss Cause Oracle, is a system that can help a Wi-Fi device achieve higher performance by diagnosing the actual cause of the packet loss and taking correct response upon packet loss with only local information observable by the packet sender. Locora uses novel methods to estimate the collision level, the channel change, and the hidden terminal activities, such that it can react to packet loss with suitable responses to improve the efficiency. One notable feature of Locora is its single-point upgradability. By making the decisions with only local observation, Locora enables the users to enjoy the performance gain by modifying only one end of the wireless link, i.e., upgrading only one device, which makes the deployment much simpler.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>L2Relay and Locora are solutions of low complexity that are implementable in firmware level. We implemented both solutions in the OpenFWWF platform. Our experiments show that L2Relay and Locora can lead to higher performance.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation develops a nonstandard approach to probability, stochastic calculus and financial modeling, within the framework of the Radically Elementary Probability Theory of Edward Nelson. The fundamental objects of investigation are stochastic sums with respect to a martingale, defined on a finite probability space and indexed by a finite set. We study the external (nonstandard) properties of these sums, such as almost sure continuity of trajectories, the L&lt;super&gt;p&lt;/super&gt; property, and the Lindeberg condition; we also study external properties of related processes, such as quadratic variation and proper time. Using the tools so developed, we obtain an Itô-Doeblin formula for change of variable and a Girsanov theorem for change of measure in a quite general setting. We also obtain results that will aid us in the comparison of certain of the processes we investigate to conventional ones. We illustrate the theory by using general techniques to build stock models driven by Wiener walks, Poisson walks and their combinations, and show in each case that when our parameter processes are constant we recover the prices for European calls of the corresponding models that use conventional stochastic calculus. Finally, we exhibit a model driven by a nonstandard Wiener process that produces different prices for European calls than are given by the conventional Black-Scholes model.</DISS_para>
