   <abstract >The issue of low community college retention and completion rates has become an important concern in recent years. The lack of persistence among college students has led to a variety of institutional initiatives including first-year experience courses, intrusive advising, and other innovative approaches. Among these approaches, First-Year Experience (FYE) courses are consistently supported as a promising retention strategy. To that end, the purpose of this mixed-method study was to investigate the motivation and first-year experience of students who participated in a Grit and Growth Mindset themed FYE course and persisted beyond the first year. Survey data were collected from 122 students and focus group interviews were conducted with 10 students at a large community college in southeast Florida. The survey data analyses using Independent Samples T-test, ANOVA, and Correlation showed that female students and older students reported a higher level of motivation than male and younger students, but there was no statistically significant difference in their motivation level by race/ethnicity. The focus group interviews revealed that students found three aspects of the FYE course influential to their motivation: (1) short-term and long-term goal setting, (2) self-reflection, and (3) support and resources. They also reported that time management strategies and supports from professors, peers, and family helped them overcome their challenges associated with balancing jobs and coursework, as well as anxiety and nervousness about their ability to complete college. An important implication of this study is for community colleges to continue emphasizing FYE courses to ensure that incoming students feel confident about their ability to achieve success during the first year and persist by overcoming obstacles. In addition, colleges should continue to equip students with practical tools and resources, such as time-management and the SMART goal framework, that support their competence and autonomy in charting their path to success.</abstract>
