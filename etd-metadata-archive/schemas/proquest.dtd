  *Publishing option:
    0 - Traditional
    1 - Open Access
  *Embargo code can be (this is the ProQuest embargo, not the IR embargo):
    0 - no embargo
    1 - 6 month embargo
    2 - 1 year embargo
    3 - 2 year embargo
    4 - flexible delayed release
      Note: if embargo code = 4
        sales_restriction 1 (in the DISS_restriction element) should be
        populated. The corresponding "remove" attribute of the
        sales_restriction element should have the delayed release date chosen
        by the author/administrator. In case the author chooses to never
        release his/her work the corresponding "remove" date on the
        restriction should be null.
      Examples:
        embargo_code = 4,
        Diss_sales_restriction = 1,
        remove = 01/01/2010 (delayed release until 01/01/2010)

        embargo_code = 4,
        Diss_sales_restriction = 1,
        remove = null (never to be released)

        Diss_sales_restriction need not be populated for embargo options
        1, 2 and 3 since the release date is implied.

  *third_party_search
    Y - submission can be indexed by search engines other than ProQuest
    N - submission can NOT be indexed by search engines other than ProQuest
  *third_party_sales
    Y - submission can be sold by entities other than ProQuest
    N - submission can NOT be sold by entities other than ProQuest
  *free_publishing_flag - Now is always "Y"
    Y - there is no fee for publishing in ProQuest
    N - There is a fee for publishing in ProQuest
