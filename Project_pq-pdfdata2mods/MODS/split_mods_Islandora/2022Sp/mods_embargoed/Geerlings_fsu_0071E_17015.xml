   <abstract>This dissertation focuses on the sounded activities and public protest rituals of political witchcrafting in the United States from 1848 through 2021. I define political witchcrafting as a practice that combines political activism with witchcraft-related practices, such as spirit communication, trancing, casting spells, and performing rituals, to create real-world social and political transformation. To craft this history of sounded political witchcrafting, I focus on three case studies: Spiritualism and the mediumship of Cora L. V. Richmond from 1848–1870, public protest rituals performed by Starhawk and the Reclaiming Collective between 1980–2002, and the political hexing rituals of Catland Books, a spiritual bookstore in Brooklyn, NY (2016–2021). The subjects of these studies are connected by their desire to improve the status of marginalized communities, their use of public political witchcrafting, and their belief in the importance of sounded practices in their public performances or rituals. One of the goals of this dissertation is to show that witchcraft has long had a presence in American society, even when it is not as evident in mainstream media or social trends, and that it has historically been a tool of political resistance and social change. It is imperative that researchers listen to and record these histories, especially now, at a time when the rights of women, particularly those of intersecting marginalized identities, are moving to the forefront of feminist and anti-patriarchal political activism. As a musicologist, I seek to render these sounded protest methods of political witchcrafting, including trance speaking, hexing, and spellcasting, as audible and important within the history of American political resistance. Singing, chanting, dancing, trancing, and spirit communication are important sounded practices within my three case studies and in political witchcrafting more broadly. For example, the Spiritualists often used singing or light conversation to enter a trance state, which allowed the medium to channel the spirits. These spirits spoke through sharp knocking sounds or the vocal cords of the medium to offer insights into the spiritual realm and discuss the importance of equality among all people. The members of Reclaiming used singing, dancing, and chanting at their public protest rituals to fight for the protection of the Earth and all of its inhabitants. The participants who performed hexes at Catland Books used chanting and screaming to heal from personal traumas and challenge the political careers of men such as former president Donald Trump and Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. These sounded practices were important ways to share their political commentary, create community and solidarity among participants, and perform political witchcrafting activities and rituals that advocated for political and social change.</abstract>
