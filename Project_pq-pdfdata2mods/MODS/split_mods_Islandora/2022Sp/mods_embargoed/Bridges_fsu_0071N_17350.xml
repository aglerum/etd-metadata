   <abstract xmlns="">Alcoholic myopathy is a wasting condition that effects skeletal muscle mass. One factor that may contribute to alcoholic myopathy is anabolic resistance which is induced by alcohol intake and leads to a suppression of protein synthesis following an anabolic stimulus. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of glycine in a model of acute alcohol consumption and its ability to alter the anabolic resistant state induced by alcohol. The purpose of aim 1 was to establish whether refeeding significantly altered protein synthesis and components of the mTORC1 pathway when alcohol and or glycine was consumed It was hypothesized that there would be a refeeding affect and the treatment groups with EtOH present in the diet would not show increased signaling in protein synthesis or components of the mTORC1 pathway. To accomplish this, female mice were split into five treatment groups including Control-Fasted, Control-Refed, EtOH-Refed, Control-Refed+Glycine, and EtOH+Refed+Glycine. The Refed groups were fasted for 16 hours during the light cycle and provided food after the fast for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes of refeeding, food was removed and tissue collection of the Gastrocnemius occurred 30 minutes after the removal of food. Proteins and mRNA of the gastrocnemius were analyzed using Western blotting and RT-PCR techniques. A refeeding affect was found for mTORC1 substrates rpS6 S240/244 and Akt T308 in the Control-Refed group compared to the Control-Fasted group. The second aim of the study was to determine whether glycine would be able to prevent EtOH induced anabolic resistance. We hypothesized that glycine would diminish the effects of EtOH and restore levels of protein synthesis and mTOR1 signaling associated with refeeding that are reduced by alcohol. The same treatment groups were used as Aim 1 excluding the Control-Fasted group. Puromycin used to express protein synthesis, 4E-BP1 S65, and Akt T308 were reduced in the EtOH-glycine-refed group compared to the Control-Refed treatment group. A main effect of alcohol for reducing mTOR S2448, S6K1 T389, rpS6 240/244, and ULK1 S757 was also found, while glycine did not offset this effect. Therefore, glycine is an ineffective method of abating the anabolic resistant state induced through the consumption of alcohol.</abstract>
