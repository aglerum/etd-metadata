   <abstract>Purpose: There is a rich history of research investigating victimization and juvenile offending. The purpose of this dissertation is to explore the relationship between childhood victimization and juvenile reoffending in a sample of juvenile justice involved youth. Research has consistently demonstrated that there is a relationship between childhood victimization and delinquent and criminal behavior. Still, most youth who are victimized do not go on to offend. Nevertheless, many youth who have offended also report being victims. Therefore, it is important to understand the mechanisms through which victimization influences offending. Through the framework of Robert Agnew's (1993, 2001) general strain theory, this dissertation assesses whether victimization is one of the strains most likely to lead to delinquent and criminal behavior. Additionally, Agnew (2002) specifies negative emotionality as the mechanisms through which strain leads to offending. This dissertation also assesses the mediating role negative emotionality plays in the strain-crime relationship using a sample of juvenile justice involved youth in Florida from January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2015. Additionally, this research builds upon prior evidence by examining a high-risk population where all of the youth in the sample have offended. By doing so, it is a more nuanced assessment of reoffending with a high-risk sample that is more likely to have experienced victimization along with having a longer delinquent/criminal history. Furthermore, this research makes a significant contribution to prior research on negative emotionality by having a more complete measures that more closely parallels what was originally specified by Agnew (2001). Methods: In order to determine the effects of strain on negative emotionality, OLS regression is utilized while a series of logistic regression models are used to assess the direct effects of strain on juvenile reoffending and the mediating effects of negative emotionality. To further examine the magnitude of which negative emotionality mediates the relationship between childhood victimization and official juvenile reoffending, two techniques—the Karlson-Holm-Breen (KHB) decomposition method and marginal effects—are used. The decomposition method determines the percentage of relationship that is due to the mediator—in this case, negative emotionality. The marginal effects allow for a comparison between youth low and high in negative emotionality and how those levels impact the likelihood of juvenile reoffending. Results: Childhood victimization—exposure to violence, neglect, verbal abuse, and poly-victimization—has a direct effect on juvenile reoffending. When accounting for negative emotionality, the size of the direct effects are reduced indicating that mediation is occurring. The KHB decomposition method indicates the direct effect of victimization and juvenile reoffending is reduced between twenty-six and sixty-one percent when accounting for negative emotionality. Additionally, youth who are high in negative emotionality are between fifty and sixty-two percent more likely to reoffend than youth who are low in negative emotionality. Conclusion: This study finds support for Robert Agnew's (2002) concept of negative emotionality as a mediator between strain and criminal and delinquent behavior. While it does so only partially, the findings of this study imply that interventions targeting negative emotionality (e.g., positive coping mechanisms) can be directed towards youth who experience victimization.</abstract>
