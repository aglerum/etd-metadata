   <abstract>The King of Ketamine is a thesis made up of 41 poems, through which I explore such themes as the prison system, child neglect, alcoholism, body positivity, death, love, and an array of other emotions. There are three sections contained there within. In the first section, titled "The King of Ketamine," we see a complicated family start to come to life, from the introduction of the titular character, the father, to a sibling, to a grandmother and a grandfather. Through all these poems, the reader is presented with an image of the speaker's relationship to his family, as well as his surroundings. This section paints a picture of a dysfunctional, often manic, up-bringing. The second section "Anger Mon, Amour," turns away from the family as a whole, with only the grandfather appearing in select poems, and instead deals with the emotional turmoil created by the relationships explored in the previous section. It presents the reader with anger, fear, hate, and grief. All of these emotions reach their climax within the final three poems of the section. These poems bring to life the grief of losing friends and attempt to leave behind a possible fate escaped by the speaker. "Good Pens and Burnt Pizza," reflects on a coworker sent away to prison, echoing the King of Ketamine's journey in the first section. "We Drank Too Much," presents the reader with the death of a friend, who represents much of the emotional anguish explored in the preceding poems. And finally, "I Smoke a Russian Cigarette," brings to life another coworker named Pavel, whose untimely death resounds with a sentiment that a good death is never promised. These poems serve as a form of closure to the first half of the manuscript, leading into a change within the speaker. In the third section, "If The Wolf Comes Let It Kill Me," the speaker begins to turn away from his past, from the emotional turmoil that weights heavy on the poems that come before, and instead attempts to embrace a change within himself. The titular poem for this section is no better representation of this, bringing in all of the difficulty from this previous life, and instead embracing companionship. In this section readers are greeted not only by a plethora of love poems, but also by many figures from pop culture, from artists like Frida Kahlo, to poets such as Walt Whitman and Tommy Pico, and even Nate 'King Cole' and Otis Redding. The poems within this section look outwards, no longer needing to focus so heavily on personal history or emotional trauma, they show a shift towards an embrace the world around the speaker, completely departing from what has come before.</abstract>
