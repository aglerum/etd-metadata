   <abstract>The utilization of sport psychology (SP) and mental performance consultants (MPCs) is becoming a mainstream resource among collegiate athletic programs. Junior colleges have yet to make this transition due to the many unique challenges they face. The primary gatekeepers of junior college athletic programs are the Athletic Directors (ADs), and as such they use their valuable knowledge, skills, and judgment to make hiring related decisions for their departments. Research to date has been minimal when examining junior college SP use and hiring of MPCs, but the information that is available claims that ADs are not knowledgeable enough about the field to make educated and informed decisions about use and hiring. The aim of this study was to examine how an educational workshop would impact AD's expectancy and value levels for the use of MPCs and SP services. By increasing knowledge of the field, services, and qualifications of MPCs, the hope was to improve perceptions and attitudes while reducing stigma surrounding performance services, which would translate into greater intentions to hire. A total of 713 ADs were emailed (the entire population of junior college ADs) and invited to participate, with 97 completing the pretest, workshop, and posttest. Differences in pretest and posttest expectancy and value scores increased significantly as a result of the workshop. Results from a series of paired t-tests revealed that as a result of the workshop, all four subscales on the Sport Psychology Attitudes Revised-Athletic Directors (SPAR-AD) had significant changes as well as an increase of at least .79 mean points for all of the 10 Knowledge Test questions, resulting in p &lt; .01 for all questions. A McNemar's test was ran to determine if ADs had shifted readiness levels to use services as a result of the workshop and showed marginal improvement, but not enough to be deemed statistically significant. Significant shifts were also seen in the potential barriers ADs would see as problematic in both pretest and posttest as well as the qualifications of MPCs they would deem desirable. Additionally, ANOVA testing among demographic variables revealed that women were nearly two times more likely to hire and seek out MPCs than males, while most other demographic data did not show differentiation in the above scales. Findings from this study have implications for junior college athletic departments, ADs, athletes, teams, coaches, and researchers and MPCs hoping to gain access to this population.</abstract>
