   <abstract>Change is a constant in organizations, especially public institutions. Without change everything remains the same and nothing improves. Organizations that adopt the idea that change is inevitable do far better than those who deny the process (Al-Ali et al., 2017; Davis &amp; Fifolt, 2018). Change should be done with the purpose of improvement and implemented strategically. Ascher (2013) states "organizations must develop better practices and policies aimed at generating a greater organizational continuous learning culture that embodies innovation, creativity, and proper training and its implementation" (p. 39). Gordon and Fischer (2015) also argue strategic planning is an effective tool for an organization's continuous improvement and success. The purpose of this study was to examine the change management practices implemented at a public university to address policy compliance. The research specifically focused on change management practices and the involvement of change leaders and agents within the College of Medicine (COM). Nine COM leaders were interviewed to discuss their implementation of eight change management strategies identified in change management literature. Their responses helped answer the research questions: (1) What change management strategies were implemented at COM to improve policy compliance? (1a) How were the strategies implemented by change agents? (1b) Why were the strategies implemented by change agents? (2) How did the university's monthly compliance report scores change after the implementation of change management strategies? Findings revealed the most frequently implemented change management strategies were communication, leadership, and management to improve policy compliance. Participants discussed how and why they implemented the eight change management strategies. Communication, bringing awareness, setting expectations, monitoring and providing feedback, and providing a sense of ownership and value for stakeholders were frequently implemented within the change management strategies discussed. The review of data from the university's monthly compliance report revealed the desired downward trend for each of the five metrics for the College of Medicine as a whole. Compliance report data by individual departments also showed a similar downward trend. Although the implementation of the change management strategies cannot be directly correlated to the downward trend on the monthly compliance report for COM, the report does show improvement in policy compliance during the time the change management strategies were implemented. It is recommended that when performance improvement efforts are needed within higher education, multiple change management strategies be implemented. Findings from the study support the realization that change management strategies have overlapping elements such as communication, bringing awareness, setting expectations, and providing feedback.</abstract>
