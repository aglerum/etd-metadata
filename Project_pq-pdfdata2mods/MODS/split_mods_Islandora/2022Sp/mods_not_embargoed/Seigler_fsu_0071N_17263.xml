   <abstract>Research about how gender affects speech has until recently strictly involved cisgender men and cisgender women (Kiesling, 2019; Newman et al., 2008; Rosanti &amp; Jaelani, 2015). Because of this, the speech of transgender men and women has gone largely unexplored (Kiesling, 2019, p. 53). This study focuses on mitigating phrases, which are "a means of conveying vagueness purposely" (Rosanti &amp; Jaelani, 2015, p. 31); some examples in English are in my opinion and sort of. Previous studies have shown that cisgender women use mitigating phrases more than cisgender men (Lakoff, 1973; Priesler, 1986) and that socialization is a key factor in the development of speech patterns (Ochs, 1991; Zimman, 2018). This leads to the question of how transgender men's speech patterns develop. In this research, a cisgender man will be defined as someone who was assigned male at birth and continues to identify as a man, and a transgender man is someone who was assigned female at birth but transitioned to identifying as a man socially or medically. I posit that transgender men who transition before the age of 13 will have patterns more similar to those of cisgender men due to socialization as men, and those who transition after the age of 13 will have patterns more similar to those of cisgender women due to socialization as a woman. This study measured the use of mitigating phrases in the Spanish speech of transgender men who transitioned before the age of 13 and after the age of 13 during a sociolinguistic interview. The interview elicited the use of mitigating phrases through questions that ask the participant about their life and experiences as a transgender person, which can be responded to in the form of an opinion (using mitigating phrases), or as a fact (without the use of mitigating phrases). Each mitigating phrase was categorized by internal and external factors, including type of mitigating phrase, if it is epistemic or affective, and age of transition of the speaker. The results revealed that although cisgender men used the most mitigating phrases on average, followed by transitioned before puberty and finally transitioned after puberty, individuals had no clear pattern. There was also not a gender preference for any type of mitigating phrase, rather a general preference for certain structures. Because of this, it is likely that gender is not the central factor in use of mitigating phrases, but rather environment. It is also possible that gender preference for this structure is a phenomenon within American English and does not extend to Spanish speaking communities. This research builds on queer linguistics theories in order to affirm the identities of trans people and finally include them in the body of research of gender and speech.</abstract>
