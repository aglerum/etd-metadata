   <abstract>As a low-impact activity that can cover longer distances than walking, cycling is not only good for older adult's health, but can also be a viable low-cost mode of transportation. Cycling can allow older adults to maintain mobility, which in turn is crucial for their health, wellbeing, and quality of life. In addition, cycling can improve quality of life among older adults through expansion of social networks and increased life-space areas. Research has shown an increase in cycling among the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic, but points to regional heterogeneity. This study builds on previous work by exploring COVID's impact on older cyclists (65+) residing in a small, auto-centric urban area. Further, this study took a first step at exploring older adults' intent to maintain cycling habits post-pandemic. Although the majority of the survey respondents did not report any significant changes to their cycling habits, the findings suggest that in some cases new habits of cycling more often, longer distances, or for new purposes were formed. For others, the pandemic was associated with negative impacts that lead to a reduction in cycling levels or even complete cycling cessation. A survey (n = 198) demonstrated that, on average, cycling frequency decreased and average distance/trip increased among the study sample. This suggests a less pronounced impact among older adults residing in a small urban area, compared to other cohorts. However, interviews (n = 24) showed that cycling during the pandemic was associated with feelings of accomplishment, enjoyment, improved self-esteem, and increased freedom by allowing participants to get out despite social distancing requirements. Further, among respondents reporting increased cycling (n=76), most (79%) plan to maintain cycling habits post-pandemic, citing reasons such as personal health, enjoyment, and the social aspect of cycling. The findings from this study suggests that changing incentives and exposure to new experiences can lead to changed travel behavior among older adults. These findings could thus in turn support efforts promoting cycling among older adults, pointing to aspects for designing voluntary travel behavior change (VTBC) programs. Five (5) main takeaways for successful VTBC programs aimed at encouraging active transportation among older adults are presented including cycling as social opportunities; promoting flexible work hours; targeting "windows of opportunities"; establishing "try it out" cycling programs for older adults; along with the need for continued motivation and repetition.</abstract>
