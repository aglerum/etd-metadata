   <abstract>The purpose of this study was to explore teenagers' use of affinity spaces on social media platforms for self-directed informal learning. This research also examined teenagers' perceptions of the advantages of social media for informal learning and the tensions they encounter while using these platforms for informal learning. This study implemented a naturalistic multiple case study design to explore this phenomenon. Using purposeful sampling, participants were selected after completing a recruitment survey. One of the primary inclusion criteria was that the participants engaged in self-directed informal learning using social media platforms. Nine teenagers between the ages of thirteen and eighteen completed two semi-structured interviews and submitted ten-to-fourteen days of audio diaries (and optional informal learning artifacts) to capture their use of social media for informal learning. After data were transcribed, cleaned, and anonymized, they were analyzed using both inductive and deductive thematic analysis. Activity Systems Analysis served as the analytic framework to guide the deductive thematic analysis. NVivo was also used to organize data for analysis. Among this sample of teenagers, the primary self-directed informal learning objectives using social media were to support gaming, hobbies and interests, and school curriculum and electives. While many participants used multiple social media platforms to support their informal learning needs, YouTube was the only social media platform that was common across the participants. Throughout their participation in the study, the teenagers indicated other informal learning instances using social media. These instances of informal included self-directed, incidental, and socialization informal learning. The advantages of social media for informal learning, as perceived by the teenage participants, included convenience, access to information, media format, and comfort within the space. Some of the tensions they experienced were similar thematically to the advantages. These tensions included access to the space, media format, comfort in the space, negative experiences, and misinformation and fake news. Overall, the teenage participants primarily discussed the advantages of social media when prompted during their interviews, indicating that they may not fully comprehend the value of these platforms beyond entertainment and socialization. Similarly, the teenagers more frequently reported tensions when prompted during their interviews. While much of the empirical literature about teenagers and social media substantiates their negative experiences and behaviors on these platforms, this finding suggests that tensions are more likely infrequent for teenagers. These findings contribute to the literature about teenagers' social media use, particularly for productive purposes. Further implications of the findings are discussed, as well as study limitations and directions for future research.</abstract>
