   <abstract >While strategic self-talk interventions' positive effects on sport performance and performance-related processes are well documented, little is known regarding naturally occurring self-statements, or organic self-talk. Previously, eight discrete organic self-talk functions were identified, yet research concerning contextual and personal factors relating to these functions is still lacking. It is imperative to explore such factors to establish a holistic sport-specific self-talk model that determines the organic self-talk use in sport. Thus, the aim of the study was to explore the relationships between sport-related stress and coping, athletic identity, demographic and sport-related factors and the eight organic self-talk functions of psych-up, anxiety control, confidence, instruction, worry, disengagement, somatic fatigue and irrelevant. Thus, 216 NCAA student-athletes were recruited to participate in a two-wave internet survey. The PSS-Sport, AIMS and ASTQS questionnaires were used to measure sport-related stress and coping, athletic identity and the organic self-talk functions respectively. Eight linear multiple regressions were conducted to determine the relationship between the aforementioned variables and organic self-talk functions' frequencies. RM MANOVAs and moderation tests were conducted to compare stress, coping and self-talk functions in and out-of-season. Results indicate that stress was associated with all self-talk frequencies except confidence. Coping was associated with psych-up, confidence and worry. Athletic identity was associated with psych-up, confidence, instruction and disengagement frequencies. Age was associated with anxiety control and instruction self-talk. Lastly, sport type and division level were associated with disengagement and instruction self-talk respectively. No changes were recorded in and out of season. Implications and limitations are discussed.</abstract>
