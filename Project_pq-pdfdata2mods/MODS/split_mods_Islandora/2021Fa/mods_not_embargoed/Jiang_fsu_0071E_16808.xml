   <abstract >In two studies, I explored the relationships among regulatory focus and L2 self-guides (which are qualitative differences in motivation), L2 oral task emotions, and L2 oral performance. In Study 1, 133 second-year high school students in China 1) completed questionnaires measuring their background information, the self-reported L2 oral proficiency levels, L2 self-guides, and chronic regulatory focus,2) completed an oral task and 3) completed questionnaires measuring their anxiety and enjoyment levels in the oral task. Each participant had a 10-minute break after completing Study 2 data collection. The participants were randomly and evenly separated into three groups by the research assistants. Participants in the first group answered some questions designed to induce their situational promotion focus orientation. Participants in the second group answered different questions designed to generate their situational prevention focus orientation. The control group participants did not answer any questions. After that, all the participants completed the second oral task. Finally, they completed questionnaires assessing their task anxiety and task enjoyment. Multiple regression and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to analyze the data. The multiple regression results showed that, in Study 1, L2 learners' oral performance was positively predicted by their chronic prevention focus and their level of enjoyment during the oral task, and negatively predicted by their ought L2 self/other. In addition, the L2 learners' chronic promotion focus and ideal L2 self/own positively predicted their enjoyment during the oral task. In Study 2, ANOVA results indicated that the anxiety levels of the L2 learners who received situational promotion focus treatment was higher than the anxiety levels of the L2 learners who received situational prevention focus treatment and who did not receive treatment. There were no differences across the groups in terms of task enjoyment and performance. The results of the study confirmed the importance of motivational variables related to L2 learners' obligations and significant others (chronic prevention focus and ought L2 self/other) in influencing Chinese L2 learners' task emotions and overall performance. Overall, the findings can enrich the understanding of L2 learners' motivation and emotions in L2 oral performance, which can in turn help educators design more effective teaching methods and provide a more enjoyable learning experience for L2 learners.</abstract>
