   <abstract >Stem cells have been proven to be an essential part of the human body when it comes to growth, development, maintenance, and repair. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are programmed to behave and differentiate with the simialr capabilities as embryonic stem cells, which are known to be able to differentiate into all cell types and can be cultured for an extended amount of time. Research has led to the concept that hiPSCs can be used for medical purposes directly through injection, but there are possible serious difficulties including immune rejection and teratoma formation. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are now shown to be the mechanism and machinery behind stem cells repairative properties. Loaded with proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids, EVs contain cargo that affect the cells that are targeted by them and diseases like cancer use EVs to propagate the growth of tumor cells. Today, one of the most difficult areas of the body to repair with medicine or treatment is the central nervous system (CNS). A few specific CNS disorders include Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's diesease, stroke, and others. A common factor that is seen in all these cases is that there is damage to the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the only major protection that the CNS has from the blood in your body. It separates the conditions of blood from the CNS as the physicological changes that occur in the blood would be damaging to nerve cells. EVs have been shown to have positive effects on damaged CNS cells, specifically when using EVs derived from the same cell type. The main issue with using EVs is that there is little data explaining their targeting capabilities in vivo as tracking has been proven difficult. Iron oxide nanoparticles have gained much interest due to their biocompatibility and can be visualized with magnetic resonance imaging. Now EVs need to be studied to see if they have the ability to transmigrate across the BBB through specific mechanisms. It is essential that a BBB model can be constructed in vitro in order to examine EV transmigration. The BBB is made up of four cell types that construct what is called the neurovascular unit and includes brain microvascular endothelial cells and pericytes (and astrocytes and neurons). Together, these two cells work together to maintain the structure and barrier properties of the BBB. These cells are differentiated from undifferentiated hiPSCs and co-cultured to form the BBB phenotype. This project derived and characterized brain pericytes and endothelial cells from hiPSCs as well as co-cultured the derived cells. A good in vitro BBB model that exhibits proper trans endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) that are comparable to in vivo BBB along with EVs loaded with iron oxide allows for an acceptable representation of how this interaction would occur in vivo. Overall this project should further our comprehension of how EVs interact with the BBB and if they indeed transmigrate across the BBB, leading to advances in medicine and EV-related therapy and drug delivery.</abstract>
