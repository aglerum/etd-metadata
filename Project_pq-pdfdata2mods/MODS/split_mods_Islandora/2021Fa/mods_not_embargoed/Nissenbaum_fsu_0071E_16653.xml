   <abstract >Mesoscale precipitation bands were investigated in 38 winter storms that impacted the northeast US between 2004 and 2015 in the GridRad reflectivity mosaic dataset and compared to simulated bands in the 12 km North American Mesoscale Model (NAM) at all forecast times. A total of 921 band timesteps were identified in GridRad and 3681 band timesteps were identified in NAM. Bands were classified by their appearance into embedded, isolated, broken, merged, fine scale, or heavy precipitation band types. These band types were further classified into multi-bands if two or more bands occurred alongside each other with similar band orientation angles and appearances. Embedded bands were the most common band type, representing 72.4% of all bands in the radar dataset and 87.7% of all bands in the NAM for all storm cases. The remaining band types were well-represented in the radar mosaic but were captured less often in the NAM, likely due to the coarse model grid. The composite thermodynamic environment of the observed bands was studied using the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR), but the band types contained overlapping confidence intervals and did not significantly differ from each other. However, band angle and time relative to occlusion featured weak and moderate significant correlations with slantwise convective available potential energy (SCAPE). These relationships suggest that large values of SCAPE are more likely in northeasterly tilted bands compared to northwesterly tilted bands as well as bands that occur before occlusion. The performance of NAM was evaluated against the observed bands in GridRad. NAM poorly resolved the observed bands at the analysis time and had even lower performance at greater lead times. By forecast hour 72, the threat score (TS) values fluctuated around 0, suggesting that almost all model skill regarding the prediction of mesoscale bands is lost. Model performance also varied according to the stage of cyclone development. TS values improved in the 5-20 hours following occlusion compared to the hours before and during occlusion. To better understand the factors that affect model performance, the environment composing low and high skill events was investigated. The low skill environment consists of a single upper-level jet south of the surface low, while the high skill environment consists of a surface low favorably positioned within the ascending branch of two robust upper-level jet streaks. A case study of a low skill event demonstrated rapid error growth in the strength, position, and amplitude of the upper-level trough at forecast hours as early as 30 hours prior to the banding event. In comparison, a case study of a high skill event achieved similar levels of error growth as late as 60 hours prior to the banding event, with smaller error growth at earlier lead times. This would suggest that low and high skill banding events are characterized by short- and long-range predictability windows, likely due to biases in the positions of troughs and ridges within the large-scale synoptic flow.</abstract>
