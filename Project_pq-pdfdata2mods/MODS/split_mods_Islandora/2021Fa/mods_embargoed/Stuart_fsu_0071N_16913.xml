   <abstract >Older adults with amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI) can experience daily Prospective Memory (PM) challenges that can affect their ability to manage day-to-day tasks, maintain their health, and sustain relationships with family and friends. Voice-activated assistants (VAAs) are a hands-free, convenient tool that have the potential to help older adults with PM-related tasks. Unfortunately, there are barriers to adoption of VAAs by this population. In this study, 15 older adults (4 with and 11 without aMCI) were given an Echo Dot device to use for a 10-day period. A Tip Card provided guidance on how to use the device to perform three PM-related tasks: setting reminders, creating lists, and setting timers. This Tip Card was designed with a human-centered design approach, incorporating the input of a subject matter expert on the needs of this population. Over 10 days, usage logs were extracted remotely from the device and each interaction was coded according to its purpose. After the use period, a semi-structured interview was conducted to assess each participant's experiences and ratings of both the device and Tip Card individually, and a thematic analysis was used to extract common experiences. On average, PM-related tasks made up 67% of total uses. Usability scores for the device were "A" on average, corresponding to a rating of "excellent"; scores for the Tip Card were also "A" on average. The most commonly mentioned interview themes were Device Usefulness and Tip Card Usefulness, and other themes revealed specific benefits of the device/Tip Card system, as well as provided insight into the barriers still faced by this population in using VAAs. Taken together, the findings support that VAAs can help older adults with and without aMCI to complete daily memory-related tasks. These findings also suggest that a Tip Card system designed with the target population in mind can provide a starting point of baseline confidence for all users and serve as a return point for users who have difficulty remembering how to use the device.</abstract>
