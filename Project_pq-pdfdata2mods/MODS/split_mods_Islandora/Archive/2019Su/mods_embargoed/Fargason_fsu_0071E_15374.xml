   <abstract xmlns="">In this manuscript, I explore issues of masculinity, mental illness, and spirituality—often using the form of elegy. Many of the elegies in this manuscript are in conversation with critic Jahan Ramazani's arguments about elegies: "the modern elegist tends not to achieve but to resist consolation, not to override but to sustain anger, not to heal but to reopen the wounds of loss." The arc of the book shows the speaker working through grief, healing from loss, and confronting mental illness. The poems of healing interrogate that "wound of loss" Ramazani describes, while detailing the inherent difficulty of opening or closing the wound. The book is structured in four sections, with each section having the central threads braided throughout. Each braid connects back to—and is filtered through—the speaker: his struggle with God, his constant conflicts with the father figure, his romantic relationships, and his own crumbling mental health. In addition to these recurring themes, I attempt to explore the distances between two people (or figures), in either a literal way, or through memory. In reckoning with those distances, the focus of exploration twists inward: the poems about other people become about the speaker. The knowledge gained from the focus inward becomes become holes in the speaker's perceived identity that the poems must then work their way out of. Several of my poems are influenced by a strained relationship with an emotionally and physically abusive father. This father figure informs my speaker's sense of masculinity through notions of power and love, which becomes mirrored in the speaker's tenuous relationship toward God throughout the manuscript. In the poems that deal directly with family, I write in the tradition of such contemporary poets as Sharon Olds. However, many of the poems in this manuscript don't glorify the body and the sensuous relationship a person can have with their body, as many of Olds' poems do. Instead, many poems look at the way the body breaks down and is impacted through chronic illness, inherited conditions, aging, and ultimately, death. Many of the poems in this manuscript filter claustrophobic human experiences and interactions through the self, attempting to navigate new knowledge that fractures one's understanding of the world. My speaker's encounters with intimacy tend to reveal the erotic to be just as claustrophobic as the self. The poems dealing with intimacy are written in the tradition of such poets as Robert Creeley (with his unresolved desire of his idealized lover) and Richard Siken (with his attempts to revive and reanimate the dead lover in Crush). Several poems attempt to reconstruct memories and fail, thereby giving the reader the sense that the speaker is always already aware that memories—even traumatic or closely held memories—degrade over time. The end of the manuscript shows the speaker working toward recovery from his mental illness, but it doesn't present that healing process in an unrealistic way, knowing that the healing process is never complete. Rather, the ending shows the speaker struggling to move forward, but moving forward nonetheless.</abstract>
