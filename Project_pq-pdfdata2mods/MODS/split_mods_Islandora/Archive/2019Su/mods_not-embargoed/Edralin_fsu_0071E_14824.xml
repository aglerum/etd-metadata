   <abstract xmlns="">The present study examined personality factors in relation to negative career thoughts and profile elevation. Study participants (n = 128) were undergraduate students enrolled in five sections of a career development course at a large, public, Southeastern university. The NEO Five-Factor Inventory-3 Form S (NEO FFI-3 Form S; McCrae &amp; Costa, 2010) was used to measure the five factors of personality (Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness). The Career Thoughts Inventory (CTI; Sampson et al., 1996a) was used to measure negative career thoughts and the Standard Self-Directed Search (StandardSDS; Holland &amp; Messer, 2017) was used to measure profile elevation. A hierarchical multiple regression analysis was conducted to determine if the five personality factors (Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness) on the NEO FFI-3 were predictors of negative career thoughts (CTI Total Score). Results of the hierarchical multiple regression showed that 27.1% of the variability in the CTI Total Score was explained by the combined effect of Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness. Neuroticism and Conscientiousness were the only statistically significant predictors of the CTI Total Score. In addition, a simple linear regression was conducted to determine if negative career thoughts (CTI Total Score) predicted profile elevation on the StandardSDS. The simple linear regression results showed that 3.6% of the variance in profile elevation could be explained by the CTI Total Score. Finally, a hierarchical multiple regression analysis was conducted to determine if the five personality factors (Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness) on the NEO FFI-3 and negative career thoughts (CTI Total Score) predicted profile elevation on the StandardSDS. The hierarchical regression revealed that 38.0% of the variability in profile elevation was explained by Openness, Extraversion, Conscientiousness, Neuroticism, CTI Total Score, and Agreeableness. Openness was found to be the strongest predictor of profile elevation, followed by Agreeableness, Conscientiousness as the third strongest, and Extraversion as the fourth strongest predictor of profile elevation. Additional analyses showed that 7.9% of the variance in profile elevation could be explained by DMC. Additional analyses also revealed a significant positive relationship between Neuroticism and DMC, as well as significant negative relationships among DMC, Extraversion, and Conscientiousness. A significant positive correlation was found between Neuroticism and CA, as well as a significant negative correlation between Conscientiousness and CA. Finally, a significant positive correlation was found between Neuroticism and EC, as well as significant negative correlations among EC and Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness. A discussion of the study's findings and limitations are offered. Lastly, implications for theory, practice, and future research are included.</abstract>
