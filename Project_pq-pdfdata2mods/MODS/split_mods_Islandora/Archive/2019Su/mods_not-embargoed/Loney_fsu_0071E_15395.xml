   <abstract xmlns="">Decision-making (DM) is a critical task performed by military medics. Often split-second decisions must be made and executed in high pressure situations that tax the human system. The consequence for either making the wrong decision or executing the right decision poorly can threaten medics' survival and the survival of those they are treating. While experience and a solid knowledge base are necessary components in the DM process, these qualities may not be sufficient. DM is strongly influenced by the medics' schemas, and emotions and attention activate these blueprints (Tenenbaum &amp; Razon, 2008). Because DM is greatly influenced by the aforementioned factors, we conducted a case study using three experienced United States (US) Army medics to enhance our understanding of the impacts of a 12-session intervention designed to enhance Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TC3) DM under pressure. The training program began with arousal control (AC) as the medic's Internal Environment (i.e., emotion-memory relationship) affects the perception-cognition-action linkage, and thus each aspect of the DM process (Tenenbaum et al., 2009). Because perception and cognition are inter-related and play a critical role in DM (Tenenbaum &amp; Razon, 2008), the intervention also included imagery-driven schema development (SD) and attention training (AT). Multiple sources of data, including both qualitative and quantitative measures were incorporated into the near and far transfer measures to provide an in-depth examination of the effectiveness of the DM training. Near transfer measures, which were assessed at four points, included baseline biometrics (e.g., HRV), imagery use, and a computer-based multi-tasking and an attention shifting task. As hypothesized, all near transfer measures increased for each medic. Far transfer measures consisted of TC3 performance ratings and interviews, resting biometrics taken pre- and post-performance, active biometrics collected during TC3 execution, appraisal-based surveys, and interviews pertaining to TC3 anticipation and attention. TC3 performance improved for two of the three medics. As expected, average resting and active HRV increased for each medic. This study supported the previously found relationship between perceived stress reactivity and higher threat appraisals, negative emotions and reduced performance satisfaction (Britton et al., 2019; Nicholls et al., 2012). Overall imagery use increased and may have exerted some influence on performance. Lastly, we found TC3 performance and evaluator-derived relevant attention frequency to be associated. Although the medics may have reduced their self-reported relevant attention, their ability to refocus upon recognition of distraction improved.</abstract>
