   <abstract xmlns="">The present qualitative study explored college student responses to personal clay use or mindfulness-based art therapy (MBAT) twice a week for stress reduction. Participants were recruited from a larger art therapy study, in which the biological stress marker, cortisol, was tested following time spent playing with clay. This study was divided into two groups, a neutral clay group (NCT group) who solely played with clay for stress reduction, and an MBAT group, also given clay, but mindfulness exercises as well. Participants from both groups were chosen to be interviewed about their experience to compare perceptions. Interviews took place once at the start of the study, and a second time after the study was complete. The semi-structured interviews explored 1) the nature of college student stress and stress management, 2) responses to MBAT on stress, anxiety, and general student functioning in the college setting, and 3) responses to personal clay use on stress, anxiety, and general student functioning in the college setting. Following thematic analysis of all interview transcriptions, differences were noted between those who engaged in personal clay use, combined with supplemental mindfulness exercises (MBAT group), and those who were provided solely with personal clay without prompts or guidance (Neutral Clay Task group; NCT). The results showed that MBAT participants learned new, specific ways of managing stress proactively, while experiencing mind and body connection, and gaining a sense of mastery and accomplishment. Participants in the NCT group also expressed that they were able to relax, work through their stressors, and create new self-care habits, but the effects of their clay use were described as more short-term, and they desired more guidance managing stressors. These results possibly indicate that MBAT could be effective for college students wanting techniques for lasting stress reduction and anxiety relief.
