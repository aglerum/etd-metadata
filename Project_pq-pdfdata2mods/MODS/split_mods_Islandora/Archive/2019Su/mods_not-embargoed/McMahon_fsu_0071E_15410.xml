   <abstract xmlns="">Departmentalization is a growing trend in elementary schools nationwide due to a focus on high stakes accountability testing. In a departmentalized school, teachers specialize in one to three subject areas and students benefit from the instruction of teachers with expert knowledge in their specific areas as opposed to the traditional, self-contained elementary school model where students receive instruction in multiple subjects from one teacher. This mixed methods study sought to investigate the process of departmentalizing fourth and fifth grade classrooms, and to examine the relationship between departmentalization and student achievement growth in St. Lucie Public Schools in Florida. The study found that elementary and K-8 schools with higher poverty populations, as well as schools with lower student enrollments, were the most likely to utilize departmentalization, especially a semi-departmentalized model in the fourth grade level. Students in departmentalized classrooms showed less growth over the course of the school year. The choice to departmentalize was largely teacher-directed and assignment of specific subjects to teachers was based on teachers' strength, comfort levels, and supporting student data. These findings are discussed and recommendations for the district are offered in the final chapter.</abstract>
