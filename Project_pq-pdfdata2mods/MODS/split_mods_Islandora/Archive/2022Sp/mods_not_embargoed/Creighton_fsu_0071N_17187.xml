   <abstract>As is the case for most of my works, World of Midnight is first and foremost a story. It started as a story that my friends and I would tell together through playing Dungeons and Dragons. Over time, I started taking the same melodies that I was using for background music during our games and setting them as contemporary chamber works. Now, they've been even further stretched and developed into a full-length symphony that is to the best of my abilities right now as a 25-year old masters student. This symphony follows a specific narrative, but I'm reserving most of these details in the hopes that the listener will find their own inspiration and stories in the music. Instead, I will provide the foundation of what each movement sets out to achieve, share the inspiration behind my selection of texts, and highlight some particularly important details. The first movement, "In the Eternal Night…," establishes the central motives and ideas that will be important throughout the symphony. It introduces us to the titular "world of midnight" that towards the latter sections of the movement undergoes some great disaster. The following movement, "…the Dead World Lay," imagines the narrator wandering through a desolate landscape observing the final moments of sunlight being consumed by an oppressive gloom and darkness. This movement in particular explores a feeling of aimless, dissociated wandering. The third movement, "A Cimmerian Waltz," …is the only movement without chorus. It depicts the a party happening near the end of the world, during which attendees stubbornly attempt to keep dancing while ignoring the interruptions brought on by the end of days. This continues without break into the final movement, "Only Death May Free," which depicts a fierce battle against forces that would seek to do harm to the world. I was drawn the texts of Clark Ashton Smith as I began to study and learn more about Lovecraft and cosmicism, and I found his dark imagery an excellent match for this shadow-stricken setting. I chose the excerpt from Seneca to serve as the twisted, nihilistic philosophy of "Moriyah," a figure introduced in the final movement that is the embodiment of darkness. The choir also invokes a different mysterious name, "Yuna," throughout the symphony. I will leave it to the listener to decide the nature of her identity and purpose.</abstract>
