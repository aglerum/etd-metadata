   <abstract>Attrition among Emotional/Behavioral Disorder (EBD) teachers in El County School District (ECSD) has been a problem. This study aimed to identify the leading causes of EBD teacher attrition within ESCD. Two research questions were researched to ascertain the causes of attrition: "How do EBD teachers describe their workload manageability in teaching EBD students?" and "What support do EBD teachers receive to manage their workload, and how does the support influence their intention to stay or leave?" An exploratory approach was taken to discover the leading causes of EBD attrition. The research design chosen for this study was a qualitative multiple case study using semi-structured interviews of seven EBD teachers and four administrators who oversee EBD units. It was discovered that workload manageability, mainly teaching and preparing for multiple grade levels, was the most significant source of stress for EBD teachers. It was also found that while administrative support was important to EBD teachers, the type/source of support was not as important as the quality and quantity of support available to manage their workloads. The findings from this study give district-level and school-based administrators a starting point to being intervening to retain their EBD teachers. It is recommended that administrators make sure EBD program built-in supports are appropriately trained to work with EBD students. They must also check in with their EBD teachers to solve problems proactively. Administrators can also ensure that EBD teachers are supported by grade-level teams, school communities, or individuals from the EBD units and have easy access to lesson plans suitable for EBD classrooms. Finally, they can improve data collection and conduct exit interviews of EBD teachers who leave their positions to see what concerns caused them to make this decision.</abstract>
