   <abstract>The Career and College Promise Program, North Carolina's dual enrollment program, was designed to allow all eligible high school students a chance to participate in college courses prior to high school graduation. Although many high school students take advantage of this opportunity, eligible Black high school students in Bladen County do not participate in the college transfer pathways portion of the program at the same rates as their White classmates. This study aimed to explore the factors that contribute to eligible Black high school students decision to enroll in the dual enrollment program. As this was a qualitative case study, geographically bounded, students were purposely selected based on several prerequisites to include: race, high school grade point average, and college plans after high school. Participants agreed to participate in face-to-face or virtual interviews, using Zoom, where a semi-structured interview was conducted in one hour or less. This study found that participants of the dual enrollment program had support from parents, siblings, and friends who were college educated or knowledgeable of the program. This study also found that participants who did not participate in the program lacked the support and guidance of parents and friends who were knowledgeable about the program. One of the main findings amongst participants who were not enrolled in the dual enrollment program is that they did not understand the purpose of the college transfer program and how it might benefit them and their future goals. Additionally, this study found that non-participants were not aware of their eligibility. This study found that high school students are more likely to participate in a dual enrollment program when there is a targeted effort to educate and recruit them. High school students are more likely to listen to their peers than to college officials who they have not built a relationship with. Additionally, a student is more likely to enroll in the Career and College Promise Program when they have a parent who is actively engaged in their academic plans. Several recommendations surfaced from this study to include hosting an assembly for all eligible students at each high school in the county, hosting an information session for school officials in order to educate and dispel any myths or rumors, and advertising within the local community in order to gain support from the community.</abstract>
