   <abstract>Introduction: Due to the high metabolic demand of sport, it is essential that athletes meet their caloric need to support training, recovery, and muscle growth. Consuming protein before sleep may have positive effects on sleep, overnight recovery, muscle protein synthesis, and performance. Additionally, consuming carbohydrates before sleep may improve hours of sleep and reduce wake episodes throughout the night. Pre-sleep fat consumption, particularly saturated fat, may also increase wake episodes throughout the night, therefore decreasing quality. Furthermore, sleep is a time where growth and recovery occur; metabolic activity is at its lowest point, and higher rates of growth hormone are secreted, thus promoting recovery. Sleep is typically the longest post-absorptive period, so examining the potential effects of pre-sleep food consumption is warranted for the impact on both sleep and recovery. Currently no data exist to assess pre-sleep nutrition habits in elite female athletes, particularly soccer players. Methods: In a retrospective study, 14 Division I female soccer players (mean ± sd: age 20.8 ± 1.4 years; height 167.9 ± 4.87 cm; weight 64.1 ± 6.9 kg; BMI 22.7 ± 0.5 kg/m2) from four universities wore a WHOOP, Inc. band 24h a day for the entire 2020-2021 competitive season to measure activity, sleep, and recovery. Surveys were administered through the WHOOP app every 3 days over the season to collect data on pre-sleep feeding habits and their effects on sleep quality, sleep quantity, and markers of recovery (as defined by resting heart rate [RHR], heart rate variability [HRV], and a WHOOP, Inc. generated recovery score). Descriptive results were completed using R studio. Results: Average pre-sleep nutritional intake (mean ± sd: kcals 330 ± 284; pro 7.6 ± 7.3 g; fat 12 ± 10.5 g; cho 46.2 ± 40.5 g) was recorded. No significant differences between high versus low kilocalorie (p = 0.10, 0.42), protein (0.69, 0.65), fat (p = 0.16, 0.81), and carbohydrate (p = 0.17, 0.81) pre-sleep consumption were reported on metrics of sleep, including hours of sleep and wake episodes, respectively). Furthermore, no significant differences existed between high versus low pre-sleep kilocalorie (p = 0.84, 0.84, 0.81), protein (p = 0.64, 0.70, 0.06), fat (p = 0.26, 0.76, 0.81), and carbohydrate (p = 0.66, 0.93, 0.92) consumption and metrics of recovery, including RHR, HRV, and recovery score, respectively. Conclusion: These findings suggest no significant impact of pre-sleep feeding on metrics of sleep or recovery. However, the meals consumed were small, and may not have been enough to elicit any positive responses in sleep or recovery. Further research is warranted to examine the effects of pre-sleep feeding on athletes in a controlled, laboratory-based setting. This study was sponsored by WHOOP, Inc.</abstract>
