   <abstract >Information that changes is often recalled worse than information that does not change, such that memory interference is observed (Anderson &amp; Neely, 1996). However, studies using the A-B, A-D paradigm have revealed that when reminding occurs during the encoding of changed information and is recollected at test, it can result in memory facilitation, such that changed information is recalled better than control information that is only presented once (Wahlheim &amp; Jacoby, 2013). One possibility is that reminding allows for memory integration, which in turn produces the facilitation observed in prior work. Memory integration allows us to make sense of new information in our daily lives, and has significant implications for the field of education (Bauer, Esposito, &amp; Daly, 2020). Although reminding appears necessary for memory integration to occur, reminding alone does not appear sufficient. The aim of the present studies was to better understand the factors and mechanisms underpinning the relationship between reminding and integration. Although animacy status has appeared to be an important factor for integration in previous studies (Schreiner, Meiser, &amp; Br√∂der, 2022), Experiment 1 found that animate and inanimate cue words did not differ in reminding during encoding, reminding recollection at test, nor in evidence of integration. Experiment 2 suggested that measuring reminding through mental imagery reports better captured integration relative to asking a direct question about reminding, and provided a new method of investigating the relationship between reminding and integration. Experiments 3 and 4 found that reminding occurred in an open-loop paradigm, but critically, found that an increased rate of reminding in that paradigm did not predict increased evidence for memory integration, and provided mixed evidence for a correlation between event structure awareness and memory integration. Taken together, the results of these experiments deepen the current understanding of the human memory system by providing support for the notion that reminding is necessary but not sufficient for memory integration, and providing new methods for investigating reminding and integration that can be used in new paradigms.</abstract>
