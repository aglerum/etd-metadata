   <abstract >The purpose of this paper was to examine the qualities of effective string orchestra teachers. The research questions for this study were (1) What are undergraduate music students' perceptions of the demonstrated qualities and behaviors of string orchestra teachers? (2) Is there a significant difference in perceptions of demonstrated qualities and behaviors between males and females? (3) Is there a significant difference in perceptions of demonstrated qualities and behaviors between music education and non-music education majors? Before commencing the study, a review of literature was completed as a foundation. The review of literature highlights qualities and behaviors of effective teachers, perceptions of qualities of effective teachers, music-specific qualities of effective music teachers, as well as problems in string music education and music education overall. After a need for the study was established via this literature review, the present study began. A Qualtrics survey was sent out via convenience and snowball sampling to music education and non-music education music major undergraduate students. Due to the nature of this distribution method, a return rate could not be calculated. They had to rate the degree to which they observed nineteen specific qualities of effective teaching in five different video episodes. Results from the web-based survey suggested that undergraduate music students can identify and evaluate traits of effective music teachers. No significant differences were found between ratings of non-music education students and music education students, suggesting that teacher training is not required to be able to perceive effective teaching qualities. However, some significant differences were found between ratings of males and females. The qualities for which there were significant differences included: 1) maintains a pleasant affect; 2) demonstrates knowledge of subject matter; 3) gives clear directions, 4) motivates students well, 5) manages student behaviors, and 6) maintains a high energy level. In each of these cases, the female ratings on average were higher than the male ratings.</abstract>
