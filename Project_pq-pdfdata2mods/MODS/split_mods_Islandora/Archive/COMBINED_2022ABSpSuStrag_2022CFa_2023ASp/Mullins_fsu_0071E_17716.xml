   <abstract >Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major public health challenge and the leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Atherosclerosis, a primary underlying cause of CVD, results from oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, and excess low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) accumulation. Dietary patterns with regular fruit and vegetable consumption are associated with multiple health advantages, including cardiovascular benefits. Foods high in phytonutrients and fiber have been associated with improving chronic inflammation, vascular function, and circulating cholesterol levels. Prunes (dried plums, Prunus domestica L.) are a nutritious food with bioactive components such as polyphenolic compounds and soluble fiber, which are associated with improved cardiovascular health. The purpose of this study was to investigate the cardioprotective effects of prune supplementation and determine the extent to which daily consumption influences blood lipids, oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, and vascular function in aging men. Sixty-two healthy men aged 55 to 80 years old, with moderate bone loss, were included in the parent study. Participants were randomized into one of three treatment groups: 100g/day prune, 50g/day prune, or control (no prunes) and consumed a daily multivitamin containing 450mg calcium and 800 IU vitamin D3. Data were collected at baseline, 3-month, and 6-month timepoints and included fasting blood draw, anthropometrics, 3-day food log, physical activity questionnaire, and DXA scan preformed to measure bone mineral density. Data and blood samples from 56 participants were included in the current study, per protocol. Serum samples were analyzed for lipid concentrations including total cholesterol (TC), low and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c, VLDL-c), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), and TC-HDL ratio. Plasma samples were analyzed for lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH), a biomarker of oxidative stress, and proinflammatory biomarkers high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). With 6 months of daily prune consumption, no significant changes were observed in TC, LDL-c, non-HDL-c, or TC-HDL ratio. Significant increases were observed for HDL-c from 3-month to 6-month timepoints (P=0.015), in all groups. Both VLDL-c and TG increased significantly (P=0.003) with 50g prune dose at 6 months, compared to baseline. No significant changes in CRP or TNF-α were observed. LOOH levels significantly improved with 50g dose at 3 months and 100g dose at 6 months, each compared to baseline. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was improved at 3 months, compared to baseline, in all groups; however, no significant improvements were seen in SBP with either 50g or 100g prune dose. Findings from this study suggest that daily consumption of 50g to 100g of prunes for a period of 6 months does not significantly influence cardiovascular risk factors in healthy aging men, compared to control.</abstract>
