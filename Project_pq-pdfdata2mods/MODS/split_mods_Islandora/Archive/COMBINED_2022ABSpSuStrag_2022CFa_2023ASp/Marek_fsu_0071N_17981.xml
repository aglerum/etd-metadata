   <abstract >Sources for musical composition can come when you least expect it. Such is the case for "Crystal Bridges". Each of the movements that make up this piece are based on a piece of art that I observed at the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas. I was captivated by many of the pieces of art, but especially by the three that I selected to constitute this piece. The first movement, "Lunar Rendezvous-Circle of Flowers", is based on Alma Thomas's work of art by the same name. Her piece was inspired by the idea of what her garden might look like from the moon. She uses abstraction and vivid colors to portray her response to technological advances and her own passion. I took the playful and elegant nature of a garden and juxtaposed that idea against the vastness and broadness of space. This movement starts in Alma Thomas's garden, then "zooms-out" to see her garden from space. The piece then zooms back into her garden, giving the movement a variation of an arch form. The second movement, "Sierra Nevada Morning", is based on Albert Bierstadt's painting of the same name. In his painting, Bierstadt keenly reinforces the theme of romanticism by focusing on both mild and powerful elements of nature, emotion, imagination, and the untainted beauty of the West. What captured my attention most about the painting was Bierstadt's use of luminism and depth. The painting features a calm pond with deer, while stretching up to the skies with bright clouds and mountains towering in the background. I reflect the idea of luminism by using metallic percussion instruments such as the vibraphone, crotales, and glockenspiel to create a "shimmering" effect. The piece itself unfolds from quiet woodwind oscillations that build into expansive, chordal hits, paralleling the growth from the pond to the towering mountains and clouds that can be found in Bierstadt's painting. Lastly, "Cerulean", the third movement, is based on Carmen Herrera's abstract painting of the same name. This piece takes the listener through some of the perceptions of the painting as observed by various patrons at the museum. Some of the words that I used as inspiration during my compositional process were "bold", "sharp", "valorous", "persistent", "vivid", "soaring", and "light". These were all words that came up in discussion with patrons at the museum. Abstract art is meant to encourage imagination and multiple perspectives, which I represent in this concluding movement.</abstract>
