   <abstract >Mobile performance support systems (MPSS) are being adopted to support workforce performance across many industries and organizations. An MPSS provides just-in-time access to assist workers with their job tasks from anywhere with minimal help from others (Gery, 1995b; Hueftle, 2005; Layton et al., 1995; Ruffner &amp; Deibler, 2010). A review of the literature suggests that empirical research on MPSS is sparse and sporadic. Scholars from human performance technology (HPT), computer science, engineering, and business fields have called for additional studies on MPSS (Egger &amp; Masood, 2020; Porcelli et al., 2013; Rossett, 2011). To date, only a few studies have explored the use of MPSS in the context of HPT. The purpose of this study was to explore why MPSS is adopted in companies and organizations in North America to solve performance problems and meet organizational goals. The study focused on why MPSS is considered an appropriate intervention, the benefits of adopting MPSS, and the challenges in the adoption. The three research questions of the study are: I. Why is MPSS adopted in the workplace? II. What are the benefits of adopting MPSS in the workplace? III. What are the challenges that participants encountered in MPSS adoption? To answer these questions, the study employed qualitative field interviews. Managers and leaders of MPSS projects from 13 companies and organizations in North America joined the study, representing government, military, transportation, aviation, health care, higher education, medical, restaurant, retailing, semiconductors, and manufacturing. The results led to the identification of ten main reasons, six salient benefits, and 12 top challenges reported by over 30% of participants. The main reasons for adopting MPSS were to improve efficiency, aid work in the field, lower costs, provide support in the moment, minimize human errors, manage content, meet job condition requirements, alleviate worker burdens, assist highly complex tasks, and support learning. The salient benefits for adopting MPSS were to boost performance, build confidence, encourage professional satisfaction, increase ROI, manage corporate knowledge, and enhance organizational reputation. The 12 prevailing challenges in MPSS adoption were grouped into four themes: change management (resistance, organizational culture, project planning, change implementation), technology usability consideration (Wi-Fi connection, interface design, device and infrastructure, environment), intervention design and development (development and delivery, content creation and maintenance), and project-related issues (cost and return, IT support). The findings of the study provide insight about the adoption of MPSS in the workplace. As the use of mobile technologies continue to expand and penetrate our daily lives, the results can help HPT professionals strategically adopt MPSS to support performance instead of blindly following current trends.</abstract>
