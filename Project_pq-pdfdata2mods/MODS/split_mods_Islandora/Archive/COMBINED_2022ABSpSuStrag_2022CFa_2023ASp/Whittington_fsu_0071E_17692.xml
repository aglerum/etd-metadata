   <abstract >Shakespeare's The Tempest is one of his most musical plays, and the monster Caliban is an inherently musical monster. He demonstrates musical skills and affinities, and his speech "Be not affeard" from Act 3, Scene 2, is one of Shakespeare's most sonically evocative speeches. Yet Caliban's speech seems uncharacteristic, because elsewhere Caliban is portrayed as grotesque. As a result of the play's musical sensibilities, many composers have set the play as opera or concert works. Interrogation of the ways in which interpreters represent Caliban in these adaptations, particularly regarding his "Be not affeard" speech, provide a revealing window on cultural history. This study considers musical adaptations chronologically from the seventeenth century to the present, reading Caliban as a cultural text. It explores the cultural and epistemological contexts of these works and analyzes them through the lenses of dramaturgy and musical style. The inconsistencies in the monster's description leave openings for interpreters to inflect the character in any number of directions. In the eighteenth century he is fish-like. In the nineteenth century he is a caricature of the noble savage or the missing link in the human evolutionary chain. In the twentieth century he stands in as a representative of any number of oppressed people groups. The musical styles that represent Caliban run the gamut from stylized grunts or growls to virtuosic vocal lines. Despite the sonically evocative language of Caliban's speech, few composers set his remarkable speech about the island at all, and even fewer set it as a discrete aria in its original affect. Examination of musical adaptations of The Tempest shows that the impetus to leave out the speech, or to invert its affect, usually stems from discomfort with portraying the monster in a sympathetic way, because a vulnerable monster would undermine or threaten the stability of cultural values. In the Enlightenment, the predilection for binaries of opposites and dichotomous worldviews necessitated that Caliban be unequivocally malevolent. Nineteenth-century adaptations situated him under the archetype of the noble savage, reading his musical affinities as an index for the presence of a redeemable soul. The advent of postcolonial literary criticism in the mid-twentieth century sparked altogether more sympathetic readings of Caliban. The influence of these readings led composers to set Caliban's speech as his aria, unrestrained in its ability to reveal the character's interiority and vulnerability. This dissertation thus situates Caliban as a revealing interpretive window onto cultural history, "listening" to him by reading him as culture and interpreting his meaning. More than other monsters, Caliban has a rich body of music composed for and around him, and listening to the performance of this music is another more phenomenological way to understand Caliban. Listening to the monster sing makes palpable his interiority and vulnerability and provides a way to know and feel Caliban's emotional worlds.</abstract>
