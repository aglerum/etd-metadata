   <abstract >NCAA Division I collegiate student-athletes in the US compete at the highest college level. These high-level academic and sport-related demands can create perfectionistic tendencies. Prior literature shows that perfectionistic concerns are positively related to athlete burnout while perfectionistic strivings are negatively related. For the prevention of athlete burnout, physical and psychological rest has been recommended. However, there is no previous study that explored the relationship between perfectionism and psychological rest. Therefore, the present study aims to contribute to the existing literature in two ways. First, the relationship between perfectionism and athlete burnout in D-I collegiate athletes was explored. Second, the relationship between perfectionism and psychological rest was explored in these athletes. A sample of 295 D-I, female, team sport athletes participated. Athletes completed online questionnaires comprised of the Competitive Orientations Scale (Sport MPS-2), The Athlete Burnout Questionnaire (ABQ), and the Wakeful Resting Experiences Questionnaire. Four subsamples were identified from the scores on these measures: a pure evaluative concerns perfectionism group (n = 11), a mixed perfectionism group (n = 28), a non-perfectionism group (n = 23), and a pure personal standards perfectionism group (n = 18). Hypothesis 1 stated that burnout scores would be highest in the pure evaluative concerns perfectionism (ECP) group, second highest in the mixed perfectionism group, third highest in the non-perfectionism group, and lowest in the pure personal standards perfectionism (PSP) group. Hypothesis 2 stated that psychological resting experience scores would be highest in the pure PSP group, second highest in the non-perfectionism group, third highest in the mixed perfectionism group, and lowest in the pure ECP group. Two separate One-Way ANOVA tests were performed to test the hypotheses. Hypotheses were partially supported. The results showed that athletes with pure ECP and mixed perfectionism had significantly higher levels of athlete burnout compared to athletes with non-perfectionism and pure PSP. Moreover, athletes with non-perfectionism reported significantly greater recent engagement in psychological resting experiences compared to athletes with mixed perfectionism. This study contributes to the literature by furthering the research on perfectionism and burnout and being a pioneer in research on the relationship between perfectionism and psychological rest.
