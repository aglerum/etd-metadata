   <abstract >This dissertation examined the relationship between student engagement in college and subsequent employment status and early career earnings in a public university. This study sought to understand whether or not student academic and social experiences in college are related to post-baccalaureate early career earnings. The literature review explored human and social capital theories, related student development theories, and the economics of education as it relates to the earnings premium of postsecondary education. The study analyzed student data and explored the relationship between student experiences in college and subsequent employment status and early career earnings. The overall engagement measure dramatically increased the likelihood a student was employed within 6 months of graduation and was also positively related to early career earnings. Of the student engagement subscales, leadership and campus involvement and community service and philanthropy increased the likelihood a student was employed within 6 months of graduation. The leadership and campus involvement measure was also positively related to early career earnings in the full model, as well as in many of the conditional models for different student subpopulations. The international and global learning measure and the research and academic endeavors measure both had a negative relationship with the natural log of wages in the overall model and in many of the conditional models, plausibly due to increased engagement of students who may have been more inclined to enter into public service, social services, or the non-profit sector. Regarding the moderating relationships, the results suggested that the research and academic endeavors measure was more important to early career earnings for males than females, while the overall engagement measure and the community service and philanthropy measure were less important for STEM majors compared to non-STEM majors.</abstract>
