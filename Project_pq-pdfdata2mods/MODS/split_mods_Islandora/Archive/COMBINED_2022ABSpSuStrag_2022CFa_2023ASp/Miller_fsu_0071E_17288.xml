   <abstract >Research has shown that during this time of development, adolescents may encounter obstacles in navigating sexuality, identity, academics, and friendships that can exacerbate risk-taking behavior (WHO, 2018; WHO, 2011). Adolescents tend to participate in higher levels of risky behaviors (i.e., unprotected sex, substance use, and violence) compared to individuals over the age of 21 (Duell et al., 2018; Reniers et al., 2016). School and parental connectedness are significant protective factors for health, school success, and overall well-being (Hay et al., 2016). Adolescents who feel a greater connection to their home and school communities are less likely to face damaging health outcomes (i.e., sexually transmitted infections [STI], drug abuse, death) connected to substance use, sexual risk, violence, and mental health (CDC, 2019a). Therefor aim of the current study was to examine whether school and parental connectedness in a preadolescent population delays onset of risk behaviors (e.g., initiation of sexual intercourse, initiation of drug, alcohol and tobacco use). The research was conducted using previously collected data from 1115 African American pre-adolescents (age 9-12 at study entry) and their primary caregivers, who were followed longitudinally for three years as part of the Parents Matter! project. The study was conducted using structural equational modeling (SEM) and path analysis to answer the research following questions: (1) Is there an association between school connectedness and risk-taking behavior (i.e., risky sexual behavior and alcohol and drug use) among African American youth?, (2) Is there an association between parental connectedness and risk-taking behavior (i.e., risky sexual behavior and alcohol and drug use) among African American youth?, (3)Does school connectedness moderate the relationship between parental connectedness and risk-taking behaviors for African American preadolescents?, (4) Does gender moderate the relationship between parental connectedness and risk-taking behaviors for African American preadolescents?, and (5) Does SES moderate the relationship between parental connectedness and risk-taking behaviors for African American preadolescents? Each research question was examined from two perspectives: the perspective of the parent and the perspective of the preadolescent. Results from analyses indicated a significant association between school connectedness and risk-taking behaviors for both the preadolescent and parent models, although the correlation was in opposite directions (i.e., negative correlation for preadolescents, positive correlations for parents) (Research Question 1). The results also revealed a significant correlation between parental connectedness and risk-taking behavior (Research Question 2). Gender moderated a significant correlation between parental connectedness and risk-taking behavior according to parent reports, however the preadolescent model only indicated a significant correlation for females as it pertains to parental connectedness and risk-taking behavior in African American preadolescents (Research Question 4). SES moderated a significant relationship between parental connectedness and child sexual behavior in all three SES categories in the parent model and in the low SES category in the preadolescent model. The preadolescent model also a revealed significant correlation between parental connectedness and substance use in the Low and Moderate SES categories (Research Question5). Results for both parent and preadolescent models yielded no significant correlation when school connectedness moderated the relationship between parental connectedness and risk-taking behavior (Research Question 3). The results of this study offer significant additions to the field of psychology, particularly within the treatment and study of risk-taking behavior reduction in African American preadolescents. Limitations regarding sampling, measures, and data analyses were taken into consideration when analyzing the results and implications of the study. Implications associated with theory, future research, and clinical practice were taken into consideration.</abstract>
