   <abstract >This thesis explores the worshipscape of First Baptist Church Midway (FBC Midway), a Southern Baptist church located in Plant City, Florida. With nearly 125 years of history and worship, FBC Midway has gone through many eras of music and worship practices. My study of this Southern Baptist church's worship history is threefold. I examine the spaces in which worship happened and continues to happen, the people who were and still are worshipping in these spaces, and the various musical styles that they have used in worship. Through a combination of archival research, ethnographic conversations, and personal reflection, I piece together a meaningful representation of this specific worshipscape and how the people who inhabited it understood its function in their lives in and outside of the church. The term "worshipscape" was coined by Adekunle Oyeniyi and is new to the field of congregational studies. Oyeniyi derived this term primarily from Michela Mari's and Sara Poggesi's term "servicescape" (2013). In doing so, he prioritizes the concepts of musical style and demographic appeal. The use of "worshipscape" in this thesis is adapted from this previous work, as well as R. Murray Schafer's concept of a soundscape, to include all musical and extra-musical aspects of worship in a given church community. This fieldwork conducted at FBC Midway is a practical and multifaceted attempt at unearthing multiple layers of influential factors important to understanding its worshipscape and how it has changed over time. The difficulty in studying worshipscapes lies in attempts at holistic representation. Much like their secular counterparts, spiritual soundscapes constantly evolve and change over time. Through this study, I develop a useful theoretical and methodological framework for investigating a Christian Baptist church's sonic worship practices from their historical formation through their present-day renditions. By employing a conglomerate of ethnomusicology, ecomusicology, sound studies, and archive studies, I juxtapose multiple influencing aspects of worship and sound into a cyclical relationship. This framework can be applied broadly to the holistic study of worshipscapes that span various religions, geographical areas, and worship practices.</abstract>
