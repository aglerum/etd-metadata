   <abstract >Anxiety among teachers is an important area to study because of the potential for anxious teachers to pass their anxiety to some of their students. From a growing body of research, we see that both preservice and practicing elementary school teachers can also experience anxiety when teaching math. Given that elementary school teachers often teach all school subjects, it is possible that this anxiety about teaching is not distinct for math but could also be experienced when teaching other subjects as well, especially when teachers are early in their careers. From the current literature, we also see that these levels of anxiety, whether about math or about teaching, can vary depending on the grade level the teacher is teaching as well as how long a teacher has been teaching. Using a sample of 296 kindergarten through third-grade teachers, we examine if teachers' general math anxiety and anxiety about teaching math differ depending on the grade level they teach and the length of time they have been teaching, and whether teachers' anxiety about teaching varies by school subject, the grade level they teach, or by the length of time they have been teaching. We found that teachers of earlier grades had more general math anxiety than teachers of upper grades. We also found that the 281 teachers who taught multiple subjects not only experience anxiety when teaching math, but also when teaching other subjects as well, especially at the upper grades. For these teachers, gaining teaching experience was associated with decreases in anxiety when teaching different school subjects. These findings provide evidence for future studies examining anxiety experienced by elementary school teachers who not only teach math, but who teach other subjects as well.</abstract>
