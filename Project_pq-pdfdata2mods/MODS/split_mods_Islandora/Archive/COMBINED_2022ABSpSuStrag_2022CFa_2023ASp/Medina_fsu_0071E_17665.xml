   <abstract >Employees engage in informal learning to solve a workplace problem and to gain knowledge at the time the need arises without waiting to attend a scheduled training session (Jacobs &amp; Park, 2009; Livingstone, 1999; Schugurensky, 2000; Schürmann &amp; Beausaert, 2016)￼ The definition employed in this study is the self-guided pursuit of knowledge, as an intentional (explicit) behavior, when the employee is cognizant of the learning while it is taking place. The organization of study was a municipal (government) utility organization in the southeast United States with combination of onsite and remote office staff, and skilled field/plant workers. The purpose of the study was to examine employees' informal learning behaviors (ILBs) and tools that support their job performance, and to explain why they used those informal learning strategies and tools for their job performance. 172 employees completed a questionnaire reporting on their frequency of use of the following ILBs: talking with others, observing others, searching the internet, using job aids, using social media, reviewing policies and procedures, manuals, or standards, participating in coaching/mentoring, using shared materials, resources, and knowledge, using resources from professional organizations, and engaging in trial and error. Interviews with 10 employees representing both office and field employees, explained why employees engaged in ILBs and tools at work. Employees responded to the survey and the findings revealed that nine out of the ten strategies were currently being used by 70% or more of the respondents. Results also show that five out of the eight informal learning tools listed on the questionnaire were being used by 70% or more of the respondents. While office and field workers ILBs and tools usage results were similar, their explanations of their specific work context revealed some important points for the organization to consider. Workers in the field could benefit from access to organizational information and applications on their mobile device because the nature of field work required them to learn on-the-go. Other unique work environments, such as remote office workers, depended on reliable access to collaboration tools and videoconferencing. The findings can help this organization and others provide a work environment that encourages ILBs and supports their employees' job performance by providing necessary resources and tools for informal learning.</abstract>
