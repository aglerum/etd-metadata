   <abstract >The purpose of this quantitative study was to examine the relationships among personal characteristics (i.e., age, race, marital status, education level, and years of teaching experience), work environment characteristics (i.e., pay, benefits, type of program, age group of children, and class size), job satisfaction, and turnover intention of preschool teachers work in licensed child care centers in Florida. This study also examined the extent to which job satisfaction had a mediating effect on the relationship between personal characteristics, work environment characteristics, and turnover intention. A cross-sectional web survey was developed and administered to a proportionate stratified random sample of 275 preschool teachers in Florida. The data collected included teachers' demographic and work environment information, Job Satisfaction Survey (JSS; Spector, 1994), and the Turnover Intention Scale (TIS-6; Roodt, 2004). The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc comparison tests, independent samples t-test, chi-square test of independence, hierarchical multiple regression, and mediation analysis using Baron and Kenny (1986) approach. The results of this study found that more than one-fourth of preschool teachers (27.6%) were considering leaving their job. Chi-square test indicated that for teachers in the age group of 25 – 34 and 35 – 44 years old, being single, and dissatisfied with their job were associated with turnover intention. The results of hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that job satisfaction was the most significant predictor of turnover intention when controlling for personal and work environment characteristics (adjusted R2 = .48, F = 168.33, p &lt; .05). While the variance accounting for turnover intention was small, work environment characteristics significantly predicted turnover intention when controlling for personal characteristics (adjusted R2 = .10, F = 1.96, p &lt; .05). However, personal characteristics showed no predictive power for turnover intention. In addition, mediation effects of job satisfaction were only found in the relationship between type of program and turnover intention, and class size and turnover intention. The findings of this study contribute to the literature by providing empirical evidence concerning the relationships among personal characteristics, work environment characteristics, job satisfaction, and turnover intention that have been underexamined in the field of early childhood education. It is important to understand how these factors are related to each other in order to retain preschool teachers in the field, which in turn can contribute to maintaining and improving the quality of early childhood education.</abstract>
