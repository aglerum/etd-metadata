   <abstract >Background: Aligning energy intake with the biological circadian rhythm and extending periods of fasting within a 24-h cycle improves whole-body metabolism. However, it is unknown if these improvements are related to changes in intestinal nutrient absorption. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of early time-restricted eating (eTRE) on energy and macronutrient digestibility, metabolizable energy, gastrointestinal (GI) function, and cardiometabolic health markers. Furthermore, we sought to determine predictive factors of digestibility. Methods: Healthy adults (n=16, age 31.1 ± 5.2 y, BMI 23.8 ± 3.4 kg/m2) participated in a 9-d randomized, crossover, controlled feeding trial where they followed an eTRE schedule (i.e., all calories consumed between 0800 and 1400) and a control eating schedule (i.e., all calories consumed between 0800 and 2000). After a 3-d acclimation to the study diet and eating schedule, all stool and urine were collected for 3-d. The energy content of the diet, stool, and urine was measured by bomb calorimetry and the results were used to calculate energy and macronutrient digestibility and metabolizable energy. An ingestible capsule was used to measure intestinal transit time and hydrogen gas production. Additional outcomes included resting energy expenditure, thermic effect of food, mean 24 h glucose, glucose variability, fasting and postprandial glucose, insulin, and lipids, and circadian gene expression. To determine the relationship between digestibility and GI function, components of energy expenditure, and cardiometabolic health markers, participants were dichotomized based on median digestibility (91.4%) during the control eating schedule and classified as an absorber (digestibility above median) or excreter (digestibility below median). Multivariable regression was used to assess predictors of energy digestibility. Results: When following a controlled, weight maintenance diet, eTRE had no impact on energy digestibility (eTRE, 91.7 ± 2.3% vs. CON, 91.7 ± 1.5%, P=0.97), metabolizable energy (eTRE, 88.0 ± 1.5% vs. CON, 87.8 ± 2.3%, P=0.71), whole-gut gastrointestinal transit time (eTRE, 23.3 ± 8.6 h vs. CON, 26.1 ± 8.6 h, P=0.32), or hydrogen production when normalized by transit time (eTRE, 4.2 ± 7.6 % H2 vs. CON, 1.4 ± 1.5 % H2, P=0.44) when compared to a control eating schedule, respectively. Compared to the control eating schedule, eTRE decreased 24 h glucose (eTRE, 95.0 ± 18.1 vs. CON, 101.1 ± 18.5 mg/dL; P&lt;0.0001), fasting glucose (eTRE, 87.3 ± 6.4 vs. CON, 93.6 ± 7.3 mg/dL; P=0.01), insulin (eTRE, 10.1 ± 3.9 vs. CON, 13.5 ± 7.4 µIU/mL; P=0.008), HOMA-IR (eTRE, 2.2 ± 0.9 vs. CON, 3.2 ± 1.7 mg/dL; P=0.001), VLDL-C (eTRE, 14.6 ± 6.9 vs. CON, 16 ± 6.1 mg/dL; P=0.03), and triglycerides (eTRE, 73.3 ± 34.1 vs. CON, 80.2± 30.3 mg/dL; P=0.03). eTRE did not affect resting energy expenditure (eTRE, 1484 ± 315 vs. CON, 1480 ± 321 kcals/d; P=0.75), thermic effect of food iAUC0-4h (P=0.59), or postprandial metabolism (iAUC0-4h, all metabolites P&gt;0.20). Lastly, after characterizing participants as an absorber (digestibility above median) or excreter (digestibility below median), absorbers had slower colonic transit time (absorber, 34.0 ± 15.8 h vs. excreter, 17.6 ± 9.5 h, P=0.04), greater glycemic variability (CV%: absorber, 21.9 ± 3.6 vs. excreter, 14.9 ± 3.3; P=0.002), and lower fasting insulin (absorber, 9.9 ± 4.5 vs. excreter, 17.1 ± 8.2 µIU/mL, P=0.05). Moreover, daily wet-weight (R2=0.79,P&lt;0.0001) and dry-weight (R2=0.78, P&lt;0.0001) stool production, glucose variability (R2=0.60, P=0.0007), colonic transit time (R2=0.40, P=0.02), age (R2=0.39, P=0.01), resting energy expenditure (R2=0.35, P=0.02), whole-gut transit time (R2=0.29, P=0.03), and gross energy intake (R2=0.28, P=0.04) were all predictive of digestibility. Conclusions: In this randomized, crossover trial in healthy adults, eTRE was more effective for reducing 24 h mean glucose, fasting glucose, insulin, insulin resistance, triglycerides, and VLDL-C. However, intestinal energy and macronutrient absorption were not impacted by eTRE. These findings suggest that changes in intestinal absorption do not seem to mediate the clinical benefits traditionally observed with eTRE. Intestinal absorption is an understudied component of nutrition and physiology. We found that energy digestibility was associated with gastrointestinal function and glucoregulatory factors. Determining factors that predict individual energy digestibility may aid in the development of personalized nutrition recommendations.</abstract>
