   <abstract >Reprise is a key element of Broadway musicals. In this dissertation, I analyze reprise in two musicals by Jeanine Tesori—Fun Home (2015) and Shrek the Musical (2008)—because their use of motives, themes, and songs complicates the general notion of reprise. Generally, reprise can be understood as the performed return of a song within a show. However, I posit that reprise can be understood more broadly as the re-presentation of some coherent and identifiable musical element. A musical element could be a song, melody, phrase, or motive. In broadening the concept of reprise in Broadway musicals through formal and dramatic features, the goal of this dissertation is to construe reprise as a way in which an earlier dramatic context informs the meaning and significance of a later one. Because the concept of reprise entails the existence of two musical segments at separate points in the show, I create a five-step methodology to aid in analysis: determining, analyzing initial element, analyzing reprise, projecting, and incorporating. To show relationships between dramatic contexts in a show, I use elements of Dora Hanninen's associational methodology. Her associational graphs, contextual domain, and contextual criteria allow me to relate reprises with their initial presentations. To connect the musical reprise to a dramatic context, I develop a dramatic domain that allows for relationships between musical segments and dramatic interpretations. Jeanine Tesori's music, as well as that of other present-day Broadway composers, exhibits features of both Tin Pan Alley songs and more recent popular/rock music (since around 1960). Because of the variety of meanings of verse, chorus, and refrain in the literature, I develop TPA- (Tin Pan Alley) and P- (Popular) versions of each to refine and clarify their formal functions as well as expand the role of reprise in Fun Home and Shrek. Chapter 1 outlines my key definitions and assumptions and then situates my study within the context of existing musical theater scholarship in music theory and musicology. In Chapter 2, I describe my analytical process, TPA- and P- terminology, and use of Hanninen's theory. Chapter 3 analyzes Fun Home, with attention to how the reprise of certain motives and themes informs the formal analysis of songs as well as the characters' development and show's dramatic arc. In Chapter 4, I explore the dramatic implications of large-scale formal features in Shrek, specifically involving the numbers "Big Bright Beautiful World," "I Know It's Today," "This is How a Dream Comes True," and "Who I'd Be." Chapter 5 examines the ramifications of reprise for thematic and character development, particularly Fiona's revelation that she is an ogress ("Morning Person Reprise") and the show's professed multicultural unity ("Freak Flag" and "Finale"). Ultimately, my project explores how the analysis of a reprise's general formal features—assumed to transfer across performances, productions, actors—can inform specific dramatic interpretations. In my analyses of Fun Home and Shrek, I show reprises that exhibit general, organizational principles of both Tin Pan Alley and recent popular music; at the same time, these general structural relationships can inform particular dramatic readings that vary by analyst, production, and performance.</abstract>
