   <abstract >In male zebra finches, the song learning process can be divided in to two distinct-but-overlapping stages: sensory, and sensorimotor, which are scaffolded by concurrent changes in the brain. In the male song network, dual premotor pathways provide distinct-but-overlapping contributions to auditory learning and sensorimotor learning of song. Female zebra finches can recognize certain familiar male songs – indicating that they too are capable of sensory learning. However, female zebra finches do not naturally produce song. The contrast of sexual dimorphism in song production and apparent partial dimorphism in song learning provides a prospective within-species comparison which by process of subtraction may highlight the delegation of neural processes to sensory acquisition, and sensorimotor learning, respectively. Historically, the seminal neuroanatomical difference between male and female zebra finches was said to be the absence of nearly all male-typical song regions + connectivity in the female brain. The behavioral and neural development of female vocalizations have not been carefully investigated, if at all. These shortcomings in the songbird literature bias the investigation and understanding of song learning and production, and limit the generalizability of any conclusions drawn from study of zebra finch brain and behavior. Here I elucidate the female "song network" anatomically and test the necessity of key female "song network" regions for development and production of female zebra finch vocalizations. The male song network is composed of two major pathways, and HVC contributes to both. The AFP (anterior forebrain pathway) induces variability in the network motor output and is disproportionally influential during juvenile song learning. The CMP (caudal motor pathway) exerts the learned theme upon the network's motor output, growing more influential as development progresses and theme encoding strengthens. In this dissertation, bilateral injections of bidirectional fluorescent tracer – one injection site per brain hemisphere - into female (a) Area X, (proper name) (b) HVC (acronym is the name), (c) LMAN (lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium) or (d) RA (robust nucleus of the arcopallium) mapped the network connectivity of those nodes in the female brain, demonstrating that female and male zebra finches possess near identical extrinsic connectivity of those four nodes. Using the neurobiology of male vocal development and production as a guide, I tested whether behavioral functions are shared between female and male song networks. Female zebra finches produce several different vocalizations (calls), yet little is known about how they arise developmentally. Conversely, the behavioral and neural developmental trajectory of male song is well studied. Thus, I recorded and quantified the normal developmental trajectory of female calls from time of nutritional independence to adulthood. Then, in a second cohort of birds, I disconnected the AFP from the "song network" via bilateral LMAN ablation in juvenile females, testing the necessity of LMAN for female vocal development. Finally, I disconnected the CMP from the "song network" via bilateral HVC ablation in adult females, to test the necessity of HVC for female call production.</abstract>
