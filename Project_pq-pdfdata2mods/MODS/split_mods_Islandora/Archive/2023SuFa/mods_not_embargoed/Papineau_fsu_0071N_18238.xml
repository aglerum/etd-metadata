   <abstract >Minimal research has investigated the group dynamics of individual sport teams. The social interdependence theory, as well as the current body of literature on individual sport teams, suggest that cross country and track and field are structurally unique from each other. However, an understanding of how teammates may experience the differences of competing in two individual sport teams is absent from the literature. The purpose of the current study was to contribute a contextualized examination of the experiences of group dynamics in collegiate cross country athletes competing in track and field to the body of literature. Therefore, a conceptual framework of group dynamics in sport is introduced to describe the factors influencing emergent states, group structures, and group processes. Data were collected through five focus group interviews with three women's and two men's teams from four NCAA Division II programs and one NCAA Division III program. A reflexive thematic analysis guided the interpretation of the data, in which three themes and seven subthemes were developed. The first theme represents participants' perceptions of their individual contributions to their cross country and track and field teams, titled "my contributions to these teams aren't always the same" and consists of two subthemes (a) "I run for something bigger than myself" and (b) "it is me over we… unless we have a chance". The second theme represents participants' experiences of cross country, titled "we are all in this together… until the end" and consists of three subthemes: (a) "it's in the beginning that "we" become 'us'", (b) "our training brings us together", and (c) "all eyes on 'the' team". The third, and final, theme represents participants' experiences of group dynamics in track and field, titled "we are not all we have, but we are all we really need" and consists of two subthemes: (a) "we bring history" and (b) "we would have it differently if we could". The findings suggest that the unique structure of cross country and track and field distinguishes teammate interaction and determines individual and team outcomes between sports. Researchers are encouraged to more closely investigate the nuances of group dynamics in individual sport teams. Although cross country athletes also compete in track and field, the current study supports the need for specialized application-based research for cross country and track and field, respectively. Consequently, individual sport teams should be considered as separate entities in research and practice.</abstract>
