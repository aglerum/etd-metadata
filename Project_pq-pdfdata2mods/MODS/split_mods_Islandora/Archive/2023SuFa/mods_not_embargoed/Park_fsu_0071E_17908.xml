   <abstract >Testament of Spring is composed for orchestra in the Rondo form which employs both of tonality and atonality. It was originally inspired by a subheading from 리타의 정원(Rita's Garden), the Korean essay book written by Ahn Rita. The subheading is that all the seasons were testaments/last wills. In order to develop the initial inspiration to the specified theme for the musical work, I wrote a Korean poem, "봄의 유언(Testament of Spring)." The musical piece focuses on the spring season among four seasons, and describes the testament of spring meaning the unreturnable past. Along with that, the musical piece implies a positive message that we can draw a better future/spring for those who are suffering from the trauma or sad memories in the past. Testament of Spring is a five-part Rondo form. The first section is a refrain with a theme having a pitch center. Beginning with a triangle refers to the Korean traditional music, 종묘제례악(The Royal Ancestral Ritual in the Jongmyo Shrine and its Music) which has two different percussion instruments for the start and the end. To indicate the infinity of time, the percussion at the end is not used in this musical piece. It gradually builds up three pitch centers, A, C, and E throughout the section. Along with the A pitch-centered part, a motivic melody is introduced by oboe, which is inspired by traditional Korean music. The second section is the first episode consisting of four subsections. The first and second subsections are written with a three-beat dance which contains an unexpected time change from time to time. The second and fourth subsections are written with an expanded fragmentation of the second episode. The third section is similar to the first section, but it ends on A flat. It is a transition to the fourth section which is written in A flat major. Also, "Autumn Leaves" is quoted to emphasize the refrains' references to the returning springs. The last section unfolds differently from the previous refrains. While it still has the pitch centers, they are more moving along the contour of melody that I borrowed from "The Lord is My Shepherd" which is a Catholic hymn composed by a Korean nun, Gu Myung Rim. The duration of this piece is about 15 minutes.</abstract>
