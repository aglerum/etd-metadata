   <abstract >In places where there is historical disinvestment in minority communities and public infrastructure, disasters like Hurricane Michael and recovery-resilience narratives provide possibilities for energizing community movement towards just community development and as rationalizing logic to maintain uneven status quo. This contestation makes the role and limitations of formal local government planning and community-based organization important. In 2018, Panama City was devastated by Hurricane Michael, a Category 5 (Saffir-Simpson intensity scale) hurricane, when it made landfall. The impacts of Hurricane Michael were differentiated across the coast of the different county not only due to the differences related to the magnitude of storm surge and hurricane winds but also because of the difference in physical infrastructure, social, and economic situation. Four years after Hurricane Michael, the City Government and different communities are still working on recovery projects and resilience plans, which are also subject to the different coastal geographies. This research looked at how Hurricane Michael impacted the daily life of people as well as government functions of Panama City. Consequently, it also critically examines the recovery and resilience building at the community and city levels. It utilized mixed methodology by combining interviews of community and local government officials with participant observation and document analysis of the formal long-term recovery planning conducted by the city and community-based planning conducted by a community-based organization. This research provides empirical evidence on how civic engagement and community care practices are leveraged by a community-based organization to advocate for transformative resilience that addresses historical vulnerability. I trace this argument of alternative forms of resilience we called "Resilience from Below" as the potential for continuing critical projects. This view of resilience is reflected by emerging literature from critical scholars, activists, artists, and communities vulnerable to environmental risk (climate change and its impacts). Resilience from below address the significant critique of mainstream resilience and provide a way to reclaim it as a potentially transformative concept. 'Resilience from below' involves 1) rethinking vulnerability and its causes using historical and intersectional lenses, 2) paying attention to the community care practices and moving away from financial-only metrics used in adaptation decisions, and 3) centering the community resilience building through collaborative and care work. Resilience in this frame recognizes vulnerable communities as active participants in resilience building, which allows for theoretical and political re-framing of resilience as a useful concept by ensuring that it is place-based, experience-based, transformative, caring, and justice-oriented.</abstract>
