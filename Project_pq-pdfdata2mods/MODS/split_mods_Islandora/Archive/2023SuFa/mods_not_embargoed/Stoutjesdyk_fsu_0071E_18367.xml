   <abstract >CS/HB 1467: K-12 Education is a new education law in Florida requiring schools and teachers to be entirely transparent about the material used for instruction and in school media centers and ensuring all materials used are appropriate and vetted. This study seeks to understand how high school English teachers are navigating these changes brought about by CS/HB 1467 and how they have adjusted their pedagogical practices and content being taught. This exploratory, qualitative interview study uses Shulman's pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) as a conceptual framework to investigate how Florida high school English teachers' PCK is being adapted due to the implementation of CS/HB 1467. The data for this study was collected through semi-structured interviews with 10 Florida high school English teachers. Participants described their experiences with adapting their pedagogy and content as well as the support that they feel they need from their schools' administrative teams, school districts, and the state. Four major themes emerged from the interviews: background, practice, reaction, and support. Qualitative analysis showed a need for support from the participants' administration teams, school districts, and state, which is recommended in the form of professional development through online learning opportunities, seminars, and workshops. Three thematic categories were discussed by participants regarding how their PCK has been affected: updating materials, adjusting time, and professional development needs. Finally, I discuss the implications of my findings, which include four professional development recommendations: 1) invite a district or state official to explain the exact wording of CS/HB 1467, how the school district is interpreting it, and what that means for high school English teachers, 2) identify new instructional skills and strategies for high school English teachers to use to support CS/HB 1467, 3) provide an easily navigable database of approved texts and media for teachers to reference, and 4) align teachers' beliefs with reform goals by sharing the purpose and goals the state expects from CS/HB 1467. These professional development opportunities can be provided to teachers in a few ways, such as through seminars, workshops, and online learning.</abstract>
