   <abstract >The present study focuses on the optimization of vitamin E (α-tocopherol) incorporation into pea protein films, with an emphasis on improving the film's properties and antioxidant capacity. Pea protein offers great potential as a natural emulsifier for delivering both nutritional and functional benefits. The study begins by investigating the modification of pea protein structure through pH-shifting treatment. This process enhances pea protein's emulsification ability, leading to the formation of stable emulsions with small particle sizes that remain stable over one week. Next, the study explores the influence of α-tocopherol addition on protein film samples, both with and without pH-shifting treatment. α-Tocopherol is added either directly or in the form of a nano-emulsion. The findings indicate that pH-shifting treatment improves the film's elongation-at-break compared to the control group. However, the direct addition of α-tocopherol negatively impacts film structure, resulting in a rough and broken surface morphology. The surface becomes smoother after treating the protein dispersion with pH-shifting, leading to a more continuous structure. Nevertheless, the mechanical properties of the film are compromised in the presence of α-tocopherol. To create film samples with excellent antioxidant properties without compromising film texture, α-tocopherol is incorporated in the form of a nano-emulsion. When both the protein dispersion and nano-emulsion are treated with pH-shifting, the resulting film samples exhibit homogeneous, even, and smooth surface textures with tiny pores, as observed in SEM images. Importantly, the mechanical properties of the films are not sacrificed. These films exhibit a tensile strength of 1.52 MPa and an elongation ability of 190.77%. Furthermore, it is noted that the color and opacity of the protein films are significantly altered by different combinations of treatments. However, factors such as solubility, moisture content, and water vapor permeability are minimally influenced. The antioxidant ability of the films is assessed through DPPH inhibition and the duration of antioxidant release. Results show that the films with pH-shifting combined with nano-emulsion treatment exhibit nearly 96.7% free radical inhibition ability and consistent antioxidant release. In summary, the combination of pH-shifting treatment and nano-emulsion incorporation proves to be an effective method for integrating hydrophobic substances into an aqueous environment while minimizing negative effects on the mechanical properties of the film. This approach holds promise for the development of pea protein-based films with enhanced antioxidant properties for a wide range of potential applications in food packaging and preservation.</abstract>
