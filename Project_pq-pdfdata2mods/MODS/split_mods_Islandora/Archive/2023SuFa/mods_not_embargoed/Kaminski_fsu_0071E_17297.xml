   <abstract >Research has demonstrated a clear connection between childhood trauma and later life difficulties, including difficulties in academic functioning. Specifically, childhood trauma is associated with declines in academic achievement (Blodgett &amp; Lanigan, 2018; Duke, 2020), attendance (Blodgett &amp; Lanigan, 2018; Crouch et al., 2019), and school engagement (Bethell et al., 2014; Crouch et al., 2019; Iachini et al., 2016). Some research has identified that certain types of trauma might be associated with different types of academic functioning (Crouch et al., 2019; Duke, 2020) and that these relationships may differ for boys and girls (Duke, 2020; Hardaway et al., 2014). However, such specific relationships and patterns are understudied. As well, though social support has been shown by preliminary research to serve as a protective factor between childhood trauma and academic functioning (Samuel &amp; Burger, 2020) research is greatly lacking in this area. Thus, the purpose of the current study was to explore relationships between childhood trauma, academic functioning, and academic functioning in adolescence while also examining potential gender differences. A sample of 380 adolescent participants (grades 9-12) were recruited from a Southeastern K-12 school and were included in the current study. The final sample (n=380) consisted of 45.8% boys (n=174) and 48.7% girls (n=185). The sample was 47.6% White Non-Hispanic (n=181), 22.9% Black or African American (n=87), 14.2% White Hispanic (n=54), 8.9% two or more races (n=34), 5.3% Asian (n=20), .5% American Indian (n=2), and .5% Native Hawaiian or Other (n=2). A cross-sectional design was utilized to investigate the following research questions: (1) Is childhood trauma associated with academic functioning for boys and girls?, (2) Are all 3 clusters of trauma (witnessing trauma, interpersonal trauma, and non-interpersonal trauma) associated with all three indicators academic functioning (academic achievement, attendance, and school engagement) for boys and girls?, and (3) Does social support (friend social support, family social support, and school social support) moderate the relationship between childhood trauma and academic functioning for boys and girls? Participants were asked questions related to childhood trauma experiences, social support, and academic functioning using the follow measures: Child PTSD Symptom Screener-5-Self-Report (CPSS-5-SR; Foa et al., 2017), the Delaware Student Engagement Scale (DSES; Bear et al., 2019), and the (CASSS; Malecki &amp; Demaray, 2001). Students' GPA and attendance were also obtained and matched with students' responses on the surveys. Additionally, demographic items such as race/ethnicity and gender were obtained. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling (Research Questions 1 and 3) and path analysis (Research Question 2). Results from analyses demonstrated that childhood trauma was significantly associated with declines in academic functioning and that path strengths were different, but the difference was not statistically significant in this sample (Research Question 1). Further, results partially illustrated that some types of trauma may be more detrimental to some types of academic success. Again, there was no significant difference between boys and girls in this sample with one exception: the path between non-interpersonal trauma and attendance was statistically significant with path being stronger for girls than boys. (Research Question 2). Social support was not found to moderate the relationship between childhood trauma and academic functioning (Research Question 3). Implications for theory, clinical practice, and future research are covered.</abstract>
