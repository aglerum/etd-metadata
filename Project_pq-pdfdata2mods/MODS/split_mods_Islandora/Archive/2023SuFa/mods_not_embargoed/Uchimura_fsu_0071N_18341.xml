   <abstract >There are two distinct time periods of the barbershop singing tradition that are often conflated in the scholarly musical community. The first period, generally from the 1860s through the 1930s, is marked by extemporaneous singing in public spaces that transitioned to the minstrel and vaudeville stages. During this period, both Black and White barbershop quartets were a staple of vaudeville shows and could be heard on the radio, early recordings, and the concert stage. The second period began in the 1930s when the tradition saw a split into two sub-genres separated by race. As vaudeville disappeared, barbershop faded from the stage as well, though it continued as a community practice. The tropes and rhetoric surrounding American barbershop singing come directly from the Society for the Preservation and Encouragement of Barber Shop Quartet Singing in America (SPEBSQSA), which currently operates under the name Barbershop Harmony Society (BHS). Meanwhile, the African American community transformed the style into what would eventually be called doo-wop. Doo-wop gained crossover popularity throughout the 1940s and 1950s, but was classified by music industry executives, disc jockeys, and record stores as rhythm and blues along with a number of other popular Black idioms such as gospel, blues, jazz, and early rock and roll. SPEBSQSA took that time to develop its own definition of barbershop singing and implant it into the American consciousness through popular media. By asserting itself as the preserver of barbershop practice, SPEBSQSA has fabricated a singular history and style that is maintained through their contest and judging rules. However, barbershoppers still participate in a semi-extemporaneous activity called "tagging" that often expands a singer's understanding and experience of barbershop. Tagging is a social activity where at least four singers get together to sing the final measures, or the tags, of barbershop tunes. Tags are typically 4-16 measures of the end of a song and are nearly always taught by rote. Although the competition model is meant to showcase the now-canonized barbershop style, tagging exemplifies the values and lived experience of the early tradition's practitioners. This thesis examines how labels and preservation practices have changed the perception of the barbershop tradition. I apply Fatimah Tobing Rony's framework of "taxidermy" and Avery Gordon's theory of "haunting" to demonstrate the power of genre labels to reify biases and create new understanding. Using barbershop and doo-wop as a case study, I argue that the racial divisions built into American musical classifications continue to obscure the diverse history, sound, and practice of popular music styles.</abstract>
