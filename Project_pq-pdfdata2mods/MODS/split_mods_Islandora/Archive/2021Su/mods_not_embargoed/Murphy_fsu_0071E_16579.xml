   <abstract>The current study examined the impact of Big-Five personality traits, Perceived Person-Organization Fit, and Internship Satisfaction on Commitment to Teaching and Intention to Quit of pre-service teachers during their internship. The sample was comprised of 114 pre-service teachers who were completing their final semester-long internship of their combined five-year bachelor's/master's degrees in education. The current study had one theoretical foundation: the Theory of Work Adjustment (TWA). The Mini-Markers Scale (Saucier, 1994) was used to measure the Big-Five personality traits of interns while the Perceived Person-Organization (P-O) Fit Scale (Saks &amp; Ashforth, 1997) was used to match the fit between an intern and their internship organization. Internship Satisfaction was measured by the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire Short-Form (MSQ-SF; Weiss, Dawis, England, &amp; Lofquist, 1967), an instrument that was adapted to internships to measure Intrinsic, Extrinsic, and General Satisfaction. Lastly, Commitment to Teaching was measured by the Occupational Commitment to Teaching Scale (Klassen &amp; Chiu, 2011), and Intention to Quit was measured by the Intention to Quit Scale (Klassen &amp; Chiu, 2011). The first hierarchical multiple regression was performed to determine the significant predictors of Internship Satisfaction. Results indicated that Agreeableness, Openness, and Perceived P-O Fit were significant predictors of Internship Satisfaction. Perceived P-O Fit was found to be the best predictor of Internship Satisfaction, accounting for 41% of the change in variance. The Big-Five personality traits and P-O Fit accounted for 52% of the variance in Internship Satisfaction. A second hierarchical multiple regression was performed to determine significant predictors of Commitment to Teaching and Intention to Quit. Agreeableness was significantly associated with Commitment to Teaching, while Extraversion was significantly associated with both Commitment to Teaching and Intention to Quit. Perceived P-O Fit and Internship Satisfaction were both significant predictor of Commitment to Teaching and Intention to Quit. Additional analyses examined the correlations between the personality traits of Agreeableness and Openness with individual items of Internship Satisfaction. Also, an additional analysis identified the significant correlations between individual items of Internship Satisfaction and Commitment to Teaching/Intention to Quit. Open-ended comments were analyzed to provide a fuller explanation of quantitative data. Lastly, an additional analysis (independent t-test) was performed to determine if any significant differences existed between the means of variables from the Spring 2020 cohort to the Spring 2021 cohort. A discussion of the findings is given, followed by the study's limitations, and the implications for theory, practice, education and training, and research.</abstract>
