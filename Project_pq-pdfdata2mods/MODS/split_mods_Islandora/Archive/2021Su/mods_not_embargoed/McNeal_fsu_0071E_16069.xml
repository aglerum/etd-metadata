   <abstract>Findings from childhood abuse and maltreatment research have revealed that trauma exposure puts children at a greater risk for an array of negative health consequences. Specifically, a history of childhood maltreatment is associated with physical conditions in adulthood such as diabetes (Monnat &amp; Chandler, 2015), heart attacks (Monnat &amp; Chandler, 2015), and poor pregnancy outcomes (Smith, Gotman, &amp; Yonkers, 2016). It has also been linked to mental health difficulties such as depression and anxiety (Choi et al., 2017), as well as a higher number of suicide attempts (Dube et al., 2001). Less is known about the long-term repercussions of maltreatment on psychological well-being in adulthood (Greenfield &amp; Marks, 2010; Herrenkohl et al., 2012; Kong, 2018). Further, there are inconsistent findings regarding the role a victim's age at first exposure to maltreatment plays in the manifestation of psychological outcomes. Thus, the purpose of the current study was to explore the relations between childhood maltreatment, age at maltreatment onset, and psychological well-being in adulthood while controlling for socioeconomic status and perceived social support. A sample of 209 adult participants (ages 21 and older) were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). A correlational cross-sectional design was employed to investigate the following research questions: (1) Does childhood maltreatment predict psychological well-being in adulthood?, (2) Does age at maltreatment onset moderate the potential predicting relation between childhood maltreatment and psychological well-being in adulthood? and (3) Do the associations among childhood maltreatment, age at maltreatment onset, and psychological well-being in adulthood remain when controlling for socioeconomic status and perceived social support? Measures included the Comprehensive Childhood Maltreatment Scale (CCMS; Higgins &amp; McCabe, 2001), Ryff's Scales of Psychological Well-being (RPWB; Ryff &amp; Keyes, 1995), the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS; Zimet et al., 1988), and a series of maltreatment timing questions and demographic items developed for this study. Data were analyzed using hierarchical linear regression. Results from Analyses revealed that childhood maltreatment was a significant predictor of psychological well-being in adulthood (Research Question 1) but that age at maltreatment onset did not significantly moderate this relation (Research Question 2). Younger age at maltreatment onset was predictive of less psychological well-being when controlling for SES and social support, but remained a nonsignificant moderator of the relation between overall maltreatment and psychological well-being (Research Question 3). Exploratory analyses suggest that the role of age at maltreatment onset may differ dependent upon type of maltreatment experience, such that that a younger age at initial exposure to psychological abuse and neglect predicted less psychological well-being in adulthood. Implications for theory, clinical practice, and future research are discussed.</abstract>
