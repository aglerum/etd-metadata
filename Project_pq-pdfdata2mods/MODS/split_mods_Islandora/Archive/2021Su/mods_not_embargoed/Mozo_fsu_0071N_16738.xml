   <abstract>Medical doctors, physician assistants, and registered nurses are professions in high demand (AAMC, 2019; Gdiesing, 2019; Mercer, 2020). Yet, too few of these professionals are joining the workforce (Flier, 2018). One potential reason for this gap may stem from the rigor of healthcare curriculums, which potentially puts these students at risk for reduced well-being, in turn negatively impacting their success and retention. While literature has identified fostering community, encouraging engagement, and mitigating burnout and fatigue as factors positively associated with supporting student well-being, less is known about the healthcare student population. At the same time, higher education institutions have grown increasingly interested in informal learning environments. Research suggests that built environment elements can support student learning and engagement (Fisher, 2015; Laage, Thorpe, Wallace, &amp; Wu, 2019; Lanteigne, 2017). To improve healthcare student well-being, support the success and retention of healthcare students, and help mitigate the current healthcare worker shortage, this study used frameworks of subjective well-being to identify which supportive elements of the built environment were preferred by healthcare students within informal learning spaces. More specifically, it assessed their preferences for environmental features that foster community, course engagement, and reduce stress and fatigue. Data was collected via a survey instrument and online interviews. Findings confirm that healthcare students likely face significant stress from a variety of sources. Of the six categories on Ryff's Scale of Psychological Wellbeing, respondents scored lowest in autonomy. In terms of spatial preferences, participants selected spaces with features supporting dynamic collaboration and discussion to foster community. Interviews further revealed the importance of peer support to foster community, encourage engagement, and mitigate fatigue and burnout. When asked about engagement with course content, participant responses revealed a spectrum of preferences related to focused work. Student interviews provided more nuanced evidence pointing to specific needs relative to tasks. Taken together, these insights suggest the need for flexible, accommodating informal learning spaces that attend to the various needs of different students and their respective modes of study. Along with peer engagement, another emergent theme surrounded the need for change and choice, which are complemented by positive distractions and access to natural views and biophilic elements. These data were used to inform a hypothetical design solution for a higher education facility along with design guidelines. This work can be used to inform the design of informal learning spaces that support user well-being, provide higher education administrators and designers recommendations for the subsequent designs of higher education facilities, add to the existing body of knowledge related to well-being and the built environment, and, ultimately, support student well-being to improve success and retention outcomes.</abstract>
