   <abstract>Background: Iron-containing micronutrient powders may increase the risk and severity of enteric infections. Unabsorbed iron in the lower intestine may increase severity of infection by promoting the growth of gram-negative enteric pathogens. These findings indicate a need for alternative iron sources to correct or prevent iron deficiency without increasing the risk or severity of infection. Aspergillus oryzae (Ao) is a filamentous fungus that has the ability to accumulate large amounts of iron and store it in vacuoles. Thus, iron-enriched Ao may not be available to enteric pathogens. Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the effect of concentration and source of iron (FeSO₄ and FeSO₄-enriched Ao) on the growth and virulence of the gram-negative enteric pathogen, Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhimurium. Method: Salmonella was grown in media containing varying concentrations of iron as FeSO₄ (iron) or FeSO₄-enriched Ao (Ao iron) or media without iron (n=5/treatment). Growth curves were generated by measuring OD₆₀₀ every 15 minutes for 12 hours. Slides were prepared at 6.5 hr into incubation and videos were taken of sections of each slide (n=7 slides/treatment x 5 videos/slide). Bacterial tracking and analyses were performed using NIS-Element Analysis AR software. Slides were prepared using RYU Flagella Stain. Random sections of each slide (n=5/treatment) were photographed and analyzed using Fiji ImageJ software to measure flagella present. Data are presented as means ±SD. Results: Greater Salmonella growth was observed in bacteria grown in media containing iron compared to both no iron (P&lt;0.0001) and Ao iron (P&lt;0.0001). Area under the curve analysis demonstrated 44% and 37% greater growth in Salmonella grown in iron compared to no iron(P&lt;0.0001) and Ao iron (P&lt;0.0001) respectively. Salmonella grown in Ao iron showed 5% greater growth than Salmonella grown in no iron (P&lt;0.0001). Salmonella grown in iron were 98% faster than those grown in no iron (P&lt;0.0001) and 65% faster than those grown in Ao iron (P&lt;0.0001). The velocity of Salmonella grown in Ao did not differ from those grown in no iron (P=0.08). Salmonella grown with iron showed 84% and 46% greater acceleration than those grown in no iron or Ao iron respectively. Salmonella traveled 65% further when grown in iron compared to no iron (P=0.03) and Ao iron (P&lt;0.04). Flagella length did not differ between groups. Conclusions: Iron-enriched Ao attenuated the growth and motility of Salmonella compared to iron alone. These findings provide evidence that iron-enriched Ao may be a suitable alternative to correct iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia without increase in risk of severity of infection.</abstract>
