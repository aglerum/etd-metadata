   <abstract >Elite private institutions, renowned for their exceptional academic offerings and rigorous selection processes, attract top-tier students and faculty; however, exclusive private schooling has perpetuated social and economic disparities by granting unequal advantages to select groups, deepening educational gaps in society. This dissertation investigated the integration of social justice principles in the educational framework of an elite private Episcopal institution in a major Florida metropolitan area. Guided by the ethos of the U.S. Episcopal Church and its commitment to inclusivity and social justice, the study delved into how teachers at the study site navigated the implementation of social justice-oriented themes in their classrooms. Drawing upon critical theory, the research explored the challenges and approaches of seven selected teachers known for their dedication to social justice values. Through purposeful sampling and multiple data collection methods—including semistructured interviews, focus groups, classroom observations, and participant equity walkthroughs—the study elucidated the complexities and nuances of integrating social justice into classroom practices in an elite educational setting. Key research questions examined teachers' definitions, approaches, enactments, and negotiations of social justice, shedding light on the ways these principles are manifested and challenged in the school community. This single-case study offered an in-depth exploration, unraveling the intricate interplay between social justice values and educational practices in the context of an Episcopal school committed to fostering diversity, equity, and inclusion. Key findings suggested that some educators found their motivation in spiritual or religious themes, (a) emphasizing service and philanthropy as a way to give back to others, (b) drawing inspiration from various world religions, and (c) aligning efforts with the school's Christian mission. Conversely, another group expressed focus on promoting equality, catalyzing social transformation, and empowering marginalized voices by prioritizing systemic change over mere acts of service. Despite these differing perspectives on social justice, both groups acknowledged the privileged status of their students and described their aims to instill a sense of responsibility toward serving others, whether through direct assistance or empowerment. The participants viewed socially just classroom environments as inclusive spaces that fostered trust and belonging, where students could make mistakes, engage in critical analysis, and receive differentiated support. Conversely, educators also discussed facing challenges in implementing social justice principles due to Florida's social climate, lack of organizational mission alignment, and time constraints. Despite these obstacles, the research aimed to uncover the underlying causes of inequity by examining how teachers conceptualized and enacted social justice in their classrooms amid external pressures. The study identified three key themes: (a) the role of elite private Episcopal schools in perpetuating social reproduction and elitism, (b) the crucial role of teachers in fostering Episcopal values and social justice advocacy, and (c) the potential of the Episcopal identity to serve as a powerful force for promoting justice in various forms. Overall, the findings and recommendations provide guidance for elite Episcopal schools seeking to reaffirm their commitment to justice and equality, emphasizing the importance of instilling Christian values of democracy and egalitarianism while raising awareness of students' privileges and moral obligations to contribute to a fair society.</abstract>
