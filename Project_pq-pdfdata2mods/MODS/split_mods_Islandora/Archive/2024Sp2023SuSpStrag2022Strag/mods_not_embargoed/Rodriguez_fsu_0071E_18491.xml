   <abstract >Scholars Leonard &amp; Woodland (2022) suggest schools and districts face a crucial challenge. Are schools and districts ensuring their personnel are prepared to engage in critical practices to affirm, include, and support all students, families, peers, and communities? Or are schools and districts just haphazardly committing to diversity, equity, and inclusion statements to check a box? Current research lacks a focus on how K-12 educators make sense of, learn, and implement, as well as the challenges to implementing equity-centered, culturally responsive, and antiracist practices. Therefore, this exploratory case study sought to address this research gap by focusing on the experiences and perceptions of educators who participated in and graduated from the District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS) yearlong professional development program, Anti-Racist Educator University (ARE-U). Specifically, this study is interested in examining the processes of sensemaking, learning, implementation, and challenges of implementing concepts learned in ARE-U in their practice, as well as educators' perspectives on the program's effectiveness. This study was informed by four frameworks: sensemaking, critical race theory, intersectionality, and critical sensemaking. This study illuminates the narratives and perspectives of classroom educators who voluntarily decided to participate in a year-long equity-centered and antiracist professional development program to improve their practice. These critical perspectives are omitted in current research, but they provide insight into the effectiveness of current approaches in supporting educator learning. Moreover, through this study and its findings, stakeholders will gain an understanding of educator's experiences in equity-minded and antiracist programs from the perspective of these educators. Specifically, the process by which educators engage in meaning-making, their understanding of concepts in teaching and instruction, and challenges to implementation. ARE-U program organizers can use data from this study to evolve ARE-U to be more effective in supporting learning and implementation. This data can also challenge school and district leaders' resource allocation and decision-making approaches that negatively impact educators. This study also supports the value of programs like ARE-U in educator training regarding sensemaking of equity and antiracism. Despite some educators' inability to make explicit connections between ARE-U's content and its application to their teaching, all educators praised ARE-U as a first step in exploring how educators can address systemic inequities in their classrooms.
