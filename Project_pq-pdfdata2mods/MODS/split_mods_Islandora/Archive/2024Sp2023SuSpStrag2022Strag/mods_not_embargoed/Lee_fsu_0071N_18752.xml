   <abstract >As one of the most widely printed and read texts in the world, Dante Alighieri's Commedia has firmly established its place in the global literary canon. Written between 1308 and 1320, the Commedia quickly became a widely disseminated and studied text. The first lectura dantis, or public readings and accompanying lectures about the poem by the great Giovanni Boccaccio, were held mere years after Dante's death, and study of the poem has continued for the past 700 years. Its enduring cultural and linguistic value for the Italian people have solidified Dante as a godlike figure in Italian history. The study of diegetic sound and music in the poem, however, has largely been overlooked or ignored, with a few exceptions. This thesis contributes to scholarship on the music and sound in Dante's Commedia, responds to existing Dante scholars such as Francesco Ciabattoni and sound studies scholars such as R. Murray Schafer and Aim√©e Boutin, and offers a collection of my thoughts and interpretations on the subject. I argue that Dante crafted an intentional sonic design into the fabric of the poem, and that through analysis of the design we are able to learn more about both the poem and poet. Using the text as an archive of sonic memory that tells the reader significant and culturally relevant information about the city of Florence and its surrounding area in the Middle Ages, I seek to develop a new methodology through which word and music scholars may "listen in" to the past through literature. I also engage with protopsychomusicology and the affective power of music through the ears of Dante. Scenes such as the interaction with the musician Casella in Purgatorio 2 suggest the use of music in an intentionally comforting or healing manner. Although sparse and uncertain, in biographical accounts scholars speculate that Dante may have had epilepsy (or a similar condition), and through the poem I argue that he used music in a therapeutic manner to treat his own condition, similarly to modern medical music therapy. Finally, I look at the sonic remnants of the past in the poem and consider how Dante used audible memory to recall and relate to past literary voices and sought to establish a cultural epic through sonic memory. Dante adopted and adapted elements of epic throughout his work in order to secure his place in literary history, and through this I argue for the relevance of sound in this channel of study. Through this thesis I open avenues for future exploration of the sonic design of the Commedia and establish new ideas with which future Dante and sound studies scholars may approach this and other similar texts.</abstract>
