   <abstract >LGBTQ+ students exist on college campuses in greater numbers than ever before. Campus culture directly impacts how LGBTQ+ students experience college and contributes to their overall sense of belonging. Campus culture in turn is shaped by students' access to resources and the effectiveness of those resources. Students' experiences, for better or for worse, are shaped by the programming they have access to and the environment the college fosters through these programs. This dissertation in practice examines the relationship between LGBTQ+ students on Emerson College's campus and the resources they use. Utilizing an exploratory case study methodology including focus groups and campus observations, this research examines the following questions: What are the experiences of Emerson's LGBTQ+ students? How do Emerson's LGBTQ+ programs and policies meet the needs of LGBTQ+ students on campus? In what ways do Emerson's efforts enhance LGBTQ+ students' feelings of belonging? This study found that many organizations and campus spaces operate as queer by default due to the orientation of their members, shaping the way that students experience campus culture. As such, other motivators such as race, ethnicity, and background prior to coming to college influence the connections students seek on campus moreso than their LGBTQ+ identity. This study also found that LGBTQ+ students experienced belonging in both LGBTQ+ campus activities and non-LGBTQ+ campus activities, although students do feel a need for more specific LGBTQ+ programming reflective of community struggles. Lastly, findings indicated that students felt that administration and faculty have a major impact on the sense of belonging present on campus as well as the LGBTQ+ offerings of the college, and there is a need for both groups to better their efforts as students feel they are earnest but misguided. The findings of this study revealed multiple implications for practice. Most of all, sense of belonging on campus for LGBTQ+ students encompasses many components, all directly related to their base need for connection. This means their sense of community cannot be pinpointed on any one item being present, but rather on multiple factors that create genuine relationships with others. LGBTQ+ students on Emerson's campus experience that definition in unique ways unique to Emerson's campus environment â€“ perhaps most significantly, their sense of belonging being influenced greatly by being in the majority and attending a campus where they are able to interact with other LGBTQ+ students in a variety of settings, not just in specific organizations that cater to that population.</abstract>
