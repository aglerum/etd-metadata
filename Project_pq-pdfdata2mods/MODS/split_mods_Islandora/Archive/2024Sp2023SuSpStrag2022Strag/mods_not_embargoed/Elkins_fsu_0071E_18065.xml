   <abstract >In this dissertation, I discuss the ways in which a musical cue in a video game expresses a given gameplay context, or ludic function, within a game's overall design. My study focuses primarily on the soundtracks of games published circa 1980–1995, beginning at the point when music became a common feature of video games and ending with the rise of CD-ROM-based game machines, when the technological possibilities of streaming audio contributed to a fragmentation of musical style across the industry. I address the musical conventions of several common ludic functions in early video game music, describing the ways in which these conventions differ depending on a game's genre and setting. After a review of relevant literature in Chapter 1, I examine video game music derived from preexisting sources (e.g., films, television, and classic cartoons) in Chapter 2, describing the ways in which these compositions established many of the semiotic codes of early video game music. I begin by discussing arcade games from the latter half of the 1970s, which relied almost entirely on preexisting compositions to accompany the on-screen action. Then, I briefly address two game genres popular in early arcades—the maze game and the shoot 'em up—and the ways in which preexisting compositions from film and classic cartoons set stylistic precedents for particular ludic functions in original soundtracks later in the decade. In Chapter 3, I discuss the musical properties of the most common ludic functions found in action games of the 1980s and early 1990s. My discussion is divided into three sections based on when each ludic function occurs relative to the overall structure of a game: before gameplay begins (title screen cues, menu music, and cues immediately preceding gameplay), during the main part of the game (level background music, power-up cues, and music for boss battles), and after a segment of gameplay (victory music, death and game over cues, and music for ending and credits sequences). I consider the ways in which form, harmony, melodic contour, and other features are commonly connected with particular ludic functions. In Chapter 4, I focus on a single ludic function—level background music—and its varied musical realizations within a single game genre: the platformer. After an overview of the early history of the genre, I describe the musical conventions used to differentiate among several common location types in platformers: overworlds, underworlds, underwater and sky areas, islands, deserts, and icy/snowy areas. I then discuss common musical strategies for communicating a level's position within the overall game structure: heroic signifiers for opening levels, static and repetitive music for mid-game areas, and several harmonic schemata used to convey gravitas in the game's final stages. In Chapter 5, I discuss ludic function in Japanese role-playing games (JRPGs), a subgenre of role-playing game which descended from Western-developed titles but quickly developed its own unique set of musical conventions. I begin by summarizing the early history of role-playing games, both in the West and in Japan, and the musical conventions established by Koichi Sugiyama in the foundational 1986 JRPG Dragon Quest. Then, I discuss the ways in which different cue types convey the relative safety or danger in several environments and contexts—towns, castles, fields, dungeons, and battles—as well as the features of JRPG victory and game over music, which differ from their counterparts in action games. I conclude by describing instances in which these musical expectations are subverted to convey narrative information to the player.</abstract>
