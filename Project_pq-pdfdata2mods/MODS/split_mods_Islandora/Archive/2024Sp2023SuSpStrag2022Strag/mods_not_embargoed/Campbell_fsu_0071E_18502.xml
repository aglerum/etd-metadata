   <abstract >The field of speech language pathology has made continuous efforts to center cultural responsivity in clinical practice in order to adhere to systematic shifts aimed at centering equity for all individuals. However, it is necessary to examine how speech-language pathologists (SLPs) manage the demands of culturally responsive practice when assessing writing quality for students with diverse linguistic profiles; especially given the general requirements for written works to use "standard" English. As such, the present study sought to examine how narratives written by Black second grade students are rated by Black and White SLPs. Forty-two SLPs were presented with a total of four narratives written by two Black students in the second grade. One of the students had a linguistic profile more consistent with African American English dialect (Student A) and the other student had a linguistic profile more consistent with General American English (Student B). SLPs were provided with the Common Core writing standards for second grade and rated a personal and fictional narrative written by each of the students using a seven-point rating scale. SLPs also completed a demographic questionnaire to provide more information about their clinical background and previous experiences. Results found that Student B's fictional narrative was rated the highest, whereas Student A's personal narrative was rated the lowest. Comparative analyses were conducted to examine group differences based on SLPs' previous training experience, previous experience working with written language, years of experience and by the dialect the SLPs' reported speaking. None of the group differences yielded statistically significant results, except for SLPs who reported being bidialectal favoring Student B's personal narrative. Results from a two-level mixed effects model also found that the child's linguistic profile and the type of narrative told had a significant influence on the ratings, however, SLP race did not. Implications of these findings suggest the presence of a pervasive language ideology that upholds the notion of language standardization in writing. Continued work is needed to promote equitable practices that would address the presence of this ideology in writing, and to redefine ideals of "quality" so that they include speakers with diverse linguistic repertoires.</abstract>
