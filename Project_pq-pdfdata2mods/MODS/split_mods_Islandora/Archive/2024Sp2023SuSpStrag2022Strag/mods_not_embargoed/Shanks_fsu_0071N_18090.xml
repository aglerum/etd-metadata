   <abstract >The rising number of students with disabilities who identify as culturally and linguistically diverse (CLD) necessitates the use of culturally and linguistically responsive (CLR) instruction and related supports. Fourteen percent of English learners (ELs) have a disability (with disability as defined by Individual with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). School-based speech-language pathologists (SLPs) often support the communication needs of these students, especially for those students who are eligible for special education and related services as students with a speech or language impairment (S/LI). Characteristics of CLR practices may be reflected in a student's individualized education program (IEP). However, there is little prior research describing CLR considerations for this population in a school setting. A total of 40 individuals from 14 states, completed an online, 22-item survey to reflect their use of CLR practices in existing IEPs for ELs with speech or language impairments. Participants also rated how often they use various CLR features in therapy and assessments with students who are ELs. Respondents varied greatly in their use of CLR features within an IEP of EL child with a S/LI. Participants reported that they never provide materials/progress notes in the child's first language and never refer to use of child's first language within the IEP. In contrast, approximately half of respondents reported that they always engage in culturally relevant practices in therapy. Additionally, most SLPs reported that they always or sometimes collaborate with other professionals in the school setting. Participants indicated that they sometimes use CLR features in goals they write within an IEP for a child who is an EL. The present study provides unique insight on school-based SLPs' use of CLR practices. This offers implications for future training (i.e., ASHA seminars or school courses) and development of IEPs concerning the incorporation of CLR features and practices for children who are EL.</abstract>
