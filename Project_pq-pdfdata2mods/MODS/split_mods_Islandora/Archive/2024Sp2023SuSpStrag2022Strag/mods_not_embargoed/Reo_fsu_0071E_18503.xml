   <abstract >Intercollegiate athletics has become a business enterprise which exists and thrives on higher education campuses. As the growth of intercollegiate sport has continued, women have been noticeably absent from leadership roles in this extremely male-dominated profession. With the passage of Title IX there was hope and expectation that women would be considered and accepted on both the playing field and in leadership positions. While the playing field has shown significant advances with approximately 50% of student-athletes being female, leadership has severely lagged behind. Slow in the evolution of female athletic directors, it is important to explore the reasons why and determine if there are opportunities for change. Speaking with women in senior leadership roles at NCAA Division I FBS institutions provides information and ideas for supporting young women who aspire to be athletic directors and leaders in intercollegiate sports. Using this exploratory study through the narrative inquiry process, women who assisted in leading their departments at NCAA Division I FBS institutions which were classified at the time in autonomy conferences were interviewed on the professional development, opportunity, and mentorship throughout their careers. The information shared was thoughtful and insightful and provides an opportunity for young women and men to understand challenges faced and opportunities for change moving forward in assisting and guiding young women into leadership positions within these departments. The feedback from these accomplished women provides leaders at institutions of higher education, search firms, and hiring managers with details and background that may assist in overcoming unconscious bias. Culture in intercollegiate athletics must evolve and adapt to the quickly changing landscape of intercollegiate sport. Allowing thought leaders in the profession to remain white and male will inevitably stunt the advancement of collegiate athletics overall. Diversity in gender, as well as race, will provide different perspectives to assist in understanding challenges that are faced by those that strive to be leaders in this environment.</abstract>
