   <abstract >Background: As the coronavirus disease continues to spread around the world, millions are being impacted by societal changes and social distancing. When the majority of educational institutions closed campuses, college students were left vulnerable to developing difficulties as they were forced to adjust to these changes. They are already particularly vulnerable to sleep difficulties, which will increase further for those with other mental health problems. Hypothesis: Following school closure, college students will display an increase in sleep difficulties across sleep onset latency, subjective sleep quality, sleep quantity, daytime dysfunction, and disturbing dreams. This relationship will be strengthened in those who experience greater levels of stress, ruminative thinking patterns, or depressive symptoms. Changes to amount of light exposure due to increased screen use will account for a proportion of these difficulties. Methods: Secondary data analysis was done using self-report questionnaires administered across four time points, and a fifth time point was collected to further expand the data. Multiple regression analyses evaluated the hypotheses across the 100 individuals (mean age=19.45, 85% female) who completed measures both pre- and post- school closure. Repeated measures regression analysis was utilized across the 1201 individuals (mean age=19.43, 76.7% female) who completed measures solely during a single time point. Results: There was a significant decrease in sleep quality when looking across all five time points (F(1,1199)=12.49, p&lt;.001), although sleep quality initially did not change from pre-pandemic to the first time point. Worry about COVID-19 was the primary mediator of worsened sleep quality across studies (F(1,94)=4.66, p=.033 and F(1,370)=48.64, p&lt;.001 respectively), although mental health difficulties were not consistent moderators. Screen use changes was only significant within study two (F(1,518)=357.58, p&lt;.001). Conclusion: These findings help further explain the consequences of COVID-19 stay-at-home orders upon college students. Sleep quality worsened as the pandemic and social distancing measures continued. Those who viewed the pandemic as more of a threat and experienced more worry about it in particular were vulnerable to developing sleep problems, particularly if they were engaging in more social distancing measures. Additionally increased screen use, particularly in relation to having virtual classes, decreased sleep quality. Beyond the role of light exposure and mental health difficulties, beliefs about COVID-19 were a primary determinant of sleep quality changes in college students.</abstract>
