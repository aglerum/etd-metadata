   <abstract >Charles Stuart returned to his native country after fourteen years in exile. His subjects had just endured eleven years of military dictatorship under Oliver Cromwell and wanted a return to the days of monarchy. On 25 May 1660, Charles II landed in Dover and was warmly greeted by his people and the leader of the army, George Monck. They set off for London and arrived on 29 May, Charles II's thirtieth birthday. Escorting Charles into London were his Life Guards, a professional military cavalry force of Royalist supporters who followed their king into exile. Having witnessed his father's failure to keep his crown because he lacked a loyal bodyguard and seeing first-hand how a devoted household helped his cousin Louis XIV maintain his kingdom, Charles II had every intention of keeping these guards throughout his reign. The challenge was that Charles had promised to disband the military, which had become very unpopular in England and was viewed as a tool of tyranny and absolute rule. This dissertation deals with the challenges Charles II and his brother James II faced in keeping a loyal guard about them in a country that genuinely feared the institution of a standing army. The first four Stuart monarchs stubbornly believed in the Divine Right of Kings and sought to rule by the Royal Prerogative. How they wielded arbitrary powers in an era where Parliament wanted more to say in declaring laws and charting a direction for the country was challenging, and all four dealt with it differently. At the root of these challenges was how money was collected to fund wars and build armies. The Stuart kings could rule without Parliament but not raise taxes to pay for expensive armies to conduct military campaigns. For this, they had to call Parliament, and Parliament was all too aware of their growing power to the point that they used these episodes to demand more say. In this complicated world, Charles II and James II could not rule as absolutists without the Life Guards who formed the nucleus of England's standing army.</abstract>
