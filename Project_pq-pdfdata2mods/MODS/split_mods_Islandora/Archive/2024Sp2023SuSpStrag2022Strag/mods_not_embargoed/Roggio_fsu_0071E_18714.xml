   <abstract >This treatise examines the Violin Concerto, op. 224 (1955) by American composer Mana-Zucca (1885-1981). A highly regarded musician during her lifetime, Mana-Zucca maintained successful and simultaneous careers as a virtuoso pianist and a singer and performer in operettas and musical comedies. As a composer with a catalogue of 1,100 compositions, she dominated the popular music scene in the early- to mid-twentieth century with her melodious songs, including "I Love Life" (1923), which launched her into the national spotlight. Mana-Zucca's legacy has been inextricably tied to this song and her role as a popular composer, but she was also an accomplished composer of instrumental concert music. Primary sources illuminate the Violin Concerto as a compositional undertaking that was especially significant to her, in part as a demonstration of her legitimacy as a serious composer. Despite her perseverance and optimism, the concerto, like many of her works, as well as those of other women composers, has been largely overlooked since her death in both literature and concert programming. The Violin Concerto can be heard as a reflection and culmination of her robust musical pursuits. Its kaleidoscopic style and structure incorporate characteristics of romanticism, classicism, and modernism, as well as the intimate style of salon music and the dramatic expressiveness of opera. Mana-Zucca positioned herself not only within a concert culture network but also at the center of a vibrant salon culture, which she cultivated through the fun, accessible nature of popular music and the value she placed on music as a force for building connection and community. Although the Concerto reflects a push to treat her compositional voice in a serious manner, this "professional salon piece" also reveals how a complex, virtuosic work for solo and orchestra can capture the appeal and charisma of "light music." This treatise is an invitation to reexamine Mana-Zucca's legacy through the lens of her Violin Concerto. By providing a historical and stylistic analysis, I contextualize Mana-Zucca's style within the broad stylistic trends of twentieth-century American music. The work itself provides a way to understand Mana-Zucca's impact on her musical network and reflects not only a stylistic synthesis but also her all-encompassing pursuit of life as a musician, composer, collaborator, and community leader.</abstract>
