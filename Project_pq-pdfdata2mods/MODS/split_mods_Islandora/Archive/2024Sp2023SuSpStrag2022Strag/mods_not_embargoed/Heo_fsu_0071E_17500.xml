   <abstract >The relationships between perfectionism and depression have been widely studied among college students (Smith et al., 2020). Research has explained their relationships by suggesting different mediating variables in cognitive, social, and behavioral contexts, specifically based on the Perfectionism Social Disconnection model (PSDM; Hewitt et al., 2006) and the Existential Model of Perfectionism and Depressive Symptoms (EMPDS; Graham et al., 2010). However, research has not examined the simultaneous effects of cognitive, social, and behavioral variables on the relationships between perfectionism and depressive symptoms with consideration of multidimensionality of perfectionism. The multidimensionality of perfectionism can be explained with perfectionistic strivings, narcissistic perfectionism, and perfectionistic concerns. The lack of an integrated model of perfectionism and depressive symptoms have engendered some limitations in comprehending multidimensional perfectionism and depressive symptoms. The limitations include: 1) the unique/conjoint effects of each perfectionism factor were not fully examined and 2) the relative strengths of mediators or their relationships were unclear in the perfectionism-depressive symptoms model. The purpose of this study is to investigate the integrated model of perfectionism and depressive symptoms through a cognitive, social, and behavioral lens by focusing on the three variables representing each domain: perceived life discrepancy, lack of social belongingness, and self-concealment. A total of 346 college students aged from 18 to 34 were recruited from a southeastern university and were used for the current study. The sample was composed of 73.9% female (N = 255), 23.4% male (N = 81), and 2.0% others (N = 7). The sample included 65.3% (non-Hispanic) White (N = 226), 12.1% Hispanic (N = 42), 4.3% (non-Hispanic) Black (N = 15), 2.9% Asian (N = 10), 0.9% Middle Eastern (N = 3), and 13.6% Bi/multiracial (N = 47). The sample consisted of 79.5% of students identified as heterosexual (N = 275), while 15.9% identified as LGBQ (N = 55). The sample also contained 2.3% international students (N = 8) and 20.2% students (N = 70) who identified themselves as a first generation in college. The sample spread from freshman to graduate students (8.4% freshman; 23.4% sophomore, 28.9% junior, 28.9% senior +, and 10.4% graduate). A cross-sectional design was used to test the integrated model of perfectionism and depressive symptoms and estimate path coefficients and mediation effects in the model. This research focused on three research questions: 1) Do three factors of multidimensional perfectionism - perfectionistic strivings, perfectionistic concerns, and narcissistic perfectionism - significantly predict depressive symptoms? 2) Do perceived life discrepancy, lack of social belongingness, and self-concealment mediate the relationship between the three perfectionism factors and depressive symptoms, controlling for other perfectionism factors and GPA (integrated parallel mediation model)? and 3) Does self-concealment additionally mediate the relationship between perceived life discrepancy and depressive symptoms and between lack of social belongingness and depressive symptoms in the parallel mediation model in research question 2 (integrated serial mediation model)? GPA was considered as a covariate to control its consistent relationships with perfectionism and depressive symptoms among college students (Huang, 2015; Madigan, 2019; SÃ¶rberg Wallin et al., 2019). Research found that perfectionistic strivings, perfectionistic concerns, and narcissistic perfectionism impacted depressive symptoms separately (research question 1). However, only perfectionistic concerns predicted depressive symptoms when the other perfectionism factors and GPA were controlled for. After the integrated model was established, the model presented several significant parallel and serial mediation effects. Research found that perfectionistic concerns impacted depressive symptoms simultaneously through perceived life discrepancy, lack of social belongingness, and self-concealment in the parallel mediation model, in addition to its direct influence on depressive symptoms. Although perfectionistic strivings and narcissistic perfectionism did not impact depressive symptoms directly, they impacted depressive symptoms through lack of social belongingness. Self-concealment did not mediate the relationship of the two perfectionism factors with depressive symptoms. Perceived life discrepancy did not mediate narcissistic perfectionism and depressive symptoms but showed a tendency to mediate perfectionistic strivings and depressive symptoms (research questions 2). However, with the inclusion of serial mediation effects of self-concealment between the other mediators and depressive symptoms (the serial mediation model), self-concealment did not directly mediate the relationship between perfectionistic concerns and depressive symptoms unlike the result in the parallel mediation model in research question 2. Instead, perfectionistic concerns impacted depressive symptoms through lack of social belongingness and self-concealment in sequence. Narcissistic perfectionism and perfectionistic strivings also showed a tendency to influence depressive symptoms through the path from perfectionism, lack of social belongingness, self-concealment, and depressive symptoms (research question 3). Surprisingly, unlike the other two perfectionism factors, perfectionistic strivings played a unique role in decreasing lack of social belongingness or perceived life discrepancy, which later impacted reducing depressive symptoms under the circumstance where GPA and the other two perfectionism factors were controlled for. Among the three mediators, lack of social belongingness functions as a stronger mediator than the other mediators consistently across perfectionism factors. The study implications and limitations of this study were discussed.</abstract>
