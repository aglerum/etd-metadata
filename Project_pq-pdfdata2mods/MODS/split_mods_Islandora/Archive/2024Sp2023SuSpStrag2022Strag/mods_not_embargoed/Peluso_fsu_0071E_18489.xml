   <abstract >As governments and other organizations worldwide increase their investment in research, the demand for skilled research administrators grows. Researchers need knowledgeable administrators to provide guidance and ensure their projects are administratively managed according to required policies and guidelines. Institutions must ensure their audit risk is managed appropriately without creating unnecessary burdens and hardships for their researchers. With a lack of academic programs in research administration, most research administration professionals enter the field with limited to no understanding of research administration. The need for research administration training programs is high. To address Florida State University's (FSU) needs in this area, the Office of the Vice President for Research (OVPR) staff developed and implemented a research administration certification program. All FSU research administrators must complete the eSPEAR Research Administration Certification Program within six months of starting their position. Florida State University (FSU) has invested staff time and other resources into developing and delivering this program. FSU wishes to evaluate the value provided to FSU's research community by eSPEAR and identify where changes or expansion would bring value. While FSU's OVPR requests feedback from participants following the training, this provides only a snapshot of the learner's experience immediately following the completion of the program. No industry-accepted method for evaluating research administration training programs exists. Kirkpatrick's Four Levels of Evaluation, which looks at learner satisfaction, learning, behavior, and return on expectations, provides a model that could potentially fill this void. This study uses Kirkpatrick's Four Levels of Evaluation to evaluate FSU's eSPEAR Program. Information was gathered from learners who completed the training, their supervisors, the researchers they support, those involved in developing eSPEAR, and members of FSU's Council of Associate Deans for Research (CADR). Overall, favorable feedback was received from learners and their supervisors. The response rate from researchers, CADR members, and those involved in developing eSPEAR was lower. Their responses were broad, with some highly favorable and others unfavorable. Many respondents answered with neutral answers, mainly due to their lack of direct knowledge. The study results provided insights into what works well with the program and where additional content, or further training development is needed.</abstract>
