   <abstract >In Dragon Year, the speaker explores their emerging queer and polyamorous identity amidst one failing relationship and another burgeoning one. At its core, this is a story of ode and elegy. The speaker looks back at the people and places who have made and unmade them. In the pain of rebirth, the speaker thinks often of death, including the suicide of a personal idol, YouTube gamer Desmond "Etika" Amofah. Indeed, video games recur throughout the work, demonstrating that digital landscapes and characters have also played a large role in the speaker's navigation of self. The poems are organized around four sections. The first introduces the speaker's current situation in media res; the second delves into the past and early formative situations; the third is a sort of quiet climax, a dark night; and the fourth is an emergence into a jubilant yet unsure future. Like Frank O'Hara suggests in his famous manifesto "Personism," these poems take place between people. Some of the poems deal explicitly with romantic love, especially potential love lost, as in "Applebee's," where the speaker admits, "I love you, and you know / though I've never said it, / and you don't love me, though we sit close / and talk a secret language." Other poems play out more of a family drama, such as "On the Plain of Dura in the Province of Delaware" and "Self-Portrait with Oathkeeper &amp; Oblivion," in which the speaker laments their inability to protect their younger sister from their parents' divorce deep in the past. Formally, I strike a wide range throughout this book. Though most of the poems count as free verse, I employ a contemporary take on several traditional forms, such as the sonnet (e.g. "Winter Lights: Three Scenes"), the pantoum (e.g. "Blue Gucci"), the blazon (e.g. "Blazon featuring Zelda Mixtape &amp; Coconut Oil"), the ode (e.g. "Ode to Just Dance, Lindy Hop, &amp; The Great Gatsby"), and the contrapuntal (e.g. "At Least Spiritually"). I also experiment with forms that carry syntax along paratactically such that the entire poem is one sentence (e.g. "Lights Out Ode"). Spirituality is an important undercurrent in this book. I've been Catholic my whole life, and that provides some consistent tension in my navigation of queerness and other complex contemporary topics. Many poems in this book demonstrate a wrestling with faith—a refusal to give in and also a refusal to give it up (e.g. "Ode to Boudin, Hurricanes, &amp; Street Performers"). In comparison to other books or the poetry market, I'd say this book owes a debt to Christian Wiman, whose works such as Every Riven Thing or Once in the West demonstrate a tense relationship with faith, a holding on even as the speaker fights back. Wiman's work, like mine, also demonstrates a deep commitment to tight, intentional form and strong musicality, though Wiman's musicality is even more pronounced than mine. I would also consider my narrative style in the lineage of Barbara Hamby and David Kirby. I expect this book would appeal to readers of poetry who are interested in queer spirituality and in poetry books that can strike a wide variety of forms, from the compressed lyric to the syntactically-expansive narrative. Though the book's final section attempts some sense of acceptance and closure, even then the speaker is just on the brink of returning to the beginning of pain again. In the final poem, "Traverse Town," during a game of mini-golf, they conclude, "I'm so color drunk I'd almost say it's / enough: tonight let's not play therapy, / pack boxes, reach for each other's bodies. / I'll birdie the next one—betcha / an ice cream. You say, let's fucking go."</abstract>
