   <abstract >Until the past few decades, criminological research has almost exclusively focused on examining the link between various environmental risk factors and criminal behavior. Since then, an emerging body of research has developed exploring the association between different antisocial traits and offending. The culmination of this research has revealed personality constructs such as low self-control, impulsiveness, aggressiveness, sensation seeking, and Machiavellianism, among others to be positively associated with greater criminal behaviors. However, this area of research, also known as propensity-based studies of offending, remains incomplete. The criminological literature has largely overlooked the potential explanatory power of callous-unemotional traits when attempting to identify the diverse factors that predict assorted offending patterns, including chronic levels of offending. To be certain, research in developmental psychology has linked these traits to a host of negative life outcomes typically found within criminological studies, including offending. And yet, research in the developmental literature has yet to uncover why, and under what conditions, this link exists as well as how this association changes based on the variant of callous-unemotional traits being examined. Likewise, research examining the etiology of callous-unemotional traits has many gaps in the literature particularly concerning male-female differences as well as discerning what environmental risk factors explain such development. This dissertation will address these gaps in the literature by examining potential pathways to the development of both variants of callous-unemotional traits as well as associations between the variants and various offending measures (i.e., general, nonviolent, violent, life-course-persistent offending, and illicit drug use). The results revealed that the etiology of both variants of callous-unemotional traits is dependent upon the sex of the individual. Additionally, the environmental factors that predicted callous-unemotional traits were different based on the variant being investigated. The models examining the callous-unemotional traits-crime link likewise found that the association differed based on the variant as well as the sex of the individual. The results of these analyses also find support for the link being nonlinear and partially due to a shared genetic etiology. The implications of these findings are discussed in reference to policy, theory, and future research.</abstract>
