   <abstract >The shipping industry is one of the significant sources of pollution and global warming. About 2.5% of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions in 2018 came from the shipping industry. Conventional tugboats are viewed as one of the contributors towards the overall amount of emissions produced from maritime transportation. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) estimates that tugboats account for 2% of global shipping emissions, including nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), and particulate matter (PM). Electric tugboats could be a promising alternative to these issues because they don't emit any harmful gases. Furthermore, electric tugboats do not produce as much noise as conventional tugboats. However, certain aspects should be carefully considered before the wide deployment of electric tugboats would be feasible, including financial viability of using electric tugboats, impacts on society, legal framework for using electric tugboats, and the overall practicality of deploying electric tugboats. This research mainly focuses on a comprehensive assessment of advantages and disadvantages from electric tugboat deployment in maritime transportation. First, all the basic background information associated with the development and deployment of electric tugboats is reviewed in detail. Second, a thorough literature review is conducted focusing on different aspects, including safety issues associated with tugboats, tugboat scheduling, electric tugboats versus conventional tugboats, environmental issues, salvage tugboats and other types of tugboats. Third, a comprehensive evaluation of electric tugboats is performed based on all the information acquired along with the interviews that were performed with the leading experts in the tugboat industry. Last but not least, the financial viability and economic performance of electric tugboats using econometric techniques is assessed as a part of this thesis research as well. Electric tugboats consistently demonstrate a greater initial capital outlay, although offer substantially reduced ongoing operational expenses owing to their enhanced efficiency and diminished maintenance needs. Consequently, they emerge as the most economically appealing alternative for long-term planning. On the other hand, conventional tugboats may seem more economically advantageous in the short term, but they ultimately accumulate significantly more expenses over time, especially in the face of increasing annual costs (e.g., unexpected increase in the cost of diesel fuel, unexpected increase in maintenance costs). Hybrid tugboats present a viable compromise, exhibiting certain cost benefits in comparison to the conventional and electric tugboat options. Therefore, the existing obstacles related to electric tugboat deployment have to be further investigated and addressed in the following years. The conducted research would be of essence to researchers and industry practitioners and can serve as a valuable reference for the relevant future studies.</abstract>
