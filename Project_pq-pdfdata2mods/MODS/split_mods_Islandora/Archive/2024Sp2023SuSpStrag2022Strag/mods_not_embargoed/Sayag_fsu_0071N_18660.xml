   <abstract >Emotional experiences and expressions are integral parts of sports. Emotions in sports were commonly examined on the individual level. From an interpersonal perspective, the EASI model (Van Kleef, 2009) describes emotions as signals sent to the environment. When perceived by others, emotional signals provide information about the person expressing the emotion and about the environment. Previous research also examined interpersonal emotional processes in naturalistic and experimental designs. Specifically, the process of emotional convergence was documented in soccer penalty kick shootouts. This current study examined the influence of viewing teammate's performance outcome (i.e., IV1) and post-performance emotional expressions of pride or shame (i.e., IV2) on participant's (i.e., perceiver) pre-performance emotional state and subsequent performance. An on-the-field between-participants experimental design was conducted, in which previous penalty kick viewing was manipulated using a pre-recorded Virtual Reality video. Participants (N = 93) viewed one of six experimental condition videos, reported their emotional state and related cognitions, and shot a penalty for their team's common goal. Results indicated no significant differences between groups in pre-performance emotional states, although a non-significant trend in anxiety was observed. The data revealed that perceived emotions were significantly influenced by the observed performance outcome, regardless of the emotional expression. Subsequent performance was significantly affected by previous penalty outcome, and a trend regarding the emotional expression appeared in the data. The results of the study are discussed within the elements of the EASI model (Van Kleef, 2009) and other relevant literature (e.g., context and perceived emotions, ironic processing). Plausible explanations for lack of consistency with previous literature are offered. Future research is encouraged to examine interpersonal emotional processes (e.g., emotional convergence) in advanced experimental designs such as using new technologies, as well as in naturalistic settings. Further, we recommend that athletes develop effective emotion regulation strategies to mitigate the potential negative effects of negative (e.g., shame) emotional expressions on individual and team performance.</abstract>
