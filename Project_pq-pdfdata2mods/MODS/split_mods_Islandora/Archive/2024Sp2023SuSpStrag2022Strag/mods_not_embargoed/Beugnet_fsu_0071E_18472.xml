   <abstract >With just 43% of community college students graduating within six years (Causey et al., 2022b), low graduation rates have been the defining, animating issue for community colleges for over a decade (Cutler &amp; White, 2022). Concurrently, high-impact practices (HIPs) have proven enormously successful in improving student outcomes at higher education institutions throughout the country (Hu et al., 2008; Kilgo et al., 2015; McDaniel &amp; Van Jura, 2022). Undergraduate research (UR) is an especially impactful HIP, with prior studies showing increases in academic performance, retention, graduation rates, and self-efficacy (Crews, 2013; Henkel, 2006; Linn et al., 2015). More importantly, UR has shown promise in improving outcomes for traditionally underrepresented minority students, who make up much of community college enrollment nationwide (Awong-Taylor et al., 2016; Milem, 2005; Santos &amp; Reigadas, 2004). Yet in spite of these impressive outcomes, UR remains rare at community colleges. A small number of institutions, however, have implemented UR successfully (Awong-Taylor et al., 2016; Hensel, 2021; Nerio et al., 2019), but few studies have examined how and why these programs have grown to become so successful within the unique context of the American community college. This qualitative multiple case study sought to fill that gap, exploring the implementation processes of highly successful UR programs at three geographically diverse community colleges, one located in a large city in the Northeast, one in a suburban community in the Pacific Northwest, and one in a rural community in the Great Lakes region. Data were drawn from interviews with faculty and administrators involved in the implementation of each institution's UR program, as well as from analysis of program documents, such as internal reports, labor contracts, and marketing materials. Findings indicated that national organizations provided critical support to these three community colleges as they implemented UR. Additionally, it was found that two UR models, course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) and community-based undergraduate research (CBUR) dominated all three institutions' UR implementations. And findings indicated that these three institutions sustained their UR programs through a combination of faculty-led administration of the programs, support from system-level administrators, and strategies aimed at managing the costs of UR in the specific context of the community college.</abstract>
