   <abstract >This qualitative case study, which took place at Ringling College of Art and Design, explores the experiences of students in on-campus where emotional support animals (ESAs) are present. With rising disability diagnoses on college campuses and an increasing number of requests for students to be allowed to keep an emotional support animal, it is important to examine their impact on the living experiences of students who share living spaces. Between June and August of 2023, a convenience sample of returners and first-time college students at Ringling College of Art and Design were contacted about completing the study, which consisted of 56 students. Out of the 56 students, 12 students decided to complete semi-structured interviews about what they knew about ESAs, their personal experiences, and their thoughts on how living on campus with an ESA was beneficial or not. The researcher aimed to address the broader question of "How does the presence of an emotional support animal influence the experience of the roommate or suitemates in on campus housing?" through questions related to participant's knowledge of the roles of ESAs, their experiences with ESAs, and their personal beliefs of the benefits and downfalls of the animal in on-campus housing. Findings showed participants without their own ESA varied in their knowledge of ESA policy and procedures. Despite no personal experience regarding ESA approval and accommodation on campuses, participants offered their opinions about the roles of ESAs along with a lack of knowledge related to the application process and possible misinformation about the specifications of an ESA. Participants reported good experiences with the owners of ESAs, indicating the potential for community-building and for mature relationships to address problems arising from the presence of an ESA. Self-mediation and communication practices among suitemates were reported, demonstrating a collective willingness to implement potential solutions to the animal's presence. Finally, roommates assessed living with ESAs as mainly positive, contributing to their emotional wellbeing and to positive relationships among residents. Some respondents were able to identify advantages like being able to self-soothe during stressful or depressive episodes, or shared happy moments with the ESA, but there were also ongoing criticisms of existing policies, specifically regarding the number and types of animals and their movement. The findings of the study offer translatable lessons on how to better disseminate information about ESAs, about how to foster community-building efforts, and about how to increase communication and outreach between residents. Among these, certain suggestions might include developing targeted educational sessions, enhancing avenues of knowledge dissemination, and perhaps even rethinking or amending ESA rules so as to cultivate more close-knit and supportive campuses. The findings address many important knowledge gaps, ensure compliance with federal law and campus policies, and encourage community. With appropriate college and university policies, guidelines and supports in place, uncertainty surrounding the rights of ESAs in on-campus housing complexities can be resolved, ensuring institutions may provide greater continuity of care for students experiencing mental illness and create campuses that are friendly for both students and ESAs.</abstract>
