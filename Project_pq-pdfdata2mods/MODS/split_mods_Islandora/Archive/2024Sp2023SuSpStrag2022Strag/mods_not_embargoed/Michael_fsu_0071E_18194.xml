   <abstract >Physical pain is a gendered experience: Women report higher levels of it than do men. This pattern may stem from differences in experiences of the body. Women are socialized to be attentive to its functioning, appearance, and sensations, while men are discouraged from paying much attention to their bodies. Little is known, however, about the precise social and economic pathways leading to gender differences in pain, especially in middle and later life when pain is most prevalent. I examine this issue using data from two waves of Midlife in the United States (2004-2006 and 2013-2014). I consider four possible explanations for gender differences in reports of pain: economic security, health, relationship strain, and stress exposure. Results indicated that women are more likely than men to report experiencing chronic pain and that three out of four explanations contributed to explaining this gender difference. Two of the explanations, however, played more substantial roles than the others. These conclusions held in both the cross-sectional and panel analyses. Results indicated that women's worse physical and mental health and their lower economic security played the largest roles in accounting for the association between gender and pain. Women's greater relationship strain, particularly in their partner and family relationships, also contributed to the explanation, but its role was more limited. Stress exposure was the only potential mediator that failed to contribute to explaining the association between gender and pain. This result derived from the observation that men, rather than women, experienced greater exposure to stressful events. This research responds to the call for more sociological research on chronic pain (Wood and Bourke 2020). More specifically, it adds to the literature on gender and pain by clarifying the processes underlying this well-documented association. The results of this study point to the role of macro-level social factors, especially socioeconomic inequality, in generating women's greater experience of chronic pain. They also reveal the central role that is played by women's worse physical and mental health, which can be viewed as another consequence of socioeconomic inequality. These results have important implications not only for research on pain but also for interventions aimed at reducing gender disparities in pain. The processes revealed in this study could be further clarified by research that uses multiple waves of data to examine changes in pain as well as potential mediators over time.</abstract>
