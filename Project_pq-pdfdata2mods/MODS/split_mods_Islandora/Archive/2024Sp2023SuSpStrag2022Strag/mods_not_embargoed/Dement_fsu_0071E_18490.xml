   <abstract >With the current priorities and challenges surrounding equity in higher education, many institutions are looking for new resources to support diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) goals at their institutions. One resource that has been shown to be underutilized across social justice development in higher education are peer leaders. While some institutions may have peer leader groups that specialize in supporting social justice initiatives, peer leaders, unless it's their primary function, are not being trained on social justice or utilized at most institutions of higher education to support social justice development. However, peer leaders have been found to be very impactful on the development and experience of their peers throughout college, but because peer leaders are not exploring social justice in training, it limits their ability to support their peers in the topic. Throughout this, a qualitative exploratory study is explored that was facilitated with peer leaders at Stetson University to understand how peer leaders serve as socially just leaders within a campus community and what support institutions can provide to develop peer leaders to serve as socially just leaders. Individual interviews and focus group interviews were conducted to gain perspective from peer leaders, their understanding of leadership and social justice, their application of socially just leadership, and areas of support they looked for from the institution. The culturally relevant leadership learning model served as the theoretical framework for this study which supported the development of interview questions, analysis of data, and development of recommendations from the study. Research within this study found common trends from the peer leaders in the ways in which they supported their peers as socially just leaders through common themes and sub-themes. And the study also found commons trends in the ways in which the peer leaders were looking for further support from the university to be socially just leaders. Results in the study suggest that peer leaders, no matter the focus of their peer leader role, have the ability to serve as socially just leaders and peer leaders are looking for support from their institutions to help them in serving as socially just leaders in their peer leader roles. Results also breakdown different ways in which peer leaders are serving as socially just leaders within the campus community.</abstract>
