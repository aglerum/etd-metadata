   <abstract >The Sullivan Report (The Sullivan Commission on Diversity in the Healthcare Workforce, 2004) identified the lack of racial diversity among health care practitioners as a major issue. This report points out that, while the U.S. population has continued to become more diverse, the composition of health care workers has not kept pace with these changes. Emergency Medical Services (EMS) workers provide advanced medical care to patients in the prehospital environment. Nationally, 11.6% of the entire workforce is African American, and 16.1% are Hispanic. Within the EMS field, African Americans represent only 6% of workers, and Hispanics represent 10.6% (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2017). One possible impediment to minorities entering the EMS workforce may involve the admissions practices of post-secondary institutions offering EMS programs (Health Resources and Services Administration [HRSA], 2017). This study examined the admissions practices of Florida college-based paramedic programs to determine what they currently are and how decisions about these requirements are made. This study used a document analysis of Florida college-based paramedic program websites to determine what current admissions requirements are in place for these programs, as well as interviews with the program managers of 11 of the 25 Florida college-based paramedic programs, to determine how decisions are made about which instruments are used and how they are used in admissions processes. The study found that these programs used a variety of qualitative and quantitative instruments in their admissions processes as well as several different methods of selecting students based on these instruments. Interviews with program managers revealed that their decision-making processes were influenced by a desire to meet several goals, including selecting students they felt would successfully complete their programs, pass licensing exams, and perform as competent clinicians. They also incorporated influences from accreditors, government regulators, and employers of their graduates in their decision-making processes. Program directors relied mostly on anecdotal evidence to make these decisions, and diversity considerations did not play a meaningful part in their decision-making processes. Accreditors and regulators should provide guidance for these decision makers in this area, and research should be conducted to assess the validity of common instruments and selection processes and their effect on the diversity of these training programs. â€ƒ</abstract>
