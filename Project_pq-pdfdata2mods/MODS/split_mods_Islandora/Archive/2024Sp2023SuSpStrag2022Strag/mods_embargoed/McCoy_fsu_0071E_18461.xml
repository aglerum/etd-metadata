   <abstract >Community colleges provide access to higher education for a wide range of prospective students with diverse interests and educational goals. With more than 60 percent of incoming community college students deemed as academically underprepared for college-level work, traditionally, students have been required to enroll in one semester or more of developmental coursework before beginning college-level classes. Several studies demonstrate traditional remedial education models seldom increase students' skills and contribute towards success in outcomes such as persistence, passage of gateway courses, or credential completion (Bailey &amp; Phillips, 2016; Goudas &amp; Boylan, 2013; Jaggars &amp; Bickerstaff; 2018). Recent developmental education reform efforts include models that have proven to be successful in accelerating the time it takes for students to successfully matriculate through developmental coursework (Edgecombe et al., 2013; Jaggars &amp; Stacey, 2014). These reform models include options for students to enroll directly in college-level courses simultaneously with support courses as with corequisite courses, curricula changes and interventions which consolidate multiple standalone courses into one single semester as with compressed courses, intensive advising policies, and alternatives to traditional placement assessments which result in a higher likelihood of placement accuracy and success in college-level coursework. Overwhelmingly, studies examining the outcomes of students who participate in developmental reform models have found benefits relative to traditional developmental models, however, these studies largely consider the effects of one type of developmental model or the presence or lack thereof of any type of developmental policy (Bahr et al., 2019; Barbitta &amp; Munn 2018; Cho et al., 2012; Jaggars et al., 2013; Ran &amp; Lin, 2019). Additionally, many studies have failed to examine whether certain types of developmental policies are more effective than others and if this differs based on gender and race/ethnicity. With states adopting varying developmental education reform policies to improve student progression into college-level coursework and beyond, this study examined how recent state modifications to placement policies, compressed/corequisite modalities, or changes to advising/academic planning have affected student persistence trends. Using a modified version of Wang's theoretical model of momentum for community college student success, I conceptualized developmental reform policies based on how they may function to contribute towards the momentum of students, and therefore, outcomes such as first-year retention and graduation rates. Drawing data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, this study used a difference-in-differences approach between the years of 2012 to 2020 to observe student success outcomes before and after implementation of developmental education policy reform models, while comparing outcomes among non-adopting states. This study considered how developmental reform policies in a national context contribute to academic momentum and student success outcomes such as persistence and completion. Results in the aggregate provide evidence that the presence of developmental education reform policies in states increase institutional retention and completion rates more so than institutions within states that do not adopt reform policies. Additionally, when disaggregating results by type of developmental education reform policy, there are no differential impacts on student outcomes, with one exception, holistic reforms which may more negatively impact outcomes. Lastly, while developmental education reforms aided in increasing overall student outcomes, gaps in graduation rates among genders and racial/ethnic groups were observed, with disparities between certain groups widening at institutions within states with reforms.</abstract>
