   <abstract >All-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) represent a promising advancement in electrochemical energy storage, with solid electrolytes (SEs) playing a crucial role. Sulfide and halide SEs have garnered substantial interest due to their distinct characteristics; sulfide SEs offer high ionic conductivity and stability with Li metal anodes, while halide SEs have better compatibility with high-voltage cathodes. This dissertation explores the structure-property relationship of mixed-anion frameworks in both sulfide- and halide-based SEs, aiming to fine-tune material structures and properties for enhanced battery performance. Firstly, we delve into the transformation of Li3PS4 via the introduction of LiBr. 31P NMR unveils the emergence of a glassy PS43− network interspersed with Br−. Solid-state NMR corroborates fast Li+ migration between PS43− and Br−, with increased Li+ mobility. A more than four-fold enhancement in ionic conductivity is observed upon LiBr incorporation (1.06 mS cm-1) into Li3PS4 (0.23 mS cm-1) resulting from the reduction of the energy barrier and transitioning Li+ transport dimensionality from 2D to 3D. The compatibility of Li3PS4 with Li metal is improved alongside an increase in critical current density (CCD) from 0.34 mA cm-2 to 0.50 mA cm-2 while preserving the electrochemical stability window. ASSB cells with 3Li3PS4:LiBr as the SE and TiS2 as the cathode active material (CAM) show robust high-rate and long-term cycling performance. Secondly, we incorporated LiBr and LiI simultaneously in Li3PS4 as a mixed-halide strategy. We achieve a two-fold increase in conductivity using a one-step ball milling technique. Subsequent low-temperature sintering further enhances conductivity to 4.43 mS/cm with a low activation energy of 0.29 eV. Furthermore, we engineered a cell configuration with stable milled SE layers toward Li metal and a high-conductive sintered SE separator in the symmetric cell with which CCD further increases compared to individual separators. In addition to sulfide-based SEs, Li-deficient lithium yttrium bromide, Li3-xYBr6-x, was prepared using the co-melting method. High-resolution X-ray diffraction and Rietveld refinement confirm the formation of the monoclinic structure with the C2/m space group with increased cation site disorder and polyhedral volume. Bond valence site energy calculations show the Li+ migration energy barrier from Li-deficiency. Ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations show the emergence of 3D-Li+ conduction. Solid-state NMR spectroscopy confirms the elimination of LiBr impurities and reveals increased Li-ion dynamics. An ionic conductivity of 4.49 mS cm-1 and activation energy of 0.28 eV were achieved. Furthermore, we synthesized a series of Li2.73Ho1.09Cl6-xBrx compounds using a solid-state co-melting approach. Crystal structure analysis revealed the presence of Li-ions in 2d octahedral sites of the C2/m space group for x ≥ 2. Analysis shows highly disordered cation sites with mixed occupancy of Li/Ho. 6Li solid-state NMR revealed a highly disordered local Li environment, which increases with Br/Cl substitution. The significant improvement in room-temperature ionic conductivity from 0.45 mS cm-1 for Li2.73Ho1.09Cl6 to 3.79 mS cm-1 for Li2.73Ho1.09Cl3.27Br2.73 is achieved with a significant decrease in activation energy from 0.38 eV to 0.32 eV, respectively. Further mixing anions and cations within a SE significantly enhances ionic conductivity by introducing controlled disorder at both cation and anion sites. This increases the system's configurational entropy and allows for the overlap of energy bands. Incorporating Mg2+ and Hf4+ into a Li3ClBrI mixed-rock-salt structure results in a substantial increase in ionic conductivity, reaching 0.88 mS cm⁻¹ for Li1.54Mg0.23Hf0.17Cl0.68BrI. The enhanced conductivity is attributed to a nanoscale solid solution between the disordered rock-salt and spinel structure. Moreover, introducing a mixed anion sublattice into cost-effective LiAlCl4 through a simple one-step mechanochemical milling process led to a 22-fold increase in ionic conductivity – from 0.0083 mS cm⁻1 to 0.18 mS cm⁻1 for Li2AlCl3S. This improvement can be attributed to the formation of new Li sites, enabling efficient 3D Li+ transport. The strategy leverages the inherent disorder to modify the Li-sublattice locally, leading to broader lithium-ion site occupancies and enhanced ion dynamics through polyhedral edge sharing. Mechanochemical milling of thiophosphate-based SEs combined with TiS2 CAM produces a composite material that leverages both cationic (Ti3+/4+) and anionic (S2-/n-, where n&lt;2) redox processes – resulting in ~2× enhancement in specific capacity. Catholytes containing mixed-anion SEs, especially with 3Li3PS4:LiBr, demonstrate better cycling performance compared to their mono-anion counterparts due to the improved ionic conductivity and thermodynamical stability. In summary, this dissertation explores innovative compositional design, optimal synthesis environment, and characterization of mixed-anion SEs, in addition to the utilization of these SEs in ASSBs. Overall, this research provides valuable insights into the development and application of high-performance ASSBs, addressing challenges associated with SEs in energy storage.</abstract>
