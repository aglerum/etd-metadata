   <abstract >The purpose of this qualitative exploratory multiple-case study was to explore how school-based teams make decisions and implement a Multi-Tiered System of Support for students exhibiting problem behavior (MTSS-B). Mandates require the use of MTSS to support both academic (MTSS-A) and behavioral needs (MTSS-B) of K-12 students. The definitions, guidelines, and structures for MTSS-A are more consistent and well-researched than those for MTSS-B. Little is known about how school-based teams make decisions about implementing MTSS-B and the factors they identify as influencing those decisions. It is important to learn how MTSS-B team members engage in the process at each tier (1, 2, and 3), how they develop interventions of increasing intensity, and what factors influence individual and team decision-making. Chapter One introduces the importance of understanding the history of disproportionate discipline and identification for special education services and provides a brief literature review of research previously conducted about how teams, fidelity, and culture are related to MTSS-B and how Contingency Theory and contingent decision-making have been connected to systems including schools. Chapter Two is the methods section where the rationale and details of this multiple case study are provided including how I increased trustworthiness and how the data was collected and analyzed. Chapter Three provides findings of the analyzed data both within and across cases. The themes developed are evidenced using invivo codes provided by participants. Overarching themes reflect some significant differences in how MTSS-B is implemented at each school. Differences are attributed to the factors considered by teams such as the home life of students, poverty, drug use, students' exposure to domestic violence, lack of supervision, homelessness, and the violent neighborhood where School 2 is located. School 1 identified factors such as the poverty experienced by their students and the often-unrecognized need for academic support. The types of behaviors exhibited by students were described as mainly classroom disruptions at School 1 and as physical aggression at School 2, requiring different approaches to consequences. Chapter Three concludes with a synthesis of how the elements of the exploratory framework are represented in how teams report implementing MTSS-B, how fidelity may contribute to the current operations of the teams, and how culture is represented by the factors influencing decision-making. Chapter Four's discussion ties components of the exploratory framework and collected data to previous research. Teams both report using a wide variety of factors, variables, and contingencies both subjective and objective to guide decision-making. This use of additional contextual and environmental variables indicates the likelihood that while teams report the use of traditional data-driven decision-making additionally, they are engaging in the contingency theory of decision-making. The chapter concludes with limitations and implications for future research.</abstract>
