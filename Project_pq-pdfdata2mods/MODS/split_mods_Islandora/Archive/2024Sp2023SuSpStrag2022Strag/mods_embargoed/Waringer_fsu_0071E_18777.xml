   <abstract >Triple Threat: A Study of American Musical Theatre Training, explores the history, growth, ethics, and progression of professional musical theatre training and BFA musical theatre programs in the United States. As this type of accredited conservatory training has existed for less than sixty years, this project ultimately seeks to pioneer an intensive inquiry into the evolution of musical theatre training, both prior to its existence within the academy and in the BFA context, and trace its relationship with the professional theatre industry. The first part of this work will historicize musical theatre training in America prior to its placement within academia, highlighting the foundations of existing methodologies, delving into the backgrounds of its most influential contributors, and identifying the strengths and challenges presented by the training throughout its development. The second part will chart the history of BFA musical theatre training within academia, contextualizing the evolution of the training within the larger framework of American higher education. This portion of the work will utilize three case studies conducted from a sampling of BFA musical theatre programs across the country to recount their respective histories and evolution, gain insight into the structures and goals of each program, and assess their relationship with the professional industry. Using the information learned from the historical research and case study portions of the project, the final part of this study will address the challenges and potentialities of current musical theatre training. An encompassing scope of the entire work will examine the inherent and pathological diversity and inclusion problems in both academia and the professional musical theatre industry. I seek to analyze how both institutions inform, uphold, or challenge the other, and how both entities may strategize for progress and change in these areas to create a more equitable industry, which I propose begins with the training. My study aims to unpack the promise of "Triple Threat training" that purports to develop well-rounded performers equally proficient in acting, singing, and dancing, where the curriculum seems to be both defined and limited by a set of prescribed skill sets. While mastery of skills valued by the existing industry is an undoubtedly important component of this training, I argue that musical theatre training must evolve to emphasize the areas in which scholarship, artistry, and craftsmanship may converge, developing artist-thinkers who can identify possibilities in the industry that may not be currently presented. I thus propose that this can be achieved through a new Triple Threat training model that replaces the pillared standards of acting, singing, and dancing with artistry, advocacy, and entrepreneurship.</abstract>
