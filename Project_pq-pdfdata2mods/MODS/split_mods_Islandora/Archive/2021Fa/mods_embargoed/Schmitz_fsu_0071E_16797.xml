   <abstract >Embedded in the history of the arid Western U.S., water conflict seems out of place in the Southeast's oozing landscape of humidity, swamps, and Spanish moss (Manganiello, 2015). Yet throughout Georgia, Alabama, and Florida's shared Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River (ACF) watershed, flows have faltered, ecosystems have suffered, negotiations have failed, and lawsuits have emerged and been put to rest, only to reappear under new guises in a cycle that continuously churns but moves no closer to resolving the issues that plague the basin. These conflicts, known collectively as the "Tri-State Water Wars", have marred the basin for over 30 years. A resolution to the protracted war seemed imminent in 2016, when the Tri-State conflict reached the U.S. Supreme Court in the form of Florida v Georgia. Although the Supreme Court ruled on the case five years later, little was settled, with lawsuits and ecological damages continuing to proliferate in the wake of Florida v Georgia. A changing climate and increasing water consumption are unquestionably key drivers in the Tri-State conflict that deserve careful examination. However, I argue that, below the surface of the water wars, there is an important history of discursive and material transformations which must also be examined to achieve a more complete understanding of water governance and conflict in the ACF basin. This dissertation contributes to an improved understanding of current issues in the ACF by analyzing an understudied topic in the region: the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE or the Corps) and their production of knowledge. The Corps has intervened in the ACF waterways since the mid-nineteenth century and today operates a system of five dams that profoundly impacts the flow regime of the Chattahoochee and Apalachicola Rivers. However, most studies of the ACF either ignore the engineers or consider them adjacent to water politics, existing only as apolitical technicians deployed by Congress and other powerful interests. I analytically recenter the Corps in the ACF, demonstrating the agency's influence in the Tri-State region extends beyond the role of expert builders typically ascribed to the engineers within the ACF literature. Drawing upon USACE ACF surveys and water control manuals from 1870-2017, I use a Foucauldian framework to track continuities and ruptures in the Corps' knowledge, logic, and modes of intervention across three eras: navigation, dam building, and ecopolitical. I show that across each era the Corps did not merely implement projects handed down from political and economic elite, but also shaped the course of river policy and interventions in the ACF through their own internal logic and conceptualization of the waterways. The historical approach I adopt additionally reveals how legacies of forgotten engineering visions continue to haunt current conflicts and modes of river governance throughout the ACF. In showcasing the ways in which the Corps have and continue to impact the ACF, I call for an analytical and political reengagement with experts and technical knowledge that have for too long remained hidden below the surface of grand political battles in the region.</abstract>
