   <abstract >Megaripples are large ripples with wavelengths ranging from 5-50 m and heights from crest to trough of 0.3-1.5. They are common current-generated structures on the continental shelf and in marine environments where bottom current velocities exceed 0.4 m s⁻¹. Although megaripples have been described from numerous sites, very little is known about their ecological functions and their role in the carbon and nutrient cycles. This thesis research therefore investigates megaripples with focus on their function as sites for rapid organic matter mineralization. Small ripples, occurring commonly on beaches, have been observed to facilitate enhanced levels of biological degradation and mineralization as a result of advective pore water exchange. This exchange occurs when water collides with the slope or crest of a bedform and creates a zone of high pressure, forcing water into the bedform. A zone of low pressure existing downstream typically pulls pore water back out of the bedform. This exchange in small ripples has been observed to cause them to act as a sink of oxygenated compounds and a source of reduced compounds. This phenomenon, termed biocatalytic filtration, has not been studied in megaripples, but has been theorized to scale up in intensity with bedform size. A megaripple field in a tidal channel (Choctawhatchee Bay, Florida, USA) was selected for study by characterizing the sediments, bedforms, and waters of the site. We found highly concentrated pools of nutrients within the pore waters of the megaripples, with crests (outwelling zone) being richer in reduced compounds while troughs (inwelling zone) had relatively lower levels of these. Distinct pore water temperature profiles indicate the presence of enhanced pore water transport velocity due to topography. Additionally, oxygen minima corresponded with rapid outwelling of megaripple pore water caused by intruding waters from the Gulf of Mexico during flood tide, indicating that the megaripples are acting as sinks of oxygenated compounds and sources of reduced compounds which may then be imported back into the Bay, resulting in enhanced chlorophyll-a levels. This indicates that megaripples can indeed be sites of active biocatalytic filtration that may scale up with size to megaripples.</abstract>
