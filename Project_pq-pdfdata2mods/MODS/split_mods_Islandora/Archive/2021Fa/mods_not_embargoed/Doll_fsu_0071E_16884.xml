   <abstract >My dissertation "Moral Rhetoric, Affective Polarization, and Direct Democracy" contributes to an emergent literature on the effects of affective polarization on political behavior by highlighting the role that moral rhetoric plays in political communication. Within my focus on affective polarization, I address two primary questions: why do political elites decide to use moral rhetoric and how do average citizens respond to moral rhetoric? First, drawing from the morality politics literature on emotional activation and the party identification literature on partisanship as a social identity, I argue that at the elite-level, moral rhetoric is used as a strategic means of voter mobilization. Secondly, drawing from the affective polarization work on the role of values and perceptions, I argue that at the individual-level, exposure to moral rhetoric increases feelings of affective polarization in average citizens. I evaluate my first argument using campaign advertisement data from the 2004 and 2008 gubernatorial and U.S. federal congressional elections. In contrast to my theoretical expectations, I present evidence that there is not an apparent relationship in my data between electoral competitiveness and the use of moral language in candidates' campaign advertisements. Consistent with my expectations, however, I also present evidence that Republican House candidates, particularly those in Southern states, are more likely to use moral rhetoric in their communications to voters. I evaluate my second argument using an original survey experiment. I present evidence that exposure to moral rhetoric increases respondents reported absolute difference in feeling thermometer ratings for the two parties, indicating greater affective polarization. I additionally present evidence that the effect of exposure to moral rhetoric on feeling thermometer ratings is conditional on individuals' strength of partisanship: for respondents with the strongest levels of partisan attachment, assignment to a moral language condition increased their absolute difference in feeling thermometer ratings by 15-points on a 100-point scale. In addition to my work on moral rhetoric and affective polarization, I am also interested in state politics. My dissertation additionally contributes to the robust direct democracy literature by highlighting the role that federal factors play in influencing the actions of state policy advocates. The third question that I address asks how partisan control of state and national governments is related to patterns of direct democracy use within the states. My main argument is that policy advocates respond to partisan control of the various levels of government, such that liberal proposals are more likely to appear on the ballot under periods of Republican control, and conservative proposals more likely under periods of Democratic control. I evaluate my third argument empirically using state-level data on direct democracy proposals that qualified for ballots between 2010-2020. I present evidence that partisan control of state government is associated with the introduction of both liberal and conservative ballot proposals. I additionally present evidence that, consistent with my expectations, there is a positive relationship between national Democratic control and the introduction of conservative proposals on state ballots. The results of my dissertation have produced important insights into the broader implications and consequences of the use of moral rhetoric in political communication and campaigns. My research can move the field of state politics toward resolution of unsettled theoretical debates concerning the impacts of direct democracy on citizen representation by describing when direct democracy may be expected to lead the introduction of liberal and conservative policies. Finally, from a prescriptive standpoint, my work reinforces the need to include federal level variables in future analyses of state policymaking.</abstract>
