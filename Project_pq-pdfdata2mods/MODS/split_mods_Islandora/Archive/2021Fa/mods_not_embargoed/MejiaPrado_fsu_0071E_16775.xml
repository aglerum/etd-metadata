   <abstract >This work proposes that the biodiversity crisis that has been documented in recent years in the Amazon is directly related to the ideas about the use of nature that the first European explorers, conquerors, and settlers proposed about the region. Chapter 1 studies the first European descriptions of the Amazon and the way in which they focused on highlighting the abundance and diversity of nature as a source of resource extraction and implementation of exogenous production models. It is proposed that these explorers, who described the indigenous people as passive entities that did not have the knowledge or the character to make the land produce, acted as prospectors of nature, in search of species and ecosystems that they could appropriate. This idea assumes that humans are separated from nature, and justifies the exploitation of biodiversity for the benefit of capital accumulation. Chapters 2 and 3 study the initiatives that have emerged in two National Reserves of the Peruvian Amazon, where the State, communities, and businessmen have partnered to face the loss of biodiversity, and to approach nature in apparently different. In these communities, natural resource co-management programs have been implemented that show encouraging results in terms of the recovery of biodiversity and the generation of direct and indirect economic benefits for some sectors, through the conservation and controlled exploitation of species with commercial value. However, at the end of Chapter 3 it is shown that these conservation strategies are based on the principles of exploitation of the land and its inhabitants imposed by European explorers and conquerors, thus questioning the sustainability of these systems, and proposes that these strategies are a remnant of some of the productive models that were violently proposed on Amazonian species and communities. In Chapter 4, other perceptions and practices of the original Amazonian inhabitants are exposed and analyzed, reflected in their symbolic narratives, and in radical contrast with the Eurocentric vision. These visions, mostly rooted in the economic narratives of modernity, actually constitute variations of systems of exploitation of people and natural resources, such as empowerment and patronage, where a few people benefit at the cost of work and the oppression of communities. Amazonian. The conclusions explore the separation between the human species and other species, and highlight the importance of listening to indigenous peoples as a way of responding to the current bi-diversity crisis. It highlights the importance of biodiversity as a whole and of each species in particular, and argues that it is imperative to relate to Amazonian nature in a different way than we have been doing to implement new forms of environmental protection and restoration.</abstract>
