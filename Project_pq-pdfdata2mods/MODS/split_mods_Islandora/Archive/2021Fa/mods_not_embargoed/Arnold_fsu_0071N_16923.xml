   <abstract >The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between leadership styles and music therapy by examining perceptions of leadership styles among music therapy student and professional leaders within one of the seven regions of the American Music Therapy Association. This study also explored how leadership styles were viewed and implemented in the music therapy field. Data were analyzed for 13 participants, 12 professional board members and 1 student board member. Mental Health was the most frequently served population by the professional participants (21.21%). Democratic leadership was the personal leadership style chosen by the most participants (40.91%). Democratic leadership also was rated the most implemented every time these leaders have had to lead (23.08%) while affiliative leadership was most usually implemented by these participants (46.15%). In the role of a music therapist, the importance of these leadership styles did not vary much from the indicated general effectiveness of the styles. Democratic leadership was rated "extremely important" by 38.46% of respondents. Coaching leadership was rated "very important" by 38.46% of respondents. Six of the participants (46.15%) strongly agreed with the idea that a successful and effective music therapist should have some sort of leadership training or taken a leadership-specific class. Additionally, six participants (46.15%) agreed that a successful and effective music therapist should be aware of their leadership style and how it plays a role in their practice. From the data gathered, Democratic, coaching, and affiliative leadership were the most important, most implemented and most effective leadership styles in general settings and, specifically, music therapy.</abstract>
