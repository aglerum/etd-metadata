   <abstract >This dissertation is composed of three essays on the topic of externalities in experimental commonpool resources and anti-commons environments. Due to weak property rights and weak formal institutions, common pool resources can face externalities imposed by stakeholders' over-usage of nature or arise from disamenities imposed by a particular agent's actions. These essays advance the field of economics by exploring the behaviors and environmental factors that benefit or harm shared resources and how both formal and informal institutions of property rights can prevent externalities from arising. In chapter 1, I develop a game theoretic model in which a resource pool has a common pool and public good aspect in its usage, such as hunting (consumption) and wildlife conservation. I then implement a laboratory experiment to evaluate how spillovers between the two related resource accounts affect consumption and conservation behaviors. The Nash prediction suggests payoff maximizing agents will increase spending on both consumption and conservation until both are equivalent when resource spillovers are present. Results from laboratory experiments are consistent with this hypothesis. As a policy intervention, I introduced and later revoked a common pool licensing policy based on U.S. hunting and fishing licensing. Under the same theoretical framework, removing a common pool licensing policy would increase welfare for all resource stakeholders. Contrary to this, experimental evidence indicates no overall change in welfare. After removing the restrictive licensing policy, the increase in the quantity of agents consuming from the commons is offset by a per-subject reduction in the amount of common pool investment. Chapter 2 explores two common pool environments, one in which the resource's destructive tipping point has a known distribution (risk) and one in which an objective probability cannot be calculated (ambiguity). The relevant theory predicts that any increase in uncertainty, whether that be from risk or ambiguity, will induce greater rates of resource consumption. Experimental tests of heightened ambiguity are of interest, as we see resource consumption and deterioration in the field be heavily influenced by ambiguous effects, such as climate change. Experiments in this study examining threshold CPR games under risk replicate the same positive risk effects on consumption found in the prior literature. Most importantly, I find new evidence in the lab that supports the notion that increasing the degree of environmental ambiguity by introducing imprecise information further increases consumption in the commons when second-order stochastic dominance of distributions is controlled for in the analysis. The final chapter of this dissertation produces an experimental market for land with environmental factors that mimic the segregation and gentrification of a neighborhood. Residential segregation by categories, such as income and ethnicity, is prevalent in the United States. Concurrently, experimental methods have been used in the literature on property to investigate questions regarding land acquisition. This stream of literature is combined with a laboratory experiment to investigate a neighborhood where a new "neighbor" purchases parcels with attendant negative externalities for the initial residents. With a simple excess demand model as a guide, this chapter aims to understand these negative externalities and the associated dynamics that lead to sorting in the absence of exclusionary institutions. The results from laboratory testing suggest a failure of the basic excess demand model to predict land acquisition. This failure results from significant transaction costs between residents and an externality imposing "neighbor." In purchasing new land units, initial residents frequently created informal institutions to impose bargaining costs on the new "neighbor." When communication between landowners is removed, the neighbor still faces information costs as take-it-or-leave-it offers are left as the only means of price searching.</abstract>
