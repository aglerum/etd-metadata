   <abstract >There is much research on music preferences, responses to music, and music therapy using client-preferred music. Not as much research exists about the effects of music therapists' preferred music, specifically their disliked music. The purpose of this study was to investigate music therapy students' perceptions about their experiences with their disliked music and their opinions about using their disliked music in music therapy. A survey was sent out via email and social media, with a total of 20 undergraduate music therapy students responding. It included questions about having disliked music, listening frequency for disliked music, reactions to disliked music, preparation and use of disliked music in music therapy, and disliked music's effect on relationships with clients. The survey consisted of 21 questions in total. In general, disliked music was listened to relatively infrequently, and participants perceived disliked music to produce negative emotional responses. Both similarities and differences were found between results for slightly disliked music and results for strongly disliked music. A notable difference was that most (n=9) music therapy students thought they should use slightly disliked music in music therapy but most (n=10) were unsure about using strongly disliked music. Two other differences between slightly and strongly disliked music were related to reactions to the music and the predicted effect on the relationship with clients. In light of the perceived negative effects of disliked music and other results from this study, music therapy students may benefit from discussion about possible responses they may have to disliked music and using disliked music in music therapy, including strategies that may facilitate its use.</abstract>
