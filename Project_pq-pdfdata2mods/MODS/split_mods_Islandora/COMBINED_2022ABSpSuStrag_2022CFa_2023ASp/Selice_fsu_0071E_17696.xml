   <abstract >Heteronormativity – the implicit moral assumption that heterosexuality is the preferred or natural sexual orientation – is evident in extant family science literature and presents challenges for researchers and clinicians. The presence of heteronormativity in the field of family science limits generalizability of study findings and promotes clinical decisions based on heteronormative research when working with LGBT individuals, couples, and families. It is imperative to conduct family science research with more diverse samples in order to challenge the dominance of heteronormativity in this field and provide more effective treatment options for those within the LGBT community. Associations have been found between adult attachment, trait mindfulness, sexual desire, and sexual satisfaction separately, but these variables have not been studied in a single model. Additionally, these variables have been studied mainly with heterosexual individuals and couples, even though sexual problems – such as low sexual desire and low sexual satisfaction – can impact all individual regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Therefore, this study sought to explore the associations between adult attachment, trait mindfulness, sexual desire, and sexual satisfaction within the LGBT community. A sample of 303 individuals who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender completed self-report measures that studied levels of attachment anxiety and avoidance, trait mindfulness, sexual desire, and sexual satisfaction. Specifically, the study found significant inverse associations between attachment anxiety and trait mindfulness, attachment avoidance and sexual desire, as well as attachment avoidance and sexual satisfaction. Furthermore, the study found a significant indirect effect demonstrating that the association between attachment anxiety and sexual satisfaction can be accounted for by trait mindfulness. Sexual desire was not found to moderate the association between trait mindfulness and sexual satisfaction. These findings are important as studying these associations within the LGBT community is crucial in order for clinicians to provide the most appropriate and effective treatment options when working with this community. Future research could expand upon these findings by studying the specific facets of mindfulness in relation to sexual satisfaction, in order to better understand the specific mechanisms that underly this negative association. Additionally, future research could include a broader examination of the potential impact of minority stress on these associations.</abstract>
