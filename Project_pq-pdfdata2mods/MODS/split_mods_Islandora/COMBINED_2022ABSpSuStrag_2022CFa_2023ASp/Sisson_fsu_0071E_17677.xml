   <abstract >The purpose of this study was to examine the qualifications, preservice experiences, and factors that influence teacher retention and attrition; and identify the needs of music teachers working in alternative schools to understand the factors that lead to music teacher retention and attrition in these schools. As this was the first study to examine music teachers in alternative schools, an attempt was made to understand who these music teachers were, recognize the factors related to their retention, and understand why specific factors were essential to the participants while others were considered unimportant. A sequential-explanatory mixed methods design was used to identify those factors that lead to music teacher attrition before exploring these ideas deeper with five specific cases. The Four Capital Theory of Teacher Retention served as the foundation for this study. It organizes the factors related to teacher retention and attrition and investigates these themes through the lens of preexisting theories: (1) human capital, (2) social capital, (3) structural capital, and (4) positive psychological capital. Strand 1 was descriptive, and examined the qualifications, preservice experiences, and factors that influence teacher retention and attrition. Results from strand 1 indicated that all teachers in the study chose to teach in their schools, nearly one-third of participants had no training in working with students with exceptionalities, and social factors are of most importance for retention. The qualitative strand 2 followed, shedding light on the lived experiences of teachers who worked in exceptional centers in Florida. Here, each teacher expressed their thoughts regarding each of the factors and how they were impacted by them. Teachers also discussed desired training opportunities. Finally, strand 3 integrated information gathered during the qualitative phase of the study with data from interviews in an effort to understand how these teachers determined those factors of most importance.</abstract>
