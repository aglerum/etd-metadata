   <abstract >Many students experience writing anxiety, which may lead to students dropping out of or changing classes, majors, college, or professions to get away from writing requirements. This repeated measures random control trial tested the effect of an online scaffolded writing time management intervention on two outcome variables (1) writing performance and (2) writing anxiety. The intervention was designed to help students reduce their writing anxiety by providing structure and guidance to help students self-regulate (keep themselves on task during the pursuit of a goal; Zimmerman, 2000) in the context of a writing assignment. This study also explored the impact of five moderator variables: (1) writing self-efficacy, (2) self-efficacy for writing self-regulation, (3) procrastination, (4) gender, and (5) year-in-school. Participants of the study were 118 undergraduate students from fall and spring Educational Psychology courses. Participants were randomly assigned to either the control (business-as-usual) or intervention condition. Participants received pre-test measures at time 1 when the assignment was introduced, a writing anxiety and writing self-efficacy measure at time 2 during the week the assignment was due, and post-test measures at time 3 after students submitted their assignment but before receiving their grades. Only writing anxiety and writing self-efficacy were measured at all three time points. The main analysis of the effect of the intervention on writing performance was severely underpowered; however, the moderator analyses had some significant and adequately powered results. Student writing self-efficacy moderated the effect of the intervention on writing performance (? = .045). Specifically, participants in the intervention with below average writing self-efficacy at T1 had a significantly higher score (23.6%) on writing performance (? = .033, ? = -1.900). While the overall test of students' self-efficacy for writing self-regulation did not moderate the effect of the intervention on writing performance (? = .203), it was underpowered and visually presented an interaction. Follow up tests revealed, that participants in the intervention with above average self-efficacy for writing self-regulation had a significantly higher grade (22.1%) on writing performance (? &lt; .001, ? = -2.186), leading to the overall conclusion that a student's perceived self-efficacy for writing self-regulation does moderate the effect on writing performance. Results indicated that there was an increase in writing anxiety scores between T1 and T2 for all participants (? = .024) and specifically for the control group between T1 and T2 (? = .048), however, when corrected for Type I error these tests were not significant. The intervention also may have stabilized participants' writing anxiety. There were two moderators from the writing anxiety tests with enough power to form a conclusion. Both procrastination (? = .515, ηp² =.305) and self-efficacy for writing self-regulation (? = .269, ηp² =.304) did not moderate the effect of the intervention on writing anxiety. All other analyses were underpowered. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.</abstract>
