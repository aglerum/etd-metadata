   <abstract >Trauma events have been documented throughout the continuum of life, and there continues to be a need among helping professionals to work with those who experience trauma. The field of music therapy has experienced a gap in scholarship and education, surrounding trauma work in areas such as mental health, medical health, physical health, and social health. Trauma symptomatology is unpredictable in how it manifests within each individual, making it difficult to treat. Additionally, trauma responses contain much cross-diagnosis symptomatology. Some music therapists strive to provide services to those with trauma symptoms; however, trauma-focused education and training is still growing within the field. This research sought to identify trauma-focused information and clinical insights to assist music therapists who work with survivors of trauma. To address the gap in the music therapy literature, a mixed-methods approach was used, along with an extensive review of the current literature related to trauma was completed. Resources during this review were included both within the music therapy umbrella, as well as those that fell within other helping professions, such as social work, psychology, education, and medicine. The literature identified a myriad of situations and events in which trauma responses have occurred. Many of these scenarios coincide in areas of work in which music therapy thrives. Subsequently, music therapists who have worked with survivors of trauma or trauma symptomatology were interviewed on their perceptions of music therapy work within the field of trauma (N = 10). Participant interview responses were then incorporated into common thematic material that emerged among the literature and between participants. Results showed a lack of knowledge and prior trainings in the trauma-focused area that was remedied by individuals seeking additional degrees outside the field and/or additional training through continuing education. Respondents reported both personal and non-personal connections to the area of therapy. Respondents' therapeutic approaches, goals, and music therapy interventions were also documented. Finally, personal perceptions and changes of therapists resulting from providing services in this area were discussed.</abstract>
