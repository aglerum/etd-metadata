   <abstract >The Legend of Zelda is a popular videogame series developed by Nintendo. It is based in the genre of medieval fantasy, specifically sword and sorcery. However, in modern popular culture, the medieval fantasy genre rarely has any attachment to the actual Middle Ages, Zelda is no different. Instead, the Zelda series exists as a post-modern medievalism. A post-modern medievalism, for the purposes of this study, is a work of popular culture that fans recognize as "medieval" in modernity but has no intended connection to the real medieval past. Instead, they focus on an attachment to other works of medieval fantasy, especially Tolkien, to fit into modern perceptions of the medieval genre. This work explores games within the Legend of Zelda series, using music as a case study. This case study on music further extends into the fandom associated with the series. Many fans engage with the series' music both within and outside the context of the virtual world that these games create. It is my contention that the games themselves create an atmosphere of post-modern medieval fantasy through their graphics, music, and in-game features that gesture towards the genre. Some of these features are swords, shields, castles, and magic. Fans are also invested in the music of the series, one of the key ways that the games build their medieval atmosphere alongside their graphics and imagery. Often, they will continue to listen to the official musical tracks of the games as a way to figuratively return to their childhood, a nostalgic undertaking. However, the musical cues found in newer entries to the series pay homage to earlier titles while also allowing fans to escape into a fantasy atmosphere. Breath of the Wild is an exceptionally successful title, focusing on ambient sounds that allow a player to fully immerse themselves into the natural surroundings that compose the majority of the game's virtual landscape. However, these ambient sounds are often broken by music associated with the rampaging, destructive technology that players must combat to save the kingdom. Beyond the games, fans also engage in their own reorchestrations of official tracks. In some instances, these reorchestrations are performed in costume and posted online for other fans to see. My argument here also incorporates the success of this genre of fan performance, and how both the actors and actresses within these works are able to bring that virtual, pseudo medieval world into our own natural world. Fans respond positively to both the theming of these videos and to the reimagining of tracks from the games of their childhood. These performances, and their positive reception amongst fans, add a sense of realism to the otherwise imaginary environments created in this sword and sorcery series of videogames.</abstract>
