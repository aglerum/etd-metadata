   <abstract >Almost from its inception, music has accompanied film. Initially, music helped move the storyline forward since films were originally silent. However, even with the advent of "talkies," or films recorded with actors' voices, music played an important role in the success of motion pictures by providing an essential backdrop to the action. Interestingly, the use of film to accompany classical music performances has not been ubiquitous. Classical music performance has evolved throughout history to combine music with other art forms such as dance, lighting, narration, and film; however, most classical performance remains the sameâ€“a purely aural tradition. Many professional musicians believe that adding other art forms to music can elevate performances and make them more relatable to audiences. However, they are unsure how to pair music and multimedia. This treatise presents the relevance and application of multimedia, specifically video, in classical music performances. A questionnaire was conducted for musicians with varying levels of education and different principal instruments to determine how musicians currently perform with video. The questionnaire indicated that out of the fifty-nine participants, 66.10 percent had performed with video. Furthermore, out of the twenty participants who claimed they had not performed with video, 80 percent expressed interest in performing with video if given a chance. Because very few pre-existing films pair neatly with any given piece of music, performers need to be able to create their films to match the music they are performing. After brief explanations of ways one can derive meaning from music and the various types of films, this treatise provides a method for determining video content for any given piece of music. Afterward, the Method is applied to three works for flute and electronics: 50 Fish: for flute and electronic soundscape (2020) by Egbert Jan Louwerse (b. 1975), Lipstick: for amplified flute/alto flute and soundtrack (1998) by Jacob Ter Veldhuis (b. 1951) and Rekindle: for flute and soundtrack (2009) by Michel Van der Aa (b. 1970). The future implications of this research include applying the method to create films for more classical compositions, shifting the focus from primarily contemporary music to all genres and styles of music, and future collaborations with composers to create multimedia performances starting from the inception of composition.</abstract>
