   <abstract >This project focuses on two Haitian narratives that risk being forgotten and consigned to oblivion. Both occurred during the rise to power of François Duvalier, specifically in the confusion of the 1957 Provisional Governments and their aftermath. The first narrative concerns the massacre of Daniel Fignolé's supporters in the slums of Port-au-Prince immediately after his forced removal from the Provisional Presidency, which effectively ousted him from the upcoming presidential elections. Among the poorest Haitian constituencies, the Fignolistes saw their hopes for a democratic voice and distributive justice disappear. They were brutally and permanently eliminated by Duvalier partisans in the army within two days after Fignolé's involuntary exile. I analyze the deceptive narratives that were circulated to media outlets across the world when the massacre took place. Thus, although there were many accounts of what had happened, these accounts were largely inaccurate and ignored. The second narrative left almost no trace in the public sphere. Yvonne Hakim Rimpel, a Haitian journalist of Lebanese background, challenged the fraudulent conditions surrounding Duvalier's election, and was the first female victim of Duvalier's vanguard. Sexually assaulted by his hooded cagoulards before the 'Tonton Macoutes' militia was created, Rimpel was forced to disavow that her rapists were connected to the Duvalier regime. Until now, there has been very little effort to retrieve these historical narratives, but we are fortunate to have a novel, Femmes au temps des carnassiers (Women in the Time of Predators) by Marie-Célie Agnant with a protagonist based on the persona of Yvonne Hakim Rimpel. The elision of literary writing and history becomes a way to retrieve a narrative that has otherwise left very few archival traces. In my dissertation, De Profundis: Screams from the Historical Sublime in Two Haitian Narratives, I have argued that the memory work we dedicate to preventing such narratives being forgotten affects us in the present, as well. An ethics of attention saves us from moral disengagement and connects us to Hayden White's understanding of the 'practical past.' We are not disinterested parties, but are rather stakeholders in the constructed rhetoric of historical representation. The historical sublime is never a coherent and meaningful 'sublime object' to be observed or discovered sui generis. We create the epistemological ground that emerges from our own constructions of historical discourse. The sublime spectacle is always overdetermined, with the corollary that our hermeneutic efforts entail complexity. This expectation of historical complexity, this understanding that meaning emerges only after we create it, encourages us to interrogate the broadest conditions of possibility for two Haitian narratives that deserve our attention.</abstract>
