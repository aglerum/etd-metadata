   <abstract >While some research exists around the leadership development processes of undergraduate women (Rupert, 2019; Shetty, 2020; Torres, 2019), little exploration has explored the leadership capacity and efficacy development of college women. Dugan and Komives (2007) found that college women scored higher than their male peers on their leadership capacity levels, but undergraduate women scored lower on their leadership efficacy levels than men. This means that women have the skills, traits, and experiences to make them successful in the leadership process, but do not believe in their ability to succeed as a leader. Dugan (2017) notes that low leadership self-efficacy inhibits participation in the leadership process. For these reasons, this study explored the leadership capacity and efficacy development of undergraduate women. Using narrative inquiry as methodology, the study looked to address both how undergraduate women develop their leadership capacity and efficacy and explore how factors and practices shape undergraduate women's perception of their leadership capacity and efficacy development. This study used the culturally relevant leadership learning model (Beatty &amp; Guthrie, 2021; Bertrand Jones et al., 2016; Guthrie et al., 2017) and the cycle of socialization (Harro, 2013) as conceptual frameworks. A sample of eleven undergraduate women who self-identified as leaders and had taken a leadership studies course participated in the study. Data for the study was collected from participants through a screening tool, a written narrative, and a semi-structured interview. Based on the themes of the study, undergraduate women's leadership capacity development is influenced through access to leadership opportunities, engagement in the leadership process, observing the leadership process of others, and through socialized traits around gender and leadership. Factors that influenced leadership efficacy development for participants included enacting the leadership process themselves, the environments in which they were leading, observing the leadership of others, messages they received about their ability to lead, and their relationship to other people who encouraged (or discouraged) them as leaders. A discussion of the findings was explored, including the connections to the conceptual framework. Implications for future research and practice were also presented, including recommendations for practice from the study participants.</abstract>
