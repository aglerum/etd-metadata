   <abstract >Accurate gene trees are difficult to estimate with traditional methods due to the effects of recombination. New methods that co-estimate gene trees and recombination breakpoints function differently than the traditional maximum likelihood (ML) framework, and therefore have the potential to alleviate inaccuracies caused by recombination. However, the accuracy of gene trees produced by these methods has yet to be evaluated under a broad range of conditions. Using simulations, we studied gene tree accuracy in the presence of intra-locus recombination. Using a previously published model of human population history, we simulate the process of recombination along large sections of a genome to produce DNA sequence alignments. We varied three parameters that influence gene tree accuracy: recombination rate, population size, and substitution rate. We then compare the accuracy of gene trees estimated using different methodologies, including traditional maximum likelihood estimation of single and concatenated regions (FastTree), as well as more sophisticated co-estimation methods (Relate, Tsinger, and Rent+). We found that traditional approaches can only produce accurate gene trees in limited regions of parameter space; as the number of sites used to estimate a gene tree increases, recombination becomes more and more problematic. Some, but not all, of the co-estimation methods successfully circumvent this tradeoff and have the potential to produce accurate gene trees in broader regions of parameter space. These results indicate that by adopting co-estimation methods, systematists may be able to improve gene tree accuracy. For Chapter 2 of this dissertation, we generate a de novo chromosome scale genome assembly for Pseudacris feriarum with open source software and our own methods. The final assembly has a total of 4,007,244,081 base pairs and is 78.0% BUSCO complete (pre-polishing); 85.95% of the assembly is assigned to 12 large chromosomes. We generated a PacBio CLR-based contig assembly and then partially removed duplicated heterozygous regions from contigs using Purge_dups. We developed our own methodology to fully remove heterozygous sequence; we rely on ambiguous bwa-mem read mappings to identify duplicated heterozygous contig pairs. Open source software we used struggled to correctly join contigs into scaffolds using intermediate range linking data (Chicago), so we developed our own methodology that ensures joins are only made between contigs whose connections encompass a certain area. After Chicago scaffolding we use Hi-C linking data along with 3D-DNA to generate chromosome sized scaffolds. We finalize our assembly with misjoin correction, manual curation in JBAT, and polishing with Arrow. Lastly, we perform a set of analyses which highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the assembly we generated in Chapter 2. Specifically, we show that the assembly of P. feriarum is reasonably complete by finding a high proportion of previously identified and sequenced genomic elements within the assembly. Additionally, we find supporting evidence in chromosome and ortholog conservation that indicates the large-scale structure of the genome assembly is correct. We also verify that small scale orientation and ordering of sequence is likely correct by recovering exon and intron properties similar to other anurans through RNA transcript mapping. We visualized and tested uniformity for the following genomic elements: anchored loci, candidate speciation genes, telomeric motifs, and a repetitive motif of particular interest. We find anchored loci and candidate speciation genes could come from uniform distributions, telomeres are not positioned correctly, and a marker motif is widely spread throughout the genome but not uniformly distributed. Repeat annotation through RepeatMasker reveals there are only 175 unique and 830 total occurrences of repetitive regions larger than 10,000 bp.</abstract>
