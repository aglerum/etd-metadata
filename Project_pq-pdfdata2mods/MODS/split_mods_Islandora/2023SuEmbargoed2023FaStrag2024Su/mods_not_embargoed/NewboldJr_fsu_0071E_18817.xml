   <abstract >This study was an exploration into the lived histories of four study subjects—all Black men working as art teachers—to delve deeper into the intricacies of their educational journeys of becoming and being Black Men Art Educators in K-12 learning spaces. The marginalization and lack of representation of Black men in art education called for an examination of the quality of experiences for these helping professionals. Exposure to burnout, gendered microaggression and racial battle fatigue when working in the education field contributes to the low population of Black men seeking and retaining positions as K-12 educators in the U.S. The aim of this study was to engage BMAE participants in a process of multimodal art reflection and to make meaning of their lived experiences as Black male K-12 educators. The research questions were developed to elevate the voices of participants by highlighting perceived barriers, comprehend the process of choosing education as a career, and discover anecdotes of resilience through career stages in art education. A critical review of salient literature and existing programs focused on pathways that lead to recruiting and training more Black male teachers and preservice teachers. With an emphasis on Black males who teach art in elementary, middle, and high schools, this study identified strategies for buttressing representation in these educational spaces. More broadly, this study used tenets of pragmatism and critical race theory to make meaning of the lived experiences of Black male artist educators through a three-part qualitative interview series. My methodological approach, then, involved three qualitative interviews conducted with each participant and also multimodal art making experiences that revealed new understandings related to personal, behavioral, and environmental factors that impact the pursuit of recruitment, resilience, and self-care for BMAE. Using a preliminary questionnaire to solicit the participation of qualifying volunteers, I collected data from four Black male artist educators in the Washington DC metropolitan area. From there, I engaged in qualitative methods that employed a three-part interview and multimodal art making protocol with each participant. Through this approach I revealed rich insights from the study subjects' life histories related to being and becoming BMAE in K-12 educational spaces. The pertinent findings of this study were reported as participant profiles and highlighted each subject's teacher origin stories. Pseudonym assignments were given to each participant to conceal their identities and ensure anonymity. The codes and categories produced in the data analysis process revealed identity construction (personal and professional) as a thematic connector. This dissertation research is important work, and it contributes to the field of art education and the salient literature on the actions and experiences of Black men teaching art in K-12 classrooms. The findings support recruitment and retention efforts of the less than 2% of the K-12 educator population in the United States—specifically focusing on the professional and creative development of BMAE at the preservice and in-service levels. Practical implications for the field of art education include issues associated with preservice preparedness and alternative pathways that may lead to an increased pool of qualified Black men applicants for the educator pipeline, Additional findings address the need for establishing affirming communities to enhance a sense of belonging for BMAE. This research underscores the importance of recognizing and addressing the B-ME teaching experiences, and its contribution to the field of art education on the actions and experiences of Black men teaching art in K-12 classrooms.</abstract>
