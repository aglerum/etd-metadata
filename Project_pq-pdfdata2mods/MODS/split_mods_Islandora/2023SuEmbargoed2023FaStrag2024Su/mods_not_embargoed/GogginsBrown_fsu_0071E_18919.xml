   <abstract >Social emotional learning (SEL) is a term that encompasses a set of essential life skills including self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship skills, and responsible decision-making (Collaborative for Academic Social and Emotional Learning [CASEL], 2024, para. 1). Despite growing interest, many school districts struggle with integrating sustainable and meaningful SEL instruction (Albright et al., 2019; Jones &amp; Bouffard, 2012; Muñiz, 2020). In 2019, the Florida Senate passed the Comprehensive Health Education (CHE) instructional policy to enhance K-12 education, responding to the MSD tragedy and the 2017 Florida Youth Rish Behavior Survey's alarming mental health statistics (U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2017). The 2021 policy revision emphasized concepts of mental and emotional health, highlighting character traits and resiliency in student development. In 2022, Florida's House Bill 7 introduced new language within the CHE policy, emphasizing the need for instruction to aligned with SEL core competencies, yet without using the term SEL (Individual Freedom Act, 2022, p. 18). The bill offered minimal program and resource selection guidance, leaving districts to navigate independently. Despite this legislation on competencies, Florida politicians were in the national spotlight for distancing themselves from the term SEL due to political and social implications (Fittes, 2023). In this larger political context, my dissertation analyzed how Florida's 67 school districts have interpreted and adapted to policy shifts in CHE instruction over four academic years (2019–2023) focusing on the documented instructional materials for Resiliency Education and Character Education. A qualitative content analysis identified 161 uploaded instructional materials; 87% of programs were evidence-based for Resiliency Education, and 89% of programs were evidence-based for Character Development. Regarding alignment to CASEL's SEL core competencies, 38% of programs for Resiliency Education and 51% of programs for Character Development aligned to CASEL's SEL core competencies. Moreover, 45% of instructional materials aligned to Florida's new Resiliency Education standards. The study also found that more instructional materials were documented for Resiliency Education (required to document) than for Character Development (not required to document). Yet, more CASEL-endorsed programs were documented for Character Development. Subtle changes in districts documentation were observed over 4 years of CHE policy implementation. Compliance rates for required documentation of instructional materials for Resiliency Education were 88% in 2020–2021, 97% in 2021–2022, and 98% in 2022–2023. Although there were few subtle changes in the compliance rate, there were no major changes in how districts documented their instructional materials across the various demographic make-up for Resiliency Education instruction as the CHE policy shifted over the 4 years of the policy. Large districts, those with above-median socioeconomic status, and districts appointed superintendents all achieved 100% compliance with CHE policy requirements over the 4 years. Orange School District was the only district out of the five largest districts to document a high level of complexity among their programs for Character Education. I propose recommendations for policymakers, the Florida Department of Education, district leaders, and school-based educators to support districts in choosing instructional materials that are both evidence-based and aligned to CASEL's SEL core competencies. Additionally, I recommend conducting implementation studies to evaluate the effectiveness of these materials, thereby providing Florida school districts with deeper insights into evidence-based, high-quality programming that aligns with the CHE policy.</abstract>
