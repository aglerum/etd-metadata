   <abstract >Eating disorders (EDs) are often an under-detected problem with a substantial risk of development during emerging adulthood. These disorders are often lethal if left untreated and affect approximately 8.4% of women and 2.2% of men during their lifetime. Guided by cognitive dissonance theory and family systems theory, this study built upon the research of the Body Project. This intervention study was adapted from the original Body Project treatment in two distinct ways. First, it included a subclinical eating disorder sample rather than a clinically significant sample. Second, it included a support person who was chosen by the participant and asked to attend all four groups in a supportive role for the participant. This study aimed to deepen the understanding of the improvement of eating disorders, body image, and relationship quality and assessed the feasibility of the overall study design through a mixed methods framework. With these adaptations, this study presented a first-of-its-kind outlook on the integration of cognitive dissonance treatment groups and social support. A sample of 10 individuals with subclinical levels of eating disorders were recruited for this study. Treatment included four virtual treatment groups. Data collection included quantitative assessments on eating disorders, body image, and social support over four time points and semi-structured qualitative exit interviews. Quantitative results indicated that eating disorder behaviors and body image satisfaction decreased, while social support did not improve. Qualitative results showed that participants did have difficulty finding a support person. Still, once a support person was found, they felt supported by the group, their support person, and the group leader. Other qualitative themes supported feasibility, including codes showing motivations to join the groups to learn about body image, needing help, and struggling with body/body image. Participants noted themes related to improvements in health attitudes towards eating behaviors, improvements in body image dissatisfaction such as increased self-confidence/self-esteem, being able to compliment/appreciate self, showing empathy to others, and enhanced social support such as group support, group sameness, and social commitment from a support person. Participants identified ways in which they considered the group could be improved upon if it were to be done again, such as having a larger group, meeting more or less often, and adding additional resources to the group. Understanding the feasibility of the adapted Body Project intervention, as well as the improvement of ED behaviors, body image dissatisfaction, and relationship quality during the intervention, is important for both improvements and adaptations for the Body Project intervention and the future treatment of eating disorders.</abstract>
