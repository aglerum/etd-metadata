   <abstract >Meaning in life is often assumed to be related to suicidal outcomes such as suicide ideation, suicide risk, and suicide attempt, and past studies have indeed found associations between meaning in life and various suicide-relevant constructs. It is unclear, however, what the extent of relations between meaning in life and suicide-relevant constructs are when the overall literature is taken into account. It is also unclear whether publication bias may be affecting the estimates of the effect sizes of associations between meaning in life and suicide-relevant constructs. The present meta-analysis seeks to determine the effect size of the relation between meaning in life and various suicide-relevant constructs across the literature. Moreover, the present meta-analysis seeks to determine whether publication bias may be present in the extant literature on meaning in life and suicidal outcomes. Finally, the present meta-analysis seeks to determine whether associations between meaning in life and suicidal outcomes systematically differ across a variety of moderator variables, including depression, anxiety, narrowness of the definition of the meaning-in-life construct, and country of study. Studies that included a measure of meaning in life, included a measure of a suicidal outcome (viz., suicide ideation, suicide risk, and/or suicide attempt), and had obtainable sample sizes and correlations for these measures were included in the meta-analysis. Studies were excluded if they were solely qualitative studies, were duplicates, consisted of duplicate data, or were not available in English. Fisher's Zr was calculated as a measure of effect size for all studies. Effect sizes were evaluated using a random-effects model with an REML estimator. Overall, results indicate that meaning in life is negatively associated with suicide ideation, with a moderate estimated mean effect size; negatively associated with suicide risk, with a moderate estimated mean effect size; and negatively associated with suicide attempt, with a small–moderate estimated mean effect size—such that greater meaning in life is associated with decreased suicide ideation, decreased suicide risk, and fewer suicide attempts. Study effect sizes were consistently found to be heterogeneous, and heterogeneity was generally not accounted for by the moderator variables. Sensitivity analyses corroborated the robustness of these findings. Assessments of publication bias indicated a lack of substantial publication bias, further supporting the robustness of these findings. Given these findings, assessments of meaning in life may aid in detecting suicidality, and meaning in life may be a robust intervention target when trying to reduce suicidal thoughts and behaviors.</abstract>
