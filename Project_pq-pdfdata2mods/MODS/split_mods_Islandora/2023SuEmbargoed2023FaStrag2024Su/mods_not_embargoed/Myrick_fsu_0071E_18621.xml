   <abstract >The study conducted a survey to assess employee perceptions of online training practices at the Space Business Area at Lockheed Martin Corp (LMC), specifically within the Space Business Area (BA), to evaluate current training and its correlation with employee retention. Utilizing the New World Kirkpatrick Model (NWKM), the survey measured four levels: Level 1 (Engagement, Relevance, and Customer Satisfaction), Level 2 (Attitude, Confidence, and Commitment), Level 3 (On-The-Job Behaviors and Drivers), Level 4 (Leading Indicators &amp; Organizational Results) and Level 4 (Individual Results &amp; Retention). Descriptive statistics were used to evaluate training at each level, and multiple regression analysis was conducted to determine the impact of current online training practices on employee retention. The sample included 72 employees, but results were limited to Space BA, and constraints were placed on recruitment and data collection. The survey responses revealed moderate levels of engagement and satisfaction with training, with 66% indicating lower engagement due to job priorities, irrelevance, and lack of incentives. Engagement increased with job tenure, especially among those in their 2nd to 5th year. While 28% found the training relevant, newer and older employees perceived it as more useful despite minimal incentives. High commitment to training was reported by 71%, with lower commitment linked to unclear expectations, lack of support, and confidence issues. Training positively impacted job behavior, with 57% applying what they learned, influenced by resources, accountability, and peer support. However, 43% struggled with application due to other priorities and lack of support. The overall organizational impact was moderately positive, with 65% rating the online training at a 6 or higher (on a scale of 10). Positive impacts were noted in quality of work, customer satisfaction, peer relationships, and productivity, but not on the participant perceptions of organizational mission. In light of the issues with normality and homogeneity in the data that require caution in the interpretation of the findings, the regression model showed a weak but significant effect of training on retention, with no statistical significance found in the individual impact of Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 on retention. Exploratory analysis of the impact of a select set of factors from each level revealed that commitment to applying training to work and seeing positive results from the training are factors and intermediary outcomes that can influence employee retention. More exploratory analysis indicated that training impact perceptions varied with job tenure, with newer employees reporting the highest ratings, followed by longer-tenured employees, while those with 1-5 years reported the lowest ratings, largely because this group often reported having higher and competing priorities at work. Finally, the findings in this study reveal that factors from Levels 1, 2, and 3 were weakly associated with retention and that higher commitment to training and more personal results observed after training are specific factors that were found to be correlated with higher intention to stay on the job. Overall, these findings imply that effective training programs should be relevant, engaging, and aligned with job responsibilities and organizational goals. Providing incentives, clear expectations, resources, and accountability is crucial. Training should be adaptable to different job tenures, with continuous evaluation and feedback to identify areas for improvement. Ensuring training is useful and worthwhile can enhance its impact on job behavior and organizational effectiveness, ultimately improving job performance, satisfaction, and retention based on the results of the exploratory regression analysis.</abstract>
