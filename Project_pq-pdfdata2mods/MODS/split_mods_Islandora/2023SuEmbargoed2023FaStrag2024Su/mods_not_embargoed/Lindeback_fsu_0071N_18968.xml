   <abstract >The global housing crisis, an increasingly complex and challenging issue, is a pressing concern as individuals and families struggle to find stable and affordable housing to meet their basic needs (Habitat for Humanity, 2023). The conventional practice of establishing single-family zoned communities, which unjustly discriminate against higher-density and lower-income multi-family communities, has created a hierarchy that exacerbates the crisis and perpetuates social inequality. Marginalized populations, already at risk, are further vulnerable to gentrification in their living, working, and educational environments. These exclusionary zoning policies not only contribute to the decline in people's mental and physical well-being but also displace them from places they value. The direct link between housing conditions and health outcomes is a stark reality that demands our immediate attention (Donkin, 2014; Osmick &amp; Wilson, 2020; Rolfe et al., 2020). Health equity is not only a concept but a fundamental principle that asserts that everyone should have a fair opportunity for optimal health, thereby requiring an equitable distribution of resources, opportunities, and conditions conducive to good health. Yet, the reality is stark. Millions of households in the United States face inadequate rental conditions or struggle with unaffordable rent burdens, a clear violation of this principle. This is a call to action for all of us to work towards a more equitable future (The White House, 2023). This study explores how the holistic design of affordable housing communities impacts the residents who live there. Using evidence-based design theories in new urbanism, community index theory, and the theory of supportive design, a framework of design implications was developed to foster identity restoration in marginalized populations living in affordable housing communities. Housing conditions and instability as social determinants of health, environmental conditions, socioeconomic status, food insecurity, and neighborhood characteristics significantly influence overall health outcomes (Handy, 2014.) The methodology includes an analysis of available amenities and the lived experiences of tiny home residents in low-income tiny home communities, low-income tiny home agrihood communities, and luxury tiny home agrihood communities. Each community, amenity, and home feature is analyzed for benefits using a lens of safety, privacy, identity, purpose, and connection. The results form a basis for comparison in determining which amenities best support human well-being. Key findings include determining the proximity of affordable housing's urban location to ensure access to grocery stores, healthcare, education, work opportunities, and entertainment, supporting residents who may not own a car (Gao et al., 2021). Secondly, promoting social interaction by engaging residents in daily activities such as maintenance and programmed amenities that bring people together can help create a sense of purpose and belonging, allowing individuals to connect and thrive. Lastly, the socioeconomic benefits of a sharing economy are explored where the local community is invited to engage with a membership to amenities and access to fresh food from an urban farm, breaking the perception that living near affordable housing communities lowers single-family house values. Involving the local community impacts the economic vitality of affordable housing. At an unprecedented pace, people are investing in smart, affordable, and factory-built homes within sustainable Farm-to-Table communities to forge a deeper connection with the land, build strong communal ties, benefit from green infrastructure, and have full confidence in the origin of their food (agrihoodliving.com, n.d.). Further research is needed on place attachment and the health impacts of supportive amenities and home features that foster a sense of belonging and satisfaction, fulfilling human needs for control, creativity, mastery, privacy, personal expression, security, and tranquility (Altman &amp; Low, 1992).</abstract>
