   <abstract >Christians believe that the perfect design of community and togetherness came after Creation was complete when there was perfect harmony between God and human beings. In the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve existed in community with one another and with God, living as God had initially intended. In the early church, which began shortly after Jesus ascended into Heaven, Jesus' disciples were never apart from one another; they shared meals, belongings, and times of prayer (ESV Bible, 2001, Acts 2:42-47). This constant connection not only strengthened their personal relationships, but it also fostered a deeper and more intimate relationship with God. Today, prominent theologian Donald S. Whitney states that the structure of the church has fallen away from this perfect design that God had originally intended for humans (Whitney, 2013). A lack of intimate togetherness is seen in church environments across the United States today, as more individuals are not connecting with others in their churches. Cliques have been formed, attendance has fallen due to lack of personal investment and connection, and people are left unknown, unseen, and disconnected from a place where community and engagement should be abundant (PEW Research Center, 2021). The intentional design of a church environment provides users with a space where social connection with others and spiritual experiences are fostered and enhanced. Church environments can and should engage individuals in a spiritual experience with God and aid in building community with others, yet collected literature and research argues the opposite is taking place. The connection between Generation Z, spiritual spaces, and the potential for socialization within church interiors is under-researched despite several overlapping connections of design theory, human experience, and church environments. Because of this potential that church environments hold, it is important that the interior space not be neglected but is rather designed intentionally and with purpose.</abstract>
