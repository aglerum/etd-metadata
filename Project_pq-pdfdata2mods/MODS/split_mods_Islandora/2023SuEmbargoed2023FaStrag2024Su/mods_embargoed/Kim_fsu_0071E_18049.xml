   <abstract >Public and non-profit organizations are often faced with challenges in recruiting and retaining competent and motivated employees. For more effective management of public human resources and enrichment of the workforce, understanding what employees seek from their workplaces and what influences their work behaviors are crucial. The three studies presented here aim to answer the question of what makes public organizations attractive as employers. To address this question, the studies investigate different organizational and individual factors related to employees' choices of careers, work behaviors and attitudes in government and non-profit workplaces. The first study examines employees' teleworking behaviors especially after majority of employees had to work remotely during the peak of Covid-19 pandemic. The study finds that there are some endowment effects involved in employees wanting to continue working remotely after the pandemic. Also, the study finds that telework can be a way for less satisfied employees to stay away from their office while still maintaining their employment. The second study explores the career choices and job satisfaction of highly educated employees with doctoral degrees and their job satisfaction in government and non-profit sectors. The study examines the effects of material, social, and idealistic work values on their career choices in public and non-profit organizations. Overall, the findings suggest employees with doctoral degrees were more likely to pursue careers in sectors and be satisfied with their jobs when they perceive better fit between themselves and the organizations and their jobs. Lastly, the third study focuses on the employees' behaviors in reaction to their performance appraisals. A survey experiment was developed and implemented to see if employees will engage in impression management tactics more if they perceive their performance appraisals to be unfair. Using a list experiment method, the study finds that the perceived fairness and unfairness differently motivates employees to engage in different impression management behaviors.</abstract>
