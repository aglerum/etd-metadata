   <abstract >Ionically bonded materials, namely, perovskites and perovskite-related materials established of organic cations and metal halide anions hold great promise for the next generation functional materials. For instance, beyond the traditional three-dimensional (3D) perovskite, low dimensional organic metal halide hybrids with two-dimensional (2D), one-dimensional (1D), and zero-dimensional (0D) structures at the molecular level are acquired. These hybrid materials benefit from the large range of available organic cations and metal halide building blocks offering them exceptional compositional and structural flexibility. Hence, low dimensional organic metal halide hybrids surpass the 3D perovskites in terms of stability, photoluminescence quantum efficiency and tunable optical properties. In most cases, these structures display the intrinsic properties of the inorganic framework due to quantum and dielectric confinement of excitons. Recently, more efforts are devoted to exploring and investigating approaches to control and tune the properties of this class of material through organic cation control. It is found that the geometry, steric characteristics, charge, and charge bearing groups of the organic cations play a critical role in molding the structure and functionality of the inorganic framework. In this dissertation, solid state synthesis of 0D highly luminescent metal halide hybrids with bulk organic cations is established. Afterwards, organic cations with singular geometries and functionalities are explored in layered 2D structures and revealed a structure-property relationship. Finally, a novel distinctive 1D structure templated by chiral organic cations is reported. In chapter 2 of this dissertation, mechanochemical synthesis is employed to prepare ionically bonded organic metal halide hybrids with a zero-dimensional (0D) structure. (Ph4P)2SbCl5 and (Ph4P)2MnCl4 were synthesized by milling appropriate ratios of bulk organic halide salt Ph4PCl with inorganic metal halide salts SbCl3 and MnCl2, respectively. The structural and photophysical properties of synthesized 0D structures are almost identical to those of single crystals prepared by slow solution growth. A blend of organic metal halide hybrid with dual emission is reported. In addition to the synthetic control of this class of materials, in chapters 3 and 4, the structure-property relationship is investigated in 2D layered perovskites. First, the impact of organic cations is explored in a model system featuring phenethyl ammonium PEA+ and its derivates MeOPEA+ with an electron-donating group and FPEA+ containing an electron withdrawing group in para-substitution. Single crystals of 2D layered perovskites are reported along with their photophysical and structural characterization. Although, (PEA)2PbBr4, (MeOPEA)2PbBr4, and (FPEA)2PbBr4 have almost identical crystal structures with similar room temperature blue emissions. Their emissions at low temperature are distinct with the presence of self-trapped broadband redshifted emissions. It is found that the organic spacers influence the distortions within the inorganic layers which impact the broadband emissions at low temperature. In chapter 4, we proceed with the efforts to manipulate the structural distortions through organic cation alteration. Chiral organic cations R-FMBA+ and S-FMBA+ along with FBA+, which is achiral due to the absence of methyl group at the α-carbon position, are used to prepare 2D layered perovskites. Interestingly, warm white photoluminescence is observed at room temperature in the chiral systems (R-FMBA)2PbBr4 and (S-FMBA)2PbBr4 contrarily to the achiral (FBA)2PbBr4 that exhibits deep blue photoluminescence. The tuning of the emissions at room temperature stems from the significant structural distortions in the chiral crystals. Furthermore, (R-FMBA)2PbBr4 and (S-FMBA)2PbBr4 inherit chirality from the organic cations and display chiroptical properties observed through the distinct opposite circular dichroism signals in the 275−400 nm range. The combination of interesting photophysical and chiroptical properties is promising for numerous applications. In chapter 5, the critical structural distortions generated from the introduction of chiral organic cations in low dimensional organic metal halide hybrids are explored to template unique structures that bridge between 2D and1D hybrids. Novel structures of (R-FMBA)5Pb2I9 and (S-FMBA)5Pb2I9 adopting nanoribbon 1D structure are reported for the first time. The Nanoribbons consist of 4 corner-sharing PbI6 octahedra isolated by the R-FMBA+ and S-FMBA+ cations. The synthesized crystals exhibit chiroptical activity demonstrated by circular dichroism response covering the range of 275 to 550 nm. Therefore, the incorporation of chirality, alongside the flexible structure of organic metal halide hybrids is considered as one of the pathways to create new unique structures that are useful for electronic and spintronic applications.</abstract>
