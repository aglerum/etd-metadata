   <abstract >The global push towards achieving carbon neutrality has accelerated the adoption of renewable energy sources, resulting in an increased integration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) within power systems. Of paramount importance in this integration is the precise control of voltage, current, and power in grid-tied inverters, a subject that has garnered extensive research attention due to its potential to enhance system stability, robustness, and reliability. Concurrently, SiC grid-tied inverters have garnered significant traction across diverse applications, leveraging their advantages such as higher switching speeds, superior efficiency, increased power density, and reduced system costs in comparison to their Si-based counterparts. However, the transition from device-level advantages to system-level benefits while ensuring stability, particularly in scenarios involving high switching frequencies and rapid dynamics like low-voltage ride-through (LVRT), presents numerous challenges. Inverter control strategies are broadly categorized into Grid-Following (GFL) and Grid-Forming (GFM) methods. Established GFL control methods commonly rely on voltage sensors, phase-lock loops (PLLs), or frequency-lock loops (FLLs) to attain effective current and power control. Nevertheless, issues of stability and constrained dynamic performance arising from PLLs and voltage sensors persist. Despite advancements that have demonstrated PLL-less, voltage sensor-less approaches with enhanced reliability and stability, these methods still exhibit limited dynamic responses, and intricate and time-consuming design remains unavoidable. In the context of cutting-edge GFM approaches, the P-? Q-E droop algorithm is adopted, and various versions of Power-Synchronization-Loop (PSL) based methods are introduced. These methods facilitate automatic power sharing and eliminate the need for PLL units during islanding mode. However, their dynamic response tends to be relatively sluggish, necessitating additional hardware and/or software to handle fault scenarios. Furthermore, the droop characteristics need to be meticulous designed with unavoidable frequency and voltage deviations. Additionally, a distinct current limitation control is indispensable to guarantee the secure operation of GFM inverters. Efforts to leverage model predictive control (MPC) techniques in grid-tied inverters for fast control have been reported. Nonetheless, many of these approaches deal with challenges like high current harmonics, the impact of delay time, discrepancies in model parameters, and an ongoing reliance on PLLs (or FLLs). Furthermore, the fault ride-through capabilities, including scenarios like LVRT, have yet to be thoroughly explored within MPC-based methods. The focal point of this research is to introduce PLL-less deadbeat-based control methods for SiC GFL and GFM inverters. The aim is to simultaneously enhance system stability, reliability, dynamic response, and fault ride through capabilities. These methods are realized on 50kHz SiC inverters, implementing a unified control algorithm spanning steady-state, transient, and LVRT scenarios. Notably, the mitigation of inrush currents does not necessitate supplementary hardware circuits or transient controllers. Moreover, the need for intricate and time-consuming controller parameter design is circumvented, ensuring ease of implementation. Importantly, the global stability of the proposed methods is established and verified mathematically.</abstract>
