   <abstract >Allyship is the act of supporting and advocating for members of marginalized groups with the goal of promoting equality, inclusion, and social justice. While the concept of allyship has recently gained traction in the media and academic literature, the effects of allyship lack empirical support. This dissertation aims to explain how trust in the ally can influence marginalized employees' perceptions of allyship experiences and impact the effectiveness of allyship. I utilized Conservation of Resources (COR) theory to hypothesize that allyship indirectly affects employee work outcomes via resources generated by the allyship experience. In addition, I proposed that the marginalized employee's trust in the ally would moderate this indirect relationship, such that higher trust in the ally would lead to more resource gains, but when trust is low, this moderated indirect effect would be weakened. I conducted two studies to test my hypotheses - a two-wave longitudinal survey study and an experimental vignette study. The two-wave longitudinal survey study used a sample of marginalized employees recruited on Prolific, and captured the extent to which the allyship experiences translated into resources (e.g., emotional support, instrumental support, psychological empowerment, and participation in decision making) for the marginalized employee and influenced marginalized employees' work outcomes. Furthermore, the moderated indirect effect of trust in the ally was also examined. In this study (study 1), allyship was positively related to marginalized employees' perceptions of emotional support, instrumental support, psychological empowerment, and PDM, but the indirect effect of allyship on employee work outcomes and the moderated indirect effect of trust were not supported. To examine the moderating effect of trust on marginalized employees' perceptions of resources, trust in the ally was manipulated through vignettes that varied on the description of trust in the ally in allyship interactions at work. Results of Study 2 indicated that the presence of an ally was an important factor which enhanced marginalized employees' perceptions of emotional support, instrumental support, and participation in decision making (PDM). This dissertation offers both theoretical and practical contributions to allyship research.</abstract>
