   <abstract >This study investigates the accessibility of Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) treatment facilities in Florida, focusing on geographical disparities and examining how accessibility varies across different income groups, racial demographics, and age groups. Utilizing Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and travel time analysis, the research provides a comprehensive view of accessibility variations at the county and block group levels, applying both nearest opportunity and cumulative opportunity models. The analysis highlights significant disparities among the counties, with Monroe and Franklin exhibiting the highest travel costs, reflecting substantial accessibility challenges. This study also identifies disparities in accessibility among different income groups, indicating that individuals with higher incomes face greater travel costs, potentially due to residing in areas with fewer treatment facilities. Conversely, those earning $14K or less experience slightly lower travel costs. This pattern underscores the need for targeted strategies to improve accessibility for all income groups, particularly in high-cost counties like Taylor and Highlands, where travel costs are exceptionally high for all income groups. The study further reveals notable disparities in accessibility across different racial and ethnic. White residents have an average travel cost closely aligned with the overall average, while Black and Asian residents face slightly higher costs, and Hispanic residents experience somewhat lower travel costs. In high-burden counties such as Taylor, Black residents face significantly higher travel costs than the county average, indicating that racial minorities in certain areas encounter extreme accessibility challenges. These findings highlight the need for targeted policy interventions to address these disparities. In terms of age group accessibility, the study finds that age alone does not significantly impact travel costs to OUD treatment facilities. The average travel cost for the total population and various age groups (18-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-64, and 65+) falls within a narrow range, suggesting consistent accessibility challenges across age demographics. However, specific metro counties such as Broward, Palm Beach, and Miami-Dade demonstrate lower travel costs across all age groups, indicating better accessibility in these regions due to higher facility density and developed infrastructure. The findings underscore the urgent need for strategic planning and policy interventions to improve accessibility to OUD treatment facilities in Florida. Addressing these challenges requires a multifaceted approach, including the expansion of treatment facilities in underserved areas, improved transportation infrastructure, and enhanced public awareness and education about available treatment options. Future research should consider dynamic models and real-time data to provide more accurate assessments of accessibility and explore the impact of other socio-economic factors on treatment accessibility.</abstract>
