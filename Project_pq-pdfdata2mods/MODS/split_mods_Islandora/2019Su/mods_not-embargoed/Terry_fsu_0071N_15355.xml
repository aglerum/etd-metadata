   <abstract xmlns="">This study will examine St. John's II period subsistence practices along the St. John's River through faunal analysis of archaeological material from the Shields Mound site (8DU12). Shields Mound, and the nearby Grant Mound, were originally excavated by C.B. Moore in 1893. His excavations focused on describing the appearance and features of the mounds, as well as, providing a detailed description of the stratigraphic changes encountered during excavation of the main mound and the artifacts that were discovered. Between 1999 and 2002, Keith Ashley, revisited the site to gain a better understanding of the village area associated with the mounds, as this was not a focus of Moore's excavation. Ashley (2005) determined the mounds were representative of the St. John's II period (A.D. 900-1250). His research focused on introducing the Mill Cove Complex within which Shields Mound is located and developing an understanding of the site in general. A 2005 issue of The Florida Anthropologist was dedicated to findings from the Mill Cove Complex. Marrinan (2005) completed faunal analysis from three distinct shell midden locations of the site: Kinsey's Knoll, Bluff Midden, and Reeve's Rise. Rolland (2005) additionally analyzed the ceramics that were discovered during excavations to determine what types were most prominent in the assemblages. Penders (2005) contributed to the understanding of the site through an analysis of bone, antler, tooth, and shell artifacts from the features that were excavated. Since 2005, Ashley and students have returned to the Shields Mound area and excavated additional samples. A primary goal of this study, therefore, is to utilize the information from these studies, as well as additional research, to determine if ritual activity, specifically feasting activity, was occurring at Shields Mound. I will utilize data from additional locations in the vicinity of Shields Mound and compare these data with criteria proposed by Jackson and Scott (1995) on feasting at an inland site. I will also consider any additional evidence, such as quantity and size of ceramic vessels, quantity of artifacts discovered, and the role of prestige or high-status species diversification, in my analysis to determine if ritual activity was occurring at Shields.</abstract>
