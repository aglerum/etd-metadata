   <abstract xmlns="">This dissertation contains emotion. In fact, it is about emotion, and particularly how emotions can disrupt and otherwise force us to reexamine our preconceived notions (or hypothetically predicted values) about important facets of our lives. This dissertation is also about autonomy and the prospect of death, and especially how human emotion changes the conversation surrounding these important topics. I am particularly interested in how the conversation about advance directives only indirectly (or often not at all) addresses emotion, given how emotionally invested most people are in their life (and, when they think about it, the prospect of their demise). I suggest in this dissertation that this is, at least plausibly and perhaps only in part, due to historically patriarchal forces that have caused a kind of cultural blindness surrounding emotion, though this is steadily being rectified by feminists and feminist allies. To return to advance directives, I intend to examine these medical documents from numerous angles. This examination becomes complicated by the cases that I have in mind, which are when advance directives are supposed to provide some measure of control and respect for autonomy for persons who will have dementia or other cognitively declining illnesses. These are popular cases in the literature to look at, but more than that, these are people who are potentially the most vulnerable in these important decisions because a person with dementia is no longer able to advocate for themselves in many cases, even if they have *advocated* for their interests previously via an advance directive. I intend to provide arguments that challenge their creation, arguments that challenge their sustained authority over incompetent patients, and arguments that show that other arguments in favor of them fail, perhaps for many reasons, but perhaps more importantly, because of their neglect of emotion. I do not intent to provide a robust theory of what an emotion is, but rather examine how they function in our decision-making and how considerations regarding the kind of knowledge and value they provide can help us recognize important realities that our cold rationality may miss. In the end, I do not argue that advance directives should be done away with entirely. Instead, I argue that the literature holds them in too high a regard in many cases, and even with the best of circumstances in completing them (which is by no means a common occurrence), the emotions provide several routes for argumentation that shows their authority over persons with dementia should be reduced to one tool among many in a complex and fraught decision-making process. Even if my arguments should fail to persuade the reader, I contend that examining such an important dimension of the human experience can only provide valuable insight and wisdom regarding an incredibly difficult issue.</abstract>
