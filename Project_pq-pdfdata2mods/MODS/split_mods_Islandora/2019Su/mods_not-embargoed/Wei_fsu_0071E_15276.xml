   <abstract xmlns="">The purpose of this study was to explore the issue of social class in art education. As mentioned in my theoretical framework underlying this study, Bourdieu (1973/2000) used the term cultural capital as forms of knowledge, tastes, and practices to explain the relationship between knowledge and power in the field of education. I employed Bourdieu's concepts of cultural capital to further develop my argument on the relationship between social class and visual arts education. By using qualitative comparative case study methods, I examined the similarities and differences in the implementation of visual art education between two selected third-grade classes with distinct aggregations of student socioeconomic status, yet taught by the same itinerant art teacher in the same county¬. I scrutinized and compared the two cases with respect to their overall access to art education resources, including funding, materials, and allotment of time for instruction; the art-related knowledge, values, and skills taught and emphasized in each art classroom; the similarities and differences between the two cases in terms of how art instruction was implemented and the art teacher's reasons for differentiating or not differentiating art instruction. This study was conducted in a metropolitan area in Virginia. I used purposeful sampling to select my participant—one itinerant visual art teacher, who traveled between and worked at a Title 1 elementary school and another elementary school within a relatively affluent area with a much lower rate of students eligible for the National School Lunch Program (NSLP). The difference in the percentages of students enrolling in the NSLP between these two schools is up to 73%. The fieldwork took place from October 2017 until March 2018. Through fieldwork, I collected data through observation, interviews, and relevant document collection. I then organized and analyzed the collected data during April 2018 to November 2018 and began to write the findings in December 2018. My data analysis strategies included writing initial codes and memos, generating patterns and themes, and selecting cross-cases themes and topics. The cross-case comparison identified the following findings: (1) the economic and racial/ethnic differences between the two school communities; (2) the disparities in external educational resources; (3) the differences in students' learning foundations and inspirations; (4) the emphasis on formalist aesthetics and craftsmanship in art instruction aligning with Virginia's Visual Art Standards; (5) the different in students' learning outcomes in art; and (6) the different cultures of learning between the two classes. Holding postmodern perspectives as my philosophical framework for this study, I value the local contexts in which I conducted this study and encourage readers to construct their own judgment and interpretation. Expanding upon my findings, I provided the implications of my study for visual arts coordinators and administrators, art education practitioners, and art teacher training programs in higher education. To further investigate the issue of social class in art education, I also recommended a multitude of relevant issues with methodologies to be used in future research.</abstract>
