   <abstract xmlns="">Up to 37% of United States adults experience psychological distress at clinically high levels; however, the majority of them do not seek psychological help. Reluctance to seek help is exacerbated in rural culture, as rural people are less likely to seek psychological help than urban people. A review of the literature revealed that one highly prevalent rural factor that may affect help-seeking is perceived stigma. Rural emphasis on self-reliance and religiosity, limited knowledge of mental illness, and confidentiality concerns are all stigma-related variables that have been shown to influence rural people's decision to seek help. Prior to the current study, the influence of perceived stigma in the link between psychological distress and willingness to seek psychological help had not been examined specifically among rural people. Further, many of the existing studies on stigma-related factors examined one factor at a time and are of qualitative nature. Within a rural-only sample, the current study examined the moderating effect of perceived stigma between psychological distress and willingness to seek psychological help. Also, this study examined the predictive abilities of self-reliance, religiosity, confidentiality concerns, and knowledge of mental illness when predicting perceived stigma and willingness to seek psychological help. Findings of this study suggest that knowledge of mental disorders is most influential on rural willingness to seek psychological help – more so than self-reliance, confidentiality concerns, and religiosity. Further, confidentiality concerns emerged as most impactful on perceived stigma among rural adults – more so than knowledge of mental disorders, self-reliance, and religiosity. Greater knowledge was associated with more help-seeking willingness, and greater confidentiality concerns were associated with more perceived stigma. However, perceived stigma was not significantly related to willingness to seek psychological help, nor did it moderate the relation between psychological distress and willingness to seek psychological help. Interestingly, greater psychological distress experienced by rural people was associated with less willingness to seek psychological help, suggesting a reverse relation between distress and help-seeking than that found in the general population. Clinical consideration of study findings may help combat the unique challenges associated with help-seeking in rural communities – challenges viewed by some mental health professionals as unsolvable or hopeless. As knowledge of mental disorders and confidentiality concerns emerged as the most important factors in willingness to seek psychological help and perceived stigma, respectively, interventions aimed to target these two factors may improve acceptability and utilization of rural mental healthcare. Integration of mental health education into primary care and community outreach partnerships (with churches, organizations, etc.) may positively influence rural adults' willingness to seek psychological help. Further, discussing manners of maintaining confidentiality during the aforementioned educational interventions may help ease perceived stigma toward mental illness among rural residents. As mental health providers can work to improve mental health literacy and confidentiality concerns, findings of this study suggest that rural mental health challenges may not be as "unsolvable" as previously believed.</abstract>
