   <abstract>For close to a decade, the Jefferson County School District (JCSD) was characterized by failed academic performance and financial instability. Some of the factors that drove these outcomes include school board dysfunction, poor use of financial resources, failure to recruit and retain highly effective teachers, revolving school leaders, and the absence of accountability. In the fall of 2016, the State of Florida declared the district in a state of financial emergency and directed the local school board to close all schools, to then be reopened under charter management. The is a single-case study designed to examine stakeholder perceptions and levels of satisfaction after four years of the charter-operated turnaround of the Jefferson County School District's schools. The district, located in rural north Florida, was reputed to be the State's worst-performing school district. The study will focus on the changes in the schools as viewed through the eyes of stakeholders and juxtaposed against standard school improvement measures. The research questions sought understanding of how stakeholders perceived the effects of school charterization on district education, how teachers perceived their school's environment, and the degree of leadership competencies of the principals. Data was collected through semi-structured behavioral event interviews with principals, a teacher survey, stakeholder focus groups, and archived documentation. The investigative findings surfaced overall school improvement. Through charterization, the school district progressed, but not up to promised academic standards, or stakeholder expectations. It also revealed that stakeholders recognized other factors that affected Jefferson's educational progress as low parental and community involvement, stalled economic development, and a lingering racial divide.</abstract>
