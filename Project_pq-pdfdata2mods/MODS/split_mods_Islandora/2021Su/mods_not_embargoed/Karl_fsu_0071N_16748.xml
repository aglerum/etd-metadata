   <abstract>Wetlands are important geographic features that are essential for biodiversity and water quality. Climate change and anthropogenic forces are affecting GIWs and are drastically changing the natural processes within them. Geographically isolated wetlands, or GIWs, are wetlands with limited surficial connections to other sources of water. Geographically isolated wetlands are considered "isolated" as implied by their name, but previous research shows that these wetlands are in communication through the water table through comprehensive modeling. However, there is a lack of observational evidence regarding how these wetlands transmit groundwater. The connectivity between GIWs, their organic carbon storage capacity, and their transmission potential for contaminants, such as trace metals, are poorly understood. This study quantified the connectivity of these wetlands through pore fluid, groundwater, and sediment analysis. Trace metals are incorporated into the crystal lattice of iron and manganese (Fe/Mn) oxides when Fe/Mn oxides form in the water column and in sediments. This remobilization allows trace metals to move out of the sediments where they are available for uptake by plants and animals and allows for binding to highly mobile colloidal organic matter. In contrast, long periods of high standing water levels in GIWs could facilitate sequestering of trace elements into organic matter through reduction in the presence of anoxic or sulfidic sediments after the depletion of oxygen. The term sulfidic refers to a water column that is absent of free molecular oxygen with H2S present in the sediments or in the water column. The data created in this study supports the presence of mild anoxia within the sediments of the GIWs. This anoxia allows for molybdenum to become concentrated within the submerged wetland soil. The sediments however were not sulfidic, as reducible sulfate was limited and could not produce hydrogen sulfide in significant enough quantities. The presence of anoxia is very important for carbon reduction and sequestration. Depending on sulfate input into the GIWs, the potential for mitigation of methane production through providing an alternate electron donator is possible. While small, GIWs are prolific across the United States. The potential for methane mitigation to the atmosphere makes GIWs important for controlling greenhouse emissions. Maintaining the health of these ecosystems is important because when wetlands are damaged their mitigation potential is also damaged. The data in this study will serve as a valuable baseline for GIW health in the future as anthropogenic influences on them continue to grow.</abstract>
