   <abstract>Colombia, the northernmost country in South America, is full of classical musicians. From students of all ages to professionals, all of them are contributing to the increasing growth of the classical culture in the country. At the same time, during the last decades, there has been an increased interest in national music. Colombian music is based on syncopated rhythms, in most cases, having a strong sense of beat displacement. Pulse dissonance is one way to refer to this characteristic. Colombian composers are highly linked to such rhythms, incorporating them in most of their works, no matter what the genre might be. Gustavo Adolfo Parra is not only a perfect example of these composers, but as a teacher in one of the most important conservatories in the country, the Conservatory of the National University of Colombia, he is imparting his knowledge to a large generation of new composers. His former students Mateo Sepúlveda and James Díaz, two young professional composers, demonstrate how they have applied Parra's teachings to their career. Similarly, violinists in Colombia are also expanding their sense of nationalism by performing more Colombian music and including it in their own studio's repertoire, inspiring students to proudly play the music of the nation. In most Colombian universities, it has not always been this way. Instead, the violin repertoire has been based on European academic music. Fortunately, this new attachment to Colombian music has a prominent future, and now can be passed to future generations. Furthermore, Colombian music is gaining international popularity. There are Colombian musicians in all parts of the world playing their national music and making it accessible to international audiences. That is the most important purpose of this project. A brief history of music in Colombia will provide context; interviews with professional violinists now living in Colombia will give some perspective on the current practices in the Colombian musical field, and the violin music by Gustavo Parra, Mateo Sepúlveda, and James Díaz will serve as examples of the present creative output in the country. Colombian composers have a bast range of styles today. Parra's violin concerto will serve as a link to traditional European forms, and his Bambuco "María" as a pure traditional Colombian genre. Sepúlveda's "Ecos" and Díaz's "Her Letters" are contemporary in nature, but both works show their link not only to Gustavo Parra, but to this Colombian attachment to syncopated rhythms.</abstract>
