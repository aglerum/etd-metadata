   <abstract>Demand for opportunities to earn accelerated credit has steadily grown over the past few decades. Increasingly, students are earning more credits via a variety of acceleration options, including but not limited to Advanced Placement (AP), dual enrollment (DE), and International Baccalaureate (IB). These acceleration options may be high-school-based or college-based and provide students with opportunities to earn college credit while in high school, which may better prepare students for college, increase postsecondary performance, and shorten time to degree (TTD) completion. Overwhelmingly, studies examining the outcomes of accelerated credit attainment have found benefits, however, these studies frequently focus on one acceleration option or one type of acceleration (i.e. high-school-based or college-based). Further, many studies have failed to examine joint participation in more than one acceleration option, a trend that has increased as students seek greater rigor during high school. However, disparities in access to accelerated coursework exist for some students, particularly students in rural areas. Using data on seven cohorts of students who matriculated at a Research 1 university in Florida, this study uses linear and logistic regression with high school fixed effects to examine the postsecondary performance of students with accelerated credit. Postsecondary performance is measured by first-year grade point average (GPA), first-year retention, graduation, cumulative GPA, and TTD completion, and the analytic sample includes 23,745 first-time-in-college students who graduated from public high schools in Florida. Results in the aggregate show that accelerated credit attainment is positively related to postsecondary performance. When disaggregating results by type of accelerated credit, results remain mostly positive, with few exceptions. Specifically, students earning accelerated credit from DE only had lower odds of retention compared to students with no accelerated credit, and students with accelerated credit from DE only, IB only, and DE and IB jointly had lower cumulative GPAs at the time of graduation. Other findings show small, positive gains to first-year and cumulative GPA, increased odds of retention and graduation, and shorter TTD completion.</abstract>
