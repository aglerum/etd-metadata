   <abstract>Decades of sentencing research have demonstrated that there are discrepancies in punishment outcomes based on race and ethnicity, gender, age, and social structures, net of legally relevant factors. These findings have led to increased concerns around fairness, equality, and justice of the law for minority citizens involved in the criminal court system. However, little is known about how the combined effects of status characteristics across contexts influence disparities in sentencing. The purpose of the current research is to address the inattention of analyzing the intersection of individual-level characteristics across racial and ethnic contexts and how these effects contribute to sentencing disparities. The intersectionality thesis and the racial/ethnic threat perspective are used as the conceptual guides for the present study. Intersectionality posits that individuals are characterized by socially constructed identities that are closely intertwined that can only be understood by examining them together rather than individually (Choo &amp; Ferree, 2010; Crenshaw, 2012). The racial/ethnic threat perspective, first articulated by Blalock (1967), argues that as the minority population grows progressively larger, criminal justice actors will use social control measures against minorities in order to control the perceived threat. This dissertation explores the intersection of individual-level characteristics across racial and ethnic contexts and how these effects contribute to sentencing disparities. Specifically, this study addresses whether the combined effects of race, ethnicity, gender, and age produce differential sentencing outcomes and if this relationship is conditioned by the county's racial or ethnic population context in which defendants are sentenced. The data from this project are taken from the 2010-2017 Florida Department of Corrections Sentencing Guidelines database and the Offender Based Information System. The county-level measures were extracted from the2010 United States Census and Uniform Crime Report. Multinomial logistic regression modeling techniques are utilized to explore the combined effects of status characteristics across minority contexts on punishment decisions. The results suggest that the combined effects of race, ethnicity, gender, and age significantly influence sentencing outcomes. Specifically, minority men of various ages receive a punishment penalty whereas, minority women of various ages are granted leniency. Moreover, the racial/ethnic context of an area significantly impacts the punishment that defendants receive. Latino men and women of various ages receive harsher sentencing outcomes when sentenced in areas with a growing ethnic presence. However, in counties with larger Black populations, the likelihood of an incarceration sanction decreases for Black males and females of all ages. Overall, the findings lend support to the notion that the combined effects of extra-legal factors across racial/ethnic contexts are used to shape the distribution of punishment.</abstract>
