   <abstract >I became interested in discovering new clarinet concertos after signing a three-year artist contract with the Mu Phi Epsilon Foundation to present new works. My background and passion for classical, jazz, and new music led me to explore pieces that combined these stylistic influences. Two pieces captured my imagination and became the focus of my research: Daniel Freiberg’s Latin American Chronicles and Frank Proto’s Paganini in Metropolis. This treatise (in conjunction with two lecture recitals presented in Fall 2018 and Spring 2019) will focus on the lives and music of Daniel Freiberg and Frank Proto. My hope is to provide a spotlight for these composers and their works, and the potential of these pieces to break boundaries between jazz and classical styles in the clarinet community. Daniel Freiberg was inspired to write his concerto for the principal clarinetist of Westdeutscher Rundfunk Köln (WDR) Radio Orchestra, Andy Miles. Known in Europe as a crossover artist, Miles has an unusual resume as a saxophonist in rock bands, tin whistler in folk bands, and clarinetist in jazz band and orchestras. At the time he reached out to Freiberg, Miles was making an album titled “Symphonic Jazz with Andy Miles,” with other notable composers Jorge Calandrelli and Jeff Beal. Looking to find more pieces, he reached out to Freiberg. Latin American Chronicles was commissioned in 2015 by the WDR Symphony Orchestra from Cologne, Germany, directed by Wayne Marshall. Comprised of three movements, the work explores classical, jazz, and South American folk music. Frank Proto collaborated with Eddie Daniels, a high school classmate, to write his concerto. Arguably, one of the most influential jazz clarinetists in recent years, Eddie Daniels has had a profound impact on this genre, inspiring composers such as Jorge Calandrelli and Jeff Beal to write jazz-inspired concertos for him. Between 1994 and 2001, Proto explained those years to be the series of “Paganini Pieces.” He had written Capriccio di Niccolo for Doc Severinson in 1994, followed by Nine Variants on Paganini for Francois Rabbath in 2002. While Daniels was on tour, the University of Texas Wind Ensemble led by Jerry Junkin, wanted something new and special to perform, which led to the commission of Paganini in Metropolis in 2002. The premiere was a rousing success, leading to another commission of Paganini in 2003 with the Santa Fe Symphony Orchestra, Eddie Daniels, and conductor David Wroe. This treatise will provide a brief background for Daniel Freiberg and Frank Proto, historical information about each piece, and how they integrate different stylistic elements, ultimately leading to the expansion of the boundaries of classical music.</abstract>
