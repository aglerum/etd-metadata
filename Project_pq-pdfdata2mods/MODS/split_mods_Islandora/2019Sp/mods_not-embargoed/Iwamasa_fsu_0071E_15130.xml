   <abstract >Music therapy degree programs originated in the 1940s and while programs have come and gone, not much was known about the profession’s trends. The current education policy was adopted in 2000, two years after the National Association for Music Therapy and the American Association for Music Therapy unified to form one governing organization called the American Music Therapy Association. In the decades since the first degree program was started, research focused primarily around entry-level competencies and curriculum issues. While the profession encountered meaningful growth in degree programs and enrollment, concerns were expressed regarding a possible shortage of doctorally prepared faculty. Full-time faculty openings are increasing along with a growing number of programs. Enrollment in undergraduate and master’s degree programs are also increasing. Hence, it is imperative that program trends and demand for qualified educators be examined. However, forecasting growth in programs, enrollment, and the need for faculty have not been investigated. The purpose of this study was to provide a descriptive analysis of current degree programs and full-time faculty, and to forecast future development of degree programs, enrollment, and the need for qualified faculty for the coming decade. The Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model was used as the forecasting method and the models predict that music therapy degree programs will grow a modest 6% compared to the prior decade’s 17% growth. Music therapy enrollment at NASM accredited schools, will grow more rapidly at 34%, however it is still less than the 65% growth experienced from 2000 to 2018. Demand for new full-time faculty was estimated based on retirement trends and enrollment projections. The need for new faculty will expand by 80 full-time positions through 2030. Limitations of the study, the culture of higher education and its impact on future degree program development and faculty recruitment, as well as policy considerations are discussed.</abstract>
