   <abstract >As a field, higher education frequently assumes lived experiences of undergraduate students, such as participating in student activism, are automatically experiential learning opportunities; however, there is a lack of research focusing and featuring students' voices on the matter. In this preliminary research study, qualitative research methods were utilized to explore the lived experiences of undergraduate students, specifically focusing on their engagement in student activism and how leadership learning may be a feature of that lived experience. Through the use of phenomenology, this study captured the lived experiences of participants regarding their activism engagement, as well as examined participants' meaning making processes regarding said experiences. This study approached leadership learning through Bertrand Jones et al.'s (2016) culturally relevant leadership learning model, specifically, leadership learning is any growth through the reciprocal relationship between an individual and the leadership process via engagement in identity, capacity, and efficacy. Additionally, activism was conceptualized in this study through Harro's (2000) cycle of liberation, therefore and action taken in an attempt to enact intrapersonal, interpersonal, or systemic change is activism. Data collection for this study consisted of the six participants completing two written reflections; two in-depth, semi-structured, virtual individual interviews; and the presentation of an artifact representing their lived activism experiences. Findings of this study revealed leadership learning is a feature of participants' lived student activism experiences through their engagement in the leadership process through identity, capacity, and efficacy. Additionally, it was revealed that all participants had a shared understanding of what constituted as activism; however, some participants identified a difference in one engaging in activism and identifying as an activist. Further, this study's findings also indicated that lived experience is not always enough and that further meaning making and reflection may be required for undergraduate students to make a connection between their activism engagement and their leadership engagement. Finally, this study highlighted the vital role institutions play in student engagement in both activism and leadership.</abstract>
