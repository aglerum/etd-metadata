   <abstract >Background: It is well established that resistance training (RT) can positively impact musculoskeletal health, physical performance, and cognitive wellness. In contrast, binge drinking can have harmful effects on the aforementioned characteristics. Interestingly, those who exercise more tend to binge drink alcohol more frequently and consume greater quantities of alcohol. Because the college years are developmentally sensitive and binge drinking is at its highest level compared to other segments of life, recent research has focused on the relationship among RT, binge drinking, and various health markers. A population of interest is young adult females as they tend to perform RT less than males, have a hormonal milieu making them more susceptible to alcohol-induced musculoskeletal issues, and have a higher prevalence of psychological disorders which may be exacerbated by alcohol consumption. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine how RT and binge drinking impact musculoskeletal health, physical performance, and cognitive wellness in young adult females. Methods: Young adult females (age: 22.19 ± 2.54 years; BMI: 23.21 ± 3.00 kg/m2) were split into 4 groups: 1) sedentary low alcohol consumers (SL; n = 12), 2) sedentary binge drinkers (SB; n = 12), 3) resistance trained low alcohol consumers (RTL; n = 12), and 4) resistance trained binge drinkers (RTB; n = 12). To be classified as sedentary, participants performed exercise on average ≤2 days per week for at least the past 2 years. To be classified as resistance trained, participants performed RT on average ≥4 times per week for at least the past 2 years. To be classified as a low alcohol consumer, participants consumed on average ≤1 alcoholic drink per week for at least the past year. To be classified as a binge drinker, participants binge drank at least once per week for at least the past year. RT and alcohol consumption were determined through self-report. Body composition was measured along with bone mineral density (BMD) via dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan (total body, spine, and non-dominant hip). Muscle quality was assessed at the non-dominant rectus femoris via ultrasonography. Insulin sensitivity was assessed via an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) using capillary blood glucose. Physical performance was assessed through chair stand power, vertical jump, squat jump, broad jump, knee extensor torque, push-ups to failure, and grip strength. Cognitive function was assessed through the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, Digit Span Test, and 30 second counting task. Psychological wellness was assessed through the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, Profile of Mood States, Short Form 36, and Friendship Scale. The primary analysis was conducted using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and when normality or homogeneity of variances was violated, non-parametric testing was performed. Results: Compared to sedentary females, resistance trained females had a lower body fat percentage (RTL = 29.28 ± 4.27; RTB = 29.03 ± 3.67; SL = 37.18 ± 5.32; SB = 34.83 ± 3.54; p &lt; .05). RTL had more fat-free mass than SL and SB (RTL = 48.31 ± 5.81 kg; SL = 38.08 ± 6.59 kg; SB = 40.37 ± 6.05 kg; both p &lt; .05). There were no differences between RTL and RTB on BMD, muscle quality, or physical performance tests and both groups trended to outperform or significantly outperformed SL and SB. RTL outperformed SL and SB on vertical jump (both p &lt; .05) while RTB outperformed SL and SB on broad jump (both p &lt; .05). RTL did have a lower fasting blood glucose than RTB (88.92 ± 12.09 mg/dL and 103.17 ± 10.21 mg/dL, respectively; p = .008), and RTL had lower blood glucose at 120 minutes of the OGTT than all groups (RTL = 103.83 ± 19.82 mg/dL; RTB = 137.58 ± 21.54 mg/dL; SL = 148.50 ± 44.60 mg/dL; SB = 139.25 ± 14.49 mg/dL; all p &lt; .05). There were no significant differences in measures of cognitive wellness between the groups. Conclusion: These data suggest chronic binge drinking does not deleteriously impact body composition, BMD, physical performance, or muscle quality in young adult females who participate in RT at least 4 times per week. However, even in young adult females who participate in habitual RT and have comparable body composition to low alcohol consumers, chronic binge drinking does impair glucose tolerance as indicated by elevated fasting and 2-hour OGTT blood glucose. Future research should investigate the various metabolic effects chronic binge drinking has in young adult populations as these are sensitive years to form long-term, lifestyle habits and attenuate disease risk later in life.</abstract>
