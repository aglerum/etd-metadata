   <abstract >The objective of this study was to evaluate how the design of the built environment can assist schoolteachers in their use of constructivist techniques as students transition from learning by play to didactic learning in early elementary learning spaces. With the increased expectations and standards for early elementary school, how can the built environment support both teachers and constructivist learning approaches such as experiential and active learning strategies to increase interactive and playful learning? Children's transition to structured schooling is associated with new experiences and challenges for students and parents. Students experience new environments, people, and modes of learning (Fabian &amp; Dunlop, 2007). In addition to this impactful life transition as children enter primary school, increased state-mandated standards have resulted in more didactic teaching approaches in kindergarten causing an abrupt transition to sedentary learning from play focused learning in prekindergarten ("The New First Grade: Too Much Too Soon," 2006; Miller &amp; Almon, 2009). However, Friedrich Froebel's intent for kindergarten was far different than what we see today, with kindergartens looking far different when compared to the original and prekindergarten in the United States more accurately resembling Froebel's vision (Fabian &amp; Dunlop, 2007). Early childhood theorists, Piaget and Vygotsky, deemed learning by play essential for young children, proving critical for social and emotional skills (Wenner, 2009; Barros, Silver, &amp; Stein, 2009; Coolahan, Fantuzzo, Mendez, &amp; McDermott, 2000; Raver &amp; Ziegler, 1997; Fantuzzo &amp; McWayne, 2002; Coolahan, Fantuzzo, Mendez, &amp; McDermott, 2000; Yogman, 2018). There is evidence to show children in early elementary school, learn best by doing; (Taylor &amp; Boyer, 2019; Yogman, 2018) so, the physical classroom environment and supportive learning spaces should support this type of active and playful learning by providing spaces that allow teachers to engage their students in these types of learning experiences. Priorities have shifted due to increased expectations as many teachers find themselves in a dilemma balancing didactic teaching for learning standards versus developmentally appropriate practices. Design considerations of the physical classroom impact how a teacher engages students in subject matter (Byers, Imms, &amp; Hartnell-Young, 2014; Thomas, 2010; Monahan, 2002). Design of the built environment can also assist teachers' utilization of active learning strategies through intentional space planning and design programming. This study hopes to understand how learning spaces can support active learning, equipping teachers with the spaces, layout, and technology needed to accommodate active learning practices to meet required objectives. By evaluating constructivist active learning strategies through a qualitative study, the researcher aims to use design as a tool to lessen the abrupt change from playful learning to sedentary learning commonly occurring as students transition into primary school. Findings from a teacher focus group provided the researcher with emergent themes aligning with constructivist pedagogy for Florida's early elementary learning standards. Focus group discussion provided the researcher with the design considerations and programming criteria to form a comprehensive design solution to ease the transition into didactic learning through a variety of learning environments and design considerations supportive of active learning strategies.</abstract>
