   <abstract >A playing position that many sports team cannot play without is a goalkeeper. Goalkeepers hold a vital role on their team due to their unique positional requirements such as being the last line of defense and having task and motivational leadership obligations. As a result, it can be argued that they are a highly instrumental or indispensable playing position within their team. It can also be suggested that the cognitive, emotional, and behavioral outcomes goalkeepers might face are related to their indispensability towards their teams' success and the relationship with their team and coach. Thus, the purposes of the present study were to determine if goalkeepers were the most indispensable position in their sport and to understand what makes them indispensable. Additionally, this study examined the outcomes of perceived indispensability for athletes and determined if the team environment acted as a moderator. A sample of 229 athletes from 47 competitive collegiate teams completed an online survey comprised of measures for self-perceptions of indispensability and leadership duties, other perceptions of indispensability and leadership duties of playing positions, effort, enjoyment, concerns over mistakes, perceived pressure, anxiety, excitement, team-cohesion, and the coach-athlete relationship. By conducting multiple quantitative analyses, the results showed that goalkeepers are perceived by their teammates to be the most indispensable due to their role requirements and leadership duties. The results also revealed that the more indispensable the athletes feel, the greater effort, excitement, and enjoyment they have when competing. Athletes' individual attraction and relatedness to their team's tasks and goals was found to moderate the relationships between self-indispensability and athletes' thoughts of concerns over mistakes and perceived pressure. These findings support and add to the definition and outcomes of social indispensability. The present study can provide practitioners and coaches with an increased awareness of the cognitive, behavioral, emotional, and social impact of being a goalkeeper as well as teach them importance of helping athletes improve perceptions of self-indispensability.</abstract>
