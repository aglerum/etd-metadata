   <abstract >Deficits in general cognitive functions, measured via reductions in the P300 ERP component, are commonly observed in adults suffering from depression compared to controls. Despite this extensive literature in adult samples, the relationship between P300 and depression during childhood and adolescence is greatly understudied. Considering risk for depression dramatically increases during adolescence, especially for females and as individuals age further into adolescence, examination of the neurological underpinnings of depression during this critical developmental period can help us further elucidate pathways that better explain this increased risk as well as increase our overall understanding of the etiology of depressive disorders. Therefore, the present study sought to examine the cross-sectional associations between P300 amplitude, depression symptoms, sex, and age in two large samples of adolescents (sample 1: ages 8 to 14; sample 2: ages 11 to 14) at both a baseline (sample 1: n = 307; sample 2: n = 608) and follow-up visit (sample 1: n = 252; sample 2: n = 448). More specifically, the P300 elicited from the doors stimuli in the doors gambling task was examined at each assessment. In line with past findings, smaller doors P300 amplitude was consistently associated to higher depressive symptoms at each assessment in both samples. Furthermore, this association was significantly moderated by participant age at the majority of assessments, such that the association between P300 and depression was increased in older adolescents. There was also evidence that sex significantly moderated this relationship suggesting that reductions in P300 amplitude related to increased depression was only present in females and not males. Additionally, doors P300 amplitude appeared to be uniquely associated to depressive symptoms even when controlling for current externalizing symptoms. Lastly, doors P300 exhibited good-to-excellent internal consistency at each assessment and good test-retest reliability over both two months and two years. In sum, the current project demonstrates that the relatively novel doors P300 component is a reliable neural correlate of depression during adolescence, and that this P300 component can assist in uncovering factors and pathways linked to increased risk for depression observed in adolescence.</abstract>
