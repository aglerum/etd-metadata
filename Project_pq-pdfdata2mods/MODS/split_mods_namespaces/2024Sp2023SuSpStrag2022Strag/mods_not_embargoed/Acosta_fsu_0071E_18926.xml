   <abstract>How Latinas experience their racial identity is unique when viewed through the Black and white racial dichotomy that exists in the United States. In Latin America, race is understood to be phenotypical and determined based off the color of your skin, whereas in the United States, race is often understood to be genotypical (Darity et. al, 2005), and designed to classify its citizens as "white" and "nonwhite." These classifications force Latinas to select a racial grouping that they might not fully feel represents them. For Latinas who racially appear as white, but ethnically identify with their family's country of origin, a certain dissonance can arise that can blur their perception of self. Living and learning in the United States as someone who presents racially as white but is a member of a marginalized community can provide insight to how whiteness shows up in certain spaces and functions as epidermic capital (Herring &amp; Hynes, 2017). This study is inspired by Anzaldúa's (1987) work on hyphenated-identities, in which she described as making her feel as if she is "ni de aquí, ni de allá." [not from here, nor from there]. Focusing on the hyphenated identity of being both white-presenting and Latina allows for richer discussions surrounding race to occur. Using testimonios as the methodology, with intersectionality (Crenshaw, 1997) through theory in the flesh (Anzaldúa &amp; Moraga, 1981) as a conceptual framework, this study sought to understand how six white-presenting Latina students experienced and made sense of their racial identity at an emerging Hispanic Serving Institution in the state of Florida. Data for this study was collected from participants through a screening tool, and two semi structured interviews which took the form of pláticas. Based on the themes of the study, participants experience with colorism, and racism informed how they made meaning of their identity which led to an actualization of their identity in college as they embarked on a quest for belonging. Some external factors that influenced meaning making of their racial identity ranged from notions of femininity and beauty, to navigating presumptions surrounding the Latina stereotype, to prioritizing being bilingual to feel connected to their Latina culture. The study concludes with a discussion on the findings in connection to the conceptual framework, and implications for practice and future discussions. Despite being socially constructed, race is socially significant and enacted in everyday life (Bonilla-Silva, 2015; Ray, 2022). It is the hope of this study that in learning how undergraduate white-presenting Latina students experience and make sense of their racial identity, higher education intuitions can become more intentional in creating physical spaces where all Latinas are able to feel "de aquí y de allá" [from here and from there].</abstract>
