   <abstract>College students previously in the foster care system are facing a lifelong achievement gap when looking at college retention and completion rates (Salazar, 2013). These college students uniquely face a myriad of challenges including an absence of social capital to help guide them through the bureaucracy of college, low socioeconomic status that can lead to food insecurity, unstable housing, and lack of reliable transportation, little academic readiness for the rigor of college coursework, and ongoing emotional trauma from their youth. These challenges affect their ability to persist from one semester to another and contribute to low completion rates of former foster youth nationwide. A lack of a college degrees impacts college students previously in the foster care system's academic future and their ability to have financial independence moving forward into adulthood. Salazar's (2013) comparison study on college graduates previously in the foster care system compared to their general counterparts, they found that college degrees bring a higher level of satisfaction and quality of life, including higher income potential, higher job satisfaction and quality of life, and "substantially lower rates of reliance on public welfare programs" (p. 139). Life attributes like income, housing, the need for public assistance, and mental health are generally found to be positively related to educational attainment (Okpych, 2012; Salazar, 2013). The Community Cultural Wealth theory advances an idea of cultural capital that acknowledges that a lack of said capital leaves members of society, often people of color or those from lower socio-economic backgrounds, at a disadvantage that extends to both education and their future lives (Yosso, 2005). Yosso challenges the deficit-based view of cultural and social capital and instead looks at the intrinsic strengths marginalized communities bring. In its place, Yosso identifies six forms of capital that underserved populations possess that "most often go unacknowledged or unrecognized" (Yosso, 2005, p. 70) by society and the educational system. This study sought to understand the perceptions and experiences of college students previously in the foster care system at a local state college while acknowledging the strengths and resilience these students bring with them to college. With the knowledge and understanding of the college experience and fostering a sense of belonging, institutions can make changes that increase persistence and completion rates improving the college experience of these students.</abstract>
