   <abstract>This dissertation is composed of three papers, each examining how households value an exogenous change in neighborhood amenities. The first chapter combines data from police incident reports to examine property values pre and post homicide. The second chapter examines move rates of owner-occupied single-family households whose next-door neighbor transitions from an owner-occupied single-family home to a renter-occupied single-family home. The third chapter examines how COVID-19 affected property values near Metrorail transit stations. The first chapter of my dissertation is called "Impact of a Homicide on Nearby Property Values: New Evidence from Miami-Dade County" In this paper, I look at the impact of a homicide on nearby property values. Employing a difference-in- difference methodology, I exploit a unique dataset containing dates and locations of homicides in Miami-Dade County over the period 2010-2018. I examine variation in property values pre and post-homicide within 0.1 miles, 0.1-0.2 miles, and 0.2-0.3 miles of a homicide. I find that homes within 0.1 miles post homicide sell for 4.8% less compared to homes slightly further away, significant at the 1% level. I then leverage data from police incident reports and the Florida Supplemental Homicide Report to obtain demographic characteristics for victims(s) and offender(s) in each homicide case. I find no statistically significant relationship between a particular offender group on housing prices post homicide. I do find a statistically significant negative relationship between all victim groups under 18, regardless of race or gender. This effect is most pronounced for white female victims under 18, as homes within 0.1 miles post homicide sell for 16.3% less. The second chapter is called "Do Renters Actually Cause Homeowners to Move: New Evidence from a Nearest Neighbors Design". This chapter uses a nearest neighbors design similar to Bayer et al (2024) to examine move rates of owner-occupied single family households whose next-door neighbor transitioned from an owner-occupied single-family home to a renter-occupied single-family home against owner- occupied households between two and five doors down who did not receive such a neighbor in the same quarter-year. I find those in the treatment group have a 7.24% higher move rate compared to households in the control group statistically significant at the 10% level. This effect is more pronounced for census blocks in the bottom and top quintile of the single-family rental rate distribution and census blocks in the top quintile of the churn rate distribution. Finally, I look at rental type and I find no statistically significant effect for non-corporate rentals as opposed to corporate rentals where the treatment group has a 11.12% higher move rate compared to the control group statistically significant at the 10% level. The third chapter is called "The Impact of Close Proximity to Metrorail Stations on Property Values during COVID-19 in Miami-Dade County". This chapter examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on property values near Metrorail transit stations in Miami-Dade County, Florida, using a difference-in-differences methodology. Results show that housing prices within 1/3 miles of a Metrorail station decreased by 12.2% post-COVID-19, with a persistent effect up to 1 mile. The heterogeneous impact analysis reveals that the negative effect was more pronounced in neighborhoods with high population density, older populations, higher income levels, and a higher share of Democrat voters. These findings suggest that the pandemic has altered households' valuation of urban amenities, particularly in neighborhoods with specific socioeconomic and political characteristics. The study highlights the need for targeted policy interventions to mitigate the negative effects on specific communities and adapt urban development strategies to changing preferences in the wake of the pandemic.</abstract>
