   <abstract>Although decades of empirical research have documented the significant relation between phonemic awareness and word reading, questions remain about the nature of this relationship over time. These questions are of particular interest when considering that learning (which is item-based and depends on the unique interaction between the skills a child brings to the task and item/word characteristics) results in continued changes to a child's word specific lexical representations (McClelland &amp; Rumelhart, 1986; Nation &amp; Castles, 2017; Rumelhart &amp; Norman, 1978; Seidenberg &amp; McClelland, 1989; Perfetti, 1991). While prior work exploring child and word effects on children's word recognition abilities have incorporated an extensive set of child-level and word-level predictors of word reading and decoding accuracy (e.g., Gilbert et al., 2011; Goodwin et al., 2014; Kearns et al., 2016; Steacy et al., 2022), to date there have been no investigations of phonological awareness at the child, word, and child-by-word level when predicting word reading accuracy. Using a sample of second-grade students (who demonstrated a distribution of word reading and decoding skills and whose phonological systems were at least partially established), this study aimed to further clarify the relationship between word reading accuracy and the quality of children's phonological representations utilizing Rasch-based Explanatory Item Response Models. This approach allowed for the exploration of the simultaneous contribution of child-level (e.g., phonological awareness, vocabulary, rapid naming, pseudoword decoding efficiency), word-level (e.g., length, phonological Levenshtein distance, concreteness, spelling-to-pronunciation transparency) and child-by-word level (e.g., word specific phonological awareness, word specific grapheme phoneme correspondence knowledge, word specific familiarity) predictors of word reading accuracy. A sample of 80 second-grade students (mean age = 8.21 years, 48.8% female, 70% White, 17.5% Hispanic, 7.5% African American) read 52 words from the Phonological Awareness Screening Test (PAST; Kilpatrick, 2021). At the child-level, pseudoword decoding efficiency and definitional vocabulary knowledge were significant predictors of word reading accuracy. At the word-level, spelling-to-pronunciation transparency rating, frequency of occurrence, and number of phonemes were significant predictors of a word being accurately read by an average child in our study. At the child-by-word level, neither a child's word specific phonological awareness, grapheme phoneme correspondence knowledge, nor familiarity were significant predictors of word reading accuracy. Because the probability of an average child reading an average word in the study was 0.96, results from this study suggest that these second-graders may have fully specified, stable (precise), and sufficiently redundant orthographic – O, phonological – P, and semantic – S, representations of the words in our study (Perfetti, 1991, 1992). As proposed by the Lexical Quality Hypothesis (Perfetti &amp; Hart, 2002), this redundancy can facilitate word recognition in the absence of complete and precise word knowledge (Adlof et al., 2016). For the children and the words in our study, the lack of significant child-by-word effects in our models may be representative of the important role precision and redundancy played in their word reading accuracy and the potential consequences of lexical quality (Perfetti, 2007).</abstract>
