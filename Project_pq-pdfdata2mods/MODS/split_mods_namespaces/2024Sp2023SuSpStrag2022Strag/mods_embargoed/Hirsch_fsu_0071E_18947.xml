   <abstract>Dysarthria is a motor speech disorder that results in changes to the quality of speech, often resulting in reduced speech intelligibility. Thus, interventions for dysarthria often target reduced intelligibility. However, there are limitations to relying on it as a sole perceptual outcome in dysarthria. Therefore, additional perceptual outcomes that can complement intelligibility measures need to be investigated within the context of dysarthric speech perception. Listening effort is a measure that has the potential to complement speech intelligibility measures to advance our understanding of communication challenges associated with dysarthria. Therefore, this current study's primary aim is to investigate listening effort, measured by pupil dilation and perceived listening effort ratings, during the perception of dysarthric speech. A total of 34 listeners completed a speech perception task, in which they listened to phrases from a speaker with dysarthria secondary to ALS and a speaker with neurotypical speech. The listeners' pupil dilation was tracked using an eye-tracking system while listening to a phrase spoken from one of the speakers. After listening to the phrase, listeners repeated back what they heard aloud and then gave a 7-point Likert rating of their perceived listening effort for that trial. The listeners completed a total of 5 practice trials, 40 trials from the speaker with ALS and 40 trials from the neurotypical speaker. Generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) were used to evaluate the influence of the speaker (neurotypical vs ALS), the phrase repetition accuracy (accurate vs inaccurate), and their interaction on pupil dilation. Perceived listening effort ratings were similarly evaluated using linear mixed-effects (LME) models. The results indicated that both pupil dilation and perceived listening effort ratings were greater for the speaker with ALS compared to the neurotypical speaker and greater for inaccurately recognized phrases compared to accurately recognized phrases. However, for the pupil dilation measure of effort, the difference between inaccurately and accurately recognized phrases was greater when listening to the ALS speaker compared to the neurotypical speaker. There was no interaction between speaker and phrase repetition accuracy for perceived listening effort ratings. The pupil dilation results also indicated that the shape of pupil dilation was different when listening to the ALS speaker compared to the neurotypical speaker, indicating that the allocation of effort was different for the ALS speaker. Overall, the results suggest that listening effort is greater when listening to dysarthric speech compared to neurotypical speech, even if intelligibility is preserved. Additionally, phrases, where the intelligibility was reduced, were more effortful compared to phrases that were completely intelligible to the listener. Therefore, while some relationship between listening effort and intelligibility is present, listening effort is more sensitive to differences in speech perception between dysarthric and neurotypical speech. While there was some overlap in the results for listening effort as measured by pupil dilation and perceived listening effort ratings, there were some notable differences. Implications of these findings and future areas of research, as indicated by the study's findings, are discussed.</abstract>
