   <abstract>Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito born flavivirus that has recently reemerged and new strains have been associated with the development of microcephaly in babies born to infected mothers as well as Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults. This rise of ZIKV and the novel neurological symptoms associated ZIKV prompted the World Health Organization to declare ZIKV a public health emergency in 2015. Since then, significant research has been performed to understand cell type specific infection characteristics in neuronal and nonneuronal cells. Here we summarize the knowledge acquired since then on the ZIKV life cycle and its cellular targets; discuss the current knowledge of how infections cause neuropathologies as well as what approaches researchers are currently taking to further advance such knowledge. A key aspect of ZIKV neuropathogenesis is virus-induced neuronal apoptosis via numerous mechanisms including cell cycle dysregulation, mitochondrial fragmentation, ER stress, and the unfolded protein response. These in turn result in the activation of p53-mediated intrinsic cell death pathways. A full spectrum of infection models including stem cells and co-cultures, transwells to simulate blood-tissue barriers, brain-region specific organoids, and animal models have been developed for ZIKV research. While it has been established that ZIKV infection induces cell cycle dysregulation and DNA damage such as double stranded breaks, the exact mechanism is still of concern. Here we focus on investigating the interferon response to ZIKV infection as a potential signaling pathway involved in the phenotypic cell cycle dysregulation. Type I interferons (IFNs) are essential in activating intra- and intercellular anti-viral responses. During ZIKV infection, the recognition of viral nucleic acid triggers the production and secretion of interferon beta (IFN-β). Subsequently, IFN-β signaling through the Interferon alpha/ beta receptor (IFNAR1/2) complex activating the JAK/STAT pathway leads to the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). To investigate the involvement of interferon signaling in ZIKV induced cell cycle dysregulation, we created IFNAR1 KO cell lines using CRISPR/Cas9. Genetic analysis through sequencing of the region surrounding the sgRNA target region revealed frame shift mutations inducing early stop codons, which indicated a successful KO of the IFNAR1 gene. Phenotypic analysis of the KO cells indicated functional elimination of the receptor as well as the absence of ISGS upon IFN-β stimulation. Further were KO cells not susceptible to IFN-β induced slowing of cell growth. Analysis of cells cycle profiles revealed that ZIKV infection induces a diminished cell cycle arrest phenotype in early S-phase in IFNAR1 KO cells compared to WT cells. Investigation of the early S-phase arrest phenotype had previously revealed that simultaneous induction DNA double stranded breaks indicated by γH2Ax phosphorylation. Studies in our lab further showed that pathogenic R-loop accumulation occurs during ZIKV infection, specifically in interferon stimulated gene regions. Here we showed that interferon signaling plays a crucial role in the induction of these R-loops. Performing sequencing of immunoprecipitation of DNA:RNA hybrids in both WT and IFNAR1 KO cells revealed the induction of interferon signaling dependent R-loops upon ZIKV infection. Further research revealed that accumulation of DSB observed in infected WT cells was significantly reduced in IFNAR1 KO cells. The results overall indicate a mechanism by which ZIKV infection induces R-loop accumulation in an interferon signaling dependent manner that results in extensive DNA damage ultimately leading to cell cycle arrest.</abstract>
