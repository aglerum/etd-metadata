   <abstract>Over the past decade, there has been a growing public discourse on the costs and benefits of teachers' unions in public education. Within the body of empirical literature, little is known about the role that teachers' unions play in the professional lives of school-based speech-language pathologists (SLPs). Although most SLPs work in states with teachers' unions and collective bargaining, many have not participated in union activities or structures. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the role of teachers' unions for school-based SLPs and their perceptions of the benefits and barriers to union membership. A 44-item survey was used to solicit information about the perceptions of and participation in teachers' unions of 320 school-based SLPs. The survey included subsections on teachers' union engagement, perceptions of teachers' unions, benefits and barriers to teachers' union membership, and roles and responsibilities of teachers' unions. Directed content analysis of 70 district collective bargaining agreements was also conducted to explore SLP provisions. Results confirm that teachers' unions collectively bargain on behalf of SLPs as they are often recognized as bargaining unit members. SLP provisions pertaining to salary supplements, caseload and workload caps, opportunities for professional development and mentorship, and alternative evaluations were uncovered. However, SLPs' perceptions of teachers' unions and collective bargaining were mixed. Frequently cited benefits of union membership included improved working conditions, legal and professional protections, and collective bargaining. Common barriers were misunderstandings about the role and responsibilities of unions and monetary costs. The findings of this study suggest that teachers' unions are not a widely used support structure for school-based SLPs. Despite the barriers highlighted by participants, unions can collectively bargain for provisions that could improve the living and working conditions of practitioners, such as salary supplements, caseload caps, and professional development. Though unions could improve outreach to SLPs in the schools, SLPs may benefit from additional training and professional development opportunities to support the degree to which they advocate and engage with their bargaining units.</abstract>
