   <abstract>The economic crisis of 2008 has forced the Peninsular social body to reevaluate the dominant narratives of the last two decades. Feelings of distrust in the population were caused by the (mis)management of the government and its State institutions in the economic crisis and the uncovering of many cases of corruption, resulting in the collapse of the 'big narratives'. This research project analyzes the shifts in Spanish subjectivity that have taken place since 2008 as a consequence of the economic crisis. I follow the critical theory of Homi Bhabha, who proposes the study of 'in-between' spaces as new sites of contestation and collaboration against the hegemony. According to him, it is in these liminal spaces where new strategies, singular and communal, are created in the act of redefining society. At the same time, Edward Soja's critical theory about the Thirdspace studies liminal spaces as a third space that draws selectively and strategically from a binary to open new alternatives. Following Bhabha's and Soja's third space theory, this dissertation proposes the emergence of transversal subjectivities as an alternative to the established narratives and as a space of collaboration and intervention for minority groups against the hegemony in contemporary cultural production in Spain since 2008. I define transversal subjectivities as those that reach out across two sides of the normative discourse in a binary to create new forms of interaction, representation, and intervention. I analyze three kinds of transversal subjectivities in relationship with three concepts that interact with the subject: nationality, gender, and morality. First, I examine the emergency of transversal subjectivities of nationality in the novel Desencajada (2020) by Ukrainian-Spanish author Margaryta Yakovenko and in the poetry book Invocación a las mayorías silenciosas (2022) by Chinese-Spanish poet Paloma Chen. Both authors are second generation immigrants, whose literature has not yet received much attention by academic scholars, but who represent a transversal subjectivity of nationality due to the fact that they are 'in-between' two nations, two cultures, and two sets of expectations. Second, I analyzed the emergence of transversal subjectivities of gender in the poetry book Poesía para niñas bien. Tits in my bowl (2011) by trans poet Txus García and the graphic novel El bebé verde (2016) by trans artist Roberta Marrero. In their works, there is a destabilization of the culturally constructed concept of gender through the representation of a transversal subjectivity of gender, which reaches out across the gender binary to propose a new concept of gender that is not attached to the biological genitalia. Lastly, I identify the emergence of transversal subjectivities of socio-morality in the films El Olivo (2016) directed by Icíar Bollaín and Magical Girl (2014) directed by Carlos Vermut. These transversal subjectivities establish a direct relationship between the social descent of the middle class in Spain, due to the precarious job market, and the resignification of moral judgment, due to the mistrust in the "grand narratives", both caused by the economic crisis of 2008. As a consequence, the morally ambiguous actions of the characters represented in both movies can be justified due to their precarious lives. In my research project, the analysis of transversal subjectivities in three different aspects, that interact with the self, indicate the beginning of a shift in contemporary Spanish subjectivity. The conditions of possibility necessary for their emergence within the Spanish social body imply a resignification of the concept of nationality, gender, and morality that points towards a change in the understanding of contemporary Peninsular subjectivity.</abstract>
