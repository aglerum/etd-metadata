   <abstract>In this research I examine LGBTQ+ inclusion in formal decision making processes through Advisory Boards across Global North and South, and research the motives and operations of these processes through the utilization of a queer lens. I focus on Global North and South because this comparison provides me the opportunity of analysis of a similar process in two starkly different contexts; Atlanta being shaped as an entrepreneurial, neo-liberally restructured city valuing diversity and inclusion vs Istanbul as a city being shaped under the Islamic neoliberal agenda far from the LGBTQ+ inclusion. I apply semi-structured in depth interviews with board members, city officials including city planners, and the local LGBTQ+ community on issues about civic engagement, involvement in the city politics and decisions, urban services, LGBTQ+ inclusion, representative power of the board, queer spaces as well as researching secondary data resources such as related news reports, local LGBTQ+ magazines and blogs.I argue that since LGBTQ+ individuals in the Global South still fight in a more challenging environment, they have that queer side that challenges the existing concepts and structures (Jagose, 1996) through resistance and insurgency (Holston, 1998; Miraftab, 2009). Although they are 'included' in participatory processes, they still need to come up with creative strategies such as informal negotiations, creating and collecting their own data, finding alternative ways of gathering as well as the use of courts and legal. As we see in the case of LGBTI+ Working group in Istanbul, Turkey, they utilize both invited spaces that are sanctioned by the formal, governmental authorities (Miraftab, 2009, 2012) and invented spaces as arenas of contestation against the organization structures whenever one is required or advantageous. From a comparative perspective, I assert that such insurgent strategies emerging from Global South, have critical value for the Global North, for instance Atlanta Advisory Board, to learn from because Atlanta may be prioritizing the interests of private investors, businesses, and the "creative class" over the needs and rights of marginalized social groups inclusive and representative of these diverse communities using diversity as a tool to enhance their image rather than promoting social inclusion. Therefore what Istanbul case tells Atlanta is that the board should 1) be able to move across and between different spaces of participation being tightly connected to bottom-up, grassroots activism on the ground so 'selective participation process' is eliminated and no one is left behind, 2) transcend acting according to the expectations of the staff at the key positions and formal structures that try to straighten LGBTQ individuals out. I argue that as queers we need to sustain our existing radical solidarity strategies while also penetrating the mechanisms of formal decision making without falling to the co-optation trap of the so called inclusive and collaborative processes. On the other hand, what Atlanta tells Istanbul case is that when resources and support are available inclusive spaces can be created in the built environment. Therefore, utilization of governmental structures is also valuable as much as insurgent acts.</abstract>
