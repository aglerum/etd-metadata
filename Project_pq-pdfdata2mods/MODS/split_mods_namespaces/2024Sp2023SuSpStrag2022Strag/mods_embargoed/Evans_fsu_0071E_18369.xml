   <abstract>Dominant scholarship on postwar German art has tended to focus on individual West German artists, at times broadly situated within movements like Capitalist Realism and Zero, and their engagement with themes of postwar recovery, cultural memory, and legacies of the Holocaust. In more recent years, alongside new scholarship on socio-communist art and politics in Eastern Europe, revisionist art historical scholarship on art collectives, in and across Europe, has drawn attention to art groups in West Germany, bringing a finer understanding of art, politics, and collectives to studies on this region. However, despite these changes, remarkably no study has yet addressed the Munich-based art collective, the Effekt group (composed of Dieter Hacker, Karl Reinhartz, Helge Sommerrock, and Walter Zehringer) who, from 1961 to 1968, were not only part of New Tendencies, a major international avant-garde movement based in Zagreb, Yugoslavia, but who exhibited pervasively, in major locations around the world. In response to this problem, this dissertation is the first sustained study on Effekt. Supported by extensive archival and field research conducted in Germany, Croatia, and the United States, including the gathering of new oral histories and unpublished or little-known photos, videos, and artworks, I examine Effekt's vanguard, collectivist practice within the politicized cultural contexts of West Germany and trans-European, Yugoslav-centered New Tendencies movement. Using formal and social art historical analysis, this dissertation especially attends to Effekt's kinetic and ephemeral artworks, namely their interactive environments and participatory objects. Alongside these innovative works made of Styrofoam spheres, bubbles, candy, and other materials, in 1965 Effekt published their manifesto, On a New Exhibition Type, proposing a new model for the display of art with a supporting anti-capitalist economic structure. I argue that Effekt's turn to innovative materials, kinetic objects, and participatory art radically altered what it meant to be an active participant in an increasingly mediated and networked world. I find that Effekt, driven by socialist and anti-authoritarian ideals of the 1960s, positioned tactile, kinetic, and playful art as a means of social and political transformation. Their artworks challenged traditional power structures by advocating for democratic art spaces that actively engaged a spectator. Using spectator agency as a metaphor for democratic participation, Effekt asserted that art could be used to empower spectators to make decisions in matters of cultural, economic, and social governance. A comprehensive analysis of Effekt's multi-faceted oeuvre expands existing discourses on postwar German socially engaged art, as well as artistic and political exchanges between West Germany and Yugoslavia. Bridging scholarship on art activism and the growing discourse on "nonaligned modernism," an aesthetic-political practice coming from Yugoslavia in this period, this dissertation elucidates the understudied impact of the political, critical, and even visionary role of art and artists like Effekt in offering alternatives to hegemonic systems in revolutionary sociopolitical and artistic contexts of the 1960s. Chapter One, "Seeds of Dissent: Experimental Art in Postwar Munich, 1961," examines Effekt's foundational years. Working within postwar Concrete and Neo-Constructivist avant-garde paradigms, as seen in Hacker's Bodies series, and coinciding with involvement in student activism in Munich, Effekt artists experimented with reduced geometric forms and spectator participation as egalitarian gestures between artist and spectator. Chapter Two, "Art for Modern Times: Democratic Spectatorship and the Grid, 1962–1964," traces Effekt's engagement with New Tendencies. It examines how this movement simultaneously resonated with Effekt's experiments in participatory and Op art while also inspiring these Munich artists to investigate new strategies, like systems aesthetics, as seen in Sommerrock's 1964 work III/4. Chapter Three, "Socialist Utopias: Formation of Effekt, 1965," analyzes the formal creation of Effekt catalyzed by their desire to combat elitism in art spaces and corruption in governmental bodies. To model spectator's agency in social and political systems, Effekt transformed their kinetic objects to kinetic spaces, as exemplified by Effekt's Soap Bubble Room, modeled after Hacker's Play Object. Chapter Four, "Global Cultural Revolution(s): Rupture and Disintegration, 1968," accounts for the fragmentation of Effekt within the context of the West-German student revolutions. It also traces the trajectories of Effekt's changed aesthetic-political strategies to align with their evolving agendas, as in Sommerrock's turn to street theater and Zehringer's creation of an anti-authoritarian kindergarten. The concluding chapter, "Legacies of Art and Politics in the Aftermath of '68," examines how the artistic and cultural developments of the 1960s continue to shape contemporary life. This chapter also proposes a larger project on the critical relationship between the avant-garde and countercultural movements in 1960s Munich, a topic that is currently absent in scholarship. This dissertation addresses Effekt's revolutionary strategies and constitutes the initial effort to address this gap.</abstract>
