   <abstract>Enhancing students' reading achievement hinges on educators' expert grasp of evidence-based practices (EBPs) proven effective in delivering reading instruction. Although several teacher knowledge measures are available to gauge teachers' knowledge of reading and reading-related skills (Binks-Cantrell et al., 2012; Elleman &amp; Oslund, 2019; Folsom et al., 2017; Foorman et al., 2020; Hindman et al., 2020; Joshi et al., 2009b; Kretlow &amp; Helf, 2013; Leader-Janssen &amp; Rankin-Erickson, 2013; Moats, 2020; Tortorelli et al., 2021), few include items that reflect knowledge of both code- and meaning-based skills (Davis et al., 2022; Hall et al., 2023; Spear-Swerling &amp; Cheesman, 201) and few have reported using a rigorous validation process to ensure adequate reliability and validity of the measure. The purpose of this study was to further develop and evaluate a measure of teacher knowledge aligned with recommendations from the What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) practice guide, Foundational Skills to Support Reading for Understanding in Kindergarten through 3rd Grade (Foorman et al., 2016) and its companion Professional Learning Community (PLC) (Kosanovich &amp; Foorman, 2016). The 30-item measure was designed specifically to assess early elementary teachers' content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge of code-based and meaning-based skills associated with the EBPs highlighted in the practice guide. The validation process for this study was guided by a primer created by Boateng and colleagues (2018). The steps in the three-phase process of the development and evaluation of a scale for validation aligns with the standards created jointly by the American Educational Research Association (AERA), the American Psychological Association (APA), and the National Council on Measurement in Education (NCME; 2014). In addition, both Classical Test Theory (CTT) and Item Response Theory (IRT) were used to determine the psychometric properties of items on the measure. The study sample included kindergarten, first, second, and third grade classroom teachers (n = 80) who were predominantly female (n = 76), White (n = 48), and spoke English as their native language (n = 77). All participants received their teacher certification in the United States, and all but one was currently teaching in classrooms in the United States. The majority of participants had been teaching for more than 10 years (n = 60) and most held a master's degree (n = 45). Results indicated that the mean and standard deviation (SD) of the correct responses on the survey was 19.08 (8.31), with individual scores ranging from 3 (n = 4) to 30 (n = 1). All items received responses, with none being rarely answered incorrectly (less than 5%), and one item (3.33%) was always answered correctly (greater than 95%). As hypothesized, the measure achieved reliability levels meeting the standards set forth by CTT for these specific indexes of the psychometric properties utilized. The measure also demonstrated acceptable reliability indices according to IRT. Finally, confirmatory factor analyses revealed a unidimensional model most appropriately described the fit indices on the measure (Byrne, 2005; Kline, 2016; Wagner, 2022). The results are discussed in relation to other teacher knowledge measures and implications for ongoing validation of the tool to support research and practice.
