   <abstract>During times of disasters, minority populations often experience disproportionate vulnerabilities, encountering significant obstacles and enduring long-term consequences compared to other racial groups. This research aims to investigate how the responses to disaster issues of minority populations vary across rural and urban areas in the Florida Panhandle. The study examines differences in disaster needs and vulnerabilities among minority populations by analyzing their evacuation status, choices of evacuation destinations, and preferred modes of transportation during previous hurricanes. The research focuses on 18 counties in the north-west region of Florida, USA, encompassing 75 rural zip codes and 59 urban zip codes. A two-target groups approach was employed to sample minority populations for the survey. The first target group comprised minorities of all ages residing in urban areas, while the second target group consisted of minorities in rural areas. A total of 160 responses were collected, evenly distributed between the two target groups. The survey was conducted using Pollfish, a reputable online survey platform that specializes in administering surveys through mobile applications, offering researchers the capability to target specific population groups based on various eligibility criteria for enhanced precision and relevance. Various regression models, including binary logistic regression and multinomial logistic regression, were used to analyze the collected data. Eighteen logistic regression models were developed, focusing on evacuation status, evacuation destination, and evacuation mode choice as dependent variables. The independent variables encompassed socio-economic factors, health-related variables, and variables related to the consequences of disasters. The findings reveal that 61.3% of urban minority populations and 81.3% of rural minority populations in the Florida Panhandle were compelled to evacuate due to the disasters they faced. The study identifies statistically significant socio-economic, health, and disaster consequence variables, highlighting the differences in evacuation behavior between urban and rural minorities. The findings of this research have practical implications for emergency management. They shed light on the evacuation decisions of vulnerable populations, assisting in the incorporation of the evacuation needs of marginalized populations. By addressing the disparities in disaster vulnerabilities among minority populations, this research strives to promote more effective and inclusive emergency response strategies in the Florida Panhandle and potentially in other similar regions.</abstract>
