         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Polyelectrolytes are polymers consisting of charged repeat units resulting in a netcharge for the macromolecules. Mixing oppositely charged polyelectrolytes creates
polyelectrolyte complexes (PEC). Different types of complexes can be obtained by
modifying the preparation technique. This dissertation focuses primarily on one kind of
PEC known as a polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEMU). These systems are formed by
depositing alternating “layers” of oppositely charged polymers onto a substrate. PEMUs
have been proposed for various applications, from electronic devices to antibacterial
coatings and drug delivery. These applications rely on the composition and integrity of
these films to withstand dynamic changes in the external environment, such as
temperature and environmental composition. They also rely on doping the films with
additives called “dopants” to modify the properties of these films.
This dissertation focuses on the stability of PEMUs and the motion of various
analytes through the films. This first aspect centers initially around the water content. The
PEMUs in this work are plasticized by water, becoming brittle when dry. This plasticization
led to the theory that the change in modulus close to room temperature for these systems
was not a glass transition but instead a dehydration/rehydration event. Fully hydrated
films were monitored using ATR-FTIR to assess the water content through the glass
transition at various salt concentrations. There was no discernible change in water
content that would indicate hydration or dehydration, supporting the theory that this
change in modulus results from a glass transition.
The commonly used polyelectrolyte pairs in this work are hydrophilic. This affinity
for water combined with added salts bringing in additional water and breaking up Pol+Polinteractions causes concern for the stability of the film. PEMUs were built again on the
ATR-FTIR and monitored in-situ as a solution of changing salt concentration flowed over
the film. The salt concentrations ranged from 0 to 1.0 M NaCl for 1, 2, and 4 hours and
then were brought back to 0 M NaCl over the same time period. The rapid change in salt
concentration was expected to stress the film, potentially causing it to swell to the point
of degradation. All three rates resulted in intact films, with the fastest change in
concentration resulting in the water not having sufficient time to equilibrate in the film, 
14
shown by a difference in response to increasing and decreasing NaCl concentration.
Long-term exposure to NaCl, especially high concentration salt, was also monitored.
Films were constructed on quartz slides and placed parallel to the beam in the cuvette.
Solutions of NaCl ranging from 0 to 2.5 M were added to the cuvette and monitored for
10 hours. The spectra indicate minimal leaching from the films into the solution at all but
the highest salt concentrations.
Ferrocyanide and ferricyanide diffusion through PEMUs was tested to determine if
their movement through the film would be sufficient to impact the rate of electrons
transferring from the redox centers through the film to an electrode. Films were built on
silicon wafers and monitored using transmission FTIR by taking spectra of the dried film
at specific time points during the exposure to the ferri- or ferrocyanide solutions. The
diffusion coefficients were determined, indicating ferricyanide diffuses significantly faster
than ferrocyanide. From the diffusion and the IR spectra, the concentration and spacing
of the redox centers were determined, indicating that the motion of the redox species is
not sufficient to alter the rate of electron motion.
Ligated lanthanide complexes are efficient emitters but often have issues with the
substrate quenching emission. PEMUs were tested to see if they could be used as
scaffolding to prevent this quenching. Hydrophilic and hydrophobic systems were
compared based on quantum yield and fluorescence lifetime. Hydrophilic films had faster
and higher uptake of the emissive sites, needing only five minutes for full incorporation,
but the hydrophobic films outperformed the hydrophilic films in emission under various
environmental humidity levels by better maintaining the quantum yield.
Diffusion of PSS through films was monitored with varying molecular weight,
temperature, and solution salt concentrations. Shorter chains diffused faster at the same
temperatures and were not impacted by changes in salt concentration. This could be
because the short-chain systems are above the Tg in those salt concentrations. Both long
and short-chain films were slower below Tg. Long-chain systems had a dependence on
salt concentration and a two-part diffusion regime at room temperature. This is because
the polymers closer to the surface of the film were more hydrated, and therefore above
the Tg, while the chains at the substrate were below Tg at room temperature. This resulted
in a two-part diffusion.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study examined the relationships among eHealth literacy, information consumption ‎from different sources, information overload, information anxiety, and information avoidance. ‎Drawing on the Comprehensive Model of Information Seeking framework (Johnson et al., ‎‎1995), a model was proposed to investigate factors influencing information avoidance during ‎the COVID-19 pandemic.‎Data were collected from adults in the United States using an online survey and the ‎proposed model was initially tested using SEM (n=1,875). The research questions were ‎answered using Exploratory Factor Analysis, Confirmatory Factor Analysis, Structural ‎Modeling correlational analyses, reliability analyses, and Generalized Linear Modeling. The ‎results showed the data do not fit the initial model properly. However, by implementing EFA, ‎an alternative best-fit model was identified. In addition, the study shows that information ‎consumption from both credible and noncredible sources had a significant relationship with ‎information overload and eHealth literacy. Also, eHealth literacy, information overload, and ‎information anxiety can be predictors of information avoidance.‎

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The forecasting of financial time series has been very important in both finance industry and academia for several years due to the volatile and unstable nature of financial systems. However, researchers believe that financial time series data can be modeled accurately, despite its noisy and unstable nature. Therefore, they have created several applications of time series modeling, which have been very successful when applied to financial markets, the prediction of stock prices being one of the main examples. In order to build better models for predicting stock prices, advanced data analysis techniques such as machine learning, deep learning, time series analysis, and probabilistic pattern recognition have been developed by researchers among from various areas in the past decades.Lately Recently, Deep Learning and Probabilistic Models are have become popular regarding due to developing their success in financial time series forecasting. This study focuses on a Deep Learning Model called Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and a Probabilistic Model called Hidden Markov Model (HMM) implementation for financial time series forecasting and on building a hybrid model by combining these two models to enhance prediction accuracy. More Specifically, the main objective is to build a novel approach of by combining LSTM with HMM, train the resulting model by using historical data, and predict future behavior of financial time series indicators. The results of our study indicate that the HMM is better than LSTM in predicting the stock closing price. The experimental result of our hybrid model process showed shows that the prediction accuracy of LSTM model increased when model combined with the HMM.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Meta-analysis has been frequently used to combine findings from independent studies in many areas. Bayesian methods are an important set of tools for performing meta-analyses. They avoid some potentially unrealistic assumptions that are required by conventional frequentist methods. More importantly, meta-analysts can incorporate prior information from many sources, including experts’ opinions and prior meta-analyses. Nevertheless, Bayesian methods are used less frequently than conventional frequentist methods, primarily because of the need for nontrivial statistical coding, while frequentist approaches can be implemented via many user-friendly software packages. This thesis divide into three parts, the first part aims at providing a practical review of implementations for Bayesian meta-analyses with various prior distributions. We present Bayesian methods for meta-analyses with the focus on a univariate meta-analysis of odds ratio for binary outcomes. We summarize various commonly used prior distribution choices for the between-studies heterogeneity variance, a critical parameter in meta-analyses. They include the inverse-gamma, uniform, and half-normal distributions, as well as evidence-based informative log-normal priors. Five real-world examples are presented to illustrate their performance. Under certain circumstances, Bayesian methods can produce markedly different results from those by frequentist methods, including a change in decision on statistical significance. When data information is limited, the choice of priors may have a large impact on meta-analytic results, in which case sensitivity analyses are recommended. Moreover, the algorithm for implementing Bayesian analyses may not converge for extremely sparse data; caution is needed in interpreting respective results. As such, convergence should be routinely examined. When select statistical assumptions made by conventional frequentist methods are violated, Bayesian methods provide a reliable alternative to perform a meta-analysis.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A critical issue of meta-analysis is that the combined studies could be heterogeneous because of differences in study populations, design conducts, etc. Thus, heterogeneity is an issue that can affect the validity of meta-analytic results. In the existence of heterogeneity, a random-effects meta-analysis is considered an appropriate model to estimate a summary effect and a between-study variance. For several studies, conventional methods could be used to estimate the random-effects meta-analysis model, but the estimate of between-study heterogeneity could be imprecise in the case of few studies, and this imprecision is not acknowledged. In this situation, a Bayesian random-effects meta-analysis is advantageous in accounting for all sources of uncertainty. The second part of this thesis uses Bayesian methods to examine the impact of meta-analysis characteristics on between-study heterogeneity by analyzing data from a large collection of meta-analyses with binary outcomes. We classify and examine all included meta-analyses by outcome types and intervention comparison types. Then, based on these outcome and intervention classifications, we derive a set of predictive distributions for the extent of between-study variance expected in a future meta-analysis in different effect measures. These findings may help researchers to use them as informative prior distributions in new meta-analyses of binary outcomes. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The last part of this thesis quantifies the between-study heterogeneity by using prediction intervals. By reporting the prediction interval, we show how often there is a contradiction in the conclusion compared to the conclusion based on the confidence interval. We also show the benefits of reporting the prediction interval in a meta-analysis, which has a straightforward clinical meaning that may guide researchers to expect the true effects in future settings. In addition, we use a large collection of meta-analyses from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews to evaluate the real-world performance of the prediction interval. We assess whether the previous meta-analysis successfully predicts a future study or a study not included in the meta-analysis based on publication years. This assessment is illustrated using a case study.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The epistemology of disagreement is primarily concerned with determining the rational response to disagreement. Of particular interest in the literature is the question of peer disagreement: how should you revise your beliefs when faced with the disagreement of an epistemic peer (i.e., someone who is just well-equipped as you are to evaluate the topic of disagreement)? The majority of the disagreement literature is directed toward the question of peer disagreement, and a range of different views have been proposed. Some views maintain that the rational response is to withhold judgment when faced with peer disagreement, while other views maintain that it can be rational to remain steadfast in your initial belief, and still other views hold that each of these responses can be reasonable under the right circumstances. In what follows, however, I will argue that the literature’s emphasis on peer disagreement is misguided, because it leads to unnecessary confusion, without offering any additional insight about how to rationally resolve disagreements. After a brief introduction in Chapter 1, I go on in Chapter 2 to argue that, although the concept of epistemic peerhood is useful for identifying epistemically interesting disagreements for study, when it comes to determining the rational response to those disagreements, peerhood becomes more of a hindrance than a help. As an alternative to standard peer-centric views of disagreement, I propose a ‘sliding-scale’ approach to the epistemic evaluation of interlocutors, a view I refer to as the Variable Weight View of disagreement (the VWV). After proposing the VWV in Chapter 2, I expand upon it in Chapter 3, responding to several potential objections, as well as considering how the VWV might be expanded upon in the future. I pay particular attention to the social dimension of disagreement, and the potential role that collective or community-level epistemic norms might play with respect to disagreement – a topic which I suggest deserves more attention than it presently receives in the literature. In Chapter 4, I consider what I take to be a particularly clear example of how peer-centric views of disagreement can go wrong. I consider the Equal Weight View as defended by Elga (2007), and I argue that his view ultimately fails because it relies for its success on a particularly problematic definition of peerhood. In Chapter 5, I conclude by comparing the VWV to the standard peer-oriented views of disagreement in the literature. I argue that, in each case, the most plausible versions of those views would benefit from abandoning their strict focus on peer disagreement, in favor of adopting a sliding-scale approach to epistemic evaluation, such as that proposed by the VWV.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This dissertation discusses brass bands in Mobile, Alabama and their individual “brands”(performance norms) and their relationship to the broader branding aspects of the city’s Mardi
Gras. I call this brass branding. How do the brass bands showcase their brand verbally and
performatively? How do different forms of Mobile Mardi Gras media incorporate brass band
aesthetics (visually and/or aurally) to convey Mobile as a Mardi Gras city? I answer these
questions through interviews, ethnographic observations, and analyses of media to show how
brass band aesthetics are tied to Mardi Gras. I found that the brass brands in the case studies I
discuss are multifaceted and function differently from context to context. The brass brands
communicate different messages regarding what Mardi Gras means to individuals or
communities in Mobile. Collectively, though, the brass brand case studies show that Mobilians
take great pride in their Mardi Gras and recognize the integral role of the brass band tradition.
Overall, this project offers approaches to studying the relationship between musicians,
marketing, and events to understand how ritual participants see and imagine themselves.
Examining the branding of Mardi Gras shows how Mobile is portraying itself as a “music” city
like New Orleans to live up to the same level of exceptionalism and how the bands each
contribute to the festivities through distinctive modes of performance.</DISS_para>
