         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The conventional 2-level voltage source converter (VSC) was first commercialized in an HVDC project by ABB in 1997. This topology being cost effective, having simpler design and control attracted the vendors to be used in high power high voltage applications. Apart from the benefits, this topology also offered limitations which included; the requirement of bulky and expensive filters for the mitigation of low order harmonics in the output voltage waveform. These harmonics can be nullified by using high frequency switching which pushes the low order frequency spectrum to higher order frequencies which in turn affected in reducing the filter size but corresponded to another cumbersome issue of increased converter switching losses. Therefore there was always a conflicting design compromise between converter switching losses and the need for bulky harmonic filter for filtration.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>IGBTs being low to medium voltage rated devices which typically ranges from 1.7kV to 6.5kV, does not have the capability to withstand the full DC-link voltage. This brings us to another troublesome issue with conventional VSC which is, this topology requires series connected IGBTs to form the converter arm valves. This means that these switching devices requires sophisticated gate drives to maintain dynamic and static voltage balancing to ensure the simultaneous switching of all the IGBTs in the converter arm. This incommodious situation in turn limits the overall efficiency of 2-level VSC. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This research is mainly aimed to make a comparison of VSC converters with a relatively new compact design solution to all the foregoing problems by modelling a 21-level Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC). As the name suggest multilevel, which eliminates the need of massive and expensive filter requirements and modular, which eliminates the need for series connected IGBTs when used in high power high voltage applications like HVDC. This converter topology regulates in lower switching frequency which in turn reduces the converter switching losses.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The MMC system that has been studied in this work involves a 100kV DC converter station connected to a 220kV, 50Hz grid station connected with two 50MW parallel loads through successive transmission lines of 10km. This work compares modelling and design of grid-tied conventional VSC and MMC. Transformation of signals from ABC frame to direct-quadrature frame (dq0) and independent control of active and reactive power at point of common coupling (PCC) are done using vector current control technique. The Proportional (P) and Integral (I) gains are calculated using Modulus Optimum tuning criteria. The modulation technique used for conventional VSC is Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM) and on the other hand Phase-Shifted Pulse Width Modulation (PS-PWM) has been used for MMC topology. The step time is set to 6.06e-6 s as the switching frequency of the converters is 1650Hz. The conventional VSC is realized using the Universal Bridge block from the Simulink library whereas the MMC is realized using the Half-Bridge MMC block and selecting aggregate model type. Both the converter topologies are analyzed and compared on the basis of their mathematical modelling of their AC dynamics, control complexity and stability conditions, output voltage quality, switching losses, total harmonic distortion (THD), harmonic spectrum analysis, filter requirement, cost and design structure and AC fault analysis.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Based on result comparison it is found that MMC topology produces less voltage harmonics than the conventional VSC. The output current waveform of MMC is smooth whereas the VSC output waveform is full of ripples. This shows the need for AC harmonic filters at the converter output for the conventional VSC. The shifting of switching frequency to 3x fundamental frequency has minimum effect on the MMC topology based on the total harmonic distortion in the output voltage as compared to VSC. Although MMC is superior in every aspect but during AC faults the MMC shows more instability and high fault current as compared to VSC topology.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Different building materials have been used in construction for centuries to meet the accommodation needs. Building materials were primarily designed to tolerate the environmental impacts and to meet the demand. However, some of these materials did not survive in the past due to their engineering limitations and durability concerns. Concrete is among the survived ones and is considered one of the primary materials used on earth. Concrete is a composite material primarily composed of ordinary Portland cement, water, coarse aggregate, and fine aggregate. Portland cement is the main binder component of regular concrete. Producing Portland cement requires a high amount of energy and heat, which corresponds to releasing carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere and negatively impacts the environment. Geopolymer concrete is a promising material that can be produced using by-product materials such as fly ash and slag as prime binders of the concrete and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and sodium silicate (Na2SiO3) as alkaline activators. Gel phases formed from fly ash/slag-based geopolymer concrete are mainly sodium aluminosilicate hydrate (N-A-S-H) and calcium aluminosilicate hydrate (C-A-S-H), and the limited replacement of OPC may improve the coexistence of these gels. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In geopolymer concrete, aluminosilicate sources (fly ash and slag) do not react entirely to form sodium-aluminosilicate-hydrate and calcium-aluminosilicate-hydrate gel phases, and that produce deficient microstructural formation. Besides the gel formations deficiency, a part of the binders remains unreacted, which sequentially induces lower mechanical performance and a part of the aluminosilicate sources to be wasted. Thus, in this study, fly ash and slag combinations were used with limited OPC content as a maximum of 12% of the total binder to improve properties of the fly ash/slag-based geopolymers and increase the uptake of calcium that is provided from OPC. The low-calcium fly ash has a slow setting time, whereas ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) has a rapid setting time, and it is crucial in the evaluation in this study to measure the effect on the hydration time. Therefore, in the first stage of this research, the effect of OPC and Na2SiO3/NaOH (SS/SH) ratios on the setting time is a significant part of this study. Moreover, microstructural formation, gel phase identification, and elemental composition studies were evaluated besides the strength developments at certain ages to investigate the changes in the development of the binary system. For the setting time measurements, a penetrometer was modified to meet ASTM C191–Standard Test Methods for Time of Setting of Hydraulic Cement by Vicat Needle. A different set of equipment and tools were used for compressive strength properties, including digital caliper, precision balance, 20-quarts mixer, vibrating table, diamond saw, and compressive strength testing equipment. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were mainly used to assess microstructural characterizations and analysis of elemental compositions. Three sodium silicate to sodium hydroxide ratios were considered, and five batches were mixed in the first stage for each ratio. For each batch, a total of fifteen cylinder samples 2x4 inch were cast. In total, sixteen batches were mixed, including the geopolymer pastes and Portland cement pastes. At each testing age, five specimens were tested to record the maximum compressive strength according to ASTM C39-Standard Test Method for Compressive Strength of Cylindrical Concrete Specimens. For SEM/EDS analysis, three samples were tested for each SS/SH ratio. The three samples were prepared for the microscope following the ASTM C1723- Standard Guide for Examination of Hardened Concrete Using Scanning Electron Microscopy. In the second stage of this research, durability studies were conducted for up to 120 days. The specimens were soaked in two different environments: magnesium sulfate as the aggressive solution and regular tap water as the reference. The samples were cured for 28 days to reach sufficient maturity, and then test results were recorded at 56, 90, and 120 days.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The studies concluded that the addition of Portland cement by minimal percentage as 3% and 6% content could significantly contribute to the hydration kinetics and the development of the low calcium fly ash/slag-based materials. Replacing GGBFS by 3% of OPC for R0.5 (SS/SH=0.5), R1.0 and R1.5 increased the initial setting time by 10%, 29%, and 4%, respectively. The effect of OPC on the final setting time was more pronounced using more OPC content. By increasing OPC content up to 6%, the final setting time increased by 18%, 14%, and 38% for R0.5, R1.0, and R1.5, respectively. The compressive strength results improved by 9.8%, 12.5%, and 7.0% with adding 3%, 6%, and 3% of OPC for R0.5, R1.0, and R1.0 at 120 days, respectively. In the microstructural analysis, the density of the hydrated products formed increased with increasing the SS/SH ratio. The SEM micrographs of the reaction products of R1.0 and R1.5 showed homogeneity and well-compactness. The microstructural formation improved significantly for R1.0 and R1.5 by using 6% and 3% of OPC, respectively, at 120 days. The elemental compositions analyses using EDS show significant shifts in the gel phases formed with OPC addition. The CaO/SiO2 revealed a substantial increasing trend with increasing OPC content, whereas the Al2O3/SiO2 ratio demonstrated a decreasing trend with increasing OPC content. Multiple gel phases co-existed in the final products formed, including N-A-S-H, C-N-A-S-H, C-A-S-H, and C-S-H. After the results of EDS analysis, the N-A-S-H gel phase was dominant in the control groups, whereas calcium-rich phases dominated the samples with OPC content. The durability studies showed that the increase in the SS/SH ratio from 1.0 to 1.5 increased the availability of the soluble silica. The existence of the free silica improved the dissolution of the precursors, which increased the reaction rate and improved the development of hydrated products.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Random numbers are used in a variety of applications including simulation, sampling, and cryptography.  Fortunately, there exist many well-established methods of random number generation.  An example of a well-known pseudorandom number generator is the Lagged-Fibonacci Generator (LFG). Marsagliashowed that lagged-Fibonacci generator using addition failed some of his DIEHARD statistical tests while it passed all when longer lags were used.  This paper presents a scrambler that takes bits from a pseudorandom number generator and outputs (hopefully) improved pseudorandom numbers.  The scrambler is based on a modified Feistel function, a method used in the generation of cryptographic random numbers, and multiplication by a chosen multiplier.  We show that this scrambler improves the quality of pseudorandom number by applying it to the additive LFG with small lags.  The scrambler performs well based on its performance with the Testu01 suite of randomness tests.
The scrambling of the LFG is so successful that scrambled LFGs with small lags perform as well as unscrambled LFGs with long lags.  This comes at the cost of a doubling of execution time, and provides users with generators with small memory footprints that can provide parallel generators like the LFGs in the SPRNG parallel random number generation package.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Individuals with Parkinson’s disease (PD) frequently exhibit deficits across various aspects of speech which include respiration, phonation, resonance, articulation, and prosody. Among these, literature has highlighted articulatory deficits such as imprecise tongue and jaw movements in this population, which consequently deteriorates their speech intelligibility. Recently, three-dimensional electromagnetic tracking systems have been increasingly used to track and record articulatory positions that are attached to various articulators providing sub-millimeter accuracy. These devices have primarily demonstrated reduced range and speed of articulatory movement in PD. However, using multiple sensors to detect dysarthria is time-consuming and costly. This creates many obstacles for using the system for clinical purposes, such as assessment and treatment of motor speech disorders. The current study investigates whether a single sensor can be used to detect dysarthria and differentiate individuals with PD from healthy controls. Especially given the growing use of jaw-decoupling procedures in the studies of dysarthria, the two methodologies (jaw coupled vs. decoupled) are also compared with respect to the sensitivity of dysarthria.  The findings have revealed that individuals with PD have longer sentence durations and similar articulatory distance when compared to healthy controls (HC). When speech intelligibility was considered, larger tongue movements were correlated with higher ratings of speech intelligibly for PD speakers and lower ratings for controls. In addition, the findings revealed that tongue front sensors are preferred to tongue back sensors and the jaw-decoupling process does not yield a significant difference. This provides insight that one sensor is clinical feasible to use for clinical purposes.          </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>We study functional data defined by an underlying structure (modeled as a metric space or ametric measure space) and feature information (represented by a 1-Lipschitz function on the ground
structure). If the ground structure is a metric space, we call it a functional space. We construct a
Urysohn space (i.e., universal and homogeneous functional space) for the class of functional spaces.
We also show that the Urysohn space is a generic functional space in the topological sense.
If the underlying structure is a metric measure space (mm-space), we call it a functional metric
measure space (fmm-space). Extending well-known distance functions between mm-spaces (i.e., Box
distance, Gromov-Prokhorov distance, and Gromov-Wasserstein distance) to the functional setting,
we study several ways of comparing fmm-spaces. Furthermore, we investigate the relationship
between the mentioned distance functions and a notion of dissimilarity between fmm-spaces based
on their matrix distributions.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Everyday animals maneuver through complex unstructured environments provided by the natural world. One way in which we can study these behaviors in animals is by partitioning the natural world into differing domains and analyzing the modes of locomotion employed by animals within them. Though animals appear to achieve multi-modality with apparent ease no robots have yet been able to approach the same degree of modal diversity. Some motivating reasons for this derive from limited understandings of the intersection between domains and how uniting these diverse modes changes the design of mechanisms and control.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This work seeks to develop tools to assist with the task of bridging three different domains of legged locomotion. In particular, this work takes its primary focus on developing models which intersect with the aquatic domain, which has been largely unmodeled for legged robotics. To that end, the first thrust of this work entails developing a model that intersects between the scansorial and aquatic domains of legged locomotion. This model is then evaluated by the first legged robot capable of producing both of these forms of locomotion. Following this the a new model is developed to capture the intersection between the aquatic and terrestrial domains, which also serves to evaluate different levels of hydrodynamic complexity. It is shown here that optimizing a simple version of this model the efficiency of hopping in resistive media can be greatly improved and that differing levels of model can show a good degree of accuracy with legged swimming. Finally, some of the models of locomotion are applied to the task of robotic design for dynamically challenging behaviors including: enabling high performance terrestrial gaits on the large robot LLAMA, and enabling multi-modality on a newly designed small scale robot. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In current news media environments where the separation between fact and opinion is blurred, it is important to understand college students’ media literacy practices and variables that may affect how they discern fake news. The purpose of this study was to investigate variables that may be related to college students’ fake news discernment, inspired by Potter’s cognitive media literacy model (2004). The investigated variables included college students’ ability to discern fact from opinion, critical thinking skills, beliefs in their control over situations or experiences (locus of control), and the degree to which they engage in and enjoy thinking (need for cognition). The study employed a sequential explanatory mixed-methods research design that consisted of a quantitative study followed by a qualitative study.The survey quantitatively measured 296 college students’ fact and opinion discernment, critical thinking skills, need for cognition, and locus of control. Critical thinking was a variable positively correlated with the fact and opinion discernment, as well as the need for cognition respectively. Group differences in the fact and opinion discernment, locus of control, and need for cognition scores were found. The follow-up interview data with 19 college students further explained the survey results and their media literacy practices. They described how they discern fact from opinion and evaluate information when reading news online. They stated that polarized media environments and their prior knowledge made information evaluation difficult when reading news online. The participants also described the importance and motivation of discerning fact and opinion and evaluating information in news reports. 
The study findings inform considerations for media literacy education which strengthens students’ skills regarding fake news discernment. This study suggests future work that further investigates the studied variables, such as developing the fact and opinion discernment instrument with borderline statements and developing a media literacy model in the context of news reading.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Senegalese writer Léopold Sédar Senghor is known for being a proponent of the cultural métissage, the Civilization of the Universal, the dialogue of cultures and the concept of humanism. He notably suggests the complementarity of different cultures and of populations as a basis for any great civilization, and he emphasizes the importance of exchange and dialogue among cultures. The idea of the multi-affiliation or identity has been the feature of the work of Francophone sub-Saharan authors Léonora Miano, Calixthe Beyala, and Alain Mabanckou. This dissertation explores the (re)negotiation of the sociocultural identity of contemporary francophone sub-Saharans in the 20th and 21st centuries with a focus on the works of Miano, Beyala, and Mabanckou. Through a close reading of my corpus, I examine how these authors present one or more facets constituting the new socio-cultural identity of sub-Saharans today. This study pays a particular attention to how these authors treat and rethink the notions of métissage, borderlands/frontière, Afropea, the African female body, gender roles, and identity. By highlighting the sociocultural and sexual realities that lead Sub-Saharans characters to define themselves as culturally hybrid/métis or as socially androgynous, I analyze the three authors’ treatment of the construction of their identity from a phenomenological, psychological, and sociological perspective. In my dissertation, I show how the renegotiation of sub-Saharans’ identity results from social and sexual emancipation in Beyala’s work; from cultural métissage in Mabanckou’s work; and/or from afropeanity or cultural hybridity in Miano’s work. In other words, this study shows how social norms, cultural heritage, and society shape gender roles and identity; how cultural experiences and openness to the Other affect the sub-Saharans’ vision of the world and their identity today. From a sociological perspective, chapter two analyzes the idea of a social androgyny as a subversive shift in gender roles to rethink the relationship between African women and men as social groups and to deconstruct social norms and the gaze of the Other concerning the representation of the African female body through Beyala’s oeuvre. Chapter three explores the impact of the western dream, “rêve occidental,” and the concept of “non-return” in the case of clandestine sub-Saharan migrants. I analyze how Mabanckou treats the questions of migration, of in-betweenness, and of non-return from a psychological standpoint by highlighting how lived experiences both in African and French societies shape and affect the identity of these sub-Saharans. Chapter four examines how the idea of Afropeanity in Miano’s work echoes in both Glissant’s theory of the poetics of relation, Senghor’s theory of the dialogue of cultures, and Mbembe’s cosmopolitanism to create a space in which sub-Saharans (including the non-migrant sub-Saharan) become cultural hybrids also known as “Afropeans” by living their adopted culture and simultaneously valuing their African roots. Through Miano’s work and from a phenomenological perspective, I show how they move consecutively from a space of uncomfortable in-betweenness to spaces of afropeanity and cosmopolitanism both by embracing cultural hybridity and diversity.

            <DISS_para>L'écrivain sénégalais Léopold Sédar Senghor est connu pour être un défenseur du métissage culturel, de la civilisation de l'universel, du dialogue des cultures et du concept d'humanisme. Il suggère notamment la complémentarité entre les cultures et les populations comme fondement de toute grande civilisation, et il souligne l'importance de l'échange et du dialogue entre les cultures. L'idée de la multi-appartenance ou de l'identité caractérise l'œuvre des auteurs francophones subsahariens Léonora Miano, Calixthe Beyala et Alain Mabanckou. Cette thèse explore la (re)négociation de l'identité socioculturelle des Subsahariens francophones contemporains aux 20e et 21e siècles, en se concentrant sur les œuvres de Miano, Beyala et Mabanckou. À travers une lecture approfondie de mon corpus, j'examine comment ces auteurs présentent une ou plusieurs facettes constituant la nouvelle identité socioculturelle des Subsahariens d'aujourd'hui. Cette étude accorde une attention particulière à la manière dont ces auteurs traitent et repensent les notions de métissage, de frontière/frontière, d'afropéa, du corps féminin africain, des rôles de genre et de l'identité. En mettant en évidence les réalités socioculturelles et sexuelles qui conduisent les personnages subsahariens à se définir comme culturellement hybrides/métis ou comme socialement androgynes, j'analyse le traitement par les trois auteurs de la construction de leur identité dans une perspective phénoménologique, psychologique et sociologique. Dans ma thèse, je montre comment la renégociation de l'identité des Subsahariens résulte de l'émancipation sociale et sexuelle dans l'œuvre de Beyala, du métissage culturel dans l'œuvre de Mabanckou, et/ou de l'afropéanité ou de l'hybridité culturelle dans l'œuvre de Miano. En d'autres termes, cette étude montre comment les normes sociales, le patrimoine culturel et la société façonnent les rôles de genre et l'identité ; comment les expériences culturelles et l'ouverture à l'Autre affectent la vision du monde et l'identité des Subsahariens aujourd'hui. D'un point de vue sociologique, le chapitre deux analyse l'idée d'une androgynie sociale comme un changement subversif des rôles de genre pour repenser la relation entre les femmes et les hommes africains en tant que groupes sociaux et pour déconstruire les normes sociales et le regard de l'Autre concernant la représentation du corps féminin africain à travers l'œuvre de Beyala. Le chapitre trois explore l'impact du rêve occidental et du concept de " non-retour " dans le cas des migrants clandestins subsahariens. J'analyse comment Mabanckou traite les questions de la migration, de l'entre-deux et du non-retour d'un point de vue psychologique en soulignant comment les expériences vécues dans les sociétés africaines et françaises façonnent et affectent l'identité de ces Subsahariens. Le chapitre quatre examine comment l'idée d'afropéanité dans l'œuvre de Miano fait écho à la fois à la théorie de la poétique de la relation de Glissant, à la théorie du dialogue des cultures de Senghor et au cosmopolitisme de Mbembe pour créer un espace dans lequel les Subsahariens (y compris les Subsahariens non migrants) deviennent des hybrides culturels également connus sous le nom d'" Afropéens " en vivant leur culture d'adoption et en valorisant leurs racines africaines simultanément. À travers le travail de Miano et à partir d'une perspective phénoménologique, je montre comment ils passent consécutivement d'un espace d'entre-deux inconfortable à des espaces d'afropéanité et de cosmopolitisme en embrassant l'hybridité et la diversité culturelles.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The objective of this study was to evaluate how the design of the built environment can assist schoolteachers in their use of constructivist techniques as students transition from learning by play to didactic learning in early elementary learning spaces.  With the increased expectations and standards for early elementary school, how can the built environment support both teachers and constructivist learning approaches such as experiential and active learning strategies to increase interactive and playful learning?Children’s transition to structured schooling is associated with new experiences and challenges for students and parents.  Students experience new environments, people, and modes of learning (Fabian &amp; Dunlop, 2007).  In addition to this impactful life transition as children enter primary school, increased state-mandated standards have resulted in more didactic teaching approaches in kindergarten causing an abrupt transition to sedentary learning from play focused learning in prekindergarten (“The New First Grade: Too Much Too Soon,” 2006; Miller &amp; Almon, 2009).  
However, Friedrich Froebel’s intent for kindergarten was far different than what we see today, with kindergartens looking far different when compared to the original and prekindergarten in the United States more accurately resembling Froebel’s vision (Fabian &amp; Dunlop, 2007).  Early childhood theorists, Piaget and Vygotsky, deemed learning by play essential for young children, proving critical for social and emotional skills (Wenner, 2009; Barros, Silver, &amp; Stein, 2009; Coolahan, Fantuzzo, Mendez, &amp; McDermott, 2000; Raver &amp; Ziegler, 1997; Fantuzzo &amp; McWayne, 2002; Coolahan, Fantuzzo, Mendez, &amp; McDermott, 2000; Yogman, 2018).  There is evidence to show children in early elementary school, learn best by doing; (Taylor &amp; Boyer, 2019; Yogman, 2018) so, the physical classroom environment and supportive learning spaces should support this type of active and playful learning by providing spaces that allow teachers to engage their students in these types of learning experiences.  Priorities have shifted due to increased expectations as many teachers find themselves in a dilemma balancing didactic teaching for learning standards versus developmentally appropriate practices.  
Design considerations of the physical classroom impact how a teacher engages students in subject matter (Byers, Imms, &amp; Hartnell-Young, 2014; Thomas, 2010; Monahan, 2002).  Design of the built environment can also assist teachers’ utilization of active learning strategies through intentional space planning and design programming.  This study hopes to understand how learning spaces can support active learning, equipping teachers with the spaces, layout, and technology needed to accommodate active learning practices to meet required objectives.  
By evaluating constructivist active learning strategies through a qualitative study, the researcher aims to use design as a tool to lessen the abrupt change from playful learning to sedentary learning commonly occurring as students transition into primary school.  Findings from a teacher focus group provided the researcher with emergent themes aligning with constructivist pedagogy for Florida’s early elementary learning standards.  Focus group discussion provided the researcher with the design considerations and programming criteria to form a comprehensive design solution to ease the transition into didactic learning through a variety of learning environments and design considerations supportive of active learning strategies.

            <DISS_para>This dissertation research examines the acquisition of second language vowels. For second language learners, learning a new languages’ sound inventory, particularly its vowels, presents a challenge perceptually and in terms of production. Incorrectly perceiving and producing sounds in a second language results in a foreign accent in many adult learners (Flege, 1995), as mental representations of second language sounds have not been properly established in the mind of the learner (Best, 1991). Vowel sounds are particularly relevant in discussion of foreign-accented speech.Second language vowel perception has received relatively little attention in recent literature, especially for English speakers learning Spanish as a second language. Often, empirical findings are inconsistent with each other. For example, Gordon (2011) found that, perceptually, learners struggle with Spanish vowels /i/ and /e/, interpreting them as English vowels /ɪ/ and /ɛ/, respectively. Garcia de las Bayonas (2004; 2008) indicates that learners struggle most perceiving /u/ and /e/. Most research on the acquisition of these vowels focuses on learner production rather than perception, with equally inconsistent findings (see, for example, Cobb &amp; Simonet, 2015; Menke &amp; Face, 2010). Additionally, the role of syllable stress is often not incorporated into these studies despite the importance of syllable stress in saliency and understanding. These gaps in the literature present an exciting opportunity to understand these acquisitional processes, beginning with the under-studied role of perception. 
Building on the methodology of Garcia de las Bayonas (2004) and other perceptual studies, this remotely conducted study explores the perception of Spanish vowels by English-speaking learners with special attention paid to the role of syllable stress. Efforts are made to better understand (1) at what point these learners establish the mental representations necessary for Spanish vowel sounds, (2) which English vowels interfere with this learning process, and (3) the role of syllable stress in vowel perception.
Participants included 243 Spanish learners in seven different levels of Spanish learning, indicated by class enrollment. The methodology include a discrimination task and an identification task. In the discrimination task, participants hea two disyllabic Spanish words and are asked to decide if the words were different or identical. In the identification task, participants are given a disyllabic Spanish word with one vowel highlighted. Participants are provided with five vowel sounds and select which of the sound options belonged with the highlighted vowel. The options consist of both Spanish and English vowel sound options. Confidence levels (on a scale of 1-7) are reported for all responses.
Results from the first task indicate that vowels in stressed syllables are easier to perceive for all groups. For less-experienced learners, discriminating between the Spanish vowels /o/ and /u/ prove to be most difficult, as these vowels differ acoustically much more than their English vowel equivalents. The results of this task indicate that students in their fourth semester of learning (and those more advanced) performed statistically similar to native speaker controls.
The identification task reveals that learners struggle to correctly identify the Spanish vowels /e/ and /a/. When asked to identify the vowel /e/, many learners select the English vowels /ɛ/, and especially /ɪ/. For items targeting /a/, many participants select /æ/, /ɑ/ and the reduced vowel schwa [ə]. These results indicate that these English vowels cause the most interference for learners learning Spanish, resulting in Multiple-category Assimilation (Best, 1991; Escudero &amp; Boersma, 2002). Results from this task also indicate that learners in their 4th semester, and those who are more advanced, tend to make selections statistically similar to native Spanish speakers. 
The results of this study indicate that by the end of the second year of classroom study, many second language Spanish learners have established mental representations for the vowels of Spanish. Language dominance scores are also collected from each participant (using the Bilingual Language Profile (Birdsong, Gertken, &amp; Amengual, 2012)), which were found to have a strong linear correlation with performance in both tasks, both in terms of accuracy and reported confidence levels. This supports the notion that the more a person uses a language, the better established their phonological inventory will be. Measures of language proficiency and language attitudes are also found to be correlated with participants’ accuracy and confidence levels.
These findings support theoretical claims made by the Perceptual Assimilation Model (Best, 1991), and shows the process by which mental representations are established for second language phones. Future studies should explore these results in conjunction with vowel production while not forgetting the effect of syllable stress.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Swiss composer, educator, and creator of eurhythmics Émile Jaques-Dalcroze (1865-1950) oriented his pedagogical philosophy around the concept of unifying the mind-body split, the ontology that is often attributed to René Descartes and Western traditions of thought. In this dissertation I consider how Jaques-Dalcroze sought to instrumentalize music and musicality toward mind-body unity and how contemporary Dalcroze Eurhythmics practice remains committed to giving students the sense of returning to their bodies and becoming whole, integrated selves, and in the process finding joy and interconnectedness. The term “eurhythmics,” not a coinage of Jaques-Dalcroze himself, uses the Greek prefix eu- to signify the goodness, health, and ease that early practitioners observed to be its benefits. The study draws upon analyses and histories of modernism from the fields of literature, cultural geography, and musicology to place eurhythmics within the discourse of modernism in a way that previous scholarship has not yet done. Within musicology, the past thirty years or so have witnessed a fruition of scholarship on embodiment. At the outset of this movement to include the body more explicitly and more thoughtfully in scholarly analyses of music, such work represented a necessary counterbalance to existing paradigms. Now that embodiment is a well-developed terrain in the discipline, it is possible to position Jaques-Dalcroze, a figure whose work centralizes the body, in this musicological tradition and to think about what a history of his eurhythmics can add to our understanding of musical modernism.
 It is instructive to think of Jaques-Dalcroze as a modernist artist both because of the role he assigned to music and more specifically because of his preoccupation with rhythm. Rhythm was a topic of great interest to philosophers, physicians, painters, and acousticians at the turn of the twentieth century in Europe and America; in fact, it would be difficult to name a field in which rhythm did not garner excitement. Influenced by his rhythm-obsessed milieu and by German Idealism, Jaques-Dalcroze conceived of music as transcendent, and though eurhythmics is ostensibly about the mind-body unification that he described in his own writings, he also frequently expressed a desire for music to help transcend the trappings of physicality. He often wrote about “absolute” music as the highest form of music. I argue that this is because, paradoxically, he feared the sensuality of the body and the diversity of human bodily forms. The major critique that runs throughout the dissertation is thus that Jaques-Dalcroze’s claim for eurhythmics as a restorative force in the face of fin-de siècle decadence and later after the destruction of the First World War was not equitably conceived. Rather, it was ineluctably marred by his commitment to sexist, racialist, and ethnonationalist views. He was a believer in the utopia and universality of rhythmic movement at the same time as he professed anti-Semitic and anti-Black views. 
Jaques-Dalcroze’s career trajectory is telling as to how he came to espouse his discriminatory views. He framed his experience of non-Western musics in French-colonized Algiers as the impetus to centralizing rhythm in his pedagogy. His accounts of this time of inspiration are marked by the anti-Black racialized stereotyping that was endemic to the colonizer perspective within many colonialist contexts. I argue that histories of eurhythmics must no longer recapitulate the existing pattern in scholarship that for the most part overlooks the racialism embedded in Jaques-Dalcroze’s recollections of the creative stimulus he found abroad. His later involvement with German industrialists and architects enabled him to play out an idea of a eurhythmic utopia at Hellerau, near Dresden. It is evident that Jaques-Dalcroze associated himself with staunch anti-Semites there, but it is likely that his own anti-Semitism predated those associations. 
By examining textual evidence supplemented with iconography, I reconstruct a history of eurhythmics as it existed under the auspices of its creator. I focus on the early period of this history, from the 1880s to about 1930, and on continental European settings, even as eurhythmics found enthusiastic support in England and America by 1920. My delimitations allow me to conclude that Jaques-Dalcroze was a product of a period of intense ethnonationalist sentiment, and while he might be dismissed by some as merely a product of his time, I maintain that historical relativism should not excuse his racist biases. When we discuss Jaques-Dalcroze’s premise of mind-body unity today, we should account for his intent to include only certain groups of people in this utopian construction.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>A playing position that many sports team cannot play without is a goalkeeper. Goalkeepers hold a vital role on their team due to their unique positional requirements such as being the last line of defense and having task and motivational leadership obligations. As a result, it can be argued that they are a highly instrumental or indispensable playing position within their team. It can also be suggested that the cognitive, emotional, and behavioral outcomes goalkeepers might face are related to their indispensability towards their teams’ success and the relationship with their team and coach. Thus, the purposes of the present study were to determine if goalkeepers were the most indispensable position in their sport and to understand what makes them indispensable. Additionally, this study examined the outcomes of perceived indispensability for athletes and determined if the team environment acted as a moderator. A sample of 229 athletes from 47 competitive collegiate teams completed an online survey comprised of measures for self-perceptions of indispensability and leadership duties, other perceptions of indispensability and leadership duties of playing positions, effort, enjoyment, concerns over mistakes, perceived pressure, anxiety, excitement, team-cohesion, and the coach-athlete relationship. By conducting multiple quantitative analyses, the results showed that goalkeepers are perceived by their teammates to be the most indispensable due to their role requirements and leadership duties. The results also revealed that the more indispensable the athletes feel, the greater effort, excitement, and enjoyment they have when competing. Athletes’ individual attraction and relatedness to their team’s tasks and goals was found to moderate the relationships between self-indispensability and athletes’ thoughts of concerns over mistakes and perceived pressure. These findings support and add to the definition and outcomes of social indispensability. The present study can provide practitioners and coaches with an increased awareness of the cognitive, behavioral, emotional, and social impact of being a goalkeeper as well as teach them importance of helping athletes improve perceptions of self-indispensability.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>     Of the fundamental elements of Western music, tempo could be considered among the most vital because of its outsized impact on the remaining elements. The performance and maintenance of tempo in musical context requires precise timing and correction at multiple neurological levels. For well over 100 years psychologists have used tempo-related timing tasks, most frequently in the form of synchronization or self-paced tapping tasks, to explore the neurological underpinnings of the unique human timing system. Yet, despite the importance of tempo and timekeeping to music, music researchers have not often explored the performance of steady beats among live musicians. Therefore, the purpose of this dissertation was to investigate the temporal consistency of different experience groups of university-aged wind instrumentalists in both a continuation tapping task and a short playing task. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>      Participants (N = 80) were undergraduate non-music majors, undergraduate music majors, and graduate wind performance majors. The three distinct groups had different musical backgrounds—such as the number of years playing their instrument or studying their instrument privately—and reported different amounts of independent metronome use. The participants engaged in a synchronization-continuation tapping task using a drum stick at two different tempos and the amount of interval-to-interval variability as well as drift from metronomic time were considered. The variability of intervals in the tapping task were not significantly different between the three groups; however, the amount of drift was significantly different between the groups. The least experienced musicians typically exhibited greater drift—both positive and negative—than the more experienced musicians. Further, both the tempo and the order of the tapping tasks impacted performance. Last, repeated performance of the tasks showed some evidence of improvement especially for the less-experienced participants.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>     Participants performed a modified version of the melody from Beethoven’s Ode to Joy on their primary instrument after listening to a metronome in the playing task. The same dependent measures as the tapping task were calculated. There were significant differences between the three groups for both variability and drift. Correlations between participant tapping and playing performance, however, were weak suggesting that tapping and playing performance were based on different skills—at least in this investigation. Potential reasons for this lack of relationship are discussed including the possibility of residual expressive timing playing a role. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>      Secondary research questions were also addressed in the context of these results. First, participants were asked to self-assess their own temporal performance in both the tapping and playing task (i.e., rushing, dragging, or staying in time). Participants’ assessments were correct at chance levels suggesting an inability to accurately assess their own performance. Second, participants were asked about the specific strategies they had employed to complete the tasks. Strategies like “internalizing the pulse” or “subdividing” were often listed by participants yet mentions of these strategies were sometimes paired with inconsistent tempo performance. Thus, the impact of such strategies remains to be tested. Suggestions for future music research in this area as well as potential impacts in music education are discussed. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Marine sediments are one of the largest habitats on Earth and are home to an incredibly diverse array of microbial and meiofaunal organisms. Although these organisms are invisible to the naked eye, they are a vital component of the marine ecosystem. Infaunal microorganisms and meiofauna are integral in mediation of nutrient cycling, bioturbation, and biostabilization of sediments. Due to their rapid generation times and metabolism, they can also provide insight into disturbances, whether the source be anthropogenic or natural, on small time scales. In order to identify variation in community structure it is crucial that an understanding of the impact of environmental fluctuation be ascertained. Here we utilized eDNA metabarcoding of the 16S and 18S genes to analyze the microbial and meiofaunal community structure of sites exhibiting differing near-bottom flow speeds as determined by a novel model of hydrodynamic conditions along the West Florida Escarpment in the Gulf of Mexico. We separated the sample sites into current regime groups based on the fifty percentile and maximum speed outputs of modelled conditions. Cores from each location were further categorized based on depth in the sediment. Community structure was significantly different between sediment depth layers; however, no significant variation in structure was observed for either gene  based on the current regime group using either modelled speed output. Composition and richness did fluctuate amongst sites and treatments with varying significance. Our results yield new insight into the structure of microbial and meiofaunal assemblages in the deep-sea and suggest that a more comprehensive strategy is required to elucidate patterns of infaunal community structure.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Alcoholic myopathy is a wasting condition that effects skeletal muscle mass.  One factor that may contribute to alcoholic myopathy is anabolic resistance which is induced by alcohol intake and leads to a suppression of protein synthesis following an anabolic stimulus. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of glycine in a model of acute alcohol consumption and its ability to alter the anabolic resistant state induced by alcohol.  The purpose of aim 1 was to establish whether refeeding significantly altered protein synthesis and components of the mTORC1 pathway when alcohol and or glycine was consumed It was hypothesized that there would be a refeeding affect and the treatment groups with EtOH present in the diet would not show increased signaling in protein synthesis or components of the mTORC1 pathway. To accomplish this, female mice were split into five treatment groups including Control-Fasted, Control-Refed, EtOH-Refed, Control-Refed+Glycine, and EtOH+Refed+Glycine. The Refed groups were fasted for 16 hours during the light cycle and provided food after the fast for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes of refeeding, food was removed and tissue collection of the Gastrocnemius occurred 30 minutes after the removal of food. Proteins and mRNA of the gastrocnemius were analyzed using Western blotting and RT-PCR techniques. A refeeding affect was found for mTORC1 substrates rpS6 S240/244 and Akt T308 in the Control-Refed group compared to the Control-Fasted group. The second aim of the study was to determine whether glycine would be able to prevent EtOH induced anabolic resistance. We hypothesized that glycine would diminish the effects of EtOH and restore levels of protein synthesis and mTOR1 signaling associated with refeeding that are reduced by alcohol. The same treatment groups were used as Aim 1 excluding the Control-Fasted group. Puromycin used to express protein synthesis, 4E-BP1 S65, and Akt T308 were reduced in the EtOH-glycine-refed group compared to the Control-Refed treatment group. A main effect of alcohol for reducing mTOR S2448, S6K1 T389, rpS6 240/244, and ULK1 S757 was also found, while glycine did not offset this effect. Therefore, glycine is an ineffective method of abating the anabolic resistant state induced through the consumption of alcohol.  </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Speech production is a learned behavior requiring sensorimotor integration. For humans and other species that produce learned vocalizations, an individual must be exposed to sufficient auditory input, typically early in development. Then, a progression through a series of sensorimotor learning phases occurs to produce patterned vocalizations. Lack of or a reduction in auditory input can delay or permanently impair an individual’s ability to accurately produce vocalizations. This effect is seen in both humans and in other species, including songbirds. Male zebra finches, but not females, learn to sing a stereotyped song by adulthood based on early auditory experience and require sensory feedback to maintain it. If juveniles do not receive sufficient song exposure, then they will not produce a stereotyped one as adults. This suggests that the neural network controlling song production is affected by auditory experience. There are several ways that this could happen, but two potential options are through altering the activity and organization of neurons in nuclei that modulate vocalizations. Auditory input could alter the activity of individual neurons, subsequently affecting activation patterns generated within a nucleus. Alternatively, it could affect the ability to propagate information between cells by acting on their physical constraints (morphology). If sufficient tutoring is necessary for song production, then the effects of it on neurons in the premotor nucleus HVC should occur during song learning. The results suggest that auditory experience affects cell physiology in both singing and non-singing birds. Additionally, there are sex differences in both cell physiology and morphology, to differing degrees. Since auditory experience affects premotor neurons in developing birds, then it is possible that it could have an effect in older birds that have already learned their song. One way to assess the role of auditory experience is by examining song deterioration following loss of auditory input. This deafening-induced song deterioration, which is seen in both birds and humans, demonstrates that proper auditory feedback is necessary to maintain previously learned vocalizations. Spectral and temporal song degradation are dependent on the structure of the original song, age at deafening, and amount of singing experience. More song practice and older age have a protective effect against deterioration.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Building more intelligent and more resourceful dialogue systems has been a long sought-after goal in Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing. In this dissertation, we investigate two topics in deep learning based dialogue systems: Leveraging Knowledge Graph (KG) in Query Rewriting (QR), and balancing multi-domain corpora in response generation.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Query rewriting is a critical component in dialogue systems to reduce frictions caused by systematic errors or user ambiguity.  When there is an entity error, it imposes extra difficulties for a dialogue system to produce satisfactory interpretation. Knowledge Graph information can be beneficial for query rewriting, as common queries for dialogue systems are often related to external knowledge like celebrity names, artworks names, and locations. In this dissertation, we investigate how to incorporate knowledge graph for query rewriting. In particular, we study knowledge graph based entity retrieval in query rewriting. We utilize neural encoders to produce utterance/entity embeddings, and similarity search for entity retrieval. We incorporate KG to provide graph structural information (neighboring entities in KG encoded by Graph Neural Network) and textual information (KG entity descriptions encoded by RoBERTa). Experimental results show that both hard negative sampling and incorporation of knowledge graph consistently improve retrieval precision on all test sets. We observe large performance gain from utilizing KG on few-shot test entities. This shows that external knowledge information is particularly beneficial for dealing with rarely seen cases.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Open-domain conversational systems are assumed to generate good responses on multiple domains. Previous work achieved good performance on a single corpus, but combining multiple corpora from different domains is less studied. In this dissertation, we explore methods that deal with multi-domain corpora. We first investigate interleaved learning which intermingles multiple corpora as the baseline. We then investigate two multi-domain learning methods, labeled learning and multi-task labeled learning, which encode each corpus through a unique embedding. Furthermore, we propose Domain-specific Frequency (DF), a novel word-level importance weight that measures the relative importance of a word in a specific corpus compared to multiple corpora. Based on DF, we propose weighted learning, a method that integrates DF to the loss function, and we also adopt DF as a new evaluation metric. Extensive experiments show that our methods gain significant improvements on both automatic and human evaluation. We share our code and data for reproducibility.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Our main contributions are the following: 1. We propose a knowledge graph enhanced system for query rewriting, leveraging both graph neighbor information and entity textual description. 2. We propose labeled learning and multi-task labeled learning for open domain, and show these two methods achieve significant improvements on automatic and human evaluation.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Interactions between clouds, water vapor, radiation, and circulation influence the organization of tropical convection, and the development of tropical cyclones (TCs). This includes the self-aggregation (SA) of convection in idealized models, in which a random distribution of clouds spontaneously transitions to coherent moist convective clusters, surrounded by dry air. The resulting organized convection may exist in several modes, including TCs when rotation is introduced. This suggests that SA, and the relative roles of the mechanisms that cause it, change with the strength of the background rotation (f). This hypothesis is addressed using a hierarchy of cloud-resolving model simulations. 31 f-plane simulations correspond to latitudes between 0.1°-20°N, simulating a range of tropical and near-equatorial environments largely unexplored in prior literature. Five β-plane experiments are also developed to study co-existent TCs, SA, and equatorial waves in a large, more realistic domain. In particular, these simulations allow the isolation of specific feedbacks contributing to SA, how these change with f, and the fundamental physics behind spontaneous TC genesis when convection is allowed to operate freely.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Simulations on the f-plane show that SA depends strongly on the background rotation. Under weak rotation (≤ 5°N), radiative feedbacks dominate in organizing convection into one coherent cluster. In cases where this cluster takes a circular shape, a weak TC subsequently forms following a ``bottom-up'' pathway, aided by low-level convergence from a large-scale overturning circulation. In β-plane simulations, equatorial organized convection is dominated by spontaneous Kelvin and equatorial Rossby waves. Under stronger rotation, SA only exists in the form of TCs. This occurs if surface enthalpy flux feedbacks can offset the negative feedback from advective processes. Upon TC genesis from an initial mid-level vortex, drying subsequently takes place elsewhere. In between these two well-defined regimes, SA fails to fully take place.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Finally, 20°N f-plane simulations are used to test how a limited set of observations captures moist static energy (MSE) variability around TCs. This is done to assess if radiative and surface flux feedbacks can reasonably be quantified in real TCs. Various patterns of grid points are developed to resemble dropsonde launch points in aircraft reconnaissance flight patterns. This work reveals that the TC's mid- and upper-level warm core contributes significantly to MSE variance, and that estimates of MSE variance and feedbacks are sensitive to the radial distribution of dropsondes.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation addresses the printed works of mathematician, Peter Apian (1495-1552). A prolific writer and scholar, Apian produced works on a range of subjects including astronomy, cosmography, and instrumentation which were noteworthy for their extensive use of illustrations and interactive paper instruments which could be manipulated within the space of the book or even removed to function as instruments when pasted onto wooden supports. Apian’s creative use of print technology to develop new types of illustrations and instruments was tied to his position as both a scholar of mathematics and his role as a printer, granting him access to both the technical and intellectual sides of his field of mathematics. The novelty of his publications not only expanded the readership for practical mathematical subjects but also demonstrated the importance of images and instruments in encouraging observational practices during the early modern period. Because of this, Apian’s works represent an ideal way of understanding the nature of scientific innovation during the sixteenth century and the factors that influenced creative new achievements in print. Apian’s innovations in instrument manufacture and dissemination brought different types of practical tools to a wider readership and positioned observational practice as a critical part of knowledge making. By examining Apian’s readership, his ideas about instrumentation in mathematics, and his relations with patrons, this dissertation demonstrates the complex social networks at play in the burgeoning community of science as well as the role of images in fostering new connections between ideas and readers.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The intensified process of globalization has reconfigured the formation and composition of sport fandom, which was—for a long period of time throughout history—rooted in local social practices and identities. With advances in telecommunication technology, today, many people follow, support, and identify with sport teams at a distance; they become ‘distant sport fans.’ In this project, I seek to understand the formation of distant sport fandom. Research pertaining to sport fandom has been generally conducted from two decoupled perspectives, yet complicit in studying local sport fans. Sport marketing scholars have focused on the psychological connection between fans and a sport team. While meaningfully theorizing the formation of fan’s identification towards a sport team, this approach can be bolstered by accounting for some important nuances that are situated in the context of sport fandom. Conversely, researchers of sport sociology have recognized the context that has made the contemporary fan identity a consumer identity in nature. However, many sociologists have not studied how, at the individual level, a fan identity is formed.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This project marks an attempt to integrate these different fields of inquiry in presenting a more complex understanding of sport fandom and the formation of fan identity in the age of neoliberal globalization. Specifically, drawing upon theoretical perspectives that seek to explore the historically-specific conjunctures of what is often referred to as the ‘neoliberal condition,’ I aim to understand how structural forces shape the processes through which distant fan identities are formed. Upon reviewing the relevant literature, I believe mediation is an important concept for us to deconstruct and understand how our daily experiences, ways of perceiving, and social relations are deeply embedded within the advanced capitalist mode of production as we continue living our lives in a mass-mediated world or the “spectacle” in Guy Debord’s (2014) words. In this project, I chose to focus on the case of Chinese distant soccer fans. By interviewing some Chinese distant fans of Bayern Munich within a certain local context, such an inquiry allowed me to highlight the importance of context in studying sport fandom, while also taking an individual’s psychological connection to a distant sport team into consideration.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Based on the online semi-structured interviews conducted, I discovered that, since distant fans rely on contextualized media outlets as their major access to a foreign sport team, they are likely to form their connection to a distant team based on some unique team objects, differing from the previously studied local fans. Sport fandom is contextualized in a particular local setting when distant fans’ experiences with a team are mediated by global (the team itself and the foreign sponsors of a team) and local mediators (the domestic sponsors of a team, fans’ social relations, streaming companies within a local context, and the local government) across the global-local conjunctures. To further complicate the scenario, fans’ experiences with a team can also be mediated by the interplay between global and local mediation, leading to their unique meaning-making of a distant sport team within a certain local context. For instance, some Chinese distant fans believed that their favorite soccer team should stay away from the political sphere so that the team would not be banned by the Chinese government; this meaning-making interestingly differs from how local fans usually make sense of a sport team now in the west.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The profound schematics of mediation then lead us to consider the extent to which structural forces can shape the ways through which distant fandom is formed in the contemporary era of neoliberalization. My project implicates that the expansion of the global soccer industry and China’s neoliberalization may constitute the growth of distant fandom in the context of China. Through new ways of media production, soccer culture has been disseminated primarily for the purpose of establishing a sport consumer’s attachment to a team. In the context of China, the global expansion of the soccer industry leads to the formation of new fan communities with some Chinese characteristics. Distant fandom can also be regarded as a neoliberal project that has been created alongside China’s economic opening-up. By identifying with a distant sport team, distant fans in China not only respond to but also carry forth the aforementioned structural forces, perpetuating and reproducing the further global and local progression of neoliberalization. In these ways, I explicated how individuals become distant spectators and how that process of identification might lead to different perceptions, intentions, and identities from the previously researched local fans.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Registration often plays a critical role in many fields, including but not limited to computer vision,shape analysis, and human activity recognition. Curves and times series data usually present a sort
of misalignment, and it impedes a model from revealing a pattern of a given data set, which results
in misleading performance in terms of tasks such as classification, clustering, etc. A successful
alignment algorithm can better preserve the main structure of given functions and lead to an
efficient model to capture the primary source of data variability.
This essay presents a novel functional registration framework: Square-Root Velocity Function
Registration Net(SrvfRegNet). SrvfRegNet architecture trains by optimizing the elastic metricbased objective function on the training data and then applies this trained network to the test
data to perform fast registration. In case the training and the test data are from different classes,
it generalizes to the test data using transfer learning, i.e., retraining of only the last few layers of
the network. We demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of this framework using several standard
curve datasets.
The second approach is Elastic Registration Net (ElasticRegNet)). Both methods share all
properties that the SrvfRegNet holds, but it can align data sharply using different smoothing
operations. Furthermore, the theElasticRegNet is more suited to transfer learning in registration
given its light architecture.
The last model is Residual SRVF Net (ReSRVFNet), which is designed for aligning large
datasets. ReSRVFNet can make high-quality alignment on massive datasets that the traditional
dynamic programming algorithm (DPA) cannot process efficiently. Also, we combine the alignment concept with classification models to boost classification significantly. We demonstrate this
integrated approach with multiple real-world datasets.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Linguistic alignment is a well-documented phenomenon that describes the act of adjusting your speech to match your partner’s. This can take various forms – by changing your tone, pitch, speech rate, or even the types of words each speaker uses. Although linguistic alignment is established, the nuances regarding alignment are less so. For example, do some speakers adapt to others more than the general population? Further, are there some people who elicit the adaptations very broadly? The focus of my dissertation was to establish adaptation in naturalistic speech and then explore the factors that affect the alignment. Experimenters in my study called businesses and asked, either At/What time do you close? There are two main findings from this dissertation. First, I demonstrated a structural priming effect (e.g., participants who were asked prepositional questions were more likely to respond using a preposition). Second, some speakers elicited stronger priming (alignment) than others, and this effect was reliable across time. My dissertation suggests individual differences in speakers may exist that can affect linguistic alignment in naturalistic speech. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>     This qualitative case study explored how course context, such as course design, facilitation, and community, supports students’ basic psychological needs and thus shapes their situational motivation to participate in asynchronous online discussions in different course contexts. Three upper-level undergraduate courses in different disciplines were investigated. All three courses were fully online courses and utilized asynchronous online discussion as one of the regular class activities. However, most students were on-campus students who took online courses for flexibility. There were a few distance learners in one of the courses. This study was conducted in a natural setting without any intervention to control the course events. Instead, interview, participation diaries, discussion archives, and surveys were used to collect data.     For each course, four to six students participated in the interviews and created participation diaries. The instructors and the TAs were also invited to be interviewed before and after the five weeks of discussions. Each course was analyzed separately to obtain individual findings within a specific course context including course design, facilitation, and community. Each course used a different approach for the weekly discussion activities. The first case used project-based discussion, the second case used topic-based discussion, and the third case used problem-based discussion. For these tasks with different discussion designs, facilitation strategies, and peer interaction, students from each case shared different perspectives regarding their satisfaction of needs and situational motivation to participate in online discussions actively and passively. A cross-case comparison provided a local theory and implications regarding instructional design to maximize students’ situational motivation to participate in online discussions. 
     When students’ basic needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness were met, the quality of participation increased because students exerted more effort and time into writing quality posts. The increased quality of posts enhanced students’ passive participation to learn more from others. Their basic needs were primarily supported by the discussion design and instructor’s facilitation. However, students’ participation is extrinsic in general because they have to participate both actively and passively to meet the requirements. Therefore, both the quantity and quality of participation can be shaped through situational motivation generated by the discussion design and instructor facilitation. When a course is challenging, the need for competence through the instructor’s guidance and support increases, and the need for relatedness to help each other elevate their competence also increases. 
     Although situational motivation within the course context is critical, students’ motivation to participate resulted from the interplay between personal traits and environmental factors within the course context. This means that different types of motivations interplay at various levels and generate students’ motivation to participate both actively and passively. For example, when students’ basic needs were met, students’ personal goal orientation became salient because some students needed more justification for extra effort. When a course is difficult, students’ self-regulation skills or prior knowledge become a critical factor in their active participation and satisfaction. Overall, this case study added to previous findings about course design factors affecting participation by answering the “how” question instead of the “what” question which was the focus of most previous studies. This study also provided some answers about the “reasons” behind the intertwined relationships between the course elements, needs satisfaction, and learner motivation instead of focusing on the relationships themselves.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The primary goal of this dissertation is to theoretically propose an indicator that captures the effectiveness of Christian, both conservative Christian and Catholic, schooling on students’ religious socialization in the academic domain and to empirically evaluate the effectiveness of Christian schooling using the indicator. In spite of the fact that Christian schooling has been ultimately intended for students’ academic development and religious socialization simultaneously and the two aims are so closely connected, there has been little systematic effort to evaluate the effectiveness of Christian schooling by focusing on religious significances of academic development. As an effort to fill in the gap in the literature, this study suggests a normative expectation that if Christian schooling is effective, then Christian school students would form weaker academic contingent self-worth than public school students; then, in order to test whether the normative expectation is empirically supported, an ordinary least squares regression with dummy interaction terms and a two-way analysis of variance combined with the inverse probability of treatment weighting were respectively conducted using the datasets of the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988. As a result, it was found that there is no empirical evidence to confirm the normative expectation for Christian schooling, which is, in turn, led to the provisional conclusion that at least during the late 1980s and early 1990s, Christian schooling may not have been effective in leading students to internalize religious significances of academic development. Based on the conclusion, several implications are suggested including the need to revisit the practices of Christian school teachers and administrators. Finally, suggestions for future research are discussed.</DISS_para>

      <DISS_content>
         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In real-world mission planning, the environment can be quite complex, and a path planner has thepotential to enable an agent to fulfill its goals in spite of unanticipated events and unexpected situations. A sound path planner defines a path starting from a source point and arriving ultimately at
a goal point. The path planning algorithms for autonomous vehicles (AVs) are broadly categorized
into two sub-areas: global path planning and local path planning. A global path planner employs
known information about the operational environment to return a path from the start point to the
goal while avoiding fixed obstacles. Here obstacles are static, such as islands, docks, ship wrecks,
etc. The path is determined prior to the AV’s departure. In contrast, a local path planner recalculates the path returned by the global path planner as needed to avoid unexpected moving obstacles
such as ships, boats, swimmers, other AVs, etc.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This work initially addresses these issues by working on the most commonly used node-basedA* algorithm and the sampling-based probabilistic road map (PRM) algorithm. The work has
found that the A* algorithm successfully avoids fixed obstacles, but the path is not smooth (makes
very sharp turns) and sometimes comes dangerously close to the obstacle being avoided. An issue
with the PRM algorithm is that the generated path often is not always optimal, i.e., may be much
longer than necessary to avoid the given obstacles. Hence, initially, the work has combined these
two approaches in such a way that these deficiencies are remedied. In particular, the computed
path is both smooth and close to optimal. In addition, this work further improves the PRM-A*
algorithm to maintain a safe distance from fixed obstacles.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The work subsequently adopted as an alternative the deterministic (non-heuristic) Grassfire(GF) algorithm. GF is conceptually simpler than A* and therefore easier to implement. For these
reasons, this research explored replacing A* with GF in the hybrid method. In addition, it was found that the PRM
algorithm could be simplified by adopting a different method for creating the roadmap. This led to
a variant of PRM, here dubbed the recursive probabilistic road map (r-PRM). This is conceptually
simpler than the original PRM and typically is faster. Accordingly, this later work presents a novel
global planner that employs a combination of three path planners: GF, Modified Grassfire (MGF),
and r-PRM. This combination is guaranteed to find a path from any given start point to any given
goal point, as long as such a path is possible.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>For dealing with the moving obstacles, this work first discusses a local path planner using anadaptation of the global path planning algorithm PRM-A*. It was proposed that this employ the
points randomly generated by PRM to construct a path around the moving obstacle. However, it
was found this has the drawback that relying on such points can lead to somewhat erratic behavior.
Thus this was replaced with a deterministic, geometrical approach that achieves the desired effect
in a more reliable manner. This local planner together with the later global path planner provide
a comprehensive path planning system.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The research has explored the prospect of implementing these algorithms in the well-knownMOOS-IvP simulation environment. PRM-A* has been ported to MOOS-IvP, thus enabling one
to simulate the use of that planner in controlling an AV in a realistic mission environment. This
applies only to the global planner, however, inasmuch as MOOS-IvP does not support simulation
of the local planner.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>An important feature of the local planner is that it employs a decision logic to determine the beststrategy for avoiding a moving obstacle, in particular, always routing the AV behind the obstacle
rather than in front of or parallel to it, whenever this is appropriate. Simulations are provided
exhibiting the acclaimed behavior. For comparison with other systems, the simulations include an
implementation of the well-known D* algorithm, and the discussion considers additional dynamic
path planning systems, which, like D*, do not necessarily route the AV behind the moving obstacle.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The aim of this study was to explore the experiences of international-student English language learners (ELLs), situated on a language learning plateau (L2P), who have been exposed to a Growth Mindset Pedagogy with Deliberate Practice.  The researcher used a qualitative research design, to document the experiences of five adult English language learners enrolled in an intermediate level composition course at a university-based Intensive English Program (IEP) in the southeastern region of the United States. The study investigated how a Growth Mindset Pedagogy with Deliberate Practice may facilitate growth language mindsets and propel movement beyond L2 plateaus.  The findings from this study revealed that a Growth Mindset Pedagogy with Deliberate Practice can facilitate growth language mindsets by fostering challenges through which learners build persistence and experiment with strategies to achieve L2 acquisition.  Additionally, Growth Mindset Pedagogy with Deliberate Practice can facilitate movement beyond L2 plateaus by raising learners’ consciousness and providing targeted learning strategies to practice and receive feedback.  </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Prevailing neurobiological models of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have focused on dysfunctions of a prefrontal-cortex-amygdala-hippocampal circuit in the top-down regulation of threat detection and emotion regulation. Nevertheless, evidence is accruing for a pathology in broad, low-level sensory hyperactivity that accounts for the unique sensory features of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). We have thus proposed a “sensory model” of PTSD, centered on deficient sensory gating and broad sensory hyperactivity. The neurophysiology of the model rests on “sensory disinhibition”, whereby disinhibited sensory processing allows for unfiltered sensory input to inundate the prefrontal cortex, even at rest, and the consequent prefrontal dysfunction further fuel sensory disinhibition, resulting in a vicious cycle to perpetuate PTSD pathology. Combining neuroimaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging/fMRI and electroencephalogram/EEG) and non-invasive brain stimulation, this dissertation conducted a series of five studies to test this sensory model and develop an intervention to enhance sensory inhibition. Study 1 (Chapter 2) revealed that resting-state (intrinsic) alpha (8-12 Hz) oscillations, a key neural process involved in sensory cortical inhibition and sensory gating, were deficient among patients with PTSD, the degree of which varied with PTSD symptom severity. These findings indicate intrinsic sensory disinhibition in PTSD. Study 2 (Chapter 3) replicated the initial findings in a sample of combat-exposed Veterans, particularly highlighting an association between alpha deficiency and symptoms of intrusive re-experiencing of trauma. Importantly, akin to our sensory model, it demonstrated that sensory disinhibition could contribute to intrusive reexperiencing through the activation of trauma memory via sensory cues. Study 3 (Chapter 4) isolated PTSD-related alpha deficits in the visual cortex and the default mode network (DMN), a key large-scale intrinsic neural network, as well as communication between the visual and the DMN. These findings thus elucidate a visual-cortex-DMN circuit dysfunction, highlighting that sensory disinhibition can underlie large-scale neural dysregulation in PTSD. Identification of this sensory pathology, which is closely associated with alpha deficiency, motivated Studies 4 and 5 to develop a novel intervention for this pathology by augmenting alpha oscillations. Study 4 (Chapter 5) applied alpha-frequency transcranial alternating current stimulation (i.e., α-tACS) over four consecutive days and demonstrated lasting and reliable alpha enhancement, which was further accompanied by reduction in anxious arousal and sensory aversion. Study 5 (Chapter 6), combining simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings with α-tACS, not only replicated the efficacy of α-tACS in alpha enhancement but also demonstrated DMN upregulation via α-tACS. Importantly, this DMN upregulation was mediated by alpha enhancement. Together, this series of studies provide converging evidence for the sensory disinhibition model of PTSD and identify a novel mechanism-based intervention that could be used to treat PTSD and related disorders.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Postsecondary institutions are viewed as spaces where students can become exposed to different ways of thinking and being beyond their own subjective experiences (Gortmaker &amp; Brown, 2006). Research has suggested that college-going queer women often characterize their universities as places where they can “be themselves” and find their voices as sexual and/or gender minorities (Valentine, Wood, &amp; Plummer, 2009). However, Formby (2017) and Rushbrook (2002) argue that these voices are often homogenized in postsecondary contexts, situating queer womanhood as a singular, universal entity while minimizing the presence of intersectional queer identities on campus (Goldman, 1996; Crenshaw, 1989; Ghabrial, 2016). This ethnographic study seeks to disrupt such narratives of homogeneity by exploring the complexities of queer womanhood at Florida State University, consequently mobilizing the postsecondary institution as a context characterized by simultaneous norms of inclusion and exclusion. This research will situate queer undergraduate women’s lived experiences as sites for unpacking the hybridity of campus culture, relying on interviews, focus groups, social media observations, multi-media responses, and photo journals to explore this relationship between the postsecondary context and students’ lived experiences and identity construction.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>One of the biggest roadblocks currently in the way of large scale quantum computationis the limited relaxation times of the current state of the art quantum computers. This
limitation is due to the use of superconducting qubits, which are large and therefore hard
to decouple from the environment. The most promising solution to the scalability problem
is the use of molecular spins, which will be the focus of this dissertation. Spins consisting of
Gd3+, Mn2+, Eu2+, etc. ions dilute in a non-magnetic matrix display a rich Electron Spin
Resonance spectra that is of interest for quantum computation. This dissertation details
the background theory of operation of spin based quantum computation and a proposed
design for sensitive spin detection. A novel differential DC SQUID readout method is
detailed for spin sensing in large magnetic fields. In field sensing is key for maximum
sensitivity and miniaturization of the circuitry. Analysis of the noise in the differential
readout is performed with some measurements and proposed methods of how to improve
sensitivity. Finally an electronic DC-SQUID Emulator is presented which allows for testing
DC-SQUID readout electronics.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The effects of pico-second pulsed laser ablation on the crystal structure and residual strain of sapphire is investigated using X-ray diffraction and Bayesian uncertainty analysis. Laser machining of sapphire has shown to be a viable manufacturing process to fabricate micron scale sapphire sensor materials for operation in high temperature and chemically corrosive environments. This method has shown to cause significant changes to the material’s modulus, strength, and toughness. The specific cause of these changes is hypothesized to be due to residual stress induced in the crystal lattice. This hypothesis is tested using X-ray diffraction coupled with Bayesian uncertainty quantification. The statistical analysis suggests in-plane compressive stresses on the laser-machined surface, which provides a plausible explanation for the observed increased bending strength and fracture toughness. In addition, anisotropic elasticity theory (Stroh’s Method) is used in conjunction with the Bayesian methodology to characterize the fracture toughness from Vicker’s indentations placed on the C(0001) and A(11-20) crystal planes. Estimates show the definitive presence of anisotropic fracture properties with in-plane energy release rates ranging from 8.66 ± 0.06 Jm^−2 for cracks on the A(11-20) plane to in excess of 16.19 ± 0.46 Jm^−2 for cracks within 10◦ of the M(1-100) plane. We achieve an uncertainty in the crack tip toughness over an order of magnitude lower than estimates from conventional bend-bar fracture studies by using the Bayesian methodology coupled with image processing tools. An additional study consisting of extending this proven methodology to a niobium sapphire interface is also proposed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Recently, there has been an increase in the awareness of sport concussion and its potential deleterious effects as progressively more research has been conducted within the past few decades. Despite this increase, there is much about sport concussion and the consequences of sport concussion that are still unknown. The current study aims to examine the prevalence of sport concussion in NCAA collegiate student athletes. Furthermore, this study seeks to investigate the prevalence of underreporting sport concussions as well as the factors that may lead athletes not to seek help for their concussion. To better understand mental health outcomes that follow sport concussion, this study attempts to understand the potential impact sport concussion has on mental health outcomes of depression and suicide ideation. Altogether, 964 student athletes across all three NCAA divisions were surveyed about their experiences in college with sport concussion. Results of this study indicate that there may be a long-term impact of sport concussion on depression and suicide ideation. Additionally, the leading reason student athletes reported they chose to not seek help for their sport concussion was being unsure of the signs and symptoms of concussion. Implications for future research, practice, and advocacy of sport and counseling psychologists are discussed. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The number of children living in poverty in the United States rose 14.4% from 2019 to 2020 (U.S. Census Bureau). In Florida, nearly one out of every four children live at or below the poverty threshold Koball and Jaing (2018). The complexities of life for people living in poverty are many. These complexities influence the education of students living in poverty.  This study explored a sample of teacher candidates’ attitudes toward people living in poverty. The survey instrument was The Undergraduate Perceptions of Poverty Survey (UPPTS) by Blair et al. (2014). This research represents the first time the UPPTS has been employed in the field of teacher preparation. It proved to be a helpful tool in collecting data from 106 participants, all enrolled in a teacher preparation program at a Predominantly White Institution in Florida. 
	The overall attitudes of teacher candidates in this sample were mainly positive, a very good sign for the teaching profession. The limitations of this study do not allow for generalizing these results to teacher candidates as a whole. Much more research using a variety of research methods is necessary for results to be generalizable for teacher candidates and the preparation programs training future teachers.  
Attitudes have been shown to influence teacher practices which in turn influence student achievement. Teacher attitudes toward student diversity influence their conscious and subconscious decision-making in the classroom limiting or expanding access students have to an equitable education. Teachers’ negative attitudes toward students living in poverty are not character flaws. They reflect a lack of experience and knowledge of the circumstances of poverty. This study may help inform research on how best to respond to attitudes toward poverty of teacher candidates and in-service teachers.

            <DISS_para>This dissertation consists of three chapters, each examining the impact of group identityon behavior in economic environments using experimental methods. Chapter One focuses
on understanding the effects of a common group identity on the formation, terms, and
sustainability of relational contracts. The experiment involves a group identity inducement
followed by an experimental labor market with unenforceable contracts. Chapter Two
examines the relative impact of common past experience in an ordeal, as distinct from
shared past experience, on cooperation via group identity. Subjects engage in an individual
task that determines Success or Failure. Subjects are then grouped according to their
outcome and participate in an infinitely repeated public goods experiment. Treatments
vary information provided to subjects. Chapter Three addresses how people differentially
incorporate information about other people when information involves in-group or outgroup
members. The chapter incorporates an experimental design that presents negative
information about an in-group or out-group member’s behavior.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This research demonstrates the techniques to potentially use continuous carbon nanotube (CNT) yarns to make high mechanical performance composites at scale for use in aerospace applications. CNT yarns are a way to convert carbon nanotubes into engineering scale materials. Fully CNT reinforced composites were manufactured using a filament winding process and aerospace grade resin systems. Manufacturing techniques were evaluated, including stretching, compression, resin impregnation, and flow control. Continuous CNT yarns were made into sizable unidirectional, 0°/90°, and quasi-isotropic composite laminates. The resultant composite panels achieved mechanical properties that exceed the current state of the art carbon fiber composites such as IM7/8552 CFRP.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The main goal of this dissertation is to examine the prosodic differences between English and Spanish that lead to different interpretations of ambiguous relative clauses. Prosody, or the rhythm, stress, and intonation of a spoken sentence, is known to have an influence on how individuals interpret ambiguous constructions (e.g., Lehiste 1973; Nespor &amp; Vogel 1983; Price et al. 1991; Kjelgaard &amp; Speer 1999; Schafer et al. 2000; Jun 2003; Kang &amp; Speer 2005; Millotte et al. 2007, 2008; etc.). Additionally, individual speakers have been shown to vary their prosody depending on the syntactic structure of a given utterance (e.g., Snedecker &amp; Trueswell 2003; Schafer et al. 2005; Kraljic &amp; Brennan 2005; etc.). Studies like these indicate that language users (both speakers and listeners) possess implicit awareness about the relationship between syntax and prosody, and they subconsciously know that they can use this information during both production and comprehension (Snedecker &amp; Casserly 2010). Relative clauses (henceforth, RCs) preceded by a complex determiner phrase (DP) of the type the ___ of the ___ are syntactically ambiguous because the RC could modify different head nouns. In (1a) below, the RC is bolded and could modify either the head noun son, called high attachment (HA) or the head noun senator, called low attachment (LA). The equivalent sentence in Spanish is shown in (1b). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>(1) a. The reporter interviewed [the son]DP1 of [the senator]DP2 who was controversial.(1) b. La  periodista entrevistó  [al     hijo]DP1 [del   político]DP2 que era polémico.
          The reporter      interviewed to-the son        of-the senator         who was controversial
         ‘The reporter interviewed the son of the senator who was controversial.’</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In order to investigate the prosody used by speakers of English and Spanish in disambiguation, an elicited production was designed targeting the production of sentences containing ambiguous RCs in either English or Spanish. 8 NSs of English and 6 NSs of Spanish participated in the study, in which they produced a total of 20 target items containing ambiguous RCs (10 HA and 10 LA). Results show that English speakers disambiguate HA from LA utterances using prosodic phrasing, while Spanish speakers do so using pitch accent configurations. Individuals’ speech patterns and implications of the findings for the syntax-phonology interface are discussed. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation reflects on questions of identities emanating from literature and artistic works by writers and sound artists with geographical, genetic, and genealogical ties to the Congo River. It takes a chronological approach to redefine concepts of identity first discussed by Congolese thinkers immediately after the Independence Era, in the 1960s. The Independence Era refers to the period during which a great majority of Francophone countries of Africa regained their Independence from the French and Belgian governments and started to establish their own new political systems. This includes the two countries discussed in this dissertation, countries which borrow the name of the Congo River in their official denominations: The Republic of Congo and The Democratic Republic of the Congo.	The aim of this dissertation is to look at the several hints left by Congolese thinkers to best describe a hybrid identity still specifically Congolese – referring to a root identity of Kongo, spelled with an initial K, without neglecting both the colonial and the postcolonial in the building of this adjusted definition of identity. As such, I dissect Sylvain Bemba’s Congolie through the lens of two elements, sound and liquid. To update this concept of Congolie that I will first explain, I propose to represent all elements of Kongo, Congolie, and Congolese “diaspora” under the following phonological representation: /kongo/. Using a simplified International Phonetic Alphabet transcription between brackets refers to oralité and prevents the written choice of Congo vs. Kongo that would refer to a narrowed choice of a segment of history rather than the encompassing vision of this history.
	The first chapter analyzes important poetic works of Tchicaya U’Tamsi, in excerpts showing the poet’s detachment from an “All-Congolese” narrative. The second chapter follows TUT’s writing by scrutinizing the poetry of Sony Labou Tansi, less discussed than his novels or plays, a gap that this dissertation intends to somewhat fill.
The third chapter looks at a novel by Emmanuel Dongala, Photo de Groupe au Bord du Fleuve. The narrative proposed by Dongala, a contemporary author, shows an example of the apparition of sound and liquid together in abundance within one single work and to permit the establishment and strengthening of the identity of the novel’s character through cultural referencing rather than explicit naming of places (city names, countries, etc.).
	The fourth and final chapter follows the analyses by looking at three representative sound artists who in their own ways commented on /kongo/ through their music: Papa Wemba, Youssoupha, and Baloji. The contemporaneity of these works also allows this dissertation to open on the consideration of African and Africana Studies through the important changes that happened in the twenty-first century in that regard.

            <DISS_para>The properties of quantum spins diluted in non-magnetic crystals make them a promising candidatefor a quantum memory given their long coherence and relaxation times and their limited
Hilbert space span by the electron and nuclear states of the spin Hamiltonian. In order to efficiently
store and retrieve the quantum information from, let’s say a superconducting qubit quantum processor,
the coupling between systems is mediated by on-chip superconducting resonators that acts as a
quantum bus. For this, a strong coupling between the spin quantum memory and electromagnetic
mode of the superconducting resonator is needed. The results presented in this dissertation demonstrates
the implementation of coupled photonic states of an on-chip superconducting resonator with
a Gd3+ rare-earth ion hosted in a scheelite (CaWO4) crystal.
Experiments probing the weakly coupled limit of the resonator mode with the electronuclear
states of the 155,157Gd3+ isotopes diluted in CaWO4 crystal are shown. Highly sensitive field
dependent cavity spectroscopy measurements showed the perturbation of the resonator properties,
such as the cavity linewidth and resonance frequency. Information about the spin ensemble phase
memory loss rate and coupling strength were obtained for the six observed resonances resulting from
the hyperfine slitting of the Gd odd isotopes. Given the resonator microwave field distribution and
carefully selecting the orientation of the static field relative crystallographic c-axis, we were able
to detect highly forbidden electron spin resnonance (ESR) transitions.
Additionaly, the strong coupling signal of the Gd3+ spin transition between the first and second
excited state with the on-chip resonator mode is demonstrated. By analyzing the spectroscopic
signal using the Dicke model that describes the interaction of photonic states with a large S spin
the observed transitions were reproduced by numerical diagonalization of the spin-cavity Hamiltonian.
Lastly the dynamics of the spin-cavity states were explored via pulsed ESR measurements
by recording the cavity ring-down signal at different pulse lengths and drive powers. The presented
results are only a first step into the exploration of the Gd3+ spin dynamics at millikelvin
temperatures.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Perfluorinated carbons are hazardous molecules that have contaminated ground water systems and become a prevalent environmental issue. One group of perfluorinated carbons is a class of molecules referred to as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which have been used for decades in applications such as firefighting foams, waterproof coatings, nonstick cookware, carpets, and many others. The wide use of PFAS has led to their large accumulation in the environment. Due to this accumulation and the release into the aquifer, PFAS has become a concern in most water purification systems. Recently developed methods to degrade PFAS include advanced oxidation and reduction techniques such as photocatalysis, sonolysis, electrochemical reduction, and nonthermal plasma. Our work focuses on the degradation of PFAS with nonthermal plasma. Two example PFAS compounds, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) are not only major pollutants but they are often used as model PFAS compounds, and they are the focus for this work.   
In this study, we use a nonthermal plasma reactor with flowing liquid and gas phases and a nanosecond pulsed power supply to degrade PFAS compounds in water. The plasma is generated with a pulsed power supply capable of variation of the input voltage, frequency, and pulse width. Through changing the input electrical pulse forming properties, we can change the plasma characteristics such as electron density, electron energy, and plasma gas temperature. The non-thermal plasma generates many different reactive chemical species such as&#x9f;OH,&#x9f;H, e-, and eaq- that may degrade PFOA and PFOS. This work shows that PFOA and PFOS are degraded into several daughter products of smaller carbon chains, and mineralization products including carbon dioxide and fluoride (F-).
This work shows that PFOA and PFOS degradation are affected by concentration and pulse frequency. PFOA and PFOA are surfactants and have large surface activities. Higher surface activity leads to higher degradation and mineralization because of increased adsorption at the interface where the plasma occurs. The input frequency of the power supply changes the plasma properties and therefore PFOA and PFOS were shown to have maximum degradation percentages of 89.6% and 96%, respectively, at 2 kHz frequency. Because the degradation is dependent on initial concentration and the input frequency, these setting can be used to optimize the reactor. For comparison with other methods, the values of energy yield and EE/O are used to describe the system efficiency. Energy yield is the molar amount of the compound degraded or produced (depending on the target compound) per joule of energy. EE/O is the amount of energy used per volume per log order reduction of contaminant. The best-case energy yield and EE/O values are 6.61x10-10 mol/J and 2.5 kWh/m3(order) for PFOA and 6.691x10-10 mol/J and1.7 kWh/m3(order) for PFOS, which are better or comparable to the best reported methods for PFAS degradation. Ground water and leachate samples from field sites were treated to demonstrate the applicability of the reactor. The ground water towards the higher chain compounds, and will degrade them in order of decreasing chain length. PFOA mass transfer and reaction rates were modeled in the reactor to analyze the</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>factors affecting the frequency and concentration effects. The model shows that the upper limit of PFOA degradation is likely mass transfer limited, but it fails to show the drop-in degradation with increasing frequency or the shift in optimal degradation with decreasing concentration.These results are encouraging for the practical application of this plasma reactor in real world remediation processes. This study furthers the understanding of non-thermal degradation of PFAS, and leads to its future use in water purification systems.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This two-article dissertation focuses on echo chambers, misinformation, and leadership in online social movements.  Over the last decade, these topics have garnered much research and media attention.  Concern for how misinformation and social bots may influence political action, such as voting behavior, and for how insulated spaces can amplify these effects have resulted in a wealth of research examining the issue, yet little research has explored its connection to collective action.  Echo chambers are effectively black boxes, and we know little about how they impact collective action and the roles that actors within them play.  In this study, I examine the characteristics of social media accounts spreading misinformation and engaging in social movement leadership tasks, whether these actions are happening within echo chambers imbedded in online social movement networks, the quality of information within those spaces, and the implications for collective action by analyzing digital leadership.  I use Twitter data collected from the months leading up to, and including, the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and analyze the network structure of two movement networks, #nevertrump and #neverhillary (Chapter 2), and content analyze tweets for the presence of misinformation and leading tasks (Chapter 3).  I assess whether there are echo chambers present in the movement networks and the characteristics of the network accounts.  I argue that accounts centrally located in the networks will produce more misinformation, perform more leading tasks, and are more likely to be a social bot than average accounts within the movement networks.  I find evidence of echo chambers and the presence of social bots across both movement networks.  Results show that centrally located accounts and human users across both movement networks are associated with the spread of misinformation and the performance of leadership tasks.  There is also a sizable portion of social bots among the network population, and they are more centrally concentrated within the networks.  These findings extend the literature on echo chambers, misinformation, and social movement leadership by examining the characteristics of network accounts producing false claims and social movement leadership tasks. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to investigate how board-certified music therapists (MT-BCs) address communication goals with multilingual clients with communication disabilities and overall confidence throughout the process of working with this population. Specifically, an emphasis was placed on perception of overall clinical confidence by region, experience, education, and language background, perceptions of confidence throughout the therapeutic process, how music therapists address sessions with multilingual clients with communication disabilities, commonly addressed and most difficult to address communication goals for multilingual clients with communication disabilities, languages used in the therapeutic setting, and useful resources to address multilingual clients with communication disabilities. Participants (N = 122) for this study were MT-BCs in the United States recruited through an email list purchased from the Certification Board for Music Therapists (CBMT). The results of the study revealed that a majority of participants indicated an intermediate rating of confidence throughout the process of therapy with minimal relation to demographics on type of communication goals. Instrument play was the most often used music intervention. Addressing the use of conventional gestures and listening skills was the most predominant communication goal. The Spanish language was the most predominant multicultural language used in the clinical setting.  
Findings may be a resource for educators, clinical supervisors, and non-multilingual music therapists. Moreover, the findings may be useful to guide music therapy educational and supervisory practices. Further results and implications are discussed within the paper.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>As part of the Slave Wrecks Project, excavations at Christiansted National Historic Site on St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands have resulted in the collection of thousands of artifacts associated with the Danish West India and Guinea Warehouse Complex, from its original construction in 1749, to the removal of the northeastern section of the complex, circa 1854. Within this assemblage hundreds of ceramic sherds of Afro-Caribbean colonoware, or Afro-Cruzan ware, have been identified. Former analysis of the colonoware established a typology as well as suggested local manufacture. In this thesis I assess the methods used to reevaluate the typology and function of Afro-Cruzan wares as a product and symbol of the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade. This study includes provenance analysis to determine whether these wares were produced locally on St. Croix or elsewhere to identify potential spheres of interaction, and if the same sources of material were used in prehistoric times. It is proposed that Afro-Cruzan ware represents cultural and economic perseverance, despite colonial oppressive conditions. Thus, this research highlights enslaved and free Africans’ lives as they sought to maintain autonomy through daily tasks expressed through ceramic traditions.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>As of 2017, there were 1.4 million Americans living in nursing homes and as the senior population continues to grow and the average life span becomes greater, it is anticipated that the need for nursing homes will increase (National Institute on Aging as cited by Neufeld, 2017). As individuals age they often experience decreased independence, cognitive declines, and physical health issues leading them to require assistance from family members or relocate into a living facility, such as a nursing home. During relocation individuals can enter a liminal period - understood as being between one phase of life and another - as they transition into a newer life role (Barrett et al., 2012). However, there is currently little existing research that addresses nursing home design and its role in supporting the wellbeing of residents as they transition to the nursing home. A review of Lawton’s Person-Environment (P-E) Fit theory suggests that a fit environment is critical for older adults’ transition out of the liminal period and supports their physical and psychological health. A fit environment should accommodate the user’s limitations and allow them to adapt (Park et al., 2017). This research seeks to identify spaces in the living facility that support the wellbeing of long-term nursing home residents and develop a list of common design characteristics that may support resident wellbeing to facilitate a comfortable life transition into their new living environment. A phenomenological study was conducted including behavioral mapping observations, a focus group with residents, and a resident interview to generate further understandings of how the nursing home is used by residents and the residents’ perspective of the living environment. Findings from the original research and knowledge gathered through precedent studies of senior living facilities have been applied to a theoretical redesign of a nursing home in Tallahassee, FL.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>From an educational equity perspective, all students need to have appropriate learning opportunities that are close to their own cultural contexts (e.g., families and communities). Based on the transformative social-emotional learning (SEL) framework, the mixed-methods study explored how culturally relevant reading experiences can be longitudinally linked with underserved students’ social-emotional and academic development. Specifically, this study explored changes in underserved students’ prosocial self-efficacy and reading skills across multiple years of involvement with a culturally relevant reading program at Freedom Schools. The multicultural reading program at Freedom Schools is rooted in culturally relevant pedagogy and SEL to empower racially-minoritized students to make a difference. The purpose of the six-week summer camp is to help underserved students maintain their reading skills during the out-of-school summer period. To explore possible sustainable learning outcomes from experiences at Freedom Schools, this study focused on targeted participants who participated in the Freedom Schools camp for at least two years (i.e., returning students in 2016 through 2019). The purpose of the study was to investigate students’ prosocial self-efficacy and reading skill outcomes over time. From the four years of annual data from Freedom Schools participants, I identified data with parental consent for a total of 50 returning students. For the quantitative analysis, I investigated returning students’ individual change patterns in prosocial self-efficacy (n = 38) and reading skills (n = 22). To support the results from the individual change patterns, I also analyzed 16 interviews from eight returning students; each student participated in two interviews that were collected during different summer years of Freedom Schools.According to the descriptive results of this study, within the summer program period (i.e., during the six-week), returning participants at Freedom Schools showed descriptive positive changes in their prosocial self-efficacy in their first camp (67.7%) and their second camp (57.6%); however, between the first and second camps, their prosocial self-efficacy changes varied across individuals. The majority of returning participants showed descriptive positive reading changes. For example, returning students descriptively increased or maintained reading skill levels in their first camp (at least 85% of participants in all reading subfactors) and in their second camp (at least 80% of participants in all reading subfactors). The summer program aimed to prevent summer reading loss of underserved students, so maintained reading scores were marked as positive outcomes within the summer camp period. More than 60% of returning participants had descriptive increases in reading skills between the first and second summer camps. There were no noticeable general change patterns between the prosocial self-efficacy and reading skills. Due to the complex change patterns of students’ prosocial self-efficacy across the multiple years, there were no general patterns to explain the relationship between prosocial self-efficacy and reading skills of returning participants. Through the interview analysis, I found that all interviewees had positive views on their summer learning experiences; students commented that their teacher and peers were supportive and respectful in the classroom, and the multicultural books in the camp were interesting to them. The learning and instructional contexts of Freedom Schools align with the transformative SEL approach. In this study, students’ interviews aligned with the theoretical ideas of transformative SEL that using culturally relevant education may support students’ positive cultural identities and successful academic achievement in racially minoritized students.
The findings contribute to our understanding of students’ transformative SEL experiences in Freedom Schools contexts. This approach highlights the importance of equity-based SEL implementation for underserved students. The findings of this study also shed light on the impact of Freedom Schools on students’ potential learning outcomes across multiple years, from a developmental perspective.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>A search is presented for a light pseudoscalar Higgs boson using full Run 2 data (2016-2018) collected by the CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) experiment at the LHC (Large Hadron Collider), corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 137.60 fb−1 and at a √s = 13 TeV. The study looks into the decay Higgs boson (H) via the H→aa→ μμτ τ channel. The Higgs boson can be both standard-model-like (125 GeV) or heavier. The pseudoscalar mass falls within the range ma[2mτ , mH /2]. The large mass difference between the Higgs and the pseudoscalar means that the final tau lepton decay products are highly boosted in the decay direction and collimated. A modified version of tau reconstruction is used to account for the highly overlapping decay products. The modified reconstruction technique gives higher reconstruction efficiency over the standard tau reconstruction and hence better signal significance and background rejection. In the absence of a significant signal, model-independent limits are set at 95% C.L. on the branching fraction for H→aa→ μμτ τ as a function of ma. The document also discusses the operations and commissioning of the CMS Phase-1 pixel detector.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>With the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning technologies have entered a fast-evolving era. This dissertation covers application studies of various algorithms ranging from traditional machine learning methods to deep neural networks. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the first study, we predicted Female Breast Cancer Incidence Rates using prevailing machine learning techniques for 1,754 US counties with a female population over 10,000. Outlier counties with unexpectedly high or low FBC IRs were identified by controlling the non-modifiable factors (demographics and socioeconomics). Geographic clusters of outlier counties as well as impacts of modifiable factors (lifestyle, healthcare accessibility, and environment) were also mapped. Our study pioneers the county-level assessment, which takes both individual and population risk factors into consideration across 6 state-of-art machine learning algorithms. Moreover, the framework we developed can be applied to studies of other types of cancer. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Diving deep into deep learning in particular, we investigated text mining models of biomedical Named Entity Recognition and Relation Extraction on both social media texts and scientific publications. For social media texts, we developed a PubMedBERT-based classifier trained with a combination of multiple data augmentation approaches. Our study explored the effects of various data augmentation strategies on extremely imbalanced data, which has not been experimented thoroughly before. It has achieved an F1 score of 0.762, which is substantially higher than the mean of all submissions (0.696). For scientific articles, we design and train two NLP systems that effectively extract biomedical entities and relations information. As a result, our methods achieved Top 4 in BioCreative VII track 3 and Top 1 in LitCoin NLP challenges. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Knowledge of a species’ range, movement patterns, and associations with environmental factors provides essential insights into their ecology. Together, these datasets can inform effective conservation measures by identifying ecologically important habitats and can be used to forecast changes in space use in response to disturbances (e.g., climate change impacts). Methods of obtaining spatial distribution data for marine species have proliferated due to recent technological advances, with passive acoustic and satellite telemetry emerging as two common tracking approaches. These approaches are often used for similar purposes of quantifying the space use and home ranges of individuals; however, data-driven comparisons of these methods and the ecological inferences that can be made from each are lacking. To systematically compare telemetry methods and make recommendations of their appropriate applications, nine juvenile green turtles (Chelonia mydas) were simultaneously tracked with both passive acoustic and Argos satellite telemetry within a foraging area in Bimini, Bahamas. The temporal durations, spatial resolution and extent, and costs of each tracking approach were compared. Dynamic Brownian Bridge Movement Models (dBBMMs) were applied to estimate and compare 95% and 50% utilization distributions (UDs) between tracking methods. Additionally, overlap indices were calculated to assess the degree of agreement between the UDs from each approach. The mean tracking durations of acoustic and satellite telemetry were similar (87 d and 119 d, respectively), although acoustic tracking provided a higher number of relocations per individual at a finer spatial and temporal scale. UDs estimated from satellite telemetry were on average 7 to 15 times larger than those estimated from acoustic telemetry. The differences in UD size were not statistically significant, although this was potentially an effect of the small sample size and high individual variability. Overlap indices indicated a moderate agreement between 95% satellite and acoustic UDs, but a low agreement between 50% UDs. Satellite telemetry confirmed that individuals generally remained within the extent of the acoustic receiver array; however, a large proportion of satellite UDs fell outside individual receiver detection ranges, suggesting that large gaps in coverage existed within the array. These results indicate that passive acoustic and satellite telemetry do not provide similar inferences about individual space use within foraging areas and should each be used to address specific ecological questions and be uniquely interpreted. While acoustic telemetry using a localized passive array is better suited for understanding ecological associations on a fine spatiotemporal scale, such as diel movement patterns, satellite telemetry is better suited for assessing movement corridors or resource selection patterns. Additionally, large differences in costs were found based on transmitter type, sample size, and the pre-existence of a receiver array, all of which should be taken into consideration when designing a telemetry study. Recommendations are made to help researchers identify the most appropriate telemetry methods for their research objectives and to aid in appropriately interpreting space use metrics from various telemetry methods.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The first chapter in this dissertation explores the welfare benefits from relationship banking that arise from the information gleaned by banks through monitoring. If monitoring reveals not only current output, but also new information about future payoffs, lenders can shield themselves from future losses through early termination of lending agreements. In a competitive lending environment, banks shift the benefits of early termination to borrowers through the lending terms, improving not only the overall expected payoff of projects, but also the welfare of borrowers. Numerical results reveal that the benefits of long-term relationships based on the information revealed in monitoring could be substantial.	
	The second chapter explores the inequality implications of automation. Changes in income inequality from advanced automation may stem from two sources. Wages may become more unequal as lower skill tasks that are currently performed by workers are done in the future by computerized capital. With higher relative wage income, high-skill workers will be able to afford investments in capital that are out of reach for low-skill workers, exacerbating income inequality further. Using a general equilibrium model of task-based production, we disentangle the impacts of automation on wage, wealth, and income inequality. Next, using this framework, we discuss policy interventions for addressing inequality, including transfers and taxes on factors, including the political economy implications of such policies. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Salamanders are often the most abundant vertebrates in forest communities and perform important ecological functions by acting as both predators and prey. Their decline, extirpation, and potential extinction can have dramatic effects on the environment through disruption of predator-prey interactions and alteration of nutrient cycles. Salamanders are also sensitive to habitat encroachment, disease, chemical contamination, and climate change, and their declines serve as an indication that environmental health may be compromised. Unfortunately, salamander declines and extinctions have been reported around the world. Several causes contribute to the declines including land use change, chemical contamination, over exploitation, invasive species, climate change and emerging pathogens.In the Eastern US, salamanders have experienced precipitous declines since at least the 1950s. Some have identifiable causes, but many declines are enigmatic, and studies are needed to identify potential causes and assess population status before restoration is possible. In Florida, declines have been reported in populations of Frosted Flatwoods Salamanders (A. cingulatum), Reticulated Flatwoods Salamanders (Ambystoma bishopi), Striped Newts (Notophthalmus perstriatus) and presumed Spotted Dusky Salamanders (D. cf. conanti). 
Two other salamanders in Florida may also be in decline: the Seal Salamander (Desmognathus monticola) and the Southern Dusky Salamander (D. auriculatus). Dusky Salamanders (Family: Plethodontidae, Genus: Desmognathus) represent an understudied clade of lungless amphibians which are difficult to distinguish due to morphological conservatism. However, modern genetic techniques are revealing a previously hidden abundance of diversity, suggesting that local extirpation of “populations” may in fact represent species level extinctions. The overarching goals of my dissertation was to evaluate the current status of D. monticola and D. auriculatus in Florida and attempt to identify possible agents of their decline. I also investigated the prevalence of amphibian chytrid pathogens in historic and contemporary salamander populations in Florida.
To answer my first question, I established historic location distributions in Florida from museum preserved specimens and surveyed all possible historic sites with traditional field techniques. Desmognathus monticola was restricted to a small series of ravines forming an unnamed tributary of Canoe Creek, Escambia Co. We were unable to locate any specimens in the field, and show the population declined after their initial discovery in 1969. Desmognathus monticola has not been seen in the state of Florida since 2002 and appears to have been extirpated by poor land use practices.
For D. auriculatus, I developed a custom environmental DNA (eDNA) assay and field collection technique to assist with species detection. I tested the effect of lentic versus lotic water habitat and pH on the efficacy of detecting D. auriculatus eDNA at sites of known presence. Although I found no significant effect of pH on eDNA detection success, I was unable to detect eDNA in lentic systems. However, I achieved 100% detection success at lotic system sites. I also detected D. auriculatus eDNA at one site of previously unknown presence but was unable to locate any live specimens during traditional surveys. I recommend conducting additional surveys at the site to ensure the eDNA detection was not a false positive.
Finally, I conducted extensive field surveys throughout Florida to locate populations of D. auriculatus. I surveyed most historic collection sites and many new sites but found an extreme reduction in their area of occupancy, with the decline occurring in the 1970s. The Southern Dusky Salamander is now restricted to a few fragmented pockets in North Florida and appears to be extinct in the Florida Peninsula. Although the amphibian chytrid pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) is present in current and historic salamander populations, its prevalence is low and does not appear to be the agent of decline. However, it is possible that infected wild D. auriculatus die shortly after contracting Bd and went untested, biasing our results. I was unable to determine the agent of D. auriculatus’ decline, but comment on potential causes.
In conclusion, my research is the first formal survey of the status of D. monticola since its initial discovery in 1969. I cannot assign a cause to its disappearance, but the most likely candidate is habitat destruction from poor forestry management. My research is also the first formal survey of D. auriculatus’ status throughout the state of Florida. I demonstrate the utility of eDNA in locating the species, identify remaining populations, and address several possible causes of the species’ decline.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Meson photoproduction off the nucleon has long been serving as a tool for understanding the properties of hadrons. At lower energy scales, the production mechanisms are dominated by the $s$-channel inelastic scattering process, where the proton absorbs the photon, gets excited to the resonance state, and then decays. Nucleon resonances have been extensively studied in this energy regime using techniques such as partial wave analysis. When the energy scale increases, the production mechanism gradually transitions from the formation of nucleon resonances to the pure scattering process, corresponding to the $t$- and $u$-channel exchange. However, the scarcity of cross section and polarization data over the photon energy range 3-6 GeV have thus far hindered our understanding of the mechanism transition from nucleon resonance to the $t$-channel Pomeron and Reggeon exchange.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This work presents differential cross sections for the reaction $\gamma p\rightarrow p\eta$ with energy-tagged photon energies between 1.2 and 4.7 GeV using the CLAS spectrometer at Jefferson Laboratory. The $\eta$ meson is reconstructed in its dominant charged decay channel $\eta\rightarrow \pi^{+}\pi^{-}\pi^{0}$. The energy scale extends from the nucleon resonance regime to the Regge regime, allowing for studying the $t$-channel exchange mechanisms. The d$\sigma/$d$\Omega$ differential cross sections are compared with predictions of $\eta$-MAID 2018 and the latest solution of the Bonn-Gatchina coupled-channel analysis. In the energy regime $W&gt;2.5$ GeV, the d$\sigma/$d$t$ differential cross sections are presented in comparison with the Regge model from  the Joint Physics Analysis Center. The data confirm the expected dominance of $\rho$, $\omega$ vector-meson exchange.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Differential cross sections and spin density matrix elements (SDMEs) are also measured for the reaction $\gamma p\rightarrow p\omega$ in the energy range $1.6&lt;E_{\gamma}&lt;5.4$ GeV. The $\omega$ mesons are detected in their dominant charged decay mode $\omega\rightarrow \pi^{+}\pi^{-}\pi^{0}$. In the center-of-mass energy range $W\in$ [2.45, 3.25] GeV, the d$\sigma/$d$t$ differential cross sections are presented in comparison with the prediction of the Regge model provided by J. M. Laget. Circularly-polarized SDMEs Im$(\rho_{10}^{3})$ and Im$(\rho_{1-1}^{3})$ are measured for the first time, while the unpolarized SDMEs $\rho_{00}^{0}$, $\rho_{1-1}^{0}$ and Re$(\rho_{10}^{0})$ in the higher momentum transfer regime $-t&gt;0.6$ GeV$^{2}$ are also first measurements. The unpolarized SDMEs are compared with two models from J. M. Laget and the Joint Physics Analysis Center, respectively. The behavior of $\rho_{00}^{0}$ and Re$(\rho_{10}^{0})$ is consistent with the model predictions, whereas $\rho_{1-1}^{0}$ goes to the opposite sign direction relative to the models. Given the relative proportion between the natural- and unnatural-parity exchanges plays an important role in shaping the matrix element $\rho_{1-1}^{0}$, this discrepancy indicates the new data are in favor of smaller contribution of the unnatural-parity exchange than the model predicts.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Children with ADHD show impairments in set shifting task performance. However, directly training shifting has not improved task performance in this population. We hypothesized that this incongruence may be because the impairments exhibited by children with ADHD during shifting tasks are due to deficits in other executive functions, as shifting tasks also include working memory and/or inhibitory control demands. Therefore, this randomized controlled trial examined the extent to which neurocognitive training of working memory vs. inhibitory control produced improvements in set shifting task performance for children with ADHD. Children with ADHD ages 8-12 (M=10.41, SD=1.46; 12 girls; 74% Caucasian/Non-Hispanic) were randomized to either central executive training (CET; n=25) or inhibitory control training (ICT; n=29). The study’s primary analyses included a series of 2 (group:CET/ICT) x 2 (timepoint:pre/post) ANOVAs for speed and accuracy shift costs, separately for two set shifting tasks (Global-Local and Number-Color). Results of the speed ANOVAs indicated that ICT improved set shifting speed (p=.02, BF10=4.53, d=0.57) on the Global-Local task and reaction times specifically during shift trials (d=0.38) on the Number-Color task, whereas the CET group showed non-specific improvements in speed on the Number-Color task (shift trials, d=0.70; non-shift trials, d=0.68). Results of the accuracy ANOVAs indicated that ICT was superior to CET for improving set shifting accuracy (p=.02, BF10=2.18, ω2=.04) and overall task accuracy (ω2=.01), albeit on only one task. Taken together, results of the current study suggest considerable overlap in variance between set shifting and the other two core executive functions in school-aged children and provides preliminary evidence for the effects of training the other two core executive functions on set shifting difficulties performance in children with ADHD. </DISS_para>

      <DISS_content>
         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>We are currently in the era of big data, where data of enormous volume and variety is generated continuously, and they need to be captured, processed, and analyzed at a high velocity.Many users have increasingly adopted big data analytics to analyze and extract value (e.g., supporting business decisions and uncovering new insights) from massive amounts of data.
Modern cluster computing frameworks (e.g., Spark) have facilitated this widespread adoption of analytics by providing developer-friendly APIs and excellent performance on diverse systems.
While modern data analytics frameworks have achieved incredible advancements in terms of speed and performance, non-trivial challenges have emerged due to various factors, such as the increasing size of datasets, increasing complexity of the configuration-performance relationship, and a shift from on-premise infrastructure to the cloud.
These challenges need to be tackled for the continued growth of the big data revolution.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The growing trend of larger dataset sizes translates to a higher requirement for system resources (e.g., compute, memory, storage).This increase in demand is exacerbated by the fact that modern data analytics frameworks rely heavily on memory for providing significant performance gains over the previous generation of disk-based frameworks.
Currently, the decrease in DRAM price is outpaced by the growth in dataset sizes, and Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) is a promising solution for meeting the increasing demand for memory.
However, a complete replacement of DRAM by NVM is not viable due to NVM having several drawbacks, namely higher access latency, lower bandwidth, and endurance.
Thus hybrid memory architectures that provide higher capacity at a lower cost by combining DRAM and NVM to overcome the disadvantages of NVM have been proposed to tackle the issue of increased memory requirement.
Unfortunately, current memory management mechanisms within modern data analytics frameworks are not suitable for hybrid memory and require to be redesigned and optimized for taking advantage of such systems.
Even if data analytics systems have enough resources, achieving optimal utilization to extract the best workload performance is immensely challenging.
For proper utilization of cluster resources, analytics workloads need to run on optimal configurations.
As modern data analytics frameworks mature, more configuration parameters are introduced for adapting to new use cases and systems.
While new parameters allow the frameworks to be more flexible and versatile, this increases the dimensionality of the configuration space.
Each new dimension in the configuration space exponentially increases the number of possible configurations, which makes determining the optimal configuration significantly difficult.
Furthermore, the relationship between workload configuration and performance is complex.
Existing tuning solutions require numerous workload execution samples to train a performance model for handling the complex configuration-performance relationship.
However, running analytics workloads with large datasets is costly, rendering current solutions unsuitable in most real-life scenarios.
A viable automated tuner needs to recommend optimal or near-optimal configurations within a limited number of iterations and keep costs low.
Another phenomenon that adds to the challenge of optimal resource allocation and utilization is the shift towards the cloud for running analytics workloads.
Cloud service providers offer hundreds of Virtual Machine (VM) types that differ in compute, memory, network, and storage capabilities.
Choosing the optimal number and type of VMs from the numerous possible combinations for workload deployment is a significant challenge.
While contemporary solutions have advanced the field of cloud configuration tuning, they have limitations in the form of predetermined search spaces and underutilization of domain-based heuristics.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation tackles the mentioned issues through three studies that propose architectural modifications and novel automated tuning frameworks for efficient data analytics.Firstly, we investigate the integration of Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) through hybridization in the memory management mechanisms of Spark.
We propose several modifications to the software stack to effectively support the hybridization of the Spark cache in an optimized manner. 
Our evaluation results have demonstrated that the proposed hybridization strategy keeps the increase in execution time minimal while only requiring a fraction of DRAM compared to a fully DRAM system. 
Secondly, we offer a high-dimensional cluster configuration tuner called ROBOTune that finds optimal or near-optimal configurations for efficient data analytics.
ROBOTune employs a Random Forests model to handle the high-dimensionality of the analytics configuration space and couples it with a Bayesian Optimization engine to search for optimal configurations within a limited budget.
Evaluation of an extensive set of applications shows that ROBOTune finds configurations that perform better on average while significantly improving search cost and search speed compared to contemporary solutions. 
Thirdly, we propose a cloud resource allocation tuner BoundConfig, which utilizes framework-level execution metrics for dynamically determining a workload-specific cloud VM search space.
We also employ domain-driven heuristics for identifying well-performing initial configurations to bootstrap the tuning process.
Furthermore, BoundConfig couples these techniques with a Bayesian Optimizer equipped with a noise-resilient acquisition function and metric-based output constraints that guide the search.
Workload-specific search spaces reduce the tuning cost, while well-performing initial configurations speed up the process.
Our extensive experiments for BoundConfig on AWS EC2 have demonstrated its significant advantage in search speed and cost compared to contemporary solutions.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The air intake captures the freestream airflow and delivers it to the engine of the parent vehicle for thrust production. The shockwave boundary layer interactions (SBLI) in the intake duct play an important role in defining the flow characteristics of supersonic air intakes.
At certain operating conditions, these SBLI may result in large-amplitude oscillations in the intake flow, and be detrimental to the safety and performance of the engine. In addition, the back-pressure rise due to combustion instabilities can cause the intake to unstart.
The unstart phenomenon generally turns out to be fatal for aerial vehicles due to loss of thrust and control.
In spite of several previous studies focused on the intake unstart at certain operating conditions, a comprehensive understanding of flow states that occur during an unstart process is needed to develop a reliable engine control system. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Both active and passive flow control techniques have been employed previously for the SBLI control to improve intake safety and performance.
Particularly, cowl SBLI control has been targeted as it plays an important role in defining the performance and unstart characteristics of an intake. It has been shown in the literature that a simple backward-facing step (BFS) can be used as a passive control device for a canonical impinging SBLI. However, the use of a BFS has never been exploited for the SBLI control in supersonic air intakes. Previous studies led to the following questions. 1) Can a passive flow control device (suitably modified BFS) improve the performance of an air intake i.e. total pressure recovery and flow uniformity? 2) How does this passive flow control technique affect the mean flow behavior and dynamics of the air intake at different back-pressures? 3) Will there be any change in the intake unstart characteristics with SBLI control? To answer these questions as our research objectives and to improve our fundamental understanding of the supersonic intake flows, in particular the unstart phenomenon, a comprehensive experimental and numerical investigation is conducted and the results are presented in this work. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The passive flow control device investigated in this study is a modified BFS, embedded at the ramp-isolator junction and is called a "Notch". The baseline intake geometry without a Notch is referred to as a Faceted configuration. The experiments include steady and unsteady wall pressure measurements, rake (total) pressures, back-pressure measurements, pressure sensitive-paint (PSP), planar particle image velocimetry (PIV), shadowgraphy, and oil flow visualizations. The numerical simulations include the Navier-Stokes-based mean flow Perturbation (NS-MFP) method for the linear analysis, Large Eddy Simulations (LES), and Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) simulations for the non-linear analysis. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Numerical simulations predicted a region of flow separation and Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) instability around the isentropic compression surface of the external ramp. The ramp separation bubble also harbors a three-dimensional stationary instability that can induce transition under the influence of shear layer instability. The streamwise oriented G{\"o}rtler vortices break down to turbulence due to secondary instabilities. The flow transitions to turbulence over the ramp before it enters the inlet-isolator duct. At low back-pressures, the inlet-isolator flow is predominantly two-dimensional (2D) and the shock train is located in the divergent section. The experiments displayed a comparatively higher level of pressure fluctuations and a fuller boundary layer in the Notched intake isolator. The LES demonstrated the underlying mechanisms at work is the mid-frequency energization through vortex shedding in a well-developed shear layer.
The Notch results in lower static pressures and higher velocity fluctuations, which will reduce the structural loads while improving flow uniformity and total pressure recovery. At high back-pressures, the shock train moves upstream and transitions to an oblique shock train. The notch effectively locks the separation at the ramp-isolator junction which is otherwise free to move in the baseline intake. Strong three-dimensional (3D) behavior exists in the inlet-isolator flow at high back-pressures due to severe adverse pressure gradients and regions of flow separation around the shock train.
The highest level of unsteadiness in the intake was found to be around a normal shock train in the isolator. The oblique shock train showed mild low-frequency dynamics which can be linked to the large-scale separation at the isolator entrance. The flow choking near the intake exit triggers the unstart wave which propagates upstream.
The unstart occurs through the development of a large-scale separation and boundary layer thickening at the ramp-isolator junction. 
The Notched intake displayed lower wave speed and a higher margin of unstart as compared to the baseline.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The improvement in the understanding of the intake flowfield has laid down a path for future intake flow control efforts. The passive flow control device has displayed the potential to control SBLI and improve performance in supersonic intakes. The lessons learned in this study can be extended to other high-speed flows and applications during design and analysis.

            <DISS_para>Music therapy interventions have proven to reduce anxiety, diminish stress, palliate pain, increase medical care satisfaction, and show benefits in acute symptom management. The emergency department is a concentrated hospital area where patients experience immediate physical and psychological needs. With music therapy’s known benefits, it should be evident that music therapists belong in emergency situations, however, research highlighting music therapy interventions in the emergency department is lacking. This scoping review of the literature regarding music therapy in the emergency department is conducted to identify the state of current research, reveal relevant gaps in the existing literature, and recommend further research directions. Clinical recommendations for expansion into service with this population will be recommended.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Nineteenth-century French censorship has had a profound impact on both the production and dissemination of literary works. The Loi de 1819, which established one of the first state-sponsored systematic policies of censorship in France, required writers and publishers to produce works that would avoid tout outrage à la morale publique et religieuse, ou aux bonnes moeurs and anyone who failed to comply risked being punished by imprisonment of up to one year and fined up to five hundred francs. In a strategic attempt to avoid the social and economic sanctions of censorship legislation such as the Loi de 1819, French writers such as Théophile Gautier, Charles Baudelaire, and Rachilde successfully deployed defensive writing strategies including acts of incompletion, direct omission, association, disassociation, rhetorical narratives, and linguistic shifts. By focusing on three case studies of writers from different periods in nineteenth-century France, this project foregrounds the banning of books on moral rather than political or religious grounds. Building on the scholarship of Elisabeth Ladenson, Yvan Leclerc, and William Olmsted, it aims to bring to light the censorship experience of French writers under different regimes (the July Monarchy, the Second Empire, and the Third Republic) as they battled against or colluded with external (e.g. state-sponsored) as well as internal (e.g. productive) censorship. In addition, moving beyond the well-known comparison of the 1857 trials of Gustave Flaubert and Baudelaire allows for the analysis of successive but distinct periods of censorship in nineteenth-century France demonstrating that writers in other periods, notably the July Monarchy and the Third Republic, faced similar social and economic constraints. This longitudinal approach allows for the inclusion and analysis of Gautier and Rachilde whose works have not been studied through this lens. Furthermore, rather than delve into book banning process after the publication of a work, this project is unique in that it scrutinizes censorship before and after the act of expression. Analyzing censorship before the act of expression highlights the internal or productive qualities of censorship, which are, again, rarely studied in critical censorship discourses. As book bans and free speech remain contemporary issues, the findings and conclusions of this project focused on the period from 1830 to 1890 identify a framework for future censorship inquiries in literary studies—one that highlights attention to the internal and external pressures restricting expression and explores the ways writers actively evade this censorship.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation is a collection of our research on star forming cores. We used tracer particles to record time dependent information on the gases that make up these cores. From these information we deduced core characteristics. We found that as time progresses, cores approach a state of coherency as defined by (Goodman et al. 1998b) and Larson (1995). At a core’s coherency phase, it also forms an ρ ∝ r−2 density radial profile. This is an indication of symmetric spherical collapse as described by Larson (1969), Penston (1969a) and Shu (1977). Spherically symmetric happens because the effects of magnetic fields are dampened by that of the gas, meaning that magnetic fields have little effect on a coherent core’s dynamics. We also found evidence that cores accretes mass after fragmentation occurs, and a coherent core has formed. This evidence was discovered by looking at density vs time plots of our cores, as well as from studying the density probability distribution function (PDF) of our molecular clouds. Using our density (PDF) we also analytically derived an expression for the star formation rate. Finally studying the gravitational binding energy of our cores, we found that coherent cores has a radius around 1 × 10−2 pc, is gravitationally bounded, and has a potential that is spherical. This add credence to the idea that our cores are going through spherically symmetric collapse at the point of coherency. Finally, We found that the gravitational binding energy outside of the coherent regions of our cores is greater than that of a spherical core. This trend is universal to most cores, including the most isolated ones. This indicates that a global potential, or semi-global potential, might be the agent of accretion.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This dissertation studies Xenophon’s engagement with fifth-century intellectual culture. In particular, it examines the ways in which Xenophon situates Socrates within and in relation to the sophistic movement. I demonstrate that the sophistic movement is not only essential for understanding Xenophon’s intellectual project and his portrayal of Socrates, but also that Xenophon himself is an overlooked but valuable source for the intellectual history of the fifth century.	The introduction explains the motivation for the project and situates it within the bourgeoning fields of study on Xenophon and on the sophistic movement, respectively. The second chapter studies Xenophon’s diverse rhetorical strategies of demarcating intellectuals. The terms sophistēs and philosophos, my analysis shows, display significant semantic overlap in Xenophon’s corpus. Consequently, attending to Xenophon’s lexical choices, I argue, allows us to rethink several prevalent assumptions about Xenophon’s views of the sophists. It also indicates that, if we are to understand his views of fifth-century intellectual culture, we must look beyond his lexical choices.
	The remainder of the dissertation examines how Xenophon presents Socrates vis-à-vis four topics or debates that were central to the sophistic movement and intellectual culture in his time: natural philosophy, the use of poetry in education, the teachability of virtue and the moral responsibility that attends education, and the question of self-interest. The third chapter turns to Xenophon’s Socrates as both a critic and reformer of natural philosophy and argues that Xenophon presents Socrates’ innovative natural theological views as a response to Anaxagorean physics. Xenophon’s defense of Socrates, my examination reveals, is programmatic for Xenophon’s own views on the intellectual and educational marketplace in the fifth century BCE. 
The following three chapters all study Xenophon’s presentation of Socrates qua teacher, and ask how Xenophon portrays Socrates as similar to and yet different from other fifth-century educators like Protagoras, Prodicus, Gorgias, and Antiphon. The fourth chapter focuses on the role of poetry in Socrates’ (and other sophists’) pedagogy, and demonstrates that Socrates was deeply embedded in (and critical of) the educational practices of his day. In turn, the fifth chapter takes up a debate on the responsibility teachers bear for the behavior of their students. I argue that, in the Anabasis, Xenophon’s presentation of Gorgias as the teacher of Proxenus and Meno engages intertextually with Plato’s Meno and Gorgias concerning debates about pedagogical responsibility. I compare Xenophon’s treatment of Gorgias with his handling of Socrates’ responsibility for Critias and Alcibiades, and demonstrate that Xenophon (and his Socrates) are critical of teachers like Gorgias who neglect to care for the moral character of their pupils. At the end, the sixth chapter considers how Xenophon situates Socrates within a live fifth-century debate about self-interest. While drawing on the work of other sophists, like Prodicus, to make his case, Xenophon opposes Socrates to advocates of a civically-harmful form of self-interest, like Antiphon. The centerpiece of this debate, a conversation between Socrates and his companion Aristippus, highlights the moral urgency and pedagogical importance of the debate. The findings of this and the preceding chapters demonstrate that Xenophon’s Socrates and thereby Xenophon himself were fully engaged in the intellectual culture of the sophistic movement. The seventh chapter offers a brief conclusion and directions for developing this project further.

            <DISS_para>Tukey's depth offers a powerful tool for nonparametric inference and estimation but also encounters serious computational and methodological difficulties in modern statistical data analysis. This article studies how to generalize Tukey's depth to problems defined in a restricted space that may be curved or have boundaries, and to problems with a non-differentiable objective. First, using a manifold approach, we propose a broad class of Riemannian depth for smooth problems defined on a Riemannian manifold and showcase its applications in spherical data analysis, and principal component analysis, and multivariate orthogonal regression. Moreover, for nonsmooth problems, we introduce additional slack variables and inequality constraints to define a novel slacked data depth, which can perform center-outward rankings of estimators arising from sparse learning and reduced rank regression. Real data examples illustrate the usefulness of some proposed data depths.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Why do public organizations and communities collaborate with each other? And what are the social and environmental outcomes of collaborative governance? This dissertation develops three essays to answer both questions. The first essay applies a conjoint experiment to investigate the determinants of interlocal collaboration decisions of U.S. municipal officials. This research extends multiple organizational network theories to organizational decision makers. The findings confirm these theories and offer new insights. The second essay explores the effects of trust in government on citizens' perceived collaborative governance and their willingness to coproduce. Using randomly assigned government integrity information as the instrumental variable of trust, the results reveal complex relations of citizen-state interactions. The third essay examines the outcomes of intergovernmental collaboration in water pollution control in China. Using the water quality panel data with the synthetic control method, this study finds that the mandated collaborative governance model effectively reduced the level of water pollution in an inter-jurisdictional river. Overall, this dissertation explores the theory of collaboration from its initial motivation to its final outcomes. The utilization of various innovative causal identification methods moves the research of collaborative governance a little step forward.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Games have shown to be great tools for learning a variety of topics, but few games have been developed mathematics topics at the undergraduate level. One possible avenue is to pursue digital game-based learning. The game Vector Unknown was designed from a task from the Inquiry-Oriented Linear Algebra (IOLA) curriculum to connect student’s algebraic and geometric understandings of vector equations in linear algebra. In the game, users guide an avatar to a goal location by selecting vectors and scaling them. This research utilizes the game as realistic basis for supporting student understanding of 2D space structured by linear combinations, which may provide crucial intuitions between concepts such as span, linear independence, basis, and abstract vector spaces. Six participants were chosen from a large Southern university with a variety of gaming experience and no linear algebra experiences. The participants were paired into three groups based upon game experience (a gamer/gamer group, a gamer/non-gamer group, and a non-gamer/non-gamer group). Participants played and analyzed the game Vector Unknown to understand its mathematical design over the course of two approximately 60-minute interviews. During a third 60-minute interview, participants were then asked to design their own version of 3D version of the game to see how their reasoning about linear combinations in 2D space extends to higher dimensions. I conducted an analysis of the student’s activity and found that students had four main themes for structuring space including  structuring by design, structuring by generating, structuring across dimensions, and structuring all possible goals.    I also found that viewpoint played an important role in student’s connecting 2D and 3D space and include a viewpoint analysis linking differing viewpoints in GeoGebra to student activity.  </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The frontoparietal control network has been established as crucial in the successful implementation of cognitive control. Specifically, regions within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) have been shown to support the ability to flexibly coordinate demands of the external environment with internal goals. However, there is debate as to how these regions are functionally organized and if some regions are more influential than others within the network. One class of hypotheses theorize the PFC is hierarchically organized where regions higher in the hierarchy are presumed to exert more influence over the network. Within this class however, there is further debate as to which region is the most influential and thus the top of the hierarchy. Specifically, the lateral frontal pole (FPl) and the middle frontal gyrus (MFG) have been suggested to be at the top by two competing hierarchical models.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The goal of this study was to provide a causal test of these hypotheses using transcranial magnetic stimulation followed by fMRI. Continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) was applied to either the FPl, MFG, or a control site (S1) followed immediately with fMRI in a within-subjects, cross-over design. Preliminary results show that MFG-cTBS significantly altered cognitive control-related activations throughout the PFC more than when targeting the FPl or control site. These preliminary results support that the MFG is an area of high influence consistent with an apical role in control. The MFG may therefore be a critical intervention target for modulating cognitive control. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This paper introduces asoptiso, which is an assembly optimizer error isolator. asopt is an assemblyoptimizer for a set of new ISAs, called the SCALE ISAs, and is a tool which is significantly difficult
to debug when it produces erroneous assembly-optimized code that fails to correctly execute during
simulation. asopt is difficult to debug due to two reasons. First, simulations can often take a long
time to test the execution of assembly-optimized code. Second, there are often a large number of
transformations which asopt has applied to the program, any of which could be the cause of error.
Manually searching for the erroneous transformations among all applied transformations is highly
impractical. I have created asoptiso to automate and simplify the process of isolating the first
erroneous transformation applied by the assembly optimizer. This tool has proved extremely useful
in speeding up the testing of asopt by not only automating error isolation, but also providing the
user with a variety of useful features.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Animals can easily develop new food preferences and aversions through associative learning. If they consume a novel flavor and experience malaise, they develop an aversion towards that particular flavor, food or fluid. Conditioned taste aversion (CTA) requires gene expression and histone acetylation, which can be enhanced by HDAC inhibitors such as sodium butyrate (NaB). Here, I sought to determine whether enhancement of CTA using NaB is subject to sex-specific differences through changes in histone modification. Adult male (n=32) and female (n=32) Sprague-Dawley rats were placed on water restriction for 7 days with ad lib food to ensure intake on conditioning day. On the conditioning day, they were given 30 min access to saccharin (0.125%) and then injected with either sodium chloride (NaCl) or lithium chloride (LiCl; 0.15M, 3ml/kg). Ten minutes later, half the rats were injected with NaB (0.3M, 12ml/kg) or NaCl (0.3M, 12ml/kg. Thus, there were 4 groups for each sex: NaCl-NaCl, NaCl-NaB, LiCl-NaCl, and LiCl-NaB. Beginning the next day, 2-bottle 24-h preference tests of water vs. saccharin was carried out for 10 days. NaCl-NaCl and NaCl-NaB groups showed high preference for saccharin throughout 2-bottle testing. Male LiCl-NaCl showed moderate CTA which extinguished over the 10 days of preference testing. Male rats injected with LiCl-NaB appeared to have a greater CTA than LiCl-NaCl rats. However, NaB did not appear to enhance CTA in the LiCl-NaB-injected females compared to LiCl-NaCl injected rats. Thus, female rats appear to be less sensitive to the CTA-potentiated effects of NaB. I wanted to check if the effect of NaB is generalizable and if there is a hormonal influence in female rats blunting the NaB-mediated conditioned taste aversion. Therefore, I used another HDAC inhibitor sodium valproate (Val) to see if I get similar results. For this experiment, I used adult male (n=20) and female (n=20) rats and found that at 100mg/kg of Val, similar to observations with NaB, LiCl-induced CTA was enhanced in male rats but not in female rats. Next, I wanted to test the role of estrogen in female rats. For this experiment I used 36 adult female rats. I divided them into three groups where the first group of rats were ovariectomized, the second group were ovariectomized with estradiol pellet implant, and the third group had a sham surgery with intact ovaries. I found that CTA was not enhanced in ovariectomized with estrogen pellet group. Finally, I assessed if the sex differences were due to a difference in basal HDAC activity between males and females, by using adult male (n=4) and female (n=4) rats and found that the males had a higher HDAC activity in brainstem and amygdala than females and also female rats are less sensitive to HDAC inhibitors.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation brings together two independent studies that examine marginalized groups of entrepreneurs being affected by different types of external shocks. In this work, I define as marginalized groups individuals that are socially, institutionally, culturally, and/or resourcefully marginalized (Pidduck &amp; Clark, 2021) and external shock as events that drastically affects the economy, either negatively or positively (Shepherd et al., 2000).Both studies are novel contexts. One involves marginalized entrepreneurial actors, doubly-stigmatized, the poor with disabilities, after the passage of a law designed to enhance their employment and self-employment, acting as a positive external shock. The second project examines marginalized entrepreneurial actors of different races in a unique time period created by a massive global external shock, during the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the first essay of this dissertation, I investigated whether facilitating the transition of persons with disabilities to self-employment could improve their economic inclusion and well-being. I exploit the effects of a positive external shock, the implementation of the Inclusion of People with Disabilities Act in Brazil during early 2016. Using a sample of 2,555 persons with disabilities (16,802 individual-years from 2013 to 2019) after the implementation of the law, the odds of self-employment were 1.03 times higher (small effect sizes), and the self-employed did not achieve improvements in income. The findings did not differ by age, sex, education, or race. The findings have implications for policy makers aiming to improve self-employment outcomes for persons with disabilities.
In the second essay, drawing on minority enclave theory and resilience theory in entrepreneurship, I test whether, with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the self-employed lost more hours than the employed and whether traditionally disadvantaged self-employed racial minorities faced harsher penalties in the form of reduced hours of work. Though spatially concentrated ethnic minority colocations could improve business outcomes in the non-crisis period, with the pandemic affecting all the members in the enclave, the very dependencies in minority enclaves could be a liability. Using a large-scale survey during the COVID-19 pandemic conducted by the Brazilian government, I draw on a one-to-one nearest neighbor matched pair sample of 19,626 employed (public or private sector) and self-employed individuals, and control for industry-sector-interview-location fixed effects. The results show that self-employed people, compared to employed, reported a greater loss of hours. At the sample level, black self-employed people on aggregate lost 9,051 hours per month, and mixed-race self-employed people on aggregate lost 27,880 hours per month. The disproportionate loss of work hours by the self-employed from racial minority groups during the COVID-19 pandemic in a developing country context calls for a closer examination and assessment of the long-term impact of COVID-19 on racial minorities. In combination, the results of this dissertation have implications for entrepreneurship research, with unique examples of application of entrepreneurship research to two novel contexts. Where previous research documents that entrepreneurship is an important mechanism for poverty alleviation, I find that it may be of limited value in marginalized groups. Poor entrepreneurs in marginalized groups were found to gain the least from positive shocks and lose the most from negative ones.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>In comparison to their lanthanide counterparts, the actinide elements are woefully understudied. This is especially true for the trans-plutonium actinides. Known isotopes of the heavier, later actinides possess, in most cases, shorter half-lives relative to the lighter actinides in addition to being more radiotoxic. These issues present significant complications when attempting to collect experimental data regarding the reactivity and bonding characteristics of the trans-plutonium actinides. Studying these elements through computational methods is made similarly difficult in part due to complex variables such as relativity and electron correlation. In light of this, it might seem easier to simply describe the actinides and their behavior as equivalent to that of the lanthanides as the Actinide Concept proposed by Glenn T. Seaborg suggests. However, advances in synthetic methods for handling these rare elements have resulted in the gathering of experimental evidence that, in combination with ever-improving computational methodology, indicate that the behavior of the later actinides does not mirror that of the later lanthanides. This is especially highlighted by the anomalous stabilization of the divalent oxidation state of the later actinides beginning at californium (Z = 98) and increasing onward to nobelium (Z = 102) which is, in fact, most stable in its divalent state at ambient conditions. A similar trend is not observed for the analogous lanthanide congeners of these actinides, and the implications of this phenomenon have been notably relevant for the separation of actinide elements from one another since the discovery of nobelium. Thus, a more thorough understanding of the unique behavior of the later actinides is crucial to understanding why they deviate from the periodicity exhibited by much lighter elements. At present, californium represents the heaviest actinide that synthetic inorganic chemistry can be achieved with and stands as the best option for investigating the nature of the divalent state of the later actinides.Chapter 1 of this work presents a detailed introduction to the typical behavior of the lanthanides and actinides under ambient conditions. An ensuing discussion of the issue of spent nuclear fuel containing many of the later actinides as fission products provides significant reason to understand the subtleties of the behavior of these elements, including the stabilization of the divalent oxidation state, for the development of more efficient separation methods. Given the scarcity of later actinides and difficulty in obtaining them, it is necessary to identify lanthanides that most closely model the behavior of the later actinides. Hence, the proposal and execution of work pertaining to optimizing the stability of relevant divalent lanthanide analogues with organic macrocycles is presented as well as the subsequent californium studies utilizing what was learned through studying the divalent lanthanides.
Chapters 2, 3, 4, and 5 detail the experiments performed to explore the interactions of divalent lanthanides like Sm, Eu, and Yb (with special emphasis on Sm) with macrocycles like cryptands and crown ethers from the direct synthesis of LnI2 with these macrocycles in organic media under an inert atmosphere, where Ln = Sm, Eu, and Yb. These studies outline robust syntheses and crystallization methods for the respective divalent lanthanide complexes presented in each chapter. In addition, the properties of the isolated compounds are characterized through various spectroscopic techniques, magnetic studies, and computational results.
Chapters 6 and 7 investigate more exotic chemistry with the divalent lanthanides. The former describes the crystallization and characterization of a Dy2+ 18-crown-6 complex while the latter explores the stability of Sm2+ under non-ideal conditions. Chapters 6 and 7 establish the potential to expand the concepts presented in chapters 2, 3, 4, and 5 to more intricate systems which is vital when exploring the more complex actinides.
Finally, chapter 8 is a discussion of the culmination of the work in the previous chapters as it is applied to trans-plutonium actinides such as Am and Cf. In the case of Cf, a mixed valent Cf3+/Cf2+ compound was isolated using 18-crown-6 as the stabilizing ligand. Methods used for the synthesis of the starting material and reduction of the trivalent Cf precursor in chapter 8 have yielded more successful results than previous attempts. In addition to the first crystallographic evidence of divalent californium, this work serves as the template for the eventual isolation of the first bulk Cf2+ compound. Finally, chapter 9 is a summation of this body of work and its implications for further exploration of the unique behavior of the trans-plutonium actinides.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>From inside our bodies to the environment we live in, there are a wide variety of unknown compounds that have been difficult to identify and characterize through current methods. We aim to study these compounds by liquid chromatography (LC) high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). LC-MS/MS has become the gold standard for the analysis of complex mixtures due to its capabilities to decrease spectral overlap and high mass measurement accuracy. Proteins are of particular interest biologically because they give insight into various diseases and the health of our biological processes. Analysis of these proteins is hindered by the current methods implemented in laboratories due to the size and characteristics of these compounds and their natural behavior outside of biological systems. Just as import as what is inside the human body is what is in the environment, specifically the Earth’s oceans. Just like proteins in the body, the Earth’s oceans give us a picture into the health of the environment. We know that human activity has severally impacted our atmosphere and water sources. We aim to understand the connections with pollution and the effects it has on oceans, a major water source on Earth.	First a broad overview of LC-MS/MS is presented in Chapter 1. The first section discusses the MS instrumentation used for the studies in the following chapters, the 14- and 21-Tesla Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Mass Spectrometer (14- and 21-T FT ICR MS). The custom-built system is designed to produce the highest resolution data for compound identification and structural information. Our facilities are also equipped with various liquid chromatography (LC) systems that are used to separate mixtures and decrease sample complexity. Lastly, a brief introduction to various complex mixtures analyzed by LC-MS. The chapters that follow cover the specific studies performed with the knowledge of LC-FT ICR-MS and compound identifications.
	Chapter 2 discusses a study into the benefits and limitations on the application of isotopic depletion for cultured proteins. Isotopic depletion is a method used to deplete compounds of various heavy isotopes of elements present, most commonly carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. Heavy isotopes effect MS experiments in multiple ways which are investigated in the study for proteins derived from multiple cell lines (E. coli and C. elegan). This work is novel in the application and analysis of isotopically depleted C. elegans proteins
	The methods used for the biological applications can be applied to the analysis of marine samples which is discussed in Chapters 3 and 4. Chapter 3 investigates the composition of sinking particles in the California Coastal Current, specifically metabolites. Sinking particles play a role in the regulation of biological processes in the water column but additionally have shown to regulate greenhouse emissions. We take an even deeper look with analysis of marine sediments to see how far pollutants travel down the water column and are stored at the bottom of the ocean, in Chapter 4. Marine sediment samples were collected from the Oregon continental shelf at established sample stations. The analysis of these environmental samples by LC-MS/MS is still in the developmental phase. Our work aims to develop novel LC-MS/MS methods that can give a fuller picture into environmental impacts of pollution.
	The overall goal is to expand the capabilities of LC-MS/MS experiments to complex mixtures. LC-MS/MS shows its true capabilities and potential in the experiments discussed here. From 300 Da to 40 kDa in size, LC-MS/MS can efficiently analyze a wide dynamic range of compounds which is critical to broad applicability. With this work, future experiments can analyze and identify a wide range of compounds by high-throughput LC-MS/MS analysis.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to explore the extent to which university-level choral faculty experience impostor feelings across job responsibilities (conducting, teaching, and research), years of experience, and gender. Individuals experiencing impostor phenomenon (IP) are typically high-achieving, successful people, yet tend to feel that they are undeserving of their success and fear exposure as a fraud. Participants (N = 206) were university faculty members who held choral music education, choral conducting, or hybrid positions. They responded to a survey that included the Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale (CIPS; Clance, 1985) and three researcher-modified CIPS for conducting, teaching, and research. Results indicated that a majority of choral faculty experience IP in at least one category, with participants feeling the highest impostor feelings regarding their research expectations and abilities. Participants reported the lowest level of IP feelings in regard to teaching. In investigating the relationship between teaching experience and IP feelings, there were significant correlations with all four scales. There was a weak, negative association between years of experience and general IP feelings, years of experience and conducting, and years of experience and teaching. There was a moderate, negative relationship between years of experience and research. Finally, results indicated no significant difference between gender and any scale category. In addition to these results, descriptive statistics for IP feelings in each category revealed high standard deviations. This finding suggests that impostor feelings are highly individualistic and can present differently based on personal experiences. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Autonomous vehicle (AV) is becoming very popular due to technological evolution in autonomous transportation sector. It can be more reliable than human-controlled vehicle as it can detect pedestrians with high accuracy and control the vehicle precisely. One major disadvantage of the autonomous vehicle is that it cannot communicate with surrounding pedestrians and other road users like a traditional vehicle. Pedestrians tend to interact with human drivers before taking a crossing decision; but AV cannot use such communication mediums. As a result, it is necessary to understand how pedestrians will behave in a crossing scenario when an AV is present. To evaluate this complex interaction pattern, a simulation tool can be useful as it can generate realistic pedestrian motion models which are useful to design different AV algorithms. These motion models can also help to understand different perspectives from a pedestrian viewpoint and what factors are related to the safe interaction between AVs and pedestrians. It can also benefit autonomous vehicle designers: they can visualize pedestrian and vehicle trajectories, extract velocity and acceleration profile of both agents, test different autonomous vehicle planning algorithms and assess the traffic safety in severe traffic conflicts. This research work presents a rule-based social force model to simulate pedestrian trajectories during interaction with an autonomous vehicle. The social force model is then integrated with an autonomous vehicle control and planning algorithm for simulating the behavior of both pedestrian and vehicle in traffic conflicts by varying different parameters such as agent’s initial speed, different vehicle sensor types (error percentage of pedestrian detection varies), different pedestrian types (risk-taking, cautious and distracted), etc. Two types of crossing scenarios (crosswalk and roundabout) are used in this research work. The output of this simulation is the minimum distance that is accepted by a pedestrian during crossing. These minimum distances can be used to simulate more risky interaction scenarios to understand the effectiveness of autonomous vehicle planning algorithm while interacting with different types of pedestrians. Although AVs are expected to reduce traffic crashes, a finite element simulation model is developed to determine pedestrian risk injury criteria for both head and chest portion during unavoidable crashes. The finite element model uses side and frontal impact for pedestrian collision. Injury probability for both head and chest injuries are found higher for the frontal impact than the side impact collision.  </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In modern statistics, data are becoming more complex than ever. These complex situations greatly challenge the classical statistical analysis especially when the problem is high-dimensional. In my dissertation, we mainly study the high-dimensional classification under three challenging scenarios: 1) When the data is heavy-tailed or it contains disturbing outliers; 2) When the sparsity assumption does not hold; 3) When the data is in the form of tensor. I develop novel methodologies to tackle the challenges occurring in these situations. My work on the three problems is recapitulated as follows.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>    The nearest shrunken centroids method (NSC) is a popular high-dimensional classifier. However, it is prone to inaccurate classification when the data is heavy-tailed. In Chapter 2, I develop a robust generalization of NSC which remains effective under such circumstances. By incorporating the Huber loss both in the estimation and the calculation of the score function, I reduce the impacts of heavy tails. I rigorously show the variable selection, estimation, and prediction consistency in high dimensions under weak moment conditions. Empirically, our proposal greatly outperforms NSC and many other successful classifiers when data is heavy-tailed while remaining comparable to NSC in the absence of heavy tails. The favorable performance of RNSC is also demonstrated in a real data example. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>    The sparsity assumption is frequently employed when the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is generalized to high-dimensional problems. However, the sparse condition (targeting ``sparse signals'') is only an approximation to the complex situation, as there also exist a lot of non-zero elements with a small magnitude, known as ``dense signals''. are not exactly zero in the practical situation. The accumulated ``dense signals'' will severely influence the prediction and interpretation of a method. In Chapter 3, I propose one LDA-type method that relaxes the sparsity assumption. By employing l_1 and l_2 based penalization separately when estimating the ``sparse signals'' and ``dense signals'' of the discriminant directions, our method achieves robustness to non-sparse data. Theoretically, our proposal has neat consistency properties without the sparse condition. Numerically, our method gives comparable prediction accuracy to many popular classification methods when the sparsity condition holds and has significant advantages when there exist both ``sparse signals'' and ``dense signals''. The method is further supported by experiments on multiple real datasets.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>    Tensor is becoming a popular data structure in contemporary scientific studies. However, I cannot directly implement the traditional classification methods for vector data to tensors as they will damage the covariance structure. Existing studies designed for tensor data mainly target the tensor discriminant directions and require specific conditions on the distribution. In Chapter 3, I develop a distance-based classifier for tensor data. It is a method with weak model assumptions that could capture the centroid structures through de-correlation. We examine this method with simulations including various scenarios and further demonstrate it with a real-world dataset.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Types of social media behaviors, including active or passive social media use, may have an influence on mental health outcomes (Aalbers et al., 2019; Verduyn et al., 2015). The impact of social media use may be particularly relevant to risk factors for suicide, such as thwarted belongingness, and forming social connections. The present study sought evaluate the impact of social media use on thwarted belongingness (TB) and desire to affiliate (DA) following a social exclusion task. One hundred forty-three participants (Mage = 19.32, SD = 1.20, 81.1% Female, 71.3% White/Caucasian, 99.3% Single/Never married, 79.7% Heterosexual) completed a series of baseline measures assessing mental health indices, affect, TB and DA followed by engaging in a social exclusion task. After completing the social exclusion task, participants were assigned to one of three conditions: an active social media use condition, a passive social media use condition, and a control condition. The researchers predicted that following the social exclusion task, all participants would experience a decrease in TB and an increase in DA. After the social media manipulation, we hypothesized that participants in the active social media condition would experience decreased TB and increased DA when compared to participants in the other conditions. In the passive condition, we predicted that participants would report increased TB and increased DA when compared to participants in the other conditions. Four hierarchal linear models were utilized to examine hypotheses controlling for demographic variables, baseline depressive symptoms, positive and negative affect, and reasons for social media use. Results did not indicate a significant effect of the social exclusion task on either TB or DA. Similarly, results did not demonstrate an effect of passive or active social media use on levels of TB or DA. Findings provide support that social media behavior does not have as great an impact as in-person interactions and may be heavily influenced by within-person factors.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation is composed of three papers, all using natural experiments from developing countries to examine critical issues in the lives of individuals in the developing world. In the first chapter, I combine data from a national high school entrance exam linked to individual tax records in Jamaica to examine the short and long-run impact of several key aspects of secondary education. The second chapter examines the impact of education on short and long-term academic outcomes in the country of  Colombia. The final chapter examines the impact political connections play in the provision of public amenities in China.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The first chapter, "High School Never Ends: Secondary School Attributeson Formal Sector Earnings" examines what features of secondary education lead to increased formal sector earnings. Five hundred million children are enrolled in secondary education in developing countries, over five times that in developed nations. However, little is known about what features of secondary education matter the most for short-term academic or long-term labor market outcomes in developing countries. In this paper, I combine data from a national high school entrance exam linked to individual tax records in Jamaica to examine several key aspects of secondary education. First, the eligibility cutoff in Jamaica allows me to employ a regression discontinuity design to estimate credible causal effects of access to a school with additional years of secondary education. Second, through a similar design, I am able to obtain a credible causal estimate of peer quality on short and long-term outcomes. Finally, using idiosyncratic variation in gender composition, I am able to analyze a school's gender composition on short and long-term outcomes. Access to a school with additional years of education increases formal sector earnings by 2,900 USD PPP per year from ages 22 to 31. However, I find no short or long-term effects from higher quality peers. Finally, I find large academic benefits from having a larger share of same-sex peers but no long-term labor market benefits.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The second chapter, "What is the Impact of Educational Spending on Short and Long Term Outcomes? Evidence from Colombia" examines the impact of both lower and higher local education spending on short-term and long-term academic outcomes. The goal of the chapter is to answer the question, "does  education spending impact student outcomes in developing countries?" I leverage two separate natural experiments to answer the question. First, I exploit the repeal of a program in Colombia that allocated a portion of oil royalties to per capita education spending in the municipalities where the oil was extracted.   Using a rich administrative data set containing more than 1.2 million students, I estimate that a 25 percent drop in education spending results in a 0.05 standard deviation decline in language standardized test scores and a 0.04 standard deviation decline in math standardized test scores. I document that children impacted by the spending cuts are 2.5 percentage points less likely to graduate from a university (8 percent relative to the mean). Moreover, I find the most severe learning losses for women, low-income individuals,  and those with less-educated parents. Second, I  utilize the institutional feature before the reform linking local education expenditure to oil royalties. I then instrument education expenditure with international oil prices interacting with fixed oil production. I find short-term educational spending increases lead to a rise in the number of students finishing high school and improvements in language scores.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The third chapter, "What is the impact of political connections on the provision of public amenities? Evidence from China's primary land markets," measures the effect of political connections on the provision of public amenities. My coauthor (Jing Feng) and I use over two million land transactions from China's primary land market during the period  2001 to 2019. Using a spatially matched sample, we find that connected firms are nearly two percentage points (30 percent) more likely to receive a kindergarten, elementary, or middle school in the immediate vicinity of their purchase. We find suggestive evidence of firms receiving more doctor's offices and hospitals. We then exploit the timing of an anti-corruption crackdown in China; we find the benefits of political connections disappear following the crackdown. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Prior studies suggest that industry clustering, the phenomenon where industry-peer firms are geographically co-located, decreases analysts’ acquisition costs and leads to greater stock price efficiency for firms within industry clusters. Since the market and analysts are information intermediaries within the financial reporting environment, I speculate that one possible way they are able to experience this benefit is due to enhanced accounting information quality, indicative of a potential link between industry clustering and accounting information quality. Consequently, I examine whether industry clustering improves accounting information quality. I find that industry clustering is positively associated with accounting information quality as measured by accrual quality. Consistent with prior research, I find that this association persists in areas when firms have greater discretionary control over their accruals and in highly concentrated industries. Overall, my findings suggest that industry clustering enhances accounting information quality, and that the financial reporting environment is perhaps a channel through which industry clustering benefits both firms and information intermediaries.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Anhedonia, or difficulty experiencing pleasure, is a core deficit in depression. Depressed patients expressing anhedonia show increased treatment resistance and greater suicidal ideation when compared to non-anhedonic depressed patients. Mechanistically, depressed anhedonic patients are characterized by a dysfunction of the reward circuit. Based on neuroimaging and animal studies, these deficits have largely been tied to the mesolimbic pathway; a dopaminergic reward circuit that includes the ventral striatum (VS). VS activation is largely mediated via glutamatergic inputs from the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and limbic areas. Depressed anhedonic patients show reduced VS activation to reward-related stimuli, perceived behaviorally as a lack of reward motivation. Interventions to enhance VS activation may therefore improve reward processing and anhedonic symptoms, but no established interventions to date specifically target the mesolimbic pathway. In a first step towards this goal, Chapter 1 reviews the literature associated with anhedonic depression, including underlying mechanisms, neural measures of reward dysfunction, and clinical treatments utilizing transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).  Chapter 2 discusses this work’s attempt to modulate VS reward activation in healthy individuals through intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS), a form of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Following studies which have shown iTBS can propagate to downstream structures within a targeted pathway, the rostromedial PFC (rmPFC), an area showing high co-activation with the VS, was stimulated to alter mesolimbic reward response. To capture this change, the reward positivity (RewP), an event-related potential that indexes activity of the reward circuit and has been shown to be abnormal in depression, was utilized. Within-subject comparisons determined that rmPFC stimulation potentiated the RewP when compared to a control site stimulation of the primary somatosensory (S1) or primary motor cortex (M1). These effects were specific to win trials, emphasizing successful targeting of the mesolimbic reward pathway. Effects were also moderated by the ability to precisely target areas within the rmPFC that exhibited high connectivity to the VS. Baseline reward signaling was also a predictor of rmPFC-iTBS effectiveness, with individuals exhibiting low baseline reward response showing greater change in RewP amplitude following rmPFC-iTBS when compared control iTBS. These findings provide novel methodology for enhancing reward response, and provide a mechanistic framework for the development of new clinical interventions for treating anhedonic depression. Chapter 3 proposes changes and refinements in methodology for future rmPFC-iTBS studies, as informed from the results presented in Chapter 2.  Follow-up studies on anhedonic participants utilizing a longitudinal within-subject design with consecutive stimulation days, and improvements on TMS targeting are discussed. Included is the development of a novel algorithm utilizing simulations, connectivity, and anatomy based on the targeting results presented in Chapter 2. 
Together, this work provides evidence of altered reward response through use of iTBS-rmPFC and proposes steps to further validate iTBS-rmPFC reward alterations in addition to refinements on how to effectively target downstream areas through superficial cortical sites. With further validation, the methodology presented within this work could lead to a new clinical intervention targeting anhedonic symptomology, which is exhibited prominently within individuals suffering from severe depression. Additionally, incorporation of the proposed targeting algorithm could be generalized to improve TMS effectiveness in manipulating downstream areas irrespective of target.

            <DISS_para>Deficits in general cognitive functions, measured via reductions in the P300 ERP component, are commonly observed in adults suffering from depression compared to controls. Despite this extensive literature in adult samples, the relationship between P300 and depression during childhood and adolescence is greatly understudied. Considering risk for depression dramatically increases during adolescence, especially for females and as individuals age further into adolescence, examination of the neurological underpinnings of depression during this critical developmental period can help us further elucidate pathways that better explain this increased risk as well as increase our overall understanding of the etiology of depressive disorders. Therefore, the present study sought to examine the cross-sectional associations between P300 amplitude, depression symptoms, sex, and age in two large samples of adolescents (sample 1: ages 8 to 14; sample 2: ages 11 to 14) at both a baseline (sample 1: n = 307; sample 2: n = 608) and follow-up visit (sample 1: n = 252; sample 2: n = 448). More specifically, the P300 elicited from the doors stimuli in the doors gambling task was examined at each assessment. In line with past findings, smaller doors P300 amplitude was consistently associated to higher depressive symptoms at each assessment in both samples. Furthermore, this association was significantly moderated by participant age at the majority of assessments, such that the association between P300 and depression was increased in older adolescents. There was also evidence that sex significantly moderated this relationship suggesting that reductions in P300 amplitude related to increased depression was only present in females and not males. Additionally, doors P300 amplitude appeared to be uniquely associated to depressive symptoms even when controlling for current externalizing symptoms. Lastly, doors P300 exhibited good-to-excellent internal consistency at each assessment and good test-retest reliability over both two months and two years. In sum, the current project demonstrates that the relatively novel doors P300 component is a reliable neural correlate of depression during adolescence, and that this P300 component can assist in uncovering factors and pathways linked to increased risk for depression observed in adolescence.

            <DISS_para>Suicide is a serious public health concern, killing more than 45,000 Americans, annually. To guide research, treatment, and prevention efforts, researchers have proposed many theories of suicide. Among theories, the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (IPTS) has been the focus of substantial study, and much of this work has demonstrated that related constructs (i.e., thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness) are predictors of suicidal ideation. Further, recent meta-analyses have indicated that perceived burdensomeness in particular demonstrates utility as a relatively strong risk factor for suicidal ideation; the latter always or nearly always precedes lethal or near-lethal suicide attempts. Notably, despite substantial investigation into the IPTS and suicidal ideation more generally, the U.S. suicide rate has risen consecutively for the past fifteen years. Treatments for suicidal ideation are generally suboptimal, with suicidal ideation often persisting even after a full course of treatment. An intervention developed to reduce suicidal ideation by targeting perceived burdensomeness, as suggested by the IPTS, has found some support. A brief cognitive bias modification (CBM) directed at perceived burdensomeness prevented the onset of suicidal ideation in adults with elevated thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness, but not suicidal ideation. It is unclear and untested if CBM targeting perceived burdensomeness can reduce suicidal ideation among participants already experiencing clinically significant impairment of suicidal ideation. The present study addressed this gap by targeting perceived burdensomeness in the hopes of reducing suicidal ideation in a treatment- seeking sample of 74 high-risk adults. Findings indicated that by targeting perceived burdensomeness, suicidal ideation was reduced in a sample of high-risk participants.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This thesis focuses on women’s music education and music-making in late eighteenth and early nineteenth-century America through the accounts of female students and educators at female seminaries. The development of women’s education and music education is traced using four case studies: Catherine Ackerly of the Bethlehem Female Seminary, Caroline Cowles Richards of the Ontario Female Seminary, Emma Hart Willard of the Troy Female Seminary, and Mary Lyon of Mount Holyoke Female Seminary. The two students’ lives are traced through personal documents, namely Ackerly’s music book and Richard’s diary. The educators’ stories, Willard and Lyon, are told through institutional records and other accounts written and published within their lifetimes. Through an examination of primary source material, we gain an understanding of the musical experiences of these women from their own perspectives. This allows an exploration of how music education influenced their lives, as well as the lives of many other students who attended these schools and others like them. These institutions served as models for the educational programs that followed them, allowing the ideals of rigorous curricula and the accessibility of education to spread across the United States and abroad.
The impact of these schools continuously resonates in music programs that still exist today. These revolutionary female seminaries created space for the inclusion of women in higher levels of education that had previously been inaccessible to them. The strength of the curricula at female seminaries influenced the development of strong music education programs across the country. The spread of the pedagogical visions and missions at these institutions contribute greatly to the landscape of higher education and higher music education as it exists today.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>As a field, higher education frequently assumes lived experiences of undergraduate students, such as participating in student activism, are automatically experiential learning opportunities; however, there is a lack of research focusing and featuring students’ voices on the matter. In this preliminary research study, qualitative research methods were utilized to explore the lived experiences of undergraduate students, specifically focusing on their engagement in student activism and how leadership learning may be a feature of that lived experience. Through the use of phenomenology, this study captured the lived experiences of participants regarding their activism engagement, as well as examined participants’ meaning making processes regarding said experiences. This study approached leadership learning through Bertrand Jones et al.’s (2016) culturally relevant leadership learning model, specifically, leadership learning is any growth through the reciprocal relationship between an individual and the leadership process via engagement in identity, capacity, and efficacy. Additionally, activism was conceptualized in this study through Harro’s (2000) cycle of liberation, therefore and action taken in an attempt to enact intrapersonal, interpersonal, or systemic change is activism. Data collection for this study consisted of the six participants completing two written reflections; two in-depth, semi-structured, virtual individual interviews; and the presentation of an artifact representing their lived activism experiences. Findings of this study revealed leadership learning is a feature of participants’ lived student activism experiences through their engagement in the leadership process through identity, capacity, and efficacy. Additionally, it was revealed that all participants had a shared understanding of what constituted as activism; however, some participants identified a difference in one engaging in activism and identifying as an activist. Further, this study’s findings also indicated that lived experience is not always enough and that further meaning making and reflection may be required for undergraduate students to make a connection between their activism engagement and their leadership engagement. Finally, this study highlighted the vital role institutions play in student engagement in both activism and leadership.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>There have been recent pushes for more active learning in mathematics classrooms, especially at the undergraduate level. To incorporate more active learning, there is a need for tasks that explicitly support this type of instruction, attention to student reasoning and whose ideas are publicly acknowledged, and awareness of differences in students’ experiences in these classes. My dissertation follows a three-paper format and addresses these aspects in an inquiry-oriented linear algebra context. In these papers, I examine student reasoning about solutions to systems of linear equations in the context of an inquiry-oriented task sequence, the development of argumentation (with attention to which students contribute this development), and the relationships among classroom obligations and students’ identities and ways of being positioned in class. 	Systems of linear equations (SLE) comprise a fundamental concept in linear algebra, but there is relatively little research regarding the teaching and learning of SLE, especially students' conceptions of solutions. It has been shown that solving systems with no or infinitely many solutions tends to be less intuitive for students, pointing to the need for more research on the teaching and learning of the topic. For the first paper, I and another author interviewed two math majors who were also preservice teachers, in a paired teaching experiment to see how they reasoned about solutions to SLE in ℝ3. I present findings focused on the progression of students’ reasoning about solutions to SLE through the lens of symbolizing. We document their progression of reasoning as an accumulation of coordinated numeric, algebraic, and graphical meanings and symbolizations for solution sets developed throughout and called on at different moments in the task sequence. 
	The second paper focuses on the participatory equity of collective argumentation during the systems of linear equations unit in an undergraduate linear algebra course. The instructor used a modified version of the task sequence presented in the first paper. It has been argued that active learning can lead to more equitable outcomes in math classrooms, but others have found that it can actually increase gaps in performances between men and women or amplify the in-class racialized and gendered experiences for students from marginalized populations. In this paper, I use video recordings and field notes from class discussions to document the overall participatory equity or inequity in the argumentation during the systems unit and how and by whom four different arguments were developed. I note that women only participated during situational activity in contrast to women not participating at all in generalizing activity. I also describe the ways in which the online chat functioned as a mechanism that, at times, made discussion participation more equitable. I highlight an instance within argumentation in which one student, whose mathematical ideas were used particularly often, made a sexist comment implying women’s contribution in the course should be identifying colors of lines on a graph.
	In the third paper, I compare one course’s normative identity, or the obligations in which students would need to adopt to be seen as successful, and personal identity, or the degree to which students identify and engage in those obligations. I then examine relationships between these identities and the ways in which students are positioned, or the ways they are allowed to participate and the ways in which they and their ideas are valued in the course. I address differences that can exist between a class’s normative identity and students’ personal identities that contribute to differences in the ways students are positioned. I also highlight ways in which students can be positioned similarly while also experiencing interactions differently.
	The three papers deal with differences that can exist in students’ reasoning, whole class participation, and experiences in an inquiry-oriented setting. The first paper addresses a gap in research on student reasoning about systems of linear equations, especially regarding systems with large or infinite solution sets. The second paper addresses a gap in the research linking collective argumentation and equity, especially in undergraduate mathematics settings. The third paper addresses a gap in the research examining the ways students identify with the classroom normative identity and how this relates to how those students are positioned in class.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Background: It is well established that resistance training (RT) can positively impact musculoskeletal health, physical performance, and cognitive wellness.  In contrast, binge drinking can have harmful effects on the aforementioned characteristics.  Interestingly, those who exercise more tend to binge drink alcohol more frequently and consume greater quantities of alcohol.  Because the college years are developmentally sensitive and binge drinking is at its highest level compared to other segments of life, recent research has focused on the relationship among RT, binge drinking, and various health markers.  A population of interest is young adult females as they tend to perform RT less than males, have a hormonal milieu making them more susceptible to alcohol-induced musculoskeletal issues, and have a higher prevalence of psychological disorders which may be exacerbated by alcohol consumption.  Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine how RT and binge drinking impact musculoskeletal health, physical performance, and cognitive wellness in young adult females.  Methods: Young adult females (age: 22.19 ± 2.54 years; BMI: 23.21 ± 3.00 kg/m2) were split into 4 groups: 1) sedentary low alcohol consumers (SL; n = 12), 2) sedentary binge drinkers (SB; n = 12), 3) resistance trained low alcohol consumers (RTL; n = 12), and 4) resistance trained binge drinkers (RTB; n = 12).  To be classified as sedentary, participants performed exercise on average ≤2 days per week for at least the past 2 years.  To be classified as resistance trained, participants performed RT on average ≥4 times per week for at least the past 2 years.  To be classified as a low alcohol consumer, participants consumed on average ≤1 alcoholic drink per week for at least the past year.  To be classified as a binge drinker, participants binge drank at least once per week for at least the past year.  RT and alcohol consumption were determined through self-report.  Body composition was measured along with bone mineral density (BMD) via dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan (total body, spine, and non-dominant hip).  Muscle quality was assessed at the non-dominant rectus femoris via ultrasonography.  Insulin sensitivity was assessed via an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) using capillary blood glucose.  Physical performance was assessed through chair stand power, vertical jump, squat jump, broad jump, knee extensor torque, push-ups to failure, and grip strength.  Cognitive function was assessed through the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, Digit Span Test, and 30 second counting task.  Psychological wellness was assessed through the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, Profile of Mood States, Short Form 36, and Friendship Scale.  The primary analysis was conducted using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and when normality or homogeneity of variances was violated, non-parametric testing was performed.
Results: Compared to sedentary females, resistance trained females had a lower body fat percentage (RTL = 29.28 ± 4.27; RTB = 29.03 ± 3.67; SL = 37.18 ± 5.32; SB = 34.83 ± 3.54; p &lt; .05).  RTL had more fat-free mass than SL and SB (RTL = 48.31 ± 5.81 kg; SL = 38.08 ± 6.59 kg; SB = 40.37 ± 6.05 kg; both p &lt; .05).  There were no differences between RTL and RTB on BMD, muscle quality, or physical performance tests and both groups trended to outperform or significantly outperformed SL and SB.  RTL outperformed SL and SB on vertical jump (both p &lt; .05) while RTB outperformed SL and SB on broad jump (both p &lt; .05).  RTL did have a lower fasting blood glucose than RTB (88.92 ± 12.09 mg/dL and 103.17 ± 10.21 mg/dL, respectively; p = .008), and RTL had lower blood glucose at 120 minutes of the OGTT than all groups (RTL = 103.83 ± 19.82 mg/dL; RTB = 137.58 ± 21.54 mg/dL; SL = 148.50 ± 44.60 mg/dL; SB = 139.25 ± 14.49 mg/dL; all p &lt; .05).  There were no significant differences in measures of cognitive wellness between the groups.
Conclusion: These data suggest chronic binge drinking does not deleteriously impact body composition, BMD, physical performance, or muscle quality in young adult females who participate in RT at least 4 times per week.  However, even in young adult females who participate in habitual RT and have comparable body composition to low alcohol consumers, chronic binge drinking does impair glucose tolerance as indicated by elevated fasting and 2-hour OGTT blood glucose.  Future research should investigate the various metabolic effects chronic binge drinking has in young adult populations as these are sensitive years to form long-term, lifestyle habits and attenuate disease risk later in life.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation aims to describe the economic importance of developing models to describe dynamic networks. Structure that changes over time is a ubiquitous feature of networks generated by human interaction. Efforts to study these interactions, however, have been limited by concerns with computational feasibility. In this work I lay out experimental and empirical analysis of three environments in which dynamic networks contain valuable information that is tractable to extract. A common thread through these chapters is market design; each chapter focuses on an issue that can arise in digital platforms, and addresses these issues with reputation systems, pricing strategy, and information disclosure.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This dissertation describes our research into the properties of the interstellar medium (ISM) through the lens of numerical magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations. Our research explores the prob- ability distribution functions (PDF) of gas density in clouds during the transition from a hot diffuse atomic gas to a cold dense molecular one. We explain their transition from lognormal to power-law scaling as functions of a critical density at which point the cloud becomes self-gravitating. We also utilize synthetic observations to explore the filamentary structures which form within these clouds at high densities and discuss the 0.1pc width reported by Arzoumanian et al. [2011] in the Herschel Gould Belt Survey through the lens of the observational and fitting effects inherent to real data. We show how sensitive these measurements can be to various factors such as finite telescope resolution in even the best performed analysis. We then discuss our current research into the observed polarized E/B mode spectra observed by Planck Collaboration et al. [2018]. In this research we run a suite of simulations through a large swath of parameter space in order to improve our understanding of the physical conditions of the interstellar dust responsible for the observed spectra. We present a constrained parameter space, several unexpected relationships and the general effects of magnetic field strength and turbulence on the polarization of the ISM.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Fourier transforms form an integral part of most signal processing applications and are therefore a crucial enabler of modern technology. Thus, fast and efficient algorithms to compute the Fourier transform is an area of active research. A class of algorithms called the Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) already exist which can compute the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) quite efficiently. However, these algorithms use complex arithmetic. This could be a hindrance in hardware that lacks dedicated multiplier units like low power/low performance digital signal processors and embedded microprocessors. Moreover, these algorithms are not easily vectorizable.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To avoid these drawbacks, a natively-real DFT computational algorithm is presented in this dissertation. This can compute the DFT with real arithmetic using real DFT eigenvectors. Moreover, this algorithm is entirely based on linear algebra and is not as complicated as the FFT algorithms. This can be implemented in parallel processing hardware since it is easily vectorizable. It has the potential to consume less power on low performance or fixed-point hardware although it needs more number of operations than existing FFT algorithms. If the need arises, this method can be combined with FFT algorithms to reduce the number of operations.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation also presents a few techniques to obtain the real and orthonormal DFT eigenvectors from the DFT projection matrices. For each of these techniques, the DFT computation error and the number of operations required are also discussed. A 2-dimensional DFT computation algorithm is also presented.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this thesis project, I explore the rhetorical consequences of mixed race Black people’s racialization in Pre-Reconstruction nineteenth century. Toward this end, I ask: How did the language surrounding mixed race Black people’s identity in Pre-Reconstruction nineteenth century inform their realities? How did mixed race Black people use passing and crossing as rhetorical action? Through these questions, I analyze the narratives of four nineteenth century Black authors’ texts informed by important historical context. By employing decolonial and critical race theory frameworks, I trace how the rhetoric of the racialization of mixed race Black people of the period led to the construction of particular material realities for enslaved Black people. I conclude that the rhetoric of the one drop rule influenced the actions, behaviors, and beliefs of nineteenth century citizens and led mixed race Black people of the period to form fictive kinships with monoracial Black people. In addition, mixed race Black people utilized passing and crossing as rhetorical action towards the exigence of enslavement.  </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation explores the impact of institutional reforms on electoral and public goods provision outcomes. My first substantive chapter investigates the question of how institutional reforms affect voter mobilization in weekly-institutionalized democracies. I examine the effect of decentralization on turnout and candidate diversity in local elections in Ukraine in 2015-2020. In 2014, the government of Ukraine initiated decentralization reform which allowed village, town, and city councils to gain wider administrative, financial, and fiscal independence. Difference-in-differences estimates show that establishment of ATCs increased turnout and decreased the percentage of successful candidates with higher education. These effects can be explained by the increased interest in local politics and easier access to candidacy due to improved salience of local politics and communities' relative independence from central authorities. Thus, even under weak democratic institutions, decentralization can have immediate effect on voter mobilization through increased perception of local elections as 'meaningful' and, thus, worth time and effort. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>My second substantive chapter analyses how political and fiscal decentralization affects redistribution in lower-middle income countries. I address this question by studying the effect of decentralization reform on public sector budgetary expenditures in Ukraine in 2015-2020. Starting from 2015, Ukrainian urban territorial communities (TCs) had an opportunity to gain control over local budgetary revenues and expenditures, as well as to gain political independence from the central authorities. Decentralization reform allowed local councils and mayors to determine the level of spending on public goods provision in administrative, law enforcement, business support, environmental protection, infrastructure, education, and welfare sectors. Difference-in-difference analysis shows that decentralization was associated with increased expenditures on welfare and public goods provision. The findings suggest that the electoral pressure of decentralized democratic institutions prompts local authorities to engage in redistributive practices and introduce long-needed changes in management of local budgetary funds. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>My third substantive chapter studies the impact of organized religion on the consolidation of power in authoritarian regimes. While previous research focused on transit to and survival of democracy, I examine the effect of religious institutions on the consolidation and maintenance of power in an already existing autocracy. I look at the electoral influence of the Orthodox Church in Russia under President Vladimir Putin. While the significance of the Orthodox Church dwindled under the Communist Era due to the repression of religion, it has since regained its presence and has become increasingly salient in society. To examine the consequences of this resurgence, I look at the expansion in the number of churches during the Putin era and its effects on support for the regime. I find that expansion in the number of churches leads to an increase in electoral support for the regime, during both parliamentary and presidential elections. My study thus highlights how non-governmental organizations can help contribute to regime stability. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Biometric-based authentication is gaining increasing attention for wearables and mobile applications. Meanwhile, the growing adoption of sensors in wearables and mobiles also provides opportunities to capture novel biometrics. In this proposal, we leverage the cutting-edge wearables to sense novel human biometrics and utilize them for user authentication, i.e., ear canal deformation and toothprint acoustic. First, we use ear wearables to sense ear canal deformation, and further design an ear canal deformation-based user authentication using ear wearables. Our system provides continuous and passive user authentication and is transparent to users. It leverages ear canal deformation that combines the ear canal's unique static geometry and dynamic motions when the user is speaking for authentication. It utilizes an acoustic sensing approach to capture the ear canal deformation with the built-in microphone and speaker of the in-ear wearable. Specifically, it first emits well-designed inaudible beep signals and records the reflected signals from the ear canal. It then analyzes the reflected signals and extracts fine-grained acoustic features that correspond to the ear canal deformation for user authentication. Our extensive experimental evaluation shows that our system can achieve a recall of 97.38% and an F1 score of 96.84%. Results also show that our system works well in noisy environments with various daily activities.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Moreover, we propose a system that leverages the toothprint-induced sonic effect produced by a user performing teeth gestures for earable authentication. In particular, we design representative tooth gestures that can produce effective sonic waves carrying the information of the toothprint. To reliably capture the acoustic toothprint, it leverages the occlusion effect of the ear canal and the inward-facing microphone of the earables. It then extracts multi-level acoustic features to reflect the intrinsic toothprint information for authentication. The key advantages of toothprint-based biometrics are that it is suitable for earables and is resistant to various spoofing attacks as the acoustic toothprint is captured via the user's private teeth-ear channel that modulates and encrypts the sonic waves. Our experiment studies with 25 participants show that our system could achieve up to 95% accuracy with only one of the users' tooth gestures.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study is to explore the educational experiences and social mobility status of a rural village cohort that started first grade at a rural village primary school in 1997 in central China. Formal education is often seen as the primary pathway for upward social mobility. However, inequalities in access to educational opportunities can mediate and determine the chance of successful upward mobility through education. In China, for many rural students, the education they receive does not provide a chance of upward mobility for them, rather, it reinforces the existing social class inequalities and rural-urban divide. Existing literature does not provide a rationale in understanding why education has not provided intergenerational upward mobility for rural residents, or the mechanisms in the reproduction of rural class identity. This study attempted to fill this research gap by adopting a case study approach to understand the lived experiences of rural residents in their views and values toward education, perceptions of upward mobility, and how they make sense of the role education plays in their social mobility status. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Data collection consisted of a survey questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. The survey questionnaire collected demographic information of the participants. Interviews explored in-depth the participants’ educational experiences, the decision-making process of major education and career choices, how they understand social mobility, and the role their education plays in shaping their social mobility status, and the meaning of education to themselves and to their children. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The educational experiences of the cohort members are about a story of struggle and perseverance, a story of “being surrounded with the right people,” and a story of believing in the role of education in providing upward mobility as well as a story of self-blaming when failed to do so. The cohort members explain that the meaning of education is to walk out of the village to the cities and become a member of the upper urban class, and to provide the expected economic returns of education. For the cohort members, to walk out, is to the language for upward mobility in the local context, is to shift away from their generational identity of a rural farmer, to bu zhong di (not farm anymore), and to have a tie fan wan (an Iron Rice Bowl: a stable secure job in the city), and to achieve income mobility. The findings of the study provide valuable insights into the mechanism of social reproduction through education, and help identify areas and levers for education researchers and policymakers to improve in rural education.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>	Volatility modeling and forecasting are crucial in risk management and pricing derivatives. High-frequency financial data are dynamic and affected by the microstructure noise. For the univariate case, we define the two-scale realized volatility estimator as the measure of the volatility of high-frequency financial data. Two main models for volatility, Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedastic (GARCH) and Heterogeneous Autoregressive (HAR), are evaluated and compared for the realized volatility forecast of four major stock indices high-frequency data. We also consider the measures of jump component and heteroskedasticity of the error in the extended HAR models. For the improvement of forecasting accuracy of realized volatility, this dissertation develops hybrid forecasting models combining the GARCH and HAR family models with the machine learning methods, Support Vector Regression(SVR), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformer. We construct hybrid models using the outputs of the GARCH and HAR family models. In the empirical application, we demonstrate improvements of the hybrid models for one-day ahead realized volatility forecast accuracy. The results show that the hybrid LSTM and Transformer based models provide more accurate forecasts than the other models.	
	In the financial markets, it is well accepted that the volatilities are time-varying correlated across the indices. We construct two portfolios, the Index portfolio and the Forex portfolio. The Index portfolio contains three major stock indices, and the Forex portfolio includes three major exchange rates. We model the conditional covariances of the two portfolios with BEKK, DCC-GARCH, and Vector HAR. The hybrid models combine the estimations of traditional multivariate models and the machine learning framework. Results of the study indicate that for one-day ahead volatility matrix forecasting, these hybrid models can achieve better performance than the traditional models for the two portfolios.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Through supervision, students develop the necessary skills to effectively and ethically provide sport psychology services to clients. Supervision serves two equally important purposes: to progress supervisees’ professional development and to ensure client welfare (Bernard &amp; Goodyear, 2014; Van Raalte &amp; Anderson, 2000). The training of competent consultants starts with competent trainers, or supervisors. This dissertation study contributes to the understudied area of supervision training for ASP graduate students in the United States. The research questions and association hypotheses seek to provide information regarding the availability, utilization, nature, and quantity of supervision training for students in applied sport psychology graduate programs in the United States and to investigate how students’ utilization of supervision training impacts their evaluation of their supervision skills, and the frequency of use and desire to learn those skills. This was accomplished using a cross-sectional, survey-based research design with graduate sport psychology students as the participants in addition to a comprehensive search of graduate sport psychology program accessible published online materials. Participants reported that sources of supervision training were more available and more utilized than was expected. Participants with peer mentoring experience reported on those experiences and revealed a number of elements including number of semesters in the role, number of mentees, time spent in certain supervision tasks, and the percentage of individual versus group mentorship provided. This helps to provide a picture of students’ peer mentoring experiences unreported until now. Results additionally revealed that students’ evaluation of supervision skills and desire to learn supervision skills was generally not significantly predicted by the amount and source of supervision training experiences acquired, but the amount and source of those experiences did significantly predict students’ overall evaluation of supervisoryix
effectiveness and frequency of use of skills. There are important applied implications at a number of levels including for students, graduate sport psychology programs and those associated with them, and governing bodies such as the Association for Applied Sport Psychology. Study limitations and future research directions are also provided.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this dissertation, I am chiefly interested in the educational experiences of black collegiate athletes. Throughout the project I build upon previous research investigating the macro-, meso-, and micro-level challenges of United States society that influence the educational opportunities of black collegiate athletes. Specifically, this dissertation aims to interrogate the social, political, cultural, and economic relations within United States society from the period of enslavement up to the contemporary era of exploitation that influences the lived experiences of black bodies and the educational experiences of black collegiate athletes. In the literature review, I work through the intercollegiate sport marketplace and “collegiate sport model” as they developed during the political economic rise of neoliberalism. From there, I give more detail on how the neoliberal logics of collegiate sport complicate the NCAA’s mission of providing a quality education for “student-athletes” and the adverse effect this particularly has on black collegiate athletes. After I bring attention to the historical and contemporary challenges for black athletes, I go on to connect these experiences to broader social, political, and economic institutional issues within the US education system and medical field. To better make sense of how these institutions in United States society, since slavery, have discursively, and materially, constructed the framework from which black athletes derive their subjectivities and educational experiences, in the latter portion of the literature review I use a biopolitical analysis to illustrate the collegiate sport dispositif. In addition to bringing in this biopolitical theoretical approach, in Chapter 3 I explain how I added another component to this line of literature through interviewing black collegiate athletes and having them complete a concept map. Unlike many previous studies, that only utilized interviews, in this study I have 15 black collegiate athletes diagram their experiences through a concept map that allowed me to analyze the interview conversations in addition to the participants’ visual representation. Using this empirical material, I analyzed the position of black collegiate athletes within wider social structures and biopolitical institutions that condition their lived experiences, make them subject, and construct the framework from which they derive their educational experiences. In Chapter 4, I amplify the voices of these 15 black collegiate athletes to articulate their educational experiences as they are positioned within the collegiate sport dispositif. Finally, in Chapter 5, I discuss how the collegiate sport dispositif works to make black collegiate athletes subjects and frame their existence in a way that binds their lives to the exigencies of revenue generation for the collegiate sport marketplace, which leaves them as dehumanized commodities in detrimental educational situations. Lastly, I further discuss how this is intensified in the NIL era and the implications for the future. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Many museums have been critically characterized as elitist institutions that offer few inclusive services to meet the needs and interests of marginalized populations and communities (Hill, 2016; Sandell &amp; Nightingale, 2013). Some museums, however, are turning to visitor-centered approaches that refocus their efforts to concentrate on the needs and interests of visitors instead of the objects on display (Love &amp; Boda, 2017; Weil, 1999). One population often overlooked by museums—adult visitors with developmental disabilities—served as the primary participant group for this qualitative bricolage case study along with their parents or caregivers and museum staff members. Using disability studies as a guiding framework, participants collaborated with the researcher and museum staff members to document their museum experiences through inclusive art-making, interviews, discussions, and observations. The purpose of this research was to explore how such collaborations might create more inclusive and visitor-centered museum experiences for these visitors. Findings were used to make recommendations for future programing and consisted of several themes developed during the coding process. The themes included understanding, accessibility, interactive, collaboration, communication, and evaluation. </DISS_para>

Una población a menudo ignorada por los museos, los visitantes adultos con discapacidades del desarrollo, sirvió como el principal grupo de participantes para este estudio de caso de bricolaje cualitativo junto con sus padres o cuidadores y miembros del personal del museo. Utilizando los estudios de discapacidad como marco de referencia, los participantes colaboraron con el investigador y los miembros del personal del museo para documentar sus experiencias en el museo a través de la creación artística inclusiva, entrevistas, debates y observaciones. El propósito de esta investigación fue explorar cómo tales colaboraciones podrían crear experiencias de museo más inclusivas y centradas en el visitante para estos visitantes. Los hallazgos se usaron para hacer recomendaciones para la programación futura y consistieron en varios temas desarrollados durante el proceso de codificación. Los temas incluyeron comprensión, accesibilidad, interacción, colaboración, comunicación y evaluación.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Over the past 30 years, magnetic resonance imaging has become a ubiquitous tool for accurately visualizing the change and development of the brain subcortical structures (e.g., hippocampus) across time and group. Although subcortical structures act as information hubs of the nervous system, their quantification is still in its infancy due to challenges in shape extraction, representation, and modeling. Here, we propose a predictive modeling involving brain morphological features and other covariates, which is of paramount interest in such heterogeneous mental disorders as PTSD. We develop a comprehensive shape analysis framework to quantify the shape differences among brain sub-structures surfaces using an elastic shape metric. Under this metric, we compute shape summaries of brain sub-structures and represent individual brain shapes by their principal scores under a shape-PCA basis. Subsequently, we use these PCs, the auxiliary exposure variables, and their interactions for regression modeling and prediction. We apply our method to data from the Grady Trauma Project (GTP) and yield superior predictive performance when modeling PTSD outcomes. Besides, we develop a simple and efficient framework of longitudinal elastic shape analysis (LESA) of subcortical structures. Integrating ideas from elastic shape analysis of static surfaces and statistical modeling of sparse longitudinal data, LESA provides a set of tools for systematically quantifying changes of longitudinal subcortical surface shapes from raw structure MRI data. The key novelties of LESA include: (i) it can efficiently represent complex subcortical structures using a small number of basis functions, and (ii) it can accurately predict the spatial-temporal shape changes of the human subcortical structures. We apply LESA to analyze three longitudinal neuroimaging datasets and showcase its wide applications in estimating continuous shape trajectories, building life-span growth patterns, and comparing shape differences among different groups. In addition, we propose a novel spatial-temporal registration and shape analysis framework of 3D surfaces that are sparse in time.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The mission of the CMS experiment at the LHC is to investigate and discover unknown physics in proton-proton collision events. This thesis presents a search for new physics in final states containing a photon and missing transverse momentum in proton–proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV, using the data collected in Run II (2016, 2017 and 2018) by the CMS experiment at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 137 $\text{fb}^{-1}$. The standard model (SM) background in monophoton events can be a problem for sensitivity to new physics. The sensitivity to new physics scenarios can potentially be enhanced by other event properties. A new strategy that can potentially enhance the new physics sensitivity is the track multiplicity from the small mass splitting supersymmetry (SUSY). SUSY with small mass splittings indicates the masses difference between the SUSY particles is small ($\tilde{q}, squark \approx \tilde{\chi}$, dark matter particle).  The track multiplicity in monophoton dataset with different bins of track $p_T$ will be studied, and compared with expectation.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>As the source of one of the largest revenue streams for professional sport franchises, the viewership of sport broadcasts has plummeted in recent years (Bode, 2018). This declining trend has been further exacerbated by the global COVID-19 pandemic (Crupi, 2021). According to Deloitte’s Fan Engagement survey, the average fan satisfaction across sports broadcast programs was only 39 percent (Deloitte, 2019),Research has been devoted to investigating the determinants of sport viewer satisfaction, including various audio and visual conditions of sport broadcasts. However, these works assume that media design effects are equally effective among all viewers and fail to account for potential heterogeneities in people’s psychological connection to the mediated sport. To address this gap, the Psychological Continuum Model (PCM; Funk &amp; James, 2001; 2006) was introduced as the theoretical foundation for understanding the formation of viewer satisfaction with a focal sport (e.g., college football).
The current dissertation examines whether and how the strength of psychological connection to college football overrides the effects of varying audiovisual presentations on viewer satisfaction with a televised college football game. A 2 (presence of commentary: With commentary vs. Without commentary) × 2 (presence of audience: High vs. Low) between-subjects online experiment was administered via Prolific (n = 338). The relationship between psychological connection and viewer satisfaction and the moderation effects of the two selected audiovisual conditions were tested using the ANCOVA.
Results showed a significant positive association between psychological connection to college football and viewer satisfaction. However, the manipulated audiovisual conditions did not moderate the aforementioned relationship between psychological connection and viewer satisfaction. The presence of audience had a significant positive effect on viewer satisfaction. In contrast, the presence of commentary exerted no significant effect on viewer satisfaction regardless of people’s PCM staging.
The findings provide empirical evidence to support the seminal PCM framework that the strength of an individual’s psychological connection to the focal sport object was a more deterministic factor that drives the sport media consumption experience than the audiovisual media presentation. For those interested in watching but have not yet formed a strong attitude towards the broadcasted sport object, the viewing experience can be optimized by maximizing the visual presence of a live audience. The null effect of commentary presence and sonic ambiance on viewer satisfaction reinforces the proposition that what is seen might be more influential than what is heard in sport media consumption (Cummins et al., 2019).
