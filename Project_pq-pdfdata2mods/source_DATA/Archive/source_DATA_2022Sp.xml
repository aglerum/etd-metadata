         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>When aerial performance became popular in the 20th century, critics reported the confusing gender appearance of its performers. Muscular women were described as mannish and Amazonian while men were observed to be graceful and feminine. I argue that aerial performance is an art form that allows gender to be reconstituted due to its unnatural and seemingly impossible stunts of flight and flexibility. Chapter Two details accounts of 20th century descriptions of aerial performance which reveal a constructed and unachievable version of femininity created to minimize women’s influence in the worlds of circus and normal society.  Chapter Three reviews literature of phenomenology and queer studies, relying heavily on the foundations by Merleau-Ponty, to theorize the audiences experience of intersubjectivity with aerial performers. The real presence of danger is kinesthetically transmitted to spectators which asks them to ponder questions of identity, mortality, and alternative movement in the world.  Chapter Four provides examples of New Circus which demonstrate how modern artists capitalize on these unique visceral effects that aerial performance has on audience members to incite social change with their experimental work.  New Circus asks audience members to find joy in discomfort as an entrance into the queer paradigm. It offers the potentiality and reiteration of bodies in space to suggest new modes of being, identity, and desire. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation defamiliarizes early “evangelicalism” as a sturdy set of culturally siloed theological convictions. Historians of the so-called “Great Awakening” or “Evangelical Revival” have often distinguished awakeners by belief. Following David Bebbington’s decades-old “evangelical quadrilateral,” scores of scholars have characterized the movement through participants’ ideas about the Bible, Jesus’s crucifixion, personal conversion, and missionary activity. In most instances, foregrounding theology has privileged the polished perspective of well-educated clergymen who coordinated epistolary networks, determined publication strategies, and, if needed, redacted laypersons’ testimonies. While theology is necessary to understanding this movement, we must acknowledge how early evangelical ministers and laypeople understood their world—including their faith—through natural landscapes, bodily gestures, voices, and buildings. This dissertation pursues an analysis of early evangelicalism that grounds the movement in lived experience, displaying how participants’ yearning for “new birth” prompted their creation of an entirely new religious sensorium.By rooting my project in the spatial, sonic, and corporeal traits of “this new Religion,” as one English contemporary put it, I join recent historiography interested in the various ways “evangelicalism” has delimited and mobilized various social communities. By examining their “hellish Shouts,” “Destortions &amp; Convulsions,” and worship in “obscure places,” I argue that everyday awakeners in colonial America, England, Scotland, and Wales eschewed the material cornerstones of British whiteness and relocated Protestant experience to spaces and soundways long understood as Indian, black, and uncivilized. By temporarily stripping British Atlantic Protestantism of its spatial, sonic, and bodily scaffolding, I contend that first- and second-generation evangelicals “democratized” Christian experience long before the rise of political populism in late-eighteenth-century America.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Prescribed fires and wildfires are widespread sources of air pollutants. Prescribed fires, which are used for agriculture, fire hazard reduction, and land clearing, last only several hours and their locations change from one day to the next. Current air quality forecast models do not account for this daily variability in emissions. This work develops a new method for statistically forecasting the locations of prescribed fires several days in advance, which can be integrated into dynamical air quality models. Our prescribed fire forecast employs a machine learning algorithm with gradient-boosted decision trees (XGBoost). The forecast model is trained on a new dataset of prescribed fires in the southeastern United States, which excludes known wildfires from satellite fire detections. The model is separately trained for each calendar month using predictors that include meteorology, land use, and land cover. Bootstrapping is used to assess model uncertainty. The model is tested on independent data, from which we evaluate forecast performance and skill relative to traditional forecasting techniques like persistence. Our model produces dramatically better forecasts of prescribed fires in the southeastern US than current methods, particularly during spring when most prescribed fires occur. During peak prescribed fire activity in March, our fire forecasts have 45% greater prediction skill (Brier skill score) than one-day persistence forecasting and 60-62% greater skill than two-day and three-day persistence. Over the entire year, XGBoost outperforms climatology in eight out of twelve months and outperforms one-day persistence forecasting in eleven out of twelve months. Compared to two-day and three-day persistence forecasts, XGBoost outperforms in all months. These results are statistically significant at a 95% confidence level. We use multiple methods (partial dependence and feature importance) to identify the major predictor variables that influence the forecast and we find results consistent with weather conditions that prescribed burners are known to consider (e.g. relative humidity, wind speed). Lastly, we also consider the potential climate impacts on prescribed fires, using data from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP 6) for our analysis. Output from XGBoost suggests considerable regional and seasonal variability in the future prescribed fire landscape, although there is some model agreement in terms of which seasons could see increases/decreases in prescribed burning. Integrating this prescribed fire emissions forecast into dynamical air quality models has the potential to improve air pollution forecast guidance for the public and decisionmakers. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>EExtreme heat events impact a wide range of health consequences (McMichael, Woodruff, and Hales 2006; Hondula, Balling, et al. 2015). The United States Center for Disease Control (CDC) defined the most at-risk groups to be: older adults, infants and children, people with chronic conditions and/or take medications that influence thermoregulation, low income, people with high heat exposure (athletes, outdoor workers). The definition of the vulnerable group expanded to include pregnant women, people with inadequate cooling systems, people who have or recovered from COVID-19 (Global Heat Health Information Network 2022). These vulnerable groups are exposed to extreme heat in both indoor and outdoor environments (Bock et al. 2021; K. L. Ebi et al. 2021; Eisenman et al. 2016). Therefore, it is important to establish extreme heat intervention measures for both environments. The primary goal of this dissertation is to integrate novel data streams to implement extreme heat intervention measures more efficiently. To achieve the goal, Chapter 2 evaluated a modified WBGT hindcast using the historical National Digital Forecast Database (hourly air temperature, dew point temperature, wind speed) and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis v5 (hourly solar radiation and wind speed). We verified the hindcasts with hourly WBGT estimated from ground-based weather observations. After controlling for geographic attributes and temporal trends, the average difference between the hindcast and in situ data varied from -0.64 °C to 1.46°C for different Köppen-Geiger climate regions reliable for decision making. However, the results showed statistically significant variances according to geographical features such as aspect, coastal proximity, land use, topographic position index, and Köppen-Geiger climate categories. The largest absolute difference was observed in the arid desert climates (1.46: 95% CI: 1.45,1.47), including some parts of Nevada, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico. This research investigates geographic factors associated with systematic WBGT differences and points toward ways future forecasts may be statistically adjusted to improve accuracy. 
Chapter 3 investigated the relationship between WBGT and shared city bicycle activity in New York City (NYC) and San Francisco (SF), US. Generalized Additive Models examined nonlinear relationships between WBGT and bicycle activity while controlling for rider demographics and temporal trends. Next, bootstrapping estimated the "peak point," when the relationship between the bike rentals and WBGT notably changed. The analysis also examined whether the heat warning messages affected cycling activities. We found that the number of rented bikes declined at different peak points in each city. The peak point was 27.4°C (95% CI, 25.0°C -29.9°C) in NYC and 23.2°C (95% CI 22.3-24.0°C) in SF. Somewhat paradoxically, bike rentals increased when heat warnings were issued in both cities.
Chapter 4 leveraged property databases and identified Air conditioning (AC) ownership in Florida, US. This study examined census tracts with the highest/lowest air conditioning saturation applying Morans'I and Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA). Moran's I result showed significant spatial autocorrelation of AC ownership. Clusters of significantly high and low values (p &lt; 0.05) of AC ownership were found across Florida. High-high clusters of AC ownership were found in the northern and eastern coastal Florida counties, with large metropolitan areas such as 39% in Duval County (Jacksonville), 20% in Sarasota County (Sarasota), 13% in Broward County (Fort Lauderdale), and 12% in Volusia County (Daytona Beach). Counties with clusters of no AC census tracts were located in the interior of Florida. We closely looked at AC prevalence clusters in Duval County, which contains the city of Jacksonville. High-value clusters of households without AC were found in the urban core, which has the most significant portion of poverty, poor housing conditions, and low education levels. Moreover, this study investigated the relationship between AC ownership and sociodemographic characteristics with a Spatial Durbin Model. We found a significant association between AC ownership and socioeconomic and urbanicity (urban and rural) variables. Among the socioeconomic variables: % Black/African American and % of historic Black/African Americans showed a significant positive relationship with the percentage of households without an AC. Our results can be used to identify neighborhoods that are in great need of AC and target heat prevention measures.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) is a powerful tool for the study of chemical structure and dynamics. The interactions that manifest in NMR spectra are anisotropic (i.e., orientation dependent) in origin, often resulting in inhomogeneous broadening that can yield spectra exceeding ca. 250 kHz in breadth; such spectra are often referred to as ultra-wideline (UW) NMR spectra. In many cases, UWNMR spectra cannot be acquired using conventional methods and rectangular radiofrequency (RF) pulses – rather, specialized pulses and techniques must be implemented. Furthermore, the large suite of high-resolution methods based on magic-angle spinning (MAS) are generally unsuitable for the acquisition of UWNMR spectra. Frequency-swept (FS) pulses are amplitude- and phase-modulated pulses that can irradiate NMR frequencies over large bandwidths. One of these is the wideband uniform-rate smooth-truncation (WURST) pulse, which features a linear effective frequency sweep. WURST pulses are used in the WURST-Carr-Purcell/Meiboom-Gill (WURST-CPMG) and broadband adiabatic inversion-cross polarization (BRAIN-CP) pulse sequences, which have been shown to be effective for the acquisition of UWNMR spectra of stationary (static) samples. These sequences have limitations, and to date, their capabilities have not been fully explored, nor have they been described from a theoretical point of view in a comprehensive manner.Signal processing is an integral component of pulsed-Fourier transform NMR spectroscopy, and comprises many protocols for enhancing spectral sensitivity and resolution. There has been much interest in advanced spectral processing methods such as alternate basis transformations (i.e., besides Fourier encoding), statistical analyses (e.g., singular value decomposition, SVD, and principal component analysis, PCA), numerical regression (e.g., non-negative least squares), and the use of deep learning and neural networks. Such methodologies are now routinely implemented in imaging and multidimensional solution NMR, but are seldom explored in SSNMR.
This thesis describes the development of new methods for the acquisition and advanced processing of conventional, wideline, and UW SSNMR spectra, including: (i) the design of new pulses and pulse sequences with optimal control theory (OCT); (ii) the modification of existing pulse sequences for UWNMR under MAS conditions; (iii) achieving signal enhancements with CPMG pulse sequences via the suppression of weak homonuclear dipolar coupling interactions under static and MAS conditions; (iv) the application of the BRAIN-CP pulse sequence to integer-spin nuclei, along with a thorough theoretical treatment; (v) rapid and robust measurements of longitudinal relaxation time constants (T1) and T1 anisotropies from UWNMR spectra under static conditions; (vi) the development and application of advanced processing methods for resolving UWNMR relaxation data with inverse Laplace transforms; and (vii) the development of a Python library for denoising 1D and 2D NMR spectra with SVD, PCA, and wavelet transforms. It is hoped that these methods will open up the Periodic Table of elements to increasingly routine exploration by SSNMR spectroscopy, aiding researchers in chemistry, biochemistry, materials science, and physics with advanced molecular-level characterization of their materials.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This treatise, which is in two parts, is based on two lecture recitals given on November 15, 2020 and November 21, 2021. The first lecture discussed the influence of past composers on two recent works by Cheryl Frances-Hoad and Caroline Shaw. The second lecture discussed the relationship between musical techniques and religious symbolism in Olivier Messiaen’s Vingt Regards sur l’Enfant-Jésus.Part 1 explores two works that reference past composers: Cheryl Frances-Hoad’s Homages, Book I, and Caroline Shaw’s Gustave Le Gray. The homage to a past composer is not a particularly new concept, but these types of pieces have certainly become more popular in recent years. The two composers discussed in Part One have different approaches to the concept, however, which leads to a different overall affect in each piece. Frances-Hoad chooses to write a series of smaller pieces that take small melodic or motivic elements from specific works to build upon. Shaw, on the other hand, quotes the entire referenced work and composes a frame around it. I will analyze each work to illuminate how these two composers reference the chosen composers and/or works, as well as point out some elements that bring a fresh perspective on those past composers.
Part 2 explores how Messiaen expresses his religious beliefs in Vingt Regards sur l’Enfant-Jésus through musical symbols. Messiaen’s devout faith informs nearly every piece that he wrote, and his complex musical techniques often directly reflect his theological beliefs. This paper will discuss some of those techniques, including the so-called “Charm of Impossibilities,” and how they relate to his fascination with concepts such as time and eternity and with visual elements of color and stained glass. Discussion of five selections from Vingt Regards will show how religious ideas and metaphorical concepts are expressed through musical symbols.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Over the years, scholars and practitioners have discussed how U. S. symphony orchestras are an unsustainable business model due to their financial and audience decline. Though orchestras are continuously improving their artistic quality, many continue to struggle administratively. Additionally, much of the extant research on U. S. symphony orchestras focuses on large or mid-size budget orchestras with no research or publications focused on small budget orchestras, despite small budget orchestras making up 67% of all orchestras in the U. S. This dissertation therefore explores how small budget symphony orchestras in the U. S. define success using a constructivist grounded theory methodology.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Participants in this study included executive directors, music directors, middle managers, and musicians of small budget symphony orchestras in the U. S. The study included 28 small budget orchestras from various regions of the U. S. including the Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, Pacific Northwest, and Southwest. Since constructivist grounded theory aims to co-construct theory with participants without using any prior framework or philosophy, the resulting framework to describe success for small budget symphony orchestras in the U. S. includes ten main factors: (1) money, (2) public awareness, (3) having a connection to the community, (4) growing attendance for concerts and events, (5) staff, (6) having a high-quality artistic product, (7) strategic programming, (8) flexibility, (9) resiliency, and (10) a strong and active board of directors. Success was also defined not necessarily as an endpoint of achievement but a continuous cycle of growth. Though some of the findings are similar to prior research on large or mid-size budget orchestras in the U. S., the findings of this study determine that there are indeed different factors that contribute to success for small budget orchestras in the U. S. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to explore teenagers’ use of affinity spaces on social media platforms for self-directed informal learning. This research also examined teenagers’ perceptions of the advantages of social media for informal learning and the tensions they encounter while using these platforms for informal learning. This study implemented a naturalistic multiple case study design to explore this phenomenon. Using purposeful sampling, participants were selected after completing a recruitment survey. One of the primary inclusion criteria was that the participants engaged in self-directed informal learning using social media platforms. Nine teenagers between the ages of thirteen and eighteen completed two semi-structured interviews and submitted ten-to-fourteen days of audio diaries (and optional informal learning artifacts) to capture their use of social media for informal learning. After data were transcribed, cleaned, and anonymized, they were analyzed using both inductive and deductive thematic analysis. Activity Systems Analysis served as the analytic framework to guide the deductive thematic analysis. NVivo was also used to organize data for analysis.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Among this sample of teenagers, the primary self-directed informal learning objectives using social media were to support gaming, hobbies and interests, and school curriculum and electives. While many participants used multiple social media platforms to support their informal learning needs, YouTube was the only social media platform that was common across the participants. Throughout their participation in the study, the teenagers indicated other informal learning instances using social media. These instances of informal included self-directed, incidental, and socialization informal learning. The advantages of social media for informal learning, as perceived by the teenage participants, included convenience, access to information, media format, and comfort within the space. Some of the tensions they experienced were similar thematically to the advantages. These tensions included access to the space, media format, comfort in the space, negative experiences, and misinformation and fake news. Overall, the teenage participants primarily discussed the advantages of social media when prompted during their interviews, indicating that they may not fully comprehend the value of these platforms beyond entertainment and socialization. Similarly, the teenagers more frequently reported tensions when prompted during their interviews. While much of the empirical literature about teenagers and social media substantiates their negative experiences and behaviors on these platforms, this finding suggests that tensions are more likely infrequent for teenagers. These findings contribute to the literature about teenagers’ social media use, particularly for productive purposes. Further implications of the findings are discussed, as well as study limitations and directions for future research.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Although the education system is beginning to recognize the impact of personal and social contextual factors by incorporating Social and Emotional Learning (SEL), it often neglects the sociocultural contextual factors which are vital to the development of students from marginalized groups. The current training practices of preservice teachers incorporate little support in working with marginalized groups, who have greater risks to their development and longitudinal outcomes. As a result, additional competencies focusing on sociocultural context and transformative SEL (TSEL), which focuses on equity and social justice, must be incorporated into preservice training. The purpose of this dissertation was to justify the development of a socioculturally transformative intervention series for preservice teachers, develop the first intervention within the series, implement the intervention, and analyze its’ effectiveness and feasibility. A mixed methods randomized control trial was utilized to quantitatively measure the impact of the “InvEstEd” intervention, while concurrently qualitatively describing the specific considerations of the participants as they engaged with the intervention. In addition, this study aimed to determine whether differences emerged between participants regarding their intervention uptake. Lastly, the purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility and acceptability of “InvEstEd” as an intervention for preservice teachers. Receiving “InvEstEd” was found to increase preservice teachers’ socioemotional consciousness, but not their sociocultural competence. The present study results offer insight into the further implementation of the “InvEstEd” intervention, the development of the more extensive intervention series, and the broader context of transformative interventions impacting socioemotional and sociocultural considerations within the education system.  </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Chapter One examines the impact of a chief executive officer (CEO) winning an employee opinion award on firm value.  Leveraging close employee vote shares in a regression discontinuity specification from Glassdoor's "Top CEOs Employees' Choice" award list suggest a causal link of the relationship.  Narrowly winning an employees' choice CEO award results in an increase in firm value.  An increase in firm efficiency is the likely economic channel that influences an increase in firm value.  The findings imply that CEO and employee relationships are an important intangible good. Chapter Two uses a difference-in-differences model around Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) discrimination announcements and Glassdoor.com employee reviews to suggest a negative causal link between discrimination publicity and employee morale.  An EEOC discrimination announcement results in a 9.08% and 3.90% decrease for employee approval of a CEO and firm, respectively.  The effect clusters in firms headquartered in the southern U.S. and that are in service orientated industries suggesting taste-based discrimination.  These announcements do not impact stock returns, sales, or CEO turnover but lead to human capital risk, workforce reductions, and decreases in Tobin's Q implying a discrimination, instead of litigation, effect. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The King of Ketamine is a thesis made up of 41 poems, through which I explore such themes as the prison system, child neglect, alcoholism, body positivity, death, love, and an array of other emotions. There are three sections contained there within. In the first section, titled “The King of Ketamine,” we see a complicated family start to come to life, from the introduction of the titular character, the father, to a sibling, to a grandmother and a grandfather. Through all these poems, the reader is presented with an image of the speaker’s relationship to his family, as well as his surroundings. This section paints a picture of a dysfunctional, often manic, up-bringing. The second section “Anger Mon, Amour,” turns away from the family as a whole, with only the grandfather appearing in select poems, and instead deals with the emotional turmoil created by the relationships explored in the previous section. It presents the reader with anger, fear, hate, and grief. All of these emotions reach their climax within the final three poems of the section. These poems bring to life the grief of losing friends and attempt to leave behind a possible fate escaped by the speaker. “Good Pens and Burnt Pizza,” reflects on a coworker sent away to prison, echoing the King of Ketamine’s journey in the first section. “We Drank Too Much,” presents the reader with the death of a friend, who represents much of the emotional anguish explored in the preceding poems. And finally, “I Smoke a Russian Cigarette,” brings to life another coworker named Pavel, whose untimely death resounds with a sentiment that a good death is never promised. These poems serve as a form of closure to the first half of the manuscript, leading into a change within the speaker.
In the third section, “If The Wolf Comes Let It Kill Me,” the speaker begins to turn away from his past, from the emotional turmoil that weights heavy on the poems that come before, and instead attempts to embrace a change within himself. The titular poem for this section is no better representation of this, bringing in all of the difficulty from this previous life, and instead embracing companionship. In this section readers are greeted not only by a plethora of love poems, but also by many figures from pop culture, from artists like Frida Kahlo, to poets such as Walt Whitman and Tommy Pico, and even Nate ‘King Cole’ and Otis Redding. The poems within this section look outwards, no longer needing to focus so heavily on personal history or emotional trauma, they show  a shift towards an embrace the world around the speaker, completely departing from what has come before.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Light-matter interactions have not only enhanced our fundamental understanding of the universe but also plays a significant role in the advancement of technology. Scientific research in this area has led to breakthroughs in materials applications from photomechanics to photocatalysis, and the world’s need for new forms of energy production through renewables has brought about exciting new advances in the field of solar energy conversion (SEC). While current SEC technologies have made significant strides over the years they are limited by the cost of production and their inability to harness the full spectrum of the sun efficiently.Incorporating photon upconversion, via triplet−triplet annihilation (TTA-UC), directly into a solar cell is an intriguing strategy for harnessing sub-band gap photons and surpassing the Shockley-Queisser limit. A majority of TTA-UC solar cells commonly use difficult to synthesize and costly platinum and/or palladium porphyrin molecules as sensitizers. Chapter 3 presents a TTA-UC solar cell that incorporates quantum dot sensitizers directly into the photocurrent generation mechanism. The photoanodes are composed of a nanocrystalline TiO2 substrate, phosphonated diphenylanthracene (A) annihilator molecules, and CdSe QDs (QD) as the sensitizer in an inorganic-organic-inorganic layered architecture (TiO2-A-QD). The device assembly, performance, energy and electron dynamics, and dependence on the QD size is examined. Collectively, the results demonstrate that multilayer assemblies containing QD sensitizers is an effective strategy to harness UC in a TTA-UC solar cell.
However, all integrated TTA-UC solar cells to date only harness visible light. In chapter 4, we incorporate an osmium polypyridal complex (Os) as the triplet sensitizer in a metal ion linked multilayer photoanode that is capable of harnessing NIR light via S0 to T1* excitation, triple energy transfer to a phosphonated bis(9,10-diphenylethynyl)anthracene annihilator (A2), TTA-UC, and electron injection into TiO2 from the upconverted state. The device assembly, performance, energy and electron dynamics are examined. Together, the results serve as a proof-of-concept that NIR photons can be harnessed via an integrated TTA-UC solar cell.
Chapter 5 looks at another intriguing materials application of light-matter interactions in photoresponsive polymers. To date, nearly all photomechanical polymers utilize the azobenzene moiety whose direct excitation and trans-cis-trans isomerization induces a bulk mechanical response under UV/visible light. Due to its higher isomerization barrier, stilbene, the carbon based analogue of azobenzene, has the potential to produce a stronger mechanical response but has remained unused in photomechanics likely due to its hypsochromically shifted absorption that requires higher energy and damaging UV light to elicit a response. This chapter utilizes triplet excited state sensitization as a new mechanism to harness light in a stilbene based photopolymer. More specifically, iridium(III)bis[2-(4,6-difluorophenyl)pyridinato-C2,N](picolinato) (FIrPic) is incorporated as a triplet sensitizing dopant into a stilbene-based polyimide polymer film. Spectroscopic measurements support a stepwise mechanism involving 1) excitation of the sensitizers, 2) triplet energy transfer from the sensitizer to the stilbene moieties, 3) trans-cis-trans isomerization of stilbene, and 4) reorientation of stilbene within the polymer that results in a bulk response from the film. These results not only open the door to the use of stilbene-based photopolymers but also triplet sensitization as a new, low energy light harvesting mechanism in photomechanical polymers. 
The work presented in this dissertation looks to utilize triplet sensitization as a means of converting light to electrical and mechanical energy in TTA-UC solar cells and photomechanical polymers, respectively.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death, with age being the strongest predictor of cardiovascular health. Age-related changes to the vasculature such as endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffening are believed to be two of the major phenotype changes associated with this increased CVD risk. Increased oxidative stress and inflammation are major contributors to endothelial dysfunction, arterial stiffening, and other age-related poor health outcomes such as decreased functional performance and poorer sleep quality. Almonds are rich in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory nutrients that may combat age-related health decline, but more research is needed to better understand the potential benefits. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of almond consumption on vascular health, physical function, and sleep in active adults who were overweight and obese. Methods: Ten (females = 5) active, older adults (57 ± 4 years) who were overweight or obese (body mass index (BMI): 27.6 ± 2.6 kg/m2) were included in this randomized, cross-over study. Participants consumed almonds (64 g/day; 384 kcal) or an isocaloric control snack (84 g/day of granola bars; 380 kcal) for 12 weeks, separated by a 4-week washout. Vascular health was assessed through flow mediated dilation (FMD) to determine endothelial function, pulse-wave velocity (PWV) and pulse wave analysis (PWA) to determine arterial stiffness, and blood draws to determine a circulating oxidative stress biomarker (total antioxidant capacity (TAC)). Functional performance was assessed by the Continuous Scale Physical Functional Performance 10 item scale (CS-PFP-10) test and a treadmill submaximal oxygen consumption (VO2) test. Sleep was determined objectively through ActiGraph accelerometry and subjectively through the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). A two-way (treatment x time) repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to assess the effects of intervention (almond, control) and time (baseline, post) on outcomes. Significance was accepted at p &lt; 0.05. Results: Self-reported compliance was not significantly different between treatments (93% for the almond regimen and 96% for the isocaloric control snack regimen). There were no significant differences between baseline measurements for any of the variables, indicating the washout period was sufficient. There was a significant treatment x time interaction on FMD%, F(1,9) = 13.69, p = 0.005, η2 = 0.603, with FMD% being greater after the almond regimen compared to control (almond: 9.05 ± 2.87 %; control: 6.61 ± 2.04 %, F(1,9) = 7.960, p = 0.020, η2 = 0.469), with a mean difference of 2.445%. However, there were no significant treatment x time interactions found in normalized FMD% or any other vascular health measurements, including the biomarker for oxidative stress (TAC). Additionally, there were no significant treatment x time interaction on functional performance assessments. There was a significant treatment x time interaction on sleep efficiency, F(1,7) = 8.231, p = 0.024, η2 = 0.540  with  sleep efficiency being greater after the almond regimen compared to the control (almond: 92 ± 2 %; control: 88 ± 6 %, F(1,7) = 5.784, p = 0.047, η2 = 0.452), with a mean difference of 4%.  There was also a significant treatment x time interaction on wake after sleep onset (WASO), F(1,7) = 7.325, p = 0.030, η2 = 0.511 with WASO being greater after the almond regimen compared to the control (almond: 37 ± 13 minutes; control: 56 ± 32 minutes F(1,7) = 4.707,  p = 0.067, η2 = 0.402) with a mean difference of 19 minutes. However, there were no significant treatment x time interaction found in any other sleep measurements. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that 12 weeks of almond consumption may benefit some aspects of vascular health and sleep but may not benefit functional performance, in comparison to an isocaloric control snack. While there are endless snack options, almonds may be a good snack alternative for people who want to improve their vascular health and sleep better. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Climate change is dramatically altering the global carbon cycle. The warming caused by climate change is approximately twice the global average in Arctic and contiguous northern high-latitude regions, which are thus especially susceptible to ecosystem shifts (e.g. permafrost thaw, wetland drying/wetting cycle exacerbation). Rivers process and transport organic matter (OM) from land where warming is destabilizing previously stabilized carbon stocks to the ocean. This dissertation examines how fluvial OM in northern high latitudes responds to climate change, and how the fate of such OM may influence the global carbon cycle. Specifically, it focuses on how the source and processing of dissolved and particulate organic matter (DOM and POM) interact to dictate OM fate. To do so, Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, carbon isotopes (Δ14C, δ13C), and data on OM concentrations and carbon to nitrogen (C:N) ratios are used. Across the pan-Arctic (Chapters 2 and 3) and northeast Pacific coastal temperate rainforest (NPCTR; Chapters 4 and 5), sources appear to influence the fate of DOM (Chapters 2, 4, and 5) and POM (Chapter 3). Both landscape-scale factors like permafrost or agricultural extent (Chapters 2 and 3) and watershed slope and wetland extent (Chapters 3, 4, and 5), as well as specific source types like tree canopy or bark and soil layer (Chapters 4 and 5) impact OM molecular, isotopic, and elemental compositions and thus processing. Further, seasonality varies between the pan-Arctic watershed (Chapters 2 and 3) and the NPCTR (Chapters 4 and 5), leading to differential timing of the strongest terrestrial carbon source impacts on the system.In large pan-Arctic rivers, spring freshet contains DOM primarily sourced from terrestrial material but also includes a latent high-energy subsidy that explains the historical paradox of freshet DOM’s bulk terrestrial composition but apparent high biolability. Winter riverine DOM is mostly sourced from old, microbially degraded groundwater DOM. This work uncovered a stable core Arctic riverine fingerprint (CARF) present in all samples from six years. The CARF may contribute to a carbon sink of aged DOM that appears to persist in the global ocean. Further, this dissertation uses a decade of compositional data on POM to untangle multiple allochthonous and autochthonous pan-Arctic and watershed-specific POM endmembers sourced from literature (for the full list of literature values used in endmembers, see supplementary file “Table B5.csv”). The three tracers used (C:N ratio, δ13C, and Δ14C) appear to reveal a substantial, previously overlooked aquatic biomass signal in POM (~53% of the annual pan-Arctic POM flux which averages 4391 Gg/y of exported particulate organic carbon). Splitting soil endmember values into shallow and deep soil pools (mean ± standard deviation: -228 ± 211 v. -492 ± 173‰) rather than the less representative traditional active layer and permafrost categories (-300 ± 236 v. -441 ± 215‰) also improved endmember resolution.
In the NPCTR, dissolved organic carbon concentrations as high as 167 mgCL-1 were found in tree DOM (which proved highly biolabile in this study; &gt;50%). Since the NPCTR is hypermaritime, tree DOM fluxes may be substantial. Condensed aromatic formulae comprised as much as 38% relative abundance of spruce and hemlock bark leachate DOM. Coniferous trees could thus be major condensed aromatic sources. Soil wetness determined DOM composition and response to microbial processing. Source-specific marker formulae were discovered in multiple soil and tree sources, and though the majority were consumed during bioincubations certain marker formulae persisted. All of these source-specific marker formulae (of which &gt;90% were from spruce stemflow) were then located downstream in the watershed demonstrating that tree DOM may escape biodegradation. Summertime in the NPCTR yields the most terrestrial DOM, which then appears to degrade during the colder, wetter, fall-spring period. Despite these seasonal trends two metrics of fresh terrestrial DOM contribution (marker formulae and modified aromaticity index) did not show any significant relationships with hydrologic or temperature variables. Antecedent conditions (rather than precipitation alone) thus seems to control molecular terrestrial connectivity.
Climate change is modifying both the sources and seasons that this dissertation shows to influence DOM composition and fate in northern regions. Increasing precipitation intensity in the NPCTR may tighten land-ocean linkages, while warming, permafrost thaw, and increasing CO2 concentrations could enhance allochthonous and autochthonous POM fluxes and the contribution of old, microbially processed, stable DOM to the Arctic Ocean. This work shows that an improved understanding of current controls on OM composition and fate will be necessary to predict future changes in northern high-latitude ecosystem carbon cycling and its role in furthering global climate change.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This thesis explores the ways in which white, Christian children were centered in several religious, political, and economic movements in 1970s and 80s America. The rise of the Religious Right and the emergence of the Satanic panic caused religious reformers to believe their children were especially susceptible to manipulative cultural, corporate, and religious forces that threatened the nuclear family. This is especially salient when analyzing the ways in which the toy and television industries advertised products to children through licensed characters in the 1980s, which led several conservative Christians to detect a creeping Satanism in children’s playthings. As a ubiquitous and commercialized object, Ouija boards embodied this social anxiety as games that came to be perceived as gateways to children’s spiritual and physical endangerment. Although children were central to the rhetoric of politicians, parents, and religious leaders in the 1970s and 80s, the actual agency and experiences of kids disappeared in the chaos. Tracing these events and ideologies demonstrates how the concept of childhood underwent rapid change, commercialization, and politicization in mid to late twentieth-century America. In doing so, I offer several contributions to the field of religious studies, including analysis of understudied Satanic panic primary sources and innovative research on Ouija boards. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This research study sought to better understand what motivates and influences young alumni to engage with their alma mater. For many development and alumni relations departments, alumni have become a source of private funding to assist in the decreased burden of tuition and the cost of attending college. Frequently, alumni who are reached out to are the ones who have given in the past and are in the latter part of their lives. This leaves a gap of alumni who have not been engaged or guided to be the next board member or donor. The young alumni population at Florida International University has been forgotten, and now it is time to understand their characteristics and build a bridge to close the gap. Previous research focused on the traditional engagement for alumni, including those who graduated over ten years. The traditional engagement is defined as those who join the board, attend football games, and give annually. However, young alumni want transparency, and they let their alma mater know that what may matter to the colleges does not necessarily matter to them. However, they want to give back and stay involved in their capacity, not because of board member responsibilities. Therefore, this study sought to explore ways to successfully engage young alumni who were former student leaders and provide insight into how best to establish a relationship between the two entities. I leveraged the social exchange theory for the conceptual baseline using a qualitative research approach. A demographic questionnaire followed by individual interviews with a small sample were analyzed for common themes in characteristics that make former student leaders want to stay involved. Findings helped generate a base understanding of the most engaged students who are now alumni and how their experiences translated to getting them involved as an alumnus. Implications for universities' development and alumni relations, the College of Engineering &amp; Computing, and the Department of Student Success are also discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>ABSTRACTThis thesis aims to trace the evolution of cognitive writing research within the field of rhetoric and composition from approximately the 1960s to the contemporary moment. While the “cognitive turn” is widely recognized as an influential component of process theory, much of the scholarship perceive this shift as a fleeting moment of the early 1980s. In wake of the “social turn,” many scholars pronounced the “death” of cognitive writing research. However, research demonstrates that after the landmark Flower and Hayes 1981 Cognitive Process Model of Writing Processes, many scholars continued to explore writing as a cognitive activity though, as I argue, this process moved underground. This thesis aims to demonstrate that although the term cognition moved underground because of the polarizing reception of the 1981 model, cognitive writing research has reappeared in contemporary terms such as reflection, metacognition, and transfer. This thesis can broadly be classified as a project that attempts to further reconcile the gap between social and cognitive studies. I argue that a merger between cognitivism and social constructivism is both possible and productive. In the examination of this goal, this thesis centers around the following question: In the 1981 model, what linguistic and structural changes need to occur to account for 1) prominent criticisms and 2) contemporary terminology?
To further trace cognition’s evolution within rhetoric and composition, I have positioned this thesis around Flower and Hayes’ 1981 article, “A Cognitive Process Theory of Writing.”  In recounting the model’s reception, I discuss the affordances and constraints of Cognitive Process Theory to outline the tensions between cognitivism and social constructivism. After, this thesis demonstrates how cognition has continued to guide the field’s research interests thereby proving its continued relevance. Next, I argue for the value in reviving the term “cognition” by proposing the beginnings of an updated cognitive process writing model. This research focuses on two key principles within rhetoric and composition—imagery and ecology—that could be utilized in future research to construct an updated cognitive process writing model. Lastly, I discuss the limitations of this project further detailing the exciting opportunities for future cognitive writing research.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The central thesis of the following dissertation is that we should understand moral worth as the practical corollary of knowledge. I therefore agree with those standard accounts of moral worth which maintain that moral worth requires us to perform right actions because they are right. I disagree however with how those accounts unpack the relevant notion of ‘because.’ I argue that just as believing something because it is true requires far more than an agent reasoning from the correct set of premises; so too performing an action because it is right requires far more than performing the action for the correct reasons.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>I argue that to understand the role that rightness plays in morally worthy action, we must look beyond the content of an agent’s reasons and towards the underlying dispositions from which an agent acts. Such an approach, I go on to argue, allows us to resolve persistent puzzles surrounding both moral fetishism and moral testimony.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Finally, in the most speculative part of the dissertation, I argue that we have similar reason to take a moral-worth-first approach to ethics that we do to take a knowledge-first approach to epistemology. Just as we cannot define knowledge in terms of analytic additions to true belief, so we won’t be able to define moral worth in terms of analytic additions to right action. Yet, despite that, we can still give important and non-trivial characterizations of moral worth and employ the concept fruitfully in understanding other moral categories. Moral worth is, I argue, amongst the most fundamental ethical concepts—moral wort is the most general description of essentially rightive activity, and most other ethical concepts involve abstractions, approximations, generalizations, and deviations from it.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This dissertation draws on oral histories from mostly Black women elders along with visual documentation, archival research and ethnography of the historic Black neighborhood of Rondo in Saint Paul, Minnesota to conceptualize memories of dispossession and displacement from the construction of the I-94 highway as Black counter memories of racialized structural violence which is memorialized in specific sites and spaces and fuels specific spatial practices for food and spatial justice in the larger context of the US Midwest. The expressions of loss and trauma experienced by Rondo’s elders when they recount their memories of the devastation brought to the Rondo neighborhood in the 1960s with the construction of the I-94 highway is conceptualized as a lived wound that is embodied and affectively experienced by Rondo elders and descendants. The dissertation then draws on ethnographies of community gardens and urban farming practices in the Rondo neighborhood to access how this lived wound and Black counter memories of Rondo as a Black place, inspires practices for food justice in the neighborhood through the work of the Urban Farmer Garden Alliance. Finally, it accesses whether spatial efforts through the construction of infrastructures like the Rondo community land bridge can bring about healing and economic/cultural capital back to Rondo’s Black community. The fieldwork for this dissertation was conducted between 2018 and 2020 during the COVID 19 pandemic. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Ocean waves are sustainable clean, and contain tremendous amount of energy. However,they are typically irregular and complex, making harnessing difficult and inefficient in the
absence of sophisticated surface measurements. Existing wave energy converters rely on
static power take-off technologies, but active power take-off (PTO) control can improve
energy extraction. The optimization of the PTO damping is crucial to maximizing the
absorbed power. The goal of this project is to use deep reinforcement learning to actively
control the PTO damping coefficient to optimize power over a specified time horizon with
only one causal surface wave measurement. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a machine
learning subset that combines reinforcement and deep learning and employs artificial feed-
forward neural networks. The learner algorithm (agent) interacts with the environment to
learn the best policy based on the actions taken and the states that result from those actions.
In this study, the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm is used,
which has two hidden layers of 256 widths each and is integrated with the PTO system of a
single-body point absorber device. The damping coefficient has been chosen to be the action
space, the velocity and position of the floating buoy to be the state space. A reward function
is created to guide the agent through the learning process. A positive reward function is set
to be the function of power absorbed by the PTO system to encourage expected behavior
patterns and increase the likelihood of similar behavior being repeated. Based on the history
of the time dynamics and limited knowledge of the future state based on the current wave
detection sensor capabilities, the agent learns the optimal damping coefficient and helps to
maximize the absorbed power.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to investigate the number of male and female band directors in the NAfME Southern Division at the collegiate level. Specifically, I wanted to know a) What is the number of males vs. females who conduct a collegiate band ensemble? b) Is there a difference between the number of male and female band directors in the NAfME Southern Division? c) Is there a difference between the number of male and female Directors of Bands in the NAfME Southern Division? d) Is there a difference in the number of female band directors by state in the NAfME Southern Division?Results showed that there were far fewer female band directors than there were male band directors in the southern division. A significant difference was found between the number of male and female band directors with male directors in the majority. A significant difference was also found between the number of male and female Directors of Bands, with men accounting for 85% of Directors of Bands in the NAfME Southern Division. Lastly, a significant difference was found between the numbers of female college band directors in each state with a range of 1-6 across the eleven different states.  Possible explanations for the disparity between male and female band directors and recommendations for future research are included.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Paul Hindemith wrote his three organ sonatas during the period in organbuilding known as the Organ Reform Movement, which idealized Baroque organs and sought to create new instruments which reflected these Baroque ideals. In the USA in particular, there was a stark contrast between the American symphonic organs and these neoclassical organs. These contrasting organ types, each with their own unique capabilities, present a performer with two contrasting approaches to the performance of Hindemith’s organ sonatas: the orchestral approach and the neoclassical approach. Though organ music already presents problems of interpretation, such as a lack of knowledge of the intended instrument, and a lack of registration or one which exceeds the capabilities of one’s given instrument, Hindemith’s own flawed understanding of the organ presents even further problems and ambiguities. The best evidence to turn to for answers to these problems are Hindemith’s own writings, principally his books Johann Sebastian Bach: Heritage and Obligation (1952), A Composer’s World (1952), and Traditional Harmony Book II (1953), as well as accounts from two of his students, Robert Noehren and Hagop Frank Bozyan, regarding what Hindemith expected from their performance of the sonatas. As for any ambiguities in Hindemith’s scores which cannot be explained according to these sources, such as redundant, contradictory, or otherwise unclear information, the performer must exercise good judgment and deductive reasoning to arrive at a reasonable and musical solution.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Since its inception, the genre of hip-hop has been celebrated for addressing the socioeconomic status of African Americans and encouraging critical thought surrounding American society and its corruption. Throughout the late twentieth century, rhythm and blues (R&amp;B) conveyed similar intellectual and politically-charged messaging to hip-hop but has historically received less credit for its scholarship and musicianship. The lack of recognition surrounding R&amp;B is caused in part by R&amp;B’s significant association with the experience of Black women, contrasting hip-hop’s lack of representation for this aspect of Black culture. The album The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill finds itself at the intersection of both of these genres, and despite the sonic mutualism between R&amp;B and hip-hop during the 1990s, the album and therefore Lauryn Hill herself are only given intellectual credit when referring to their overlap with hip-hop.  Concerning DuBois’ formulation of double consciousness, this triple consciousness of the African American woman that Hill utilizes has been both severely undermined by society and understudied by scholars. Through the lens of The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, this thesis recognizes that R&amp;B women of the late twentieth century use their own artistic and intellectual ingenuity to create music for social and political change. This thesis explores this dilemma of intellectual misogynoir through (1) a lyrical analysis of the Black scholarship used on the album, (2) a musical analysis of Black feminism in Black American popular music and genre, and (3) the sonic exploration of the album’s musical influences through sampling. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This body of work explores the growth and structure of two different cobalt containing compounds that may show interesting quantum spin behaviors: [(CH3)3NH]CoCl3 and BaCo2(PO4)2. In [(CH3)3NH]CoCl3, the Co ions are arranged in a chain and show anti-ferromagnetic interactions, making this system a good approximation for a one-dimensional Ising model. In BaCo2(PO4)2 ,the Co ions are arranged on a  honeycomb lattice, with geometrical frustration of the magnetic interactions. The crystal growth and room temperature single crystal structure of the linear magnetic chain compound [(CH3)3NH]CoCl3 is reported, along with low temperature magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity measurements. [(CH3)3NH]CoCl3 single crystals were grown using two methods: slow evaporation and seeded growth. The compound crystallizes in an orthorhombic structure with lattice parameters a =7.2716 (3) Å  b =8.0983(3) Å and c =16.6473(5) Å, consistent with literature values. Seeded crystal growth in a supersaturated solution resulted in large crystals with well-developed habit. [(CH3)3NH]CoCl3 is of interest because it realizes a one-dimensional (1-D) spin system, which can be probed through heat capacity and magnetic susceptibility measurements. Attempts to grow deuterated crystals for neutron scattering experiments are in progress.
A literature review and experimental analysis on the synthesis of BaCo2(PO4)2 is also reported. Single crystals of BaCo2(PO4)2 were previously grown using hydrothermal methods. Although no single crystals of Barium Cobalt Phosphate have been obtained so far, several side products resulting from different reactants, pH, and temperatures profiles have been isolated. The main goal, to obtain the single crystal of BaCo2(PO4)2 to probe the spin interactions has not yet been  attained.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Query rewriting (QR) is a critical component in dialogue systems for reducing frictions caused by systematic errors or user ambiguity.  When there is an entity error, it imposes extra difficulty for a dialogue system to produce satisfactory interpretation. Knowledge Graph (KG) information can be beneficial for query rewriting, as common queries for dialogue systems are often related to external knowledge like celebrity names, artworks names, and locations.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This thesis investigates how to incorporate knowledge graph for query rewriting. In particular, we study knowledge graph based entity retrieval in query rewriting. We utilize neural encoders to produce utterance/entity embeddings, and similarity search for entity retrieval. We incorporate KG to provide graph structural information (neighboring entities encoded by Graph Neural Network) and textual information (KG entity descriptions encoded by RoBERTa). Experimental results show that both hard negative sampling and incorporation of knowledge graph consistently improves retrieval precision on all test sets. We observe large performance gain from utilizing KG on few-shot test entities. This shows that external knowledge information is particularly beneficial for dealing with rarely seen cases.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Since 2019, more than 30 states have proposed over 100 pieces of legislation seeking to ban or heavily restrict young transgender and gender minority athletes from participating in sports. Fully aware of the developmental, physical, and mental health benefits that sport can bring young people, state legislators have passed many of these bills. My thesis includes uses of Bem’s (1981) gender schema theory (GST) to inform analysis of how stereotypes and discrimination against transgender people and gender minorities manifest from sex-typed associations and rigid gender schemas. As many Americans still don’t personally know a transgender person (Minkin &amp; Brown, 2021), we often turn to news media to stay informed. I use textual analysis to critically analyze how cable news media frame young gender minority athletes and the controversy of gender minorities participating in organized sport. Content-specific frames are developed for each of the three major cable news outlets (Cable News Network, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC) that characterize coverage of the controversy in transcripts between January 1, 2019, and October 16, 2021. Overarching frames were also developed that describe the strategies of all three cable news networks. Additionally, coverage was analyzed for how framing or representation may change based on the intersectional identities of the main athletes discussed in coverage during the time frame. Trends present over the designated time frame were also noted, amalgamating to a nuanced evaluation of how the inclusion of young transgender and other young gender minority athletes in sports is being framed by the three major cable news networks. Although there were differences between networks, overall, I found that there were overarching frames employed by all three outlets explored in this study: (1) there are only two sides to the issue at hand; (2) trans athlete participation is used as a political ploy by the “other side;” and (3) the beliefs about the issue on the “other side” reveal absurdity in the issue itself and the political party. These frames essentially oversimplify the issue by presenting it as a two-sided controversy—typically only reporting dominant arguments or beliefs in the form of Republican views versus Democratic views or right versus left—instead of an acknowledgement of the complexity and nuance of the conversation around the inclusion of gender minorities in sport.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Unlike in many northern European centers, Augsburg’s amateur archeologists, scholars, artists, and printers did not rely on the invention or falsification of antiquities. During the early modern period, European cities and regions fashioned their own civic identities according to local concerns, often through the creative manipulation of ancient texts and images which served as material evidence of distant origins. By the sixteenth century, interest in local histories and the collecting of artifacts reached a zenith, and the printing press offered a new method for communicating knowledge of antiquity to a wide audience. In the city of Augsburg, known in antiquity as Augusta Vindelicorum, Roman heritage has long been a significant facet of civic cultural identity. Working in the shadow of Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I, Augsburg’s leading patrons, including humanist Konrad Peutinger and the mercantile Fugger family, documented surviving local antiquities and commissioned new works of classicizing art and architecture, visually asserting a genuine, unbroken lineage to the city’s past. My dissertation, “Augsburg All’antica: Picturing German Antiquity in the Age of Print,” examines the central role of print to local antiquarian pursuits and generation of a style all’antica in early sixteenth-century Augsburg, Germany. This study challenges previous art historical narratives that promote Augsburg as the first German center to adopt Renaissance art and architecture but reduce the story to one of imitation spurred on by German artists’ and patrons’ supposedly revelatory visits to the Italian peninsula. Using theories of transmission, translation, and book history, I instead track the development of a style all’antica in Augsburg, informed both by transalpine exchange and local traces of antiquity. Dual artistic styles emerged as a byproduct of cross-cultural exchange, and the graphic field of the early modern page saw the conflict between the imported welsch and indigenous deutsch artistic styles play out. At the same time, prints stabilized Augsburg’s fragmentary remains of antiquity and circulated the free imperial city’s claim to a notable past. I demonstrate that Augsburg’s artists and printers did not simply seek to imitate Italian modes of representation. Instead, they actively participated in an international network of exchange marked by emulation and competition. Augsburg’s artists acted as archeologists of the printed page, excavating useful fragments for reincorporation into their own compositions. The visual vocabulary initially imported from Italy was manipulated in many cases beyond recognition, resulting in a hybrid, classicizing style imbued with connotations of Augsburg’s Roman past, the prestige of economic and cultural ties with Italy, and the imperial favor of Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This dissertation explores Cicero’s reception of Cato the Elder, particularly in respect to his fragmentary history of Rome and Italy, the Origines. I revisit commonly held conceptions about Cato’s style, aims, and influences which I suggest are owed more to the transmission history of the fragments than to Cato’s intent and authorial agency. I rely on philological and digital methodologies to catalog and analyze Cicero’s engagement with Cato’s writings, but I focus particularly on the dialogues written from the mid-50s BCE until the end of Cicero’s life. In a departure from previous approaches to the research problem, which center authorial intent or remove Cato’s fragments from their transmission context, I focus on reader responses to Cicero’s Cato. I both analyze Cicero’s citation of Cato as form of reading, and consider how readers in the Late Republic, many of whom were interested in Cato, would in turn read Cicero’s Cato as compared to their external knowledge of Cato’s life, career, and writings. I suggest that Cicero’s representations of Cato would not have been accepted by all ancient readers, and that we should thus expect a variety of potential responses to Cicero’s uses of Cato. I thus argue that readers, including Cicero’s audience and Cicero himself, fundamentally shape Cato’s image as a historian. Relying on the work of scholars who suggest that citations may provoke skeptical reader responses in fictional narratives, and also that we can understand the fictionalized interlocutors in Cicero’s dialogues as an internal audience analogous to Cicero’s readers, I analyze potential responses to Cicero’s citations both of Cato and in Cato’s voice. In this way, we can better understand the reception of Cato the Elder and the place of his Origines, the earliest Latin history, in the cultural and intellectual history of the Roman world.My dissertation contains five chapters, an introduction, and a conclusion. My first chapter provides an overview of Cicero’s reference to and citation of Cato throughout his career. Building on this foundation, the second chapter explores how Cicero tends to name Cato in groups with other famous Romans and Greeks. I argue that this tendency reflects Cato’s multivalence as a political, literary, and military figure, but also that it helps Cicero to designate Cato as the first orator and historian worth reading, a role he often takes on in Cicero’s rhetorical works. In the next chapter, I offer a case study in how the goals of the citing authority alter our conceptions of Cato’s most famous stylistic device, antonomasia, or the omission of personal names by focusing on Cato and dialogic verisimilitude in De re publica. In the last two chapters I discuss his De senectute, the dialogue delivered in Cato’s voice and written late in Cicero’s life. In the penultimate chapter I explore how Cicero cites and refers to Roman authors in the dialogue, especially to Ennius and to Cato himself. I suggest this citation practice makes the dialogic Cato plausible, not realistic, but that it also shapes our understanding of the historical Cato, whose Origines are cited in the dialogue. Finally, I end with a case study that argues that Cicero in this dialogue (and elsewhere) is ultimately responsible for the tradition that Cato’s histories were influenced by Xenophon. Thus, I conclude that Cicero’s citation of Cato has had not just profound influence on Cicero’s literary career or Cato’s legacy, but our very understanding of the origins of Roman literary history. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Molecular luminescent materials have been widely studied and used in different applications, including optoelectronics, sensors, and bioimaging. The photophysical properties of these materials are controlled by several factors, such as their aggregation behaviors, molecular electronic structures, and modes of assembly. Molecular interactions, either intra- or intermolecular, play a significant role in regulating these factors. Therefore, understanding these interactions, which are unique to each material system, improves our ability to rationally design molecular luminescent materials with desired electronic and optical properties. In this dissertation, we explore the effects of molecular interactions on the photophysical properties, such as emission colors and photoluminescence quantum efficiencies (PLQEs), for two different classes of materials: cyclometalated Pt(II) complexes and organic metal halide hybrids.
Cyclometalated Pt(II) complexes adopt a square-planar geometry that favors their assembly through Pt-Pt interactions. These complexes are known to display very distinguished photophysical properties depending on the level of interactions between the Pt centers. They can either exhibit emissions from the high energy ligand centered/metal-to-ligand charge transfer (LC/MLCT) state or the lower energy metal-to-metal-ligand charge transfer (MMLCT) state.        In binuclear Pt(II) complexes, the Pt centers are bridged by an appropriate bridging ligand (e.g., pyrazole) which dictates their molecular geometries. Chapter 2 and 3 of this dissertation discuss binuclear Pt(II) complexes with H-frame and A-frame geometries, respectively. In Chapter 2, the synthesis and characterization of a series of binuclear 2,4-difluorophenylpyridine Pt(II) complexes bridged by thiazol-2-thiolate ligands with different bulkiness are reported. The three complexes adopt H-frame geometries or half-lantern structures with short Pt-Pt distances ranging from 2.916 to 2.945 Å, favoring their intramolecular Pt-Pt interactions. All these complexes are found to exhibit strong and stable 3MMLCT emissions in the orange/red region, with PLQEs reaching near-unity. Chapter 3 covers another series of binuclear Pt(II) complexes that have no intramolecular Pt-Pt interactions due to their A-frame geometries and long Pt-Pt distances. These complexes are bridged by pyrazole and have different cyclometallating ligands (N,N-dimethyl-3-(pyridin-2-yl)aniline and 2-(naphthalen-1-yl)pyridine). The complex with N,N-dimethyl-3-(pyridin-2-yl)aniline as its cyclometallating ligand exhibit a positive solvatochromic behavior introduced by the electron-donating dimethylamino group. This behavior is studied in several solvents with different polarities and evaluated using the Lippert-Mataga correlation and the empirical solvent polarity parameter ET(30). The positive solvatochromism recorded for this complex is assigned to the intramolecular charge transfer character of its emission.  
In addition to binuclear Pt(II) complexes, mononuclear cationic Pt(II) complexes are studied in Chapter 4. Intermolecular Pt-Pt interactions can exist between these complexes, which are regulated in a series of four mononuclear cationic Pt(II) complexes by modifying their counter-anions and molecular structures. These complexes exhibit strong 3MMLCT emissions in solid state with colors ranging from green to deep red. The structural and photophysical characterizations of these complexes reveal a clear correlation between their stacking modes and photophysical properties. 
The second class of materials studied in this dissertation is the ionically bonded organic metal halide hybrids. The remarkable structure diversity of this class of materials, originating from the infinite combinations of organic cations and metal halides, unlocks many new properties of both components. In Chapter 5, the synthesis and characterization of a series of benzoquinolinium (BZQ+) metal halides with a unique two-dimensional (2D) structure are reported. The structures are composed of layers of face-sharing metal halides (Pb2X5-, X= Cl, Br) separated and balanced by cationic BZQ+ arrays. The BZQ+ cations are found to be responsible for the emission of these hybrid materials, as revealed by their optical characterizations and theoretical calculations. The inorganic layers in the 2D structure scaffold the organic cations and provide a more rigid architecture due to stronger molecular interactions, enhancing the PLQEs and stability of the BZQ+ cations in the 2D metal halide hybrids compared to the pristine BZQ halides. In addition to the scaffolding effect, the composition of metal halide also affects the photophysical properties of BZQ+ cations. Replacing Cl by the heavy atom Br results in room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from cationic BZQ+ due to heavy atom effects.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The purpose of this dissertation in practice was to understand how participation in a career exploration/introduction to career and technical education (CTE) course with embedded digital tools certification implemented for fifth-grade students influenced how students thought about and articulated their career aspirations. The setting for this study was a rural, medium-sized school district located in northern Florida with minimal resources for supplemental education. An outcome study design was used through a qualitative case study to compare student perspectives from the beginning of the curriculum to how students felt after the curriculum had been taught. This focus was measured through pre- and post-perception interviews with students who participated in the curriculum. Analysis resulted in the identification of nine emergent themes that led to the development of two central domains. Findings underscored the value of career curriculum implementation in upper elementary school settings. Implications for K–12 school systems regarding timing and content of career preparation for students was also discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This thesis documents a 20th century African American cemetery located in Tallahassee Florida. Hickory Hill Cemetery which was utilized by sharecroppers living and working on the Welaunee Plantation has not been properly surveyed since 1997. A survey of the cemetery was conducted in winter of 2022 which utilized an EDM total station to create a map of the site. By documenting the condition of the site along with historical research the author was able to create spatial maps that represent different family groupings, and headstone types. The author also provides background knowledge on Middle Florida plantation life, African American burial traditions, Welaunee Plantation, and sharecropping. A family tree was also created to depict how individuals buried within the cemetery are related to one another.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This phenomenological study investigates the narratives of six Black women faculty to ascertain how their experiences contributed to their retention and persistence in Computing. This study, which incorporates Anti-Deficit Achievement Framework, Critical Race Theory, and Intersectionality Theory, is guided by phenomenology and the following key research question: What are the lived experiences of Black Women Faculty in Computing that have aided their academic persistence and capacity to overcome internal and external barriers? </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Given the dearth of research in this area, this study employed a qualitative research approach to elucidate and understand the factors that contributed to these Black women faculty's academic and professional success in Computing. The study collected data through in-depth semi-structured interviews. The research explored three sub-questions (1) What experiences influenced each participant's decision to begin and continue their education in Computing? (2) What factors influenced the participant's ability to persist as a faculty member in computing sciences? (3) What impact does each participant believe they have had on computing education, and what impact do they wish to have? At the study's conclusion, the researcher gave results and recommendations to enhance Black women faculty in Computing's perseverance and career success.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Multivariate models with dependent variables are popular in financial industry, with applications to option pricing, portfolio optimization, risk management, and modeling credit portfolios. Other applications include geostatistic, hydrology, insurance mathematics,medicine, and reliability theory. Multivariate distributions can be separated into univariate marginals and the dependence structure. Usually, we are more interested in the latter part, which is represented by copulas. In this report, we provide a review of two popular simulation methods. For each method, different random number sequences (MC vs RQMC) are used for comparison. We first compare these simulation methods by a goodness-of-fit test for copulas from literature.Then we propose a new goodness-of-fit test for copulas, investigate the accuracy of the test numerically, and compare it with a well-regarded test in the literature. In addition, we established error bounds for numerical integration and option pricing problems.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Polyelectrolytes are polymers bearing charged repeat units. Based on the charge, a polyelectrolyte can be categorized as either a polycation or a polyanion. When dissolved in water, the charges on a polyelectrolyte are balanced by small counterions. Mixing certain polycations and polyanions in an aqueous solution will result in solid precipitants due to polymer-polymer interactions and the entropy gain of releasing the small counterions. This type of material is called polyelectrolyte complexes, PECs. PECs have a wide range of applications including drug delivery systems, film coatings, and membranes. Because of their charged nature, PECs can bind with enzymes and DNA or many bio-medical applications. To further explore the applications of PECs, it is important to understand the dynamics and viscoelastic properties of this special type of polymer. Many factors such as water, temperature, and composition heavily influence the behaviors of PECs, and therefore were studied in this work.The first part of the dissertation focuses on water and the viscoelastic properties of various PECs. Thirteen different polyelectrolytes were used to produce those PECs, and radiolabeling and NMR techniques were used to determine the polycation: polyanion stoichiometry in the materials. Rheological studies were performed on those PECs to determine their glass transition temperatures, Tg. The PECs exhibit a wide range of Tgs within the working range of aqueous solutions between 0 and 100 °C. To study the correlation between Tg and water, a radiochemical method was developed to measure the pore volume within the PECs, which was used to differentiate between PEC water and pore water. Contrary to what was generally believed, the Tg correlated poorly with the water volume fraction in PECs. There was a weak correlation in a series of PECs in which one of the polyelectrolytes was held constant. On the other hand, time-temperature superposition of linear viscoelastic responses provided a classical estimate of the fractional free volume of PECs, which correlated well with Tg.
The second part investigated the correlation between the stoichiometry and viscoelastic properties of a certain PEC, poly(diallydimethylammonium) (PDADMA)/poly(4-styrenesulfonic acid) (PSS). Various nonstoichiometric PECs with excess in either PDADMA or PSS were produced by a “quenching” method. A

maximum of 36% molar excess of PDADMA or 40% molar excess of PSS was achieved. Those nonstoichiometric PECs exhibited lower Tgs compared to stoichiometric ones, and an excess of PDADMA had a bigger effect on lowering the Tg. It was shown that the decrease in Tg was caused by the increase in water content. Due to the excess polyelectrolytes and counterions, more water was introduced to the nonstoichiometric PECs and therefore lowered the Tg via the plasticizing effect. In addition, time–temperature superposition revealed a correlation between segmental relaxation times and stoichiometry. Nonstoichiometric PECs were shown to have elevated fractional free volumes and decreased polymer volume fractions, which are responsible for changes in their mechanical properties.
The third part focuses on the formation and properties of PEC blends. Four PECs with distinct Tgs were used to produce two PEC blends with varying compositions. Each blend is comprised of one polycation and two polyanions, and the molar ratio of the two polyanions was adjusted to create blends with the same components but different molar compositions. Rheological experiments were carried out to determine the Tgs of the blends. It was shown that one of the blends exhibited Tgs in between the two individual PECs, and the Tgs can be modeled using the Kwei Equation. The other blend showed two different Tgs that were similar to the individual PECs’ Tgs, indicating the blend was immiscible. The immiscibility was explained by the difference in critical salt concentration between the two individual PECs.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Behavioral economics has become a significant perspective in the evaluation of human judgment and decision-making. In the limited research literature of cognitive biases in online health information seeking (OHIS) behavior, researchers have suggested that more empirical studies are needed in order to generalize how cognitive biases influence the OHIS behavior of health information seekers. This study examines the dynamics of online health information seekers’ decision-making behavior through the lens of behavioral economics, and thus behavioral information research (BIR), and incorporates a behavioral economics approach to research OHIS behavior, by conducting online experiment on cognitive biases in OHIS. Specifically, this dissertation research project: (a) conducts a systematic review of cognitive biases and debiasing in OHIS research literature to gain an analytical overview of the area of research, (b) conducts an experimental study on the detection of selected common behavioral cognitive biases (confirmation bias and order effect specifically) and the effectiveness of the use of designed human-computer interaction (HCI) debiasing features based on the principle of cognitive system switching, and (c) conducts an online experimental study on the detection of selected social cognitive biases (authority bias and ethnic-name prejudice specifically) and the effectiveness of HCI debiasing features based on the principle of behavioral nudging with accidentally encountered word priming. The results of the systematic review show that much remains to be done in using the behavioral information research perspective to examine and possibly improve OHIS behavior in terms of the judgment of information quality. The results of the online experiments, in addition to providing significant and nonsignificant evidence for the existence of certain biases in OHIS, adds to the much-needed research replication repository for continuing validation to advance the field of behavioral information research and provides an empirical examination of nudge theory in OHIS using word priming. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed for the advancement of future behavioral information research studies. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The central focus of this thesis is a study of materials with competing magnetic interactions and understanding how these interactions affect the overall magnetic behavior of solids.  Understanding the fundamental factors that can be used to tune the magnetic exchange interactions provides the legwork to a “materials by design” approach that may be used to target desired magnetic properties for applications related to electronics and spintronics.  Specifically, this thesis will focus on the fundamental understanding of how magnetic materials behave when one or more of the following factors is considered: chemical substitution, pressure, applied magnetic field, and temperature.Chapter 1 covers the fundamentals of magnetism and examples of magnetic behaviors that demonstrate the principles that are important to this thesis.  Chapter 2 covers the experimental and theoretical methods used in this work.  In Chapter 3, the behavior of solid solutions La1-xCexCo2P2, with a particular focus on the representative with x = 0.3, is analyzed.  The careful analysis of La0.4Ce0.6Co2P2 is particularly important to this series, as at this composition the magnetic phase boundary between ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) behavior occurs.  The loss of magnetic ordering in this compound due to a temperature driven lattice collapse and the magnetic behavior under pressure are discussed.  Additionally, a specific focus on the magnetic behavior of cerium is incorporated for a deeper understanding of the role intermediate valence of Ce plays in the magnetic properties of this series.
In Chapter 4, the AFM compound MnBi2Se4 is investigated by neutron scattering and magnetic measurements.  The crystal structure reveals AFM chains of Mn atoms. A relative half-translation shift of the neighbor chains results in spin frustration caused by interchain magnetic exchange. Ultimately, these spin-frustrating interactions lead to helimagnetic ordering along the chain propagation direction.
To further understand the nature of magnetic exchange in MnBi2Se4, Chapters 5 and 6 focus on the simple binary monocalcogenides, MnS and MnSe.  Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) is used to measure the specific magnetic exchange constants in these materials.  In MnS, the INS measurements combined with theoretical investigation lead to the revelation that both superexchange and direct exchange play a significant role in the overall AFM ordering.  The behavior of MnSe is inherently more complex due to the structural phase transition from cubic (NaCl) to hexagonal (NiAs) phase upon cooling.  The transition is incomplete due to its very slow kinetics, which have allowed, for the first time in this system, for experimental observation of the intermediate third phase involved in this transformation.  The intermediate phase was investigated by temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction and pair distribution function (PDF) measurements, and supported by INS studies.
In continuation of the theme of competing magnetic interactions, Chapter 7 focuses on the magnetic behavior of systems with geometric triangular arrangements of magnetic moments of 4f ions (Ln).  The lack of magnetic ordering is observed for a majority of the LnZn3P3 and YbZn2Pn2 (Pn = P, As, Sb) systems down to 1.8 K.  The question arises, could the lack of magnetic ordering be caused by the frustration induced by the crystal lattice?  Further studies are needed to confirm whether the lack of magnetic ordering, indeed, is caused by spin frustration.  X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy is utilized to address the oxidation state of Yb in YbZn2Pn2.
Finally, Chapter 8 is dedicated to another potentially interesting system for which the magnetic behavior has not been thoroughly investigated.  Er5S7 is unusual as a non-valence-precise structure.  The crystal growth and magnetic behavior of Er5S7 are reported, revealing AFM ordering at low temperature.  The challenges associated with determining the exact crystal and magnetic structures of this materials are discussed.
Throughout this thesis, the relationship between the underlying crystal structure and competing magnetic interactions will be identified and discussed for each unique system.  The broad scope of systems considered in this thesis has allowed identification of potentially interesting future research directions, which are outlined in the concluding Chapter 9.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Self-regulation, an increasingly focus of social-emotional learning curriculums for over twenty years according to Zimmerman (2008), provides students with the ability of “setting goals, selecting strategies, and self-monitoring their effectiveness” as opposed to waiting for others to redirect their behavior (p. 166). Prekindergarten students who have documented strengths in social-emotional learning, and particularly self-regulation, have a greater chance at demonstrating academic readiness at the kindergarten level (Ashdown &amp; Bernard, 2015). On the contrary, if students do not strengthen these social-emotional learning skills by the age of 8, a potential of long-term academic weaknesses exists (Aksoy, 2019).Prekindergarten options such as the State of Florida Voluntary Prekindergarten Program, strive to provide enriching methodologies for students at four years of age with aspirations of strong social-emotional skills and academic success in kindergarten. The most recent readiness results, from the 2018 school year, from the State of Florida indicate 58% of students demonstrated proficiency, meaning 42% of students were not ready for kindergarten during the 2019 school year (Nickerson, 2019). This result is an increase from 36% not being proficient in the 2018 school year (Postal, 2019).
	The purpose of this study was to better understand if an increased focus on social-emotional development at the prekindergarten level would increase a prekindergarten student’s academic readiness in the form of print knowledge, phonological awareness, and oral language. In addition, the study researched the relationship between this social-emotional learning program and the number of verbal and physical aggressions for prekindergarten students.  
The leadership team for the school featured in this study researched several commercial programs dedicated to social-emotional learning and selected the Incredible Years Dinosaur School as the primary means for teaching social-emotional skills during the school years of 2020-2021. I conducted a descriptive study using ANOVA to compare academic reading scores of prekindergarten students at the school between the years of 2019-2020 (control group) and 2020-2021 (treatment group) using the results of the State of Florida Voluntary Prekindergarten Assessment for Assessment Period 1 administered within the first 30-days of each school year and Assessment Period 3 which occurred 30-days prior to the ending of both school years. I calculated the number of incidents of verbal and physical aggression using student behavioral incident forms to provide further data regarding the outcome. An additional analysis examined the role gender and age play in the success of students in both groups for the areas of literacy. 
	This study finds that the students who participated in the Incredible Years Dinosaur School demonstrated growth in oral language skills with a decrease in both verbal and physical aggression occurrences. In addition, further analysis of age data between the control and treatment group indicated students from the younger cohort group (those who turned five years of age from February 1st 2021-August 31st 2021) demonstrated more success with pre-reading skills than those from the older group (those who turned five years of age from September 2, 2020-January 31, 2021. On the contrary, however, the results showed that the addition of the Incredible Years Dinosaur School at the school had no effect on the students’ print knowledge or phonological awareness levels.
While the school found the implementation of Incredible Years Dinosaur School strengthened students’ social-emotional skills as measured by student behavioral data, the prekindergarten program at Country Wide School should research and employ supplemental reading curriculums for students to develop levels of print knowledge and phonological awareness. Oral Language, however, can be increased from such social-emotional learning programs as these programs typically provide modeling and an enhanced exposure to vocabulary. Prekindergarten programs should review the information presented in this study as well as examine the data from their own facilities to gauge whether additional time allotted to social-emotional learning possibly would be of benefit.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Scholars have been utilizing the inquisition period and the blood purity statutes put into effect in fifteenth-century Spain in order to define and outline antisemitism as we know it today, as well as disregard the notion that race has been an ever-evolving concept that did not just begin with the emergence of genetics in the 18th century. Conceptually, it seemed as though the formulation of the idea of Jewish people as a race aligned heavily with Nazi propaganda in the 1930s. Thus, medieval Spanish works, such as El Retablo de las Maravillas by Miguel de Cervantes, began to be examined through two distinct lenses: the basis for modern day antisemitism, and the foundations of racism. However, much of what is known about the society of medieval Spain today demonstrates that the concept of race was more of a social construct than a biological one. Spanish society was heavily influenced by politics, using religion as a foundation for understanding the world, and the constant anxiety that one’s social status could change overnight. Cervantes’ work and the societal structures of 15th century Spain must be returned to and left in their own time period. Looking at the parallels drawn between Nazi Germany’s treatment of Jews and Spain’s inquisition period through El Retablo de las Maravillas, in addition to analyzing the distinct meanings of the terms “raza” and “race”, provides us with in depth understanding and the integral ability to distinguish the two time periods.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The ‘simple view of reading’ is an influential model of reading comprehension which asserts that children’s reading comprehension performance can be explained entirely by their decoding and language comprehension skills. Children with ADHD often exhibit difficulty across all three of these reading domains, yet it is unclear whether the simple view of reading is sufficient to explain reading comprehension performance in this population. The current study was the first to use multiple indicators and latent estimates of decoding, language comprehension, and reading comprehension to examine the validity of the simple view of reading in a clinically evaluated sample of 250 children ages 8-13 (M=10.29, SD=1.47; 93 girls; 70% White/Non-Hispanic) with and without ADHD. Results of the primary structural equation model were consistent with predictions from the simple view of reading, and revealed that decoding and language comprehension explained all (R2=.99) of the variance in reading comprehension for children with and without ADHD. Further, results of the multigroup model (ADHD, Non-ADHD) indicated that there was no difference in the quantity of variance explained for children with ADHD versus children without ADHD, and that the quantity of explained variance did not differ from 100% for either group. Sensitivity analyses indicated that these effects were generally robust to control for monomethod bias, time sampling error, and nonverbal IQ. These findings confirm simple view of reading predictions that decoding and language comprehension are both necessary and sufficient for explaining children’s reading comprehension skills, and extend prior work by indicating that these findings hold for both children with ADHD and clinically evaluated children without ADHD. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation examines the origins of free carrier density in semiconductor nanocrystals and relates these findings to the observed localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs). The first chapter introduces some of the most relevant and fundamental concepts in solid state physics, nanomaterials, plasmonics, and key analytical instrumentation used for the studies. Chapter two focuses on what is likely the most famous example of all plasmonic semiconductors, indium tin oxide (ITO) nanocrystals. ITO was one of the first semiconductors shown to exhibit a LSPR, a phenomenon previously thought to only occur in metallic systems such as gold and silver. In this chapter, the concentration of tin dopant is synthetically tuned to investigate its effect on the total number of free carriers generated and their relation to the overserved infrared LSPR. One electron chemical titrations are used to show that the Drude model is shown to be inaccurate for calculating free carrier concentrations and appropriate corrections are proposed. The third chapter examines the effect of dopant size mismatch on free carrier generation. Al3+, Ga3+, and In3+ doped ZnO nanocrystals are synthesized and shown to exhibit unique mid-infrared LSPRs that are not dependent on dopant concentration like is seen in ITO. A combination of infrared spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, and chemical titrations were used to show that better dopant/host ion size matching results in higher free carrier densities. This work is further extended in chapter four, where solid state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is used as an element specific probe for Al3+ and Ga3+ doped ZnO nanocrystals. Evidence of the formation of an insulating spinel phase (AB2X4) explains the lack of tunability of the LSPR with dopant concentration.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Second language acquisition has been observed to be variable in its outcome such that, unlike native speakers, all second language learners do not achieve total success. Second language acquisition is made of macro and micro processes. External and internal (e.g., age, individual differences) factors are assumed to affect language processing in theoretical models like the Competition Model and VanPatten’s Model of Input Processing, particularly for language features that are marked or not available in the native or first language like object fronted or inverted word order sentences. Many studies have addressed universals of second language processing and the processing strategies used by L2 learners to interpret object-verb-subject (OVS) and subject-verb-object (SVO) sentence types. Fewer studies have investigated if and/or how individual differences like working memory and inhibitory control ability affect sentence interpretation. The goal of this study was to examine the role of these cognitively based individual differences (working memory and inhibitory control) on second language sentence interpretation for two groups of second language learners of Spanish as compared to a group of native Spanish speakers. Participants (N = 87) completed two working memory span tasks (reading and operation span), a measure of inhibitory control (the Simon task), and a sentence interpretation task. The results suggest that there is an effect for proficiency level on L2 sentence interpretation for OVS sentences; a relationship between working memory and L2 sentence interpretation for L2 intermediate learners; and a relationship between inhibitory control ability and L2 sentence interpretation for L2 intermediate and L2 advanced learners in opposite directions. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The following collection of poems represent the author’s best attempts are writing and cultivating poems which continue the creative tradition of the “Seriously Funny” as defined in the anthology of the same name, edited by David Kirby and Barbara Hamby: “poems of artistic merit that contain elements of comedy” (xiii). While these is no narrative or thematic through-line between the poems, they are intended to tonally work together and hopefully culminate into a collection which is itself hilarious and emotionally substantive. The collection is broken down into three sections in which each has its own rough identity in terms of content and style. Each section has a title lifted from one of the poems it contains. In the first section, “The Royal Socket Wrenches,” the poems all consist of one stanza. Additionally, in the spirit of writers such as Frank O’Hara, these poems are littered with pop culture references. The second section of the collection, “Notes of Stone Fruit and Oak,” features poems more experimental in terms of both form and content. They seek to continue the surreal and comical tradition of James Tate. The third and final section of the collection, “Worcestershire Sauce,” contains the poems which are the most personal to the life of the author, bringing in friends, family members, and other loved ones. Despite the aforementioned section breaks, it is the author’s hope that the collection also works as a singular cohesive unit in which laughter and the poems’ emotional substance coexist in a symbiotic relationship. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>As is the case for most of my works, World of Midnight is first and foremost a story. It started as a story that my friends and I would tell together through playing Dungeons and Dragons. Over time, I started taking the same melodies that I was using for background music during our games and setting them as contemporary chamber works. Now, they’ve been even further stretched and developed into a full-length symphony that is to the best of my abilities right now as a 25-year old masters student. This symphony follows a specific narrative, but I’m reserving most of these details in the hopes that the listener will find their own inspiration and stories in the music. Instead, I will provide the foundation of what each movement sets out to achieve, share the inspiration behind my selection of texts, and highlight some particularly important details. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The first movement, “In the Eternal Night…,” establishes the central motives and ideas that will be important throughout the symphony. It introduces us to the titular “world of midnight” that towards the latter sections of the movement undergoes some great disaster. The following movement, “…the Dead World Lay,” imagines the narrator wandering through a desolate landscape observing the final moments of sunlight being consumed by an oppressive gloom and darkness. This movement in particular explores a feeling of aimless, dissociated wandering. The third movement, “A Cimmerian Waltz,” …is the only movement without chorus. It depicts the a party happening near the end of the world, during which attendees stubbornly attempt to keep dancing while ignoring the interruptions brought on by the end of days. This continues without break into the final movement, “Only Death May Free,” which depicts a fierce battle against forces that would seek to do harm to the world.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	I was drawn the texts of Clark Ashton Smith as I began to study and learn more about Lovecraft and cosmicism, and I found his dark imagery an excellent match for this shadow-stricken setting. I chose the excerpt from Seneca to serve as the twisted, nihilistic philosophy of “Moriyah,” a figure introduced in the final movement that is the embodiment of darkness. The choir also invokes a different mysterious name, “Yuna,” throughout the symphony. I will leave it to the listener to decide the nature of her identity and purpose.</DISS_para>

      <DISS_content>
         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The following treatise is based on content from two separate lecture recitals that were presented from 2021-2022 at Florida State University. The first lecture was given on December 4th, 2021, covered the topic of the purpose of allusion in select works by Mikhail Johnson, Samuel Adams, and Adam O’Dell, and was followed by a performance of the discussed works. On March 28th, 2022, a second lecture will be presented on Liszt’s Sonata in B Minor that discusses the Faustian and biblical programs associated with the piece. 	The first chapter discusses the possibility of humor, creativity, or homage serving as the purpose for alluding to previous composers. Johnson’s Wach ya HAYDN!, Adams’s Sonatas, and O’Dell’s To Aram from Adam (which I had the privilege of commissioning in 2021) are analyzed, with musical elements such as melody, texture, rhythm, form, and quotation being discussed and compared to music written by the connected past composer.  By examining these pieces and their associations, the author hopes to stimulate discussion and interest in these composers and their fascinating new works. 
	The second chapter discusses two possible programs for Liszt’s Piano Sonata in B Minor. Scholars such as Bertrand Ott propose that the main characters in Goethe’s Faust are the inspiration behind the primary musical themes, while others, like Tibor Szász, advocate for an interpretation of Liszt’s musical symbolism from a religious perspective. In comparing and contrasting these two programs, the author hopes to deepen the reader’s and listener’s appreciation of the work and to give pianists further considerations for interpretation.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Many frequently performed solo trumpet works of the past century have been written by French composers. They are played for jury performances, at recitals, and on stage with symphony orchestras to showcase the virtuosic capabilities of trumpeters worldwide. Of the most commonly performed French pieces, very few were written by women. This is not, however, because of an absence of music. A shift in European gender roles spurred by the Second Industrial Revolution and World Wars ignited a significant increase in the number of women composers and the quality of their work. Unfortunately, gendered or lack of public critical review, securing performance past an initial premiere, and balancing home and professional lives significantly impacted the likelihood that pieces by women would be programmed. As a result, most have been forgotten for decades. The purpose of this treatise is to provide a practical point of reference for musicians interested in the morceaux de concours written by women for the trumpet and cornet at the Paris Conservatory during the twentieth century, while also raising questions about why and how certain works are excluded from the standard solo repertoire.The Paris Conservatory is an exceptional institution in that its professors have been composing original works for their students to perform as contest pieces since its inception. Hundreds of works have been composed for dozens of instruments; 171 works have been written for the trumpet and cornet alone. This large repository of music has produced some works that have become standards in the trumpet repertoire, but of the fifteen pieces written by women, none of them has achieved widespread recognition in the form of recordings, publication, and performances. The barriers women faced for centuries still persist today as it remains a challenge to find recordings, scores, and biographical information about women who composed for solo trumpet. This treatise is a first step in addressing this issue.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Volunteers are critical to the success of the Florida 4-H youth development program. They broaden the scope of county programs and increase program capacity beyond what a single 4-H faculty member could provide. Because of the reliance on volunteers to deliver positive youth development programming, the overall success of the organization could depend on the level of training and support volunteers receive (Arnold et al., 2009). Volunteer development is part of the overall volunteer management system aimed at preparing volunteers for their roles and responsibilities. Those on-going activities could include orientation, supervision, relaying policies and procedures, training, support, feedback, recognition, and continual management (Kyrwood, et al., 2016; Plesak, n.d.). While investing in volunteer development is expensive and time-consuming, it yields positive impacts related to the volunteer and within the organization (Manetti et al., 2015; Malinen &amp; Harju, 2016; Boone et al., 2013). Conversely, when organizations fail to provide effective volunteer leadership or volunteer investment, volunteer satisfaction decreases and volunteers leave resulting in organizational losses (Radhakrishna et al., 2011).	Skills and competencies youth development volunteers should possess have been both researched and established in current literature. They include communication, organizational, subject matter, relational, leadership, technology, time management, facilitation, and teaching skills as well as policy and procedural knowledge and skills directly related to their volunteer roles (Culp et al., 2007; Kok et al., 2020). While there is empirical research on volunteer skills, competencies, motivations, and organizational benefits, research examining the specific resource needs of volunteers is scarce. Thus, how adults learn in the workplace holds implications for volunteer development. Activities like group participation, observing others, working through tasks, and working directly with clients as well as resources like documents, manuals, mentoring, and coaching could assist volunteers with fulfilling their roles and responsibilities (Eraut et al., 2004). In addition, job aids, check lists, videos, and resource sharing could provide further resources for supporting volunteers (Moore et al., 2019). 
	The purpose of this research study was to explore what current resources Florida 4-H provides for its volunteers and to describe the beliefs related to volunteer support between the two stakeholder groups, Florida 4-H volunteers and Florida 4-H faculty members, and how those beliefs might differ between the two groups. Four research questions guided this study:
•	Research Question 1: What resources does Florida 4-H provide for its volunteers?
•	Research Question 2: What resources do Florida 4-H volunteers identify as helpful in fulfilling their roles and responsibilities?
•	Research Question 3: What resources do Florida 4-H faculty members identify as helpful for volunteers to successfully fulfill their roles and responsibilities?
•	Research Question 4: How do the beliefs of Florida 4-H volunteers and Florida 4-H faculty members differ as related to resources helpful in successfully fulfilling volunteer roles and responsibilities? 
The study consisted of an online questionnaire and follow-up interviews with both Florida 4-H volunteers and 4-H faculty members. Survey respondents included 229 volunteers and 32 faculty members. Follow-up interviews were conducted one-on-one with 10 volunteers and 10 faculty members. 
	The results of this study indicated that volunteer resources should be delivered using a wide variety of methods that directly support volunteer work. Resources are particularly needed that support the 4-H club and youth project work. For example, both volunteers and faculty cited a need for training related to parliamentary procedures and resources like checklists and manuals to support running 4-H club meetings. In addition, study results indicated facilitating, improving, and supporting communication between 4-H volunteers and 4-H faculty and 4-H volunteers and Florida 4-H. For example, the Florida 4-H website was identified as lacking in functionality and overall organizational support to volunteers and faculty which directly affected youth and parent stakeholders. Findings from this study could help to establish a framework for resource development to support the Florida 4-H volunteer development program.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>A Suit of Paper Feathers engages landscape, gender, and time through ecopoetic lyricism and site-specificity. Families create syncopated mythologies from the psychic offal of hyperobjects. Rural voices interrogate issues of work and land-use on the fringes of empire. The poems employ a variety of imagined speakers who problematize, interrogate, and celebrate language—often simultaneously. The first section considers land use through an ecopoetic lens, drawing on lived experience in rural and remote places. In the second section, disparate speakers gaze toward consumer capitalism, environmental issues, and imperial decline. A Suit of Paper Feathers is followed by a chapbook-length poem called Theta Decay. The term “theta decay” comes from finance and refers to the rate of decline in the value of an option. In sections titled with other financial and marketing terms, the poem utilizes dislikeable narrators to argue against the complicity of language in the commodification of death. These poems seek a dynamic affinity between linguistic beings and the fragile biome we inhabit.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Little is known about what contributes to individual differences in reading fluency after accounting for accuracy. Previous research has shown individual differences in the relative growth in word and nonword reading, specifically a pattern in which students who start lower on reading grow more in word than nonword reading ability. The purpose of the present study was to test whether this asymmetric growth contributes to individual differences in reading speed. Results showed that the relative growth in untimed word reading accuracy to untimed nonword reading accuracy from 1st to 4th grade contributed significantly to the prediction of 4th grade word reading efficiency after controlling for word reading accuracy. Specifically, those who grew more in untimed word reading accuracy than untimed nonword reading accuracy from 1st to 4th grade were slower readers compared to others with the same current accuracy levels.  </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Visceral feedback from the body plays an important role in guiding motivated behaviors. For example, sensory information from the gut during a state of negative energy balance reduces innate avoidance and anxiety-like behaviors. These visceral signals engage vagal afferents relaying these subconscious “gut feelings” to the caudal nucleus of the solitary tract (cNTS). Within the cNTS, there are two distinct metabolically responsive neuronal populations, the prolactin-releasing peptide (PrRP)-positive noradrenergic A2 neurons and the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1)-positive neurons. Both the PrRP+ A2 and GLP1+ neurons are activated by innate stressors and are implicated in behavioral responses to innate threats. However, whether these neurons are activated by conditioned stressors and whether metabolic state modulates this activation and subsequent conditioned avoidance behavior is unclear. Data in chapter 2 demonstrate that re-exposure to a conditioned context previously paired with a single mild electric footshock induces cFos expression in the PrRP+ A2 neurons, but not the GLP1+ neurons, within the cNTS, and induces cFos expression in neurons within the vlBNST, a brain region that receives significant input from the PrRP+ A2 neurons. Further, overnight food deprivation reduces cFos expression in the PrRP+ A2 neurons and in the vlBNST, and reduces expression, but not acquisition, of conditioned passive avoidance behavior in male rats. These data demonstrate the recruitment of PrRP+ A2 and vlBNST neurons by a conditioned stressor and metabolic modulation of conditioned passive avoidance. 
In Chapter 3, we show that delivery of a ghrelin receptor antagonist prior to the retention test partially restores cFos activation in the PrRP+ A2 neurons and in the vlBNST, and restores conditioned passive avoidance behavior. These data suggest that ghrelin receptor signaling at least partially mediates food deprivation-induced suppression of conditioned passive avoidance and neural activation. 
Considering the parallel modulation of cFos in the PrRP+ A2 neurons/vlBNST neurons and conditioned passive avoidance, we investigated whether this circuit plays a role in the expression of conditioned passive avoidance behavior. In Chapter 4, we find that lesioning noradrenergic inputs to the vlBNST increases the expression of passive avoidance, indicating that these inputs are not necessary, but do contribute to conditioned passive avoidance behavior. Overall, the results of this dissertation suggest that visceral feedback modulates conditioned passive avoidance, and that conditioned passive avoidance is influenced by a vagal afferent-cNTSA2-vlBNST pathway.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Attrition among Emotional/Behavioral Disorder (EBD) teachers in El County School District (ECSD) has been a problem. This study aimed to identify the leading causes of EBD teacher attrition within ESCD. Two research questions were researched to ascertain the causes of attrition: “How do EBD teachers describe their workload manageability in teaching EBD students?” and “What support do EBD teachers receive to manage their workload, and how does the support influence their intention to stay or leave?” An exploratory approach was taken to discover the leading causes of EBD attrition. The research design chosen for this study was a qualitative multiple case study using semi-structured interviews of seven EBD teachers and four administrators who oversee EBD units. It was discovered that workload manageability, mainly teaching and preparing for multiple grade levels, was the most significant source of stress for EBD teachers. It was also found that while administrative support was important to EBD teachers, the type/source of support was not as important as the quality and quantity of support available to manage their workloads. The findings from this study give district-level and school-based administrators a starting point to being intervening to retain their EBD teachers. It is recommended that administrators make sure EBD program built-in supports are appropriately trained to work with EBD students. They must also check in with their EBD teachers to solve problems proactively. Administrators can also ensure that EBD teachers are supported by grade-level teams, school communities, or individuals from the EBD units and have easy access to lesson plans suitable for EBD classrooms. Finally, they can improve data collection and conduct exit interviews of EBD teachers who leave their positions to see what concerns caused them to make this decision.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>El desgaste entre los profesores de trastorno emocional/conductual (EBD) en el Distrito Escolar del Condado de El (ECSD) ha sido un problema. Este estudio tuvo como objetivo identificar las principales causas del desgaste de los profesores de EBD dentro de la DSC. Se investigaron dos preguntas de investigación para determinar las causas del desgaste: "¿Cómo describen los profesores de EBD su capacidad de gestión de la carga de trabajo en la enseñanza de los estudiantes de EBD?" Y "¿Qué apoyo reciben los profesores de EBD para gestionar su carga de trabajo y cómo influye el apoyo en su intención de quedarse o irse?" Se adoptó un enfoque exploratorio para descubrir las principales causas del desgaste de la EBD. El diseño de investigación elegido para este estudio fue un estudio cualitativo de caso múltiple utilizando entrevistas semiestructuradas a siete profesores de EBD y cuatro administradores que supervisan las unidades de EBD. Se descubrió que la gestión de la carga de trabajo, principalmente la enseñanza y la preparación para múltiples niveles de grado, era la fuente más importante de estrés para los profesores de EBD. También se descubrió que, si bien el apoyo administrativo era importante para los profesores de EBD, el tipo/fuente de apoyo no era tan importante como la calidad y la cantidad de apoyo disponible para gestionar sus cargas de trabajo. Los resultados de este estudio dan a los administradores a nivel de distrito y escolar un punto de partida para intervenir para retener a sus profesores de EBD. Se recomienda que los administradores se aseguren de que los soportes integrados del programa EBD estén debidamente capacitados para trabajar con estudiantes de EBD. También deben consultar con sus profesores de EBD para resolver los problemas de forma proactiva. Los administradores también pueden asegurarse de que los maestros de EBD cuenten con el apoyo de equipos de nivel de grado, comunidades escolares o individuos de las unidades de EBD y tengan fácil acceso a planes de lecciones adecuados para las aulas de EBD. Por último, pueden mejorar la recopilación de datos y realizar entrevistas de fin de servicio a los profesores de EBD que abandonan sus puestos para ver qué preocupaciones les hicieron tomar esta decisión.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Difficulties with anger and aggression have been linked to serious youth outcomes with long-term effects including psychopathology and incarceration. In the United States, although the cost to incarcerate a youth varies by state, the national average is $407 per day or $148,767 per year. Youth involved in the juvenile justice system or foster care are more likely to have been exposed to one or more adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) than the general population. Involvement with juvenile justice, foster care, and exposure to ACEs are associated with higher rates of mental health and behavioral struggles, including anger and aggression. Studies of anger and aggression are often focused on anger or aggression in a particular context rather than anger or aggression as concepts and are primarily focused on adults. Additionally, studies of the effects of ACEs have centered primarily on adult mental health outcomes such as depression, anxiety, conduct problems and partner aggression. As such, there are important gaps in the literature in terms of understanding conceptual distinctions between anger and aggression of youth. This bolsters the necessity of studying the concepts of anger and aggression of youth without contextual qualifiers (e.g., in the context of youth sports), from their perspective with particular attention to the role juvenile justice and foster care involvement, or exposure to ACEs may play. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to understand the essence anger and aggression from youths’ perspectives and compare narratives of youth with differing levels of risk.Using social constructionism and developmental trauma frameworks as guides, semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted to understand youths’ experiences of anger and aggression. A phenomenological constructionist approach was used to gain an understanding of the essence of anger and aggression from youths’ experiences. Additionally, demographic information was used to supplement the qualitative findings and a quantitative trauma risk measure was used to screen the level of risk for trauma and connection to the juvenile justice system or foster care youth have and make comparisons among the data. A sample of 27 youth was recruited for this study. Due to the diverse nature of youth who are involved in juvenile justice, foster care, and have experienced trauma or exposure to ACEs, this study sought to include a diverse sample of participants. 
Data analysis was conducted using thematic analysis. The study aimed to address the following research questions: How do youth experience anger? How do youth experience aggression? How do youth differentiate between anger and aggression? And do youth who are at-risk conceptualize or differentiate anger and aggression differently than youth who are not considered at-risk? Results indicated that most youth identified anger and aggression as separate concepts, with anger being more emotion-based and aggression being more action-based. Additionally, while there were many similarities in how youth who were not at-risk and who were “at-risk” defined and experienced anger and aggression, there were some major differences, especially in the ways aggression was understood and experienced. Understanding anger and aggression from the perspective of youth, while considering the role of involvement in juvenile justice, foster care, and exposure to ACEs in their conceptualization of these concepts, may help shape the development of appropriate assessments and treatments and address negative outcomes.

            <DISS_para>Iterative methods are widely used to solve algebraic equations and matrix equations. In fact, they can also be used to solve differential equations. Unlike discretization methods which generate point solutions, iterative methods generate domain solutions that are valid for the whole solution domain. In this dissertation we modify the renormalization iterative method (RIM) defined by Ablowitz and Musslimani to make it more likely to converge, and extend its application from ODEs and PDEs to SDEs, SPDEs and systems of ODEs and SDEs. We show by computing numerous prototype examples that it is a powerful tool for solving both deterministic and stochastic differential equations. We also do some convergence analysis for the method.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Nonmonosex individuals often face higher odds of exposure to trauma and negative outcomes related to medical, mental health and social disparity. Despite growing numbers, research into exposures and risk/resilience and their impact on wellbeing and quality of life for nonmonosex persons has been lacking. This project tested a portion of a newly developed framework, the Nonmonosex Risk/Resilience Processes Framework, aimed at explicating a risk/resilience process unique to nonmonosex persons using path analysis and post hoc analyses. Results indicate poor model fit for the framework and point out a need for model respecification to be considered to attend to nuance, complexity, and the need for further conceptualization of the various relationships between risk/resilience factors, exposures, stress response, and wellbeing/quality of life described in the framework. In the future, model modification and retesting should be undertaken.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Book of Alice embodies the tension between a desire to re-center Black women in the narrative of creation and the Bible’s history of oppression. There are several questions guiding this completion of this project: first, what tensions are created when we transpose a tool of oppression, like Christianity, over Black narratives; what happens when we focalize on the Black narratives that have been erased/whitewashed within the most canonical text in the Western tradition; finally, how might the repositioning of these voices resurrect the Bible as a relevant and revelatory text? The project as a whole is composed of three sections: Genesis, which wrestles with the origins of the main character, Alice, and the reoccurring tension between her desire for self-love and divinity; Exodus, which parallels The Great Migration alongside the narrative of Alice’s eventual passing; and Revelations, which describes the speaker’s journey towards self-love after the death of Alice. The project defines a difference between silence and quiet, acknowledging Kevin Quashie’s (The Sovereignty of Quiet) suggestion that the quiet interior can be a source of liberation. It foregrounds matters of silence as an oppressive force in the project’s explorations of the transmutable South and the Black body’s external reading as “excessive.” The project as a whole undergirds the development of a fat poetics through its focus on Black subjectivity, the importance of folklore, and its genre-challenging range.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In an effort to better understand the language environments of early childhood education (ECE) classrooms with varying proportions of dual language learners (DLLs), we examined the frequency in which adults use various language facilitation strategies. We further investigated the potential classroom characteristics that may predict teacher strategy use and the impact that teacher strategy use may have on DLL children’s lexical and morphosyntactic skills. The study included 21 preschool classrooms and 69 children from a Latine background that spoke Spanish at home. Classroom observations were recorded at three different time points (Fall, Winter, Spring) in one school year. Interval coding was implemented as each observation was randomly divided into three 10-minute segments and coded for frequency of strategy use. A total of 14 strategies were of interest: English-General (n = 5), Spanish-General (n = 5), and DLL-Specific (n = 4) language facilitation strategies.A between-subjects one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated that the frequency in which teachers are using the strategies did not differ by strategy type; however significant interactions between teacher language status (i.e., English-speaking monolingual and Spanish- English speaking bilingual) and strategy use were found. Due to the nested structure of the data, hierarchical linear models (HLM) were examined to analyze how classroom level predictors are linked to teacher strategy use. Results indicated that the proportion of DLLs has significant positive associations with teachers’ use of Spanish general language facilitation strategies and DLL-specific language learning strategies. Finally, two-level HLMs examining the association between strategy use and DLL language outcomes revealed a significant negative association between the use of Spanish general language facilitation strategies and English lexical outcomes.
Further, the analyses revealed significant positive associations between English general language facilitation strategy use and DLL morphosyntactic outcomes. This study informs our understanding of adult-child interactions in ECE programs, classroom language environments for Spanish-speaking DLLs, the frequency of different language facilitation strategies, and the impact that implementation of such strategies may have on DLL children’s language growth. Limitations and implications are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>There are many safety concerns with cryogenic systems around the world such as particle accelerators. One large concern is the sudden loss of vacuum within the particle accelerator systems. Loss of vacuum can lead to catastrophic equipment and facility damage as well as possible personnel injury. To mitigate risk and improve safety during operation of particle accelerator systems, a clear understanding of the dynamic and complex heat and mass transfer processes after a vacuum break is needed. Research in our lab focuses on the simulation of a sudden loss of vacuum in liquid helium cooled superconducting particle accelerator beam-line tubes. Loss of vacuum is simulated using an evacuated copper tube cooled in liquid helium and suddenly venting nitrogen gas from a buffer tank into the tube. Abrupt temperature rise by thermometers mounted to the tube's wall marked the location of the gas propagating front. Previous experiments and analysis in our lab using normal helium (He~I) and preliminary studies in superfluid helium (He II) observed an exponential slowing of the gas propagating front (Dhuley and Vansciver, 2016). Condensation of the nitrogen gas onto the tube walls was shown to be the reason for the exponential slowing, but the underlying analysis and explanation of the gas dynamics and condensation was limited. This dissertation describes the continuation and evolution of our lab's experiments, and improvements in the quantitative analysis to better explain the underlying physical mechanisms of the slowing down process in both He I and He II. Further systematic experimental and simulation work using different mass flow rates into the evacuated tube were conducted to determine the applicability and robustness of the model in both He I and He II. The improved understanding of the physics of a vacuum break in a liquid helium cooled tube could have practical uses by improving particle accelerator safety. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The utilization of sport psychology (SP) and mental performance consultants (MPCs) is becoming a mainstream resource among collegiate athletic programs. Junior colleges have yet to make this transition due to the many unique challenges they face. The primary gatekeepers of junior college athletic programs are the Athletic Directors (ADs), and as such they use their valuable knowledge, skills, and judgment to make hiring related decisions for their departments. Research to date has been minimal when examining junior college SP use and hiring of MPCs, but the information that is available claims that ADs are not knowledgeable enough about the field to make educated and informed decisions about use and hiring. The aim of this study was to examine how an educational workshop would impact AD’s expectancy and value levels for the use of MPCs and SP services. By increasing knowledge of the field, services, and qualifications of MPCs, the hope was to improve perceptions and attitudes while reducing stigma surrounding performance services, which would translate into greater intentions to hire. A total of 713 ADs were emailed (the entire population of junior college ADs) and invited to participate, with 97 completing the pretest, workshop, and posttest. Differences in pretest and posttest expectancy and value scores increased significantly as a result of the workshop. Results from a series of paired t-tests revealed that as a result of the workshop, all four subscales on the Sport Psychology Attitudes Revised-Athletic Directors (SPAR-AD) had significant changes as well as an increase of at least .79 mean points for all of the 10 Knowledge Test questions, resulting in p &lt; .01 for all questions. A McNemar’s test was ran to determine if ADs had shifted readiness levels to use services as a result of the workshop and showed marginal improvement, but not enough to be deemed statistically significant. Significant shifts were also seen in the potential barriers ADs would see as problematic in both pretest and posttest as well as the qualifications of MPCs they would deem desirable. Additionally, ANOVA testing among demographic variables revealed that women were nearly two times more likely to hire and seek out MPCs than males, while most other demographic data did not show differentiation in the above scales. Findings from this study have implications for junior college athletic departments, ADs, athletes, teams, coaches, and researchers and MPCs hoping to gain access to this population.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Children with ADHD frequently demonstrate deficits in working memory as well as across multiple domains of math skills. Working memory is a multi-component system that includes a domain-general central executive (the ‘working’ component of working memory) and two domain specific storage subsystems – phonological short-term memory and visuospatial short-term memory. Extant literature indicates a strong link between neurocognitive deficits in working memory and math skills, however the extent to which each component of the working memory system may account for this relation is unclear. The current study was the first to use bifactor-(S·I-1) modeling to examine the relations between each working/short-term memory component (i.e., central executive, phonological short-term memory, and visuospatial short-term memory), ADHD symptoms, and math skills in a clinically evaluated sample of 186 children ages 8-13 (Mage=10.40, SD=1.49; 69.9% White/Non-Hispanic; 62 girls). Results of the structural equation model indicated that all three working/short-term memory components contribute significantly and approximately equally to children’s math achievement (β=.29-.50, all p&lt;.05). Exploratory bias-corrected, bootstrapped conditional effects modeling indicated that 24% of central executive’s relation with math skills occurs via the ADHD inattentive symptom pathway (95% CI excludes 0.0); neither phonological nor visuospatial short-term memory were associated with ADHD symptoms (95% CIs include 0.0). Sensitivity analyses indicated that these findings were generally robust to prediction of latent vs. specific math skills and held for children with ADHD as well as clinically evaluated children without ADHD. These findings suggest that math skills in children are associated with neurocognitive vulnerabilities in working/short-term memory and to a lesser extent, inattentive ADHD symptoms. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation focuses on the sounded activities and public protest rituals of political witchcrafting in the United States from 1848 through 2021. I define political witchcrafting as a practice that combines political activism with witchcraft-related practices, such as spirit communication, trancing, casting spells, and performing rituals, to create real-world social and political transformation. To craft this history of sounded political witchcrafting, I focus on three case studies: Spiritualism and the mediumship of Cora L. V. Richmond from 1848–1870, public protest rituals performed by Starhawk and the Reclaiming Collective between 1980–2002, and the political hexing rituals of Catland Books, a spiritual bookstore in Brooklyn, NY (2016–2021). The subjects of these studies are connected by their desire to improve the status of marginalized communities, their use of public political witchcrafting, and their belief in the importance of sounded practices in their public performances or rituals. One of the goals of this dissertation is to show that witchcraft has long had a presence in American society, even when it is not as evident in mainstream media or social trends, and that it has historically been a tool of political resistance and social change. It is imperative that researchers listen to and record these histories, especially now, at a time when the rights of women, particularly those of intersecting marginalized identities, are moving to the forefront of feminist and anti-patriarchal political activism. As a musicologist, I seek to render these sounded protest methods of political witchcrafting, including trance speaking, hexing, and spellcasting, as audible and important within the history of American political resistance.
Singing, chanting, dancing, trancing, and spirit communication are important sounded practices within my three case studies and in political witchcrafting more broadly. For example, the Spiritualists often used singing or light conversation to enter a trance state, which allowed the medium to channel the spirits. These spirits spoke through sharp knocking sounds or the vocal cords of the medium to offer insights into the spiritual realm and discuss the importance of equality among all people. The members of Reclaiming used singing, dancing, and chanting at their public protest rituals to fight for the protection of the Earth and all of its inhabitants. The participants who performed hexes at Catland Books used chanting and screaming to heal from personal traumas and challenge the political careers of men such as former president Donald Trump and Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. These sounded practices were important ways to share their political commentary, create community and solidarity among participants, and perform political witchcrafting activities and rituals that advocated for political and social change.  </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This narrative research study attempts to investigate the stories between the participants and the researcher which highlight the influences that growing up in the Gospel music culture may have on the pedagogy of jazz music of these individuals. Furthermore, this research attempts to contextualize the many characteristics of Gospel music that are immediately transferable to jazz music, which in turn could serve as a teaching aid in the jazz idiom. Finally, another objective of this study was to actively engage collegiate jazz educators in sharing meaningful stories about their experiences growing up in an African American church and teaching jazz music.The participants in this study were ten active jazz educators who were selected under the following inclusion criteria: Each participant must (1) have attended an African American church during their lifetime for at least ten years, (2) be currently employed, recently retired from, or frequently hold residencies at a College or University where they taught or coached a large jazz ensemble (big band), jazz combo, or jazz applied lessons, (3) and must have a minimum of 10 year’s experience teaching jazz music. The data collection process consisted of semi-structured interviews in which the participants were asked questions about their backgrounds, church experience, and jazz performance/pedagogy. 
The data collected from the semi-structured interviews were coded and thoroughly analyzed by the researcher, and the following six themes emerged. 1) Ear Training/Oral Tradition 2) Call and Response 3) Response Time 4) Communal Aspect (Mindfulness) 5) Spirituality/Communication 6) Rehearsal/Show planning. These themes were drawn from the data analysis and were labeled as musical and non-musical concepts which were influenced by their experiences with black Gospel music in the African American church. The participants use these in their daily jazz pedagogy. Implications and suggestions for future research are discussed.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Both textual and archaeological data suggest that Sardinia’s ores were extensively exploited for silver, lead, iron and copper, from the Late Bronze Age to the Byzantine period (Balmuth 
1992). Yet the spatial organization of this exploitation is poorly understood, especially in the 
region of the Sulcis Mountains. Considering the evidence for dense settlement of Sulcis from the 
Bronze Age through Roman periods, understanding if these resources were exploited, and if so 
how and to what extent, should be a priority for research (Melis 2014). However, the nature of 
the topography (rugged and dissected uplands) means that types of archaeological prospection 
reliant on pedestrian observation (i.e., fieldwalking) are not possible. Analysis of remotely 
sensed (RS) data has been used in other contexts to explore the spatial organization of this type 
of landscape exploitation (Pryce and Adams 2010; Savage et al. 2012; Sivitskis et al. 2019). This 
project, in the larger context of the Landscape Archaeology of Southwest Sardinia Project 
(LASS) — utilizes RS methods to remotely evaluate the existence and structure of antique 
mining and quarrying sites. This directly contributes to our understanding of the economic 
organization of Sulcis in the BA and IA and has broader methodological implications. Through 
the use of three varied approaches reliant on the analysis of RS imagery, an effective method for 
identifying likely ancient mining and mineral processing sites can be established. This project 
integrates a broad hydrothermal alteration land classification (iron-oxide band ratio), a target slag 
heap identification technique and ore deposit (mining waste) identification techniques to 
establish the certainty of mining activity zones. Positive identification in all three approaches
indicates a high likelihood mining zone, only two, an intermediate, and one, an unlikely or 
random zone. The analysis outcomes indicate that the uplands of the Sulcis region are mineral 
rich and marked by significant alteration hotspots.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>As a low-impact activity that can cover longer distances than walking, cycling is not only good for older adult’s health, but can also be a viable low-cost mode of transportation. Cycling can allow older adults to maintain mobility, which in turn is crucial for their health, wellbeing, and quality of life. In addition, cycling can improve quality of life among older adults through expansion of social networks and increased life-space areas. Research has shown an increase in cycling among the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic, but points to regional heterogeneity. This study builds on previous work by exploring COVID’s impact on older cyclists (65+) residing in a small, auto-centric urban area. Further, this study took a first step at exploring older adults’ intent to maintain cycling habits post-pandemic. Although the majority of the survey respondents did not report any significant changes to their cycling habits, the findings suggest that in some cases new habits of cycling more often, longer distances, or for new purposes were formed. For others, the pandemic was associated with negative impacts that lead to a reduction in cycling levels or even complete cycling cessation. A survey (n = 198) demonstrated that, on average, cycling frequency decreased and average distance/trip increased among the study sample. This suggests a less pronounced impact among older adults residing in a small urban area, compared to other cohorts. However, interviews (n = 24) showed that cycling during the pandemic was associated with feelings of accomplishment, enjoyment, improved self-esteem, and increased freedom by allowing participants to get out despite social distancing requirements. Further, among respondents reporting increased cycling (n=76), most (79%) plan to maintain cycling habits post-pandemic, citing reasons such as personal health, enjoyment, and the social aspect of cycling. The findings from this study suggests that changing incentives and exposure to new experiences can lead to changed travel behavior among older adults. These findings could thus in turn support efforts promoting cycling among older adults, pointing to aspects for designing voluntary travel behavior change (VTBC) programs. Five (5) main takeaways for successful VTBC programs aimed at encouraging active transportation among older adults are presented including cycling as social opportunities; promoting flexible work hours; targeting “windows of opportunities”; establishing “try it out” cycling programs for older adults; along with the need for continued motivation and repetition.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Cosa (modern Ansedonia, Italy), a Latin colony founded in 273 BCE on a waterless, calcareous, brecciated limestone hill in Etruria, depended solely on rainwater for its survival and as such the site is provisioned with dozens of features to collect and store water.  Previous scholarship notes the necessity of these rainwater harvesting features, however, no complete synthesis of them has ever been undertaken.  Furthermore, although ubiquitous in the compluvium/impluvium of the Roman house, rainwater harvesting, and particularly that of non-domestic contexts, has not received emphasis in Classics or archaeology.  This study therefore seeks to fill this gap by examining the mechanisms of rainwater harvesting and storage implemented to contend with the environment of Cosa during the Roman Republican and Imperial periods, alongside comparative rainwater harvesting features from the contemporary Mediterranean, in order to understand the settlement’s water management scheme and how competitive euergetism associated with monumental rainwater harvesting shaped the colony’s history.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>First, I delve into Cosa’s ecology, which made the promontory waterless but the hinterland marshy, and how it dictated the Cosan settlers’ acute concern for non-domestic rainwater harvesting.  Then, I investigate the socio-political implications of water management, proposing that the non-domestic rainwater harvesting system of Cosa offered an arena for intense competition among local grandees who sought to gain notoriety and power through building and administrating waterworks.  I demonstrate how elements of the ecological situation of Cosa effected the settlement, which suffered cyclical periods of growth and decline over its long history.  These questions about the colony’s approach to water management reveal historical and socio-cultural facets of the colony, such as the euergetic behavior and prestige associated with cistern construction as well as how water-related illness impacted the population.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation is composed of three papers, all using modern applied econometric methods that try to isolate causal estimates in several important settings. Each chapter examines social and formal institutions on the well-being of children.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The first chapter studies the importance of parental presence for children's adulthood labor market outcomes. Through interactions with their parents, a child develops the basic foundations for cognitive and non-cognitive skills that directly shape their adulthood economic well-being. Motivated by this critical role, a large body of research has sought to uncover the consequences of disruptions to family structure and parental inputs on a child's development. Despite its importance, we know relatively little about the consequences of the most severe form of parental absence: the death of a parent. Empirical evidence of the long-run causal effects of parental death has been limited since it requires sufficient longitudinal data and plausibly exogenous variation in parental mortality. To overcome these challenges in the literature, I make use of a rich dataset of over 180,000 historical mining accidents and link individual accident victims to the full-count U.S. Census. Doing so allows me to follow the sons of mining accident victims through to adulthood and study the causal effects of parental death on economic well-being. To identify the causal impact of parental death, I compare the adulthood outcomes of children of fatal mining accident victims to children whose parents suffered a serious but non-fatal mining accident. I find that, compared to children of non-fatal mining accident victims, bereaved children experienced nearly four percent lower wage income during adulthood. Further analyses reveal the most severe effects stem from those that lost their parent at an early age. Specifically, adults who were younger than primary school age when they lost their fathers had roughly 15 percent lower wages. Exploring potential channels, I show that most of the estimated earnings penalty can be attributed to differences in employment along both the intensive and extensive margins and is not due to differences in human capital accumulation. Bereaved sons were more likely to be out of work, report unemployment assistance, and work fewer weeks. Together, these employment channels can account for more than 60 percent of the estimated loss of adulthood income. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The second chapter of this dissertation, coauthored with E. Jason Baron (a classmate at Florida State University) and Joseph P. Ryan (Professor of Social Work at the University of Michigan), examines the sources of over-representation of Black children in foster care systems and the causal effects of one popular reform that seeks to reduce this over-representation. The program, known as "blind removals," conceals demographic characteristics of children at-risk for foster care placement from child welfare professionals weighing whether or not to remove the child from their home. We present the first quantitative analysis of blind removals by examining a comprehensive administrative dataset of the universe of child maltreatment investigations in Michigan and presents two main findings. First, the over-representation of Black children in foster care systems is almost entirely driven by Black children being twice as likely to be investigated for child maltreatment as White children. Conditional on initial rates of investigation, White and Black children are placed in foster care at similar rates. Second, the study finds no evidence that blind removals impacted the already small racial disparities in the removal decision, but the program substantially increased the time to removal.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The final chapter of this dissertation, coauthored with two classmates from Florida State University (E. Jason Baron and Cullen T. Wallace), highlights the link between educators and child maltreatment reporting.  Roughly four in ten children experience child maltreatment by the time they reach adulthood. Importantly, teachers, guidance counselors, school psychologists, and other school workers are mandated reporters of suspected child maltreatment, and education personnel are the primary reporting source of suspected child maltreatment. To combat the spread of COVID-19, most K-12 public schools in the U.S. canceled in-person classes. While several studies have highlighted the costly effects of COVID-19 learning losses, time away from school could also negatively impact children through a much less explored channel: a broken link between reporters and victims of child maltreatment. The study uses county-level data from Florida to estimate a counterfactual distribution of child maltreatment allegations for March and April 2020, the first two months in which Florida schools closed. While one would expect the financial, mental, and physical stress due to COVID to result in more child maltreatment cases, we find that the actual number of reported allegations was 15,000 lower (27 percent) than expected for these two months in Florida (and roughly 212,500 nationwide.) The results yield important implications: while school closures may be effective at halting the spread of COVID-19, policymakers should consider the under-reporting of child maltreatment when evaluating the cost-benefit analyses of keeping schools closed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Quantifying Earth’s carbon budget remains an imperative task in the carbon cycle science community. Among its challenges, assessing carbon fluxes over the Arctic Ocean remains an arduous task, due to its remoteness and difficulty to observe. While the global oceans take up carbon in the net, the Arctic Ocean has been found to be regionally variable in both flux sign and magnitude. Coupled with a warming climate and declining sea ice, future projections of the Arctic carbon budget are highly uncertain. As the Arctic climate rapidly  warms, there is a critical need for understanding its observed changes and variability, but a lack of long-term observations has historically hindered progress. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This work analyzes measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) mixing ratios from an 8-year dataset of measurements obtained over Arctic sea ice (the O-Buoy Network; 2009–2016). These observations, along with measurements from coastal observatories, were analyzed and interpreted with an atmospheric chemical transport model. This model reproduced the observed features of the seasonal cycle and shows that terrestrial biosphere fluxes and synoptic transport explain most CO2 variability over the surface of the Arctic Ocean. Interannually, the coastal observations were more comparable in overall CO2 growth than concurrent measurements over sea ice. Evidence indicating the presence of ocean gas exchange in and around sea ice during periods where this growth discrepancy occurs is discussed. In addition, a Lagrangian trajectory model and airmass contact tracers were used to gain insight into upwind source and sink regions of CO2 residuals over Utqiagvik, Alaska, and O-Buoys within the Beaufort Gyre during distinct periods based on the mean seasonal cycle of CO2. It was found that the terrestrial Arctic-boreal zone did not provide the carbon emissions expected for the large CO2 residual events. Finally, the O-Buoy observations are assimilated into an atmospheric inversion, along with additional datasets of satellite and surface observations. The inversions demonstrated the value of incorporating O-Buoy observations, which helped to constrain scaling factors for ocean and land fluxes over the northern high latitudes. Overall, this work highlights the importance of obtaining continuous observations over the Arctic and Arctic Ocean during this era of rapid biogeochemical change.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>A large amount of research has been conducted in the area of teacher retention as it relates to the impact teachers have on student achievement and closing the achievement gap. Retaining highly effective teachers each year helps ensure students are provided with high quality and rigorous instruction. Teacher retention is imperative in areas of high poverty, where schools experience the greatest amount of teacher shortages each year (Reitman &amp; Karge, 2019). This sequential mixed methods study investigates the role that teacher support plays in the retention of beginning teachers in secondary Title I schools and examines the relationship between the support the teacher receives and the likelihood they will return to teaching. The study found that teachers who receive support from a mentor throughout the year were most likely to plan to return teaching in the following year. Teachers without a consistent mentor were more likely to not return to teaching or be unsure of returning to teaching in the following year. While the school district facilitates the identification of the mentors during the teacher induction program, it is the responsibility of the teacher and mentor to actively participate in the relationship. The findings of this study will be shared with the school district to support future implementation of beginning teacher support and mentor teachers.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Career and College Promise Program, North Carolina’s dual enrollment program, was designed to allow all eligible high school students a chance to participate in college courses prior to high school graduation.  Although many high school students take advantage of this opportunity, eligible Black high school students in Bladen County do not participate in the college transfer pathways portion of the program at the same rates as their White classmates.  This study aimed to explore the factors that contribute to eligible Black high school students decision to enroll in the dual enrollment program.  As this was a qualitative case study, geographically bounded, students were purposely selected based on several prerequisites to include: race, high school grade point average, and college plans after high school.  Participants agreed to participate in face-to-face or virtual interviews, using Zoom, where a semi-structured interview was conducted in one hour or less.  This study found that participants of the dual enrollment program had support from parents, siblings, and friends who were college educated or knowledgeable of the program.  This study also found that participants who did not participate in the program lacked the support and guidance of parents and friends who were knowledgeable about the program.  One of the main findings amongst participants who were not enrolled in the dual enrollment program is that they did not understand the purpose of the college transfer program and how it might benefit them and their future goals.  Additionally, this study found that non-participants were not aware of their eligibility.  This study found that high school students are more likely to participate in a dual enrollment program when there is a targeted effort to educate and recruit them.  High school students are more likely to listen to their peers than to college officials who they have not built a relationship with.  Additionally, a student is more likely to enroll in the Career and College Promise Program when they have a parent who is actively engaged in their academic plans.  Several recommendations surfaced from this study to include hosting an assembly for all eligible students at each high school in the county, hosting an information session for school officials in order to educate and dispel any myths or rumors, and advertising within the local community in order to gain support from the community.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Coastal areas serve as vital habitat for many marine fishes. Estuaries are a type of coastal system in which freshwater input often drives broad gradients of environmental variables while transporting fluvial nutrient subsidies to marine systems. Increased nutrient levels contribute significantly to estuarine productivity, while wide ranges of abiotic conditions provide a diverse collection of environmental niches on both spatial and temporal scales. We aimed to understand the influence of environmental variables on the distribution and abundance of fishes as well as the contribution of various nutrient sources to fish biomass, both of which are necessary information for devising appropriate management strategies for commercially and recreationally exploited species in coastal systems. We documented large fish community structure in the Apalachicola Bay system (ABS) from 2018 to 2021 using fishery-independent longline and gillnet surveys. Spatiotemporal variation in fish assemblages was evaluated with permutational multivariate ANOVA, while community- and species-level habitat relationships were described across gradients of environmental variables with non-metric multidimensional scaling and generalized additive models. With samples collected from these surveys, we used carbon (δ 13C) and sulfur (δ 34S) stable isotope mixing models to identify the contribution of prey sources in a fluvial-dominated estuarine habitat relative to nearby seagrass and offshore reef habitats to five species of migratory shark. Fish communities varied spatially throughout the system, and changes in these communities were most strongly correlated with gradients in salinity, clarity, and depth. Sharks exhibited a strong reliance on prey from fluvial-dominated habitat with the youngest individuals displaying the highest reliance relative to larger individuals. We documented higher species richness and density of young elasmobranchs in our surveys compared to adjacent systems, supporting past suggestions that this area serves as important juvenile shark habitat.  These findings illustrate the importance of a fluvial-dominated estuarine system to migratory marine predators in providing both habitat and important nutrient sources, especially in early life-stages. Changes to river-flow regimes could disrupt both the availability of diverse niches along a gradient of river-influence and the transport of fluvial nutrients to coastal marine systems, ultimately impacting migratory predator populations and their role in transporting these nutrients across the seascape.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Community of practice (CoP) of research data curators is a relationship group of data curators with shared values that comes together to network and share their knowledge and ideas. By joining the CoP of research data curators, members can get learning opportunities, have a chance to meet various experts, and can build professional networks. This study examined the activities of CoP of research data curators, including their community building and maintenance activities, by using activity theory as its main theoretical framework. The study used an embedded multiple-case study design for exploring the activities of three CoP of research data curators, including their community building and maintenance activities. The case study design used document analysis and semi-structured interviews to collect data. We conducted 15 individual interviews and 3 group interviews with 23 participants in total. We used thematic content analysis to analyze the collected data. 
The study found that for building a CoP, it was necessary to recruit members and make an initial investment. In addition, to maintain the CoP continuously, establishing a financial sustainability model was needed and membership must be managed. Membership was largely divided into institutional membership and individual membership, and the motives for members to join and contribute to the CoP vary from extrinsic to intrinsic motivations. Besides the community building and maintenance activities, other activities were performed in the CoP of research data curators, which could be largely divided into curation activities, education activities, and communication activities. We also identified three roles played by members in those activities: PI/chair(s), curators, and coordinator(s)/assistant director. Moreover, the study’s findings include the tools used and skills needed in the CoP activities. Finally, we identified and categorized challenges and success indicators for CoP of research data curators as perceived by participants. In particular, we identified three types of challenges or contradictions the communities faced and 13 perceived indicators of success. 
This study informs the practice of research data curation by providing a knowledge base for building and maintaining a CoP of research data curators. Also, the study expands the theoretical base for studying CoP by providing an activity theoretic examination of CoP of research data curators. The future research will extend this study by examining additional cases of CoP with diverse regional compositions, and well as by investigating interactions and knowledge sharing among the CoP of research data curators and scholarly societies and research communities.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Deaner is the story of Dean Hauser, a metalhead who becomes a cult celebrity after starring in a mockumentary based on an amped-up version of himself—The Deaner. After two years of fame he’s at wits end, spiraling out of control. On the verge of self-destruction, he disappears, off to reinvent himself as the polar opposite of what he was. When the novel opens, he’s five years out of the spotlight, now a golf junky and closet alcoholic in the Florida Panhandle, where he hustles matches alongside an ex-All American named Deeda. The money is good. Times are nice. Then Deeda’s husband dies in a freak accident and in a haze of grief, she and Dean get hustled for a sum they can’t repay. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The second half follows them as they travel to Nebraska in order to convince the director and co-star of The Deaner that it’s time to make a sequel. Vandy, the director, had a successful run shooting high-budget commercials, but a medical malpractice suit against her husband has recently uprooted everything. Rudd, the co-star—an elite athlete who had a promising college football career derailed by James Joyce—ultimately confides in Dean that he’s been diagnosed with terminal cancer. It is his dying wish that they pour everything they’ve got into the performance. As Dean goes further into character, what’s real and what’s fiction becomes increasingly blurred.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The present study revisits both historically and analytically the work of Ernst Troeltsch (1865–1923), centering its interpretive lens primarily around his various theoretical and methodological contributions to Religionswissenschaft.  Roughly analogous to what we today would call or recognize as the wide-ranging and arguably loosely-knit field of religious studies, Troeltsch’s approach to Religionswissenschaft was an expression of foundational epistemological debates that affected the entire disciplinary matrix of the emerging cultural (Kultur-) or human sciences (Geisteswissenschaften).  Troeltsch transcribed how the study of religion had reoccupied deep philosophical issues connected to the eighteenth-century question of the relationship between the Enlightenment ideal of Reason and the traditional or premodern theistic self-understanding of Western civilization.  The dissolution of the dogmatic Christian worldview and its adjoining conception of Church authority was the starting-point for Troeltsch’s multipronged justification of Religion as a viable category.  The autonomy of scientific socio-historical inquiry meant that the operative “theoretical horizon” of the History-of-Religions School had turned “comparative” while being irreversibly “expanded to include the totality of human religions”; Troeltsch’s liberal theology would also have to forego conversation-stopping appeals to “supernatural revelation” (übernatürlichen Offenbarung) (1991b, 87–88).               
Troeltsch’s framework for Religionswissenschaft matured during the late nineteenth century and through the First World War.  He was an early twentieth-century heir of German Idealism, suffering through a generational post-Hegelian philosophical malaise that culminated in collective fears about civilizational anomie, a crisis of values and meaning.  Troeltsch interpreted Nietzsche’s madman prophecies about the death of God—viz., the onset of European Nihilismus and the “overcoming” (Überwindung) of Christian metaphysics, morality, and culture by means of a triumphant will-to-power—as a condensed symbol and direct assault on both Enlightenment rationalism and Western religious consciousness.  Haunted by Relativismus (both ethical and epistemological), Troeltsch’s socio-cultural writings on the conflict-ridden modern “spirit” (Geist) had a taste for melodramatic mandarin themes of spiritual bankruptcy and cultural collapse.  Sadly, the tragic course of historical events would prove that he was no alarmist:  Troeltsch presciently foresaw that this profound irrationalist deformation in German philosophy was linked to a budding propensity for post-truth barbaric statolatry.         </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Troeltsch retraced these cultural anxieties, which were aggravated by the dizzying pace of accelerated social change, to the modern scientific disenchantment of the cosmos and its heightened sense of “historical consciousness” (historische Bewußtsein)—defined loosely as a deepening insight into the plurality of worldviews and the contingency of religious reasons, cultural values, and practical forms of rationality.  Troeltsch wrote seriously about “Die Krisis des Historismus” (1922) as an epistemological and cultural problem, and he fully integrated this concern into his thinking about Religionswissenschaft, Kulturgeschichte, and the post-WWI future of Europäismus.  Troeltsch finalized his career in Berlin as a prestigious philosopher of culture dedicated to building a democratic Weimar Republic, critiquing nationalist power politics, and situating Christian liberal theology and ethics within the broader socio-historical discourse of comparative Weltreligionen.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Analytic respect for the content of Troeltsch’s constructive project reveals systematicity and coherence.  Regarding the nature of historical consciousness and its relationship to religious consciousness, the foundational concerns of Religionswissenschaft steered Troeltsch headlong into many longstanding and definitive problems within the Western philosophical tradition.  “The systematic study of religion,” Troeltsch summarized in 1922, exhibits its greatest depth and power in the way it summons the mind to confront the antinomy of “metaphysics and history,” placing “both sets of problems in intimate crossfertilization” (1991b, 366).  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The constructive portion of Troeltsch’s Religionswissenschaft settled on critical idealism, a Baden Neo-Kantian conception of transcendental freedom and rationality that made ample room for faith while limiting philosophy’s traditional metaphysical ambitions.  Hegel’s ontological excesses and theological oversteps rendered his teleological philosophy of history into a crude self-glorification fantasy, but Troeltsch found it important not to throw the idealist baby out with the Absolutist bathwater.  Functioning as a Neo-Kantian “value theory” (Werttheorie), Troeltsch’s Religionswissenschaft offered an epistemology and philosophy of culture which presupposed a normative conception of rationality that seeks out universal validity in its basic ends or value-orientations.  Moreover, Troeltsch’s philosophy of religion reincorporated Schleiermacher’s mystical notion of “religious consciousness” (religiöse Bewußtsein) right into the very heart of Kant’s tripartite economy of practical reason—that is, operative within and underlying rationality in its self-legislating theoretical, moral, and aesthetic forms.  Troeltsch believed it was necessary to be suspicious and critical toward all concrete claims of Absoluteness, but idealism’s obsession with the problem of normative rationality and its relation to das Absolute could not be completely vanquished or pragmatically deflated.  Troeltsch’s Werttheorie operates formally as a species of epistemological transcendentalism, holding that autonomous and valid ideals provide some sort of a priori bulwark against historicist relativism in its many guises (1999, 45).  Troeltsch ultimately endorsed Platonismus—an ontologically grounded metaphysics of value—and theistic Personalismus.  These overbeliefs carried him beyond the sphere of Religionswissenschaft proper, but Troeltsch nevertheless saw the scientific discipline as being compatible with a liberal and non-dogmatic Christian lifeworld (Lebenswelt) and faith (Glaubenslehre).</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In the United States, postsecondary educational attainment positively correlates to the probability of a person being employed and the amount of money they earn (U.S. Department of Labor, 2018). Financial aid programs attempt to help students afford, remain in, and finish their postsecondary pursuits, but Levin (1989) asserted some forms of assistance produce more significant results than others. On one hand, researchers have found the more financial aid a student receives, the higher their chances are of being retained year over year or completing their studies (Bettinger, 2015; Castleman &amp; Long, 2016; Millea et al., 2018; Upton, 2016). On the other hand, researchers have found financial aid to have little to no impact on retention or completion (Carruthers &amp; Özek, 2016; Hawley &amp; Rork, 2013; Welch, 2014). Further investigation was necessary to find and promote financial aid programs that can unequivocally improve postsecondary educational attainment. Although researchers have studied various financial aid programs, the financial aid fee at Florida’s public postsecondary 2-year institutions stands out for its uniqueness and vagueness. This exceptional program is a mandatory charge students pay, but it is also financial assistance awarded to students. Florida’s state colleges have considerable discretion to choose how much financial aid fees they charge and how to use the resulting revenue to award financial assistance (Florida K–20 Education Code Act, 2002a; Florida K–20 Education Code Act, 2002b). This dissertation was significant because it sought to fill an apparent gap in the literature by questioning how Florida’s state colleges implement the financial aid fee—from both the fee and financial assistance perspectives—to address affordability, retention, and graduation problems.
A mixed-method design was used to answer the central research question of how Florida’s public state colleges implement the financial aid fee. Research was divided into three stages to triangulate findings. In Stage 1, public financial aid fee information available on the internet was collected from all 28 of Florida state colleges. Stage 2 involved surveying financial aid and business office staff from 25 of Florida’s state colleges. Finally, a purposefully selected sample of 12 respondents from the second phase whose colleges met predetermined peer analysis criteria was interviewed in a semistructured format during Stage 3.
Results suggested many college officials have not assessed, adjusted, or thought about their financial aid fee implementation for years. Those who have are sometimes suppressed by unwritten rules imposed by legislators. Accordingly, Florida’s public state colleges seem to be implementing the financial aid fee in an uncomplicated and unconscious manner. Top-level executives appear practically responsible for financial aid fee decision making, despite stakeholders with different titles located within various departments being involved with implementation. Indicators insinuate athletics plays a pivotal role at numerous colleges, but politics, mission and vision, return on investment, “large rocks,” “doughnut holes,” and logistics are salient financial aid fee considerations.
State politicians are advised to rescind unwritten tuition and fee rules, amend existing financial aid fee statutes, and create authority for colleges to charge a distinct athletic fee. Institutional administrators should improve financial aid fee communication and branding, evaluate program efficacy, and include a wider array of stakeholders in implementation processes. Researchers are asked to expand upon this study’s foundational implementation knowledge by causally investigating financial aid fee outcomes.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Stroke is a leading causing of death and disability world-wide, and yet, few options for therapeutic treatment exist. Cell therapies, particularly human bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC), have elicited particular interest recently. Of the approximately 29 clinical trial studies worldwide, none however has yet established a robust hMSC approach to treat stroke, largely due to variance with in vivo stem cell response and varying preconditioning metrics. This work describes the development of unique magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy (MRI/S) methods to assess early markers of tissue recovery in response to hMSC-derived therapies in ischemic stroke. Combining 23Na MRI and 1H MRS provides a highly sensitive, multinuclear approach enabling real time monitoring of the in vivo efficacy of hMSC therapies by probing ionic and energetic homeostasis, starting at therapeutic administration through the evolution of disease progression and recovery. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Utilizing a preclinical cerebral ischemia model, this work demonstrates that these highly sensitive MR metrics can discern therapeutic efficacy and assess the differential impacts of 2D and 3D hypoxic preconditioning on hMSC when applied in vivo. The early assessment provided by MR evaluation correlate positively with extended neurological recovery assessed by neuromotor analysis and immunohistochemistry as well as with in vitro assays and ischemic challenges over extended cell culture. With the aid of a novel method to label hMSC-derived extracellular vesicles for investigating biodistribution and therapeutic efficacy of the hMSC secretome, enhanced MR sensitivity further provides insight into the mechanism of action by these stem cells. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Overall, results demonstrate the superior benefits of intra-arterially injected hMSC that are pre-conditioned using 3D aggregation with respect to the recovery of ionic and metabolic homeostasis both at the lesion and systemically. However, hypoxically conditioned 2D hMSC and extracellular vesicles also displayed improvement in ionic and metabolic recovery over untreated ischemia. These approaches (e.g., 3D versus 2D culture or direct cell implantation versus extracellular vesicles) have significant ramifications for the feasible translation of hMSC into clinical use. With the ability to monitor treatment efficacy with MR techniques, these preconditioning steps can be developed further to aid in refinement of cell and extracellular vesicle preparation at clinically relevant scales as they are moved towards therapeutic implementation for ischemic stroke.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The diverse Hispanic/Latino population is the fastest-growing minority in the United States. This community faces specific barriers and multiple inequalities when seeking medical health care in the U.S. Moreover, there are particular challenges to seeking mental health services, such as language barriers, poverty, and cultural perceptions, among others. Music therapists must keep up with the changes in the overall population to ensure providing quality and ethical services to clients who identify as Hispanic or Latino. This research aims to present culturally relevant information to clinicians working with Hispanic or Latino persons.An extensive review of literature was completed, yielding cultural subsections addressing specific issues to be considered from a clinical standpoint. The topics addressed in this research were cultural overview, race taxonomy, identity, language and communication, religion, gender, immigration and generations, and mental health. Music therapists, educators, health care professionals, and individuals who identified as Hispanic or Latino were asked to authenticate this material via an interview process. These participants in this research provided feedback on the cultural subsections and shared their perspectives of commonalities and differences with the information presented. The researcher incorporated the participants' viewpoints into each cultural subsection. 
The mental health topics discussed in this dissertation followed the structure of the fifth edition of the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). The researcher included the DSM-5 suggested Cultural Formulation Interviews (CFI) at the end of each cultural subsection or topic. In addition, an annotated list of songs recommended for counseling-based interventions and a guide of sing-along songs was included as a resource for music therapists.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>     This treatise presents information about the composer André Caplet (1878-1925) and selected poets whose works he set to music. The primary focus of this document will be the lesser known and performed published songs of Caplet for voice and piano: Chanson d'automne (Autumn Song), Deux Poèmes de Charles Baudelaire (Two Poems of Charles Baudelaire), Dans la Fontaine (In The Fountain), Détresse (Distress), Doux fut le trait (Sweet Was The Arrow), En regardant ces belles fleurs (Looking At These Beautiful Flowers), Hymne à la naissance du matin (Hymn to the Birth of the Morning), Lon lon la, La croix douloureuse (The Painful Cross), La part à Dieu The Part To God), Nuit d'automne (Autumn Night), Paroles à l'absente (Words to the Absent), Prière normande (Prayer from Normandy), and Tu nous souriais (You Were Smiling At Us).     This guide will be useful for singers and coaches wishing to study or perform his repertoire. Brief biographical information about the composer and each poet will be included as well as historical information on Caplet’s mélodies. Each poem will be transliterated using the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) and will include a word-for-word English translation in addition to a poetic translation. 
     In addition to these translations, each piece will be evaluated addressing the following elements: voice type, singer expertise, range, tessitura, phrase concerns, rhythmic intricacy, coloratura requirements, poetic complexity, accompaniment issues, dynamic expectations, duration, and stamina to name a few. Availability of commercial recordings will also be provided. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Bi2Sr2CaCu2Ox (Bi-2212) round wire is one of the most promising candidates for high field magnet applications. The round wire geometry is preferred by the magnet designers as it shows isotropic superconducting properties independent of the direction of the applied magnetic field. The wire is multifilamentary and can be twisted, which ensures low screening current and AC loss. Over the last decade, significant advancement has been made in Bi-2212 conductor and coil technology. The advent of overpressure processing and improvement of powder quality have significantly improved the critical current density (Jc) of the wire while development of insulation and mechanical reinforcement of the coil winding pack have brought Bi-2212 on the verge of commercial applications. However, there are still areas that needs further development and better understanding. I have worked on some of those issues during my PhD.As part of this thesis, I have worked on TiO2 insulation of Bi-2212 wire. When the TiO2 insulation was developed, it was thought to be great replacement for the alumino-silicate insulation as it is much thinner (15-30 µm compared to 150 µm thickness of alumino-silicate), chemically compatible with the sheath and Bi-2212 and allows oxygen transfer during the heat treatment through the cracks and porosity present in TiO2 layer. However, attempts to use TiO2 as single layer insulation in a large test coil in our lab resulted in severe Ag protrusion through the insulation layer which electrically shorted the winding pack. We have found that, the application of overpressure and the uneven distribution of MgO particles in the sheath, which led to local difference in mechanical properties of the sheath, was responsible for the Ag protrusion for the wire used in that particular coil. The Ag protrusions were found to be depleted of the MgO particle and as a result, was squeezed through the TiO2 layer when the wire shrinked under the application of overpressure. However, later, when we studied 9 different wires from different time period, we found that Ag protrusions are not universal and most of the wires do not show any protrusion through the sheath.
Different possible current limiting factors in Bi-2212 round wire was also investigated. Evidence of filament area variation along the length (sausaging) was found in as-received Bi-2212 wires (before heat treatment). This sausaging occurs from the wire drawing procees and some of the filaments showed a variation as high as 50% along the wire length in as received state. This type of sausaging is possibly a significant current limiting factor in Bi-2212 wire. The filament area variation along the length further deteriorates during the heat treatment with increased time spent in the melt state (tmelt). This area fluctuations in the melt state happen due to Raleigh instability and is more significant for smaller filaments. As a result, the performance of wires with smaller filaments were found to be more dependent on tmelt compared to larger filaments.
The formation of interfilament bonds and their role in controlling the Jc of Bi-2212 round wire was examined. For years, the so-called type A interfilament bonding, which occur when the superconductor is in melt state and increases with increased tmelt and decreased interfilament separation, was believed to be the underlying reason for tmelt dependence of Jc. However, the mechanism of how the interfilament bonding impacts Jc was not fully understood. In my research, I have found that interfilament bonding significantly increase the Rayleigh instability driven area fluctuations in Bi-2212 filament cross-sections during the melt state. The larger bonded region grows at the expense of nearby unbonded regions to reduce the interfacial energy and create bottlenecks which is a possible reason for Jc dependence on the amount of type A bonding. This fluctuation is higher in wires with smaller interfilament separation, i.e. higher interfilament bonding, and filaments can undergo large area fluctuation and eventual pinch-off along the length with increased tmelt. 
We have also investigated the impact of filament size on the Jc of Bi-2212 wires. Our results show that the texture of Bi-2212 grains possibly depends on the filament size and decreased filament size can potentially lead to better aligned grains and higher Jc in bi-2212 round wires.

            <DISS_para>College student leadership development is a commonly stated learning outcome in U.S. higher education including doctoral education. This dissertation study examines the leadership development of international doctoral students in Education at a U.S. university using a socialization lens. I employed a phenomenological qualitative inquiry and conducted nine semi-structured interviews with international doctoral students studying Education. The findings of this study indicate participants’ socialization experiences were shaped by their motivations for pursuing doctoral degrees while they were prospective students. Additionally, part of these international doctoral students’ socialization experiences including their academic and professional experiences and supports from their major professors contributed to their understanding of and development of leadership in their doctoral programs. Findings of this study provide valuable implications for higher education researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to better understand the socialization and leadership development experiences of international doctoral students with considering these students’ pre-doctoral experiences holistically, from which specific programs or services can be offered to better meet international doctoral students’ needs during their doctoral journey. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>        The nonequivalent-groups anchor-test (NEAT) data-collection design is commonly used in large-scale assessments.  Under this design, different test groups take different test forms. Each test form has its own unique items and all test forms share a set of common items.  If item response theory (IRT) models are applied to analyze the test data, the estimates of item parameters in different test forms and ability scores of different test groups may not be on the same scale because of the IRT property of scale indeterminacy.  To compare the items in different forms and examinees in different test groups, a statistical procedure, linking, is needed to convert the item parameters and ability scores to a common scale.  	There are several IRT linking approaches under the NEAT design.  Some of the approaches make use of the common (anchor) items shared by test forms and are referred to as common-item linking approaches.  The often used common-item linking approaches under the NEAT design include concurrent calibration, separate calibration with moments-linking approaches (e.g., mean/mean and mean/sigma), and characteristic-curve linking approaches (e.g., Haebara approach and Stocking-Lord approach).  All common-item linking approaches hold the same key assumption – that common items perform in the same way across different test forms, which means the common-item parameters are assumed to be invariant.  When the common-item parameters are non-invariant, the results of common-item linking might be affected.  The other type of linking approach studied in this dissertation, common-population linking, does not assume the invariance of common items.  This linking approach makes use of one group’s ability distributions derived from different calibration runs to do linking, and assumes that the ability distributions of different test groups are the same in one of the steps involved.  Under the NEAT design, the test groups possibly come from different populations, which means the equivalence assumption for group ability distributions might be violated. Violation of this assumption might threaten the accuracy of common-population linking results.  
	Many studies have compared the performance of several popular common-item linking approaches under a variety of conditions. However, no study has compared the common-population linking approach with common-item linking approaches under the NEAT design.  This study aimed to compare the performance of common-population linking and common-item linking approaches (specifically, concurrent calibration and separate calibration with Stocking-Lord linking approach) under some simulated conditions.  The design factors included differences in ability distributions, parameter drift for some anchor (common) items, sample size, test length, and the numbers of anchor items. 
	The simulated study findings showed that no one approach always outperformed the other two approaches across all conditions in the scenario that the scores of the focal group (taking the new form) were linked to the scale of the reference group (taking the old form).  Generally, the type of parameter drift for anchor items impacted the performance of the Stocking-Lord and the concurrent calibration approaches, but even under conditions of drift, these two approaches still performed well.  The concurrent calibration was more sensitive to sample size and the number of anchor items than the Stocking-Lord approach.  For the common-population approach, when the ability distribution of the focal group had same mean and standard deviation as the reference group, this approach sometimes performed equally well or slightly better than the other two approaches.  Once the two groups had different means and standard deviations, its performance was poor.  
      In addition to a simulation study, empirical data from the Florida Standards Assessments (FSA) were used to demonstrate the applications of these approaches in a practical test setting.  Florida Department of Education (FLDOE) applies separate calibrations with the Stocking-Lord linking approach.  In this empirical study, concurrent calibration with nonequivalent groups and a common-population linking approach were applied and were compared with the original results generated from the FLDOE’s separate calibration with Stocking-Lord linking. Results showed that the scale scores from the concurrent calibration and the common-population linking correlated strongly with the original FSA scale scores.  The linked item parameters from the two linking approaches were also similar to the corresponding ones on the FSA scale.  
      In conclusion, when some anchor items had parameter drift and the two test groups had different ability distributions, the Stocking-Lord approach generally performed the best; the common-population approach performed the worst in the majority of simulated conditions except when its underlying assumption of equal ability distributions across groups was not violated.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Beginning in the 1970s, an ideological, political, and legal shift toward more punitive policies to address crime occurred.  The punitive turn can also be seen inside of prisons, and one example is the expanded use of extended restrictive housing (ERH).  By design, ERH is used to house the most difficult-to-manage individuals in the correctional system.  Those in ERH spend up to 24 hours a day confined to their cells, for months or years.  ERH has been criticized for its potential adverse effects on incarcerated persons and, to date, the bulk of research on ERH has focused on its effects on those incarcerated, with little attention given the staff who work in it.This gap in research is notable in part because the work conditions in ERH differ markedly from those in general population prison facilities.  Personnel work with individuals who may be more violent and face management challenges unique to a setting in which incarcerated individuals almost never leave their cells.  The result may be impacts on personnel’s physical and mental health and how they view and manage incarcerated persons.
To address this research gap and contribute more broadly to scholarship on the impacts of the punitive turn on contemporary correctional systems, this dissertation examined the effects of ERH on prison personnel.  The first study examined the effects of ERH work-related stressors on stress among personnel.  The second examined emotional numbing as a possible response to work in ERH.  And the third examined whether officers’ empathy, punitiveness, and views about individual agency shape their perceptions about the impacts of ERH on incarcerated individuals.
The dissertation analyses draw on survey, focus group, and interview data collected from Florida Department of Corrections personnel as part of a project focused on restrictive housing.  These data were uniquely suited to the dissertation’s focus because they included responses to questions about work experiences in ERH and personnel perceptions of incarcerated persons.
Analyses of the data revealed several key findings.  ERH work, for example, appears to entail exposure to more and unique stressors and to elevate stress and increase emotional numbing.  In addition, lower levels of empathy and a greater belief in individual agency were associated with a lower likelihood of viewing ERH as causing mental health problems.  The findings illuminate the need for more research on the use and effects of ERH on incarcerated persons, personnel, and prison systems, and, more broadly, the impacts of the punitive turn.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>	Understanding individuals’ attitudes towards cybersecurity and their performance of risky cyber behavior is essential to understanding the problem of cybersecurity. Technology cannot protect everyone from every cyber threat. If an individual is willing to engage in risky cyber behavior such as sharing personal information online, sharing passwords with friends, or placing their current location on social media, protective technologies are bypassed.  	At the start of the 2020 pandemic, many organizations worldwide moved into a remote work, or hybrid working environment, (O'Reardon, 2020). Organizations and individuals experienced new cybersecurity threats because of the 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic (Kim, 2021). Not only did threat actors use COVID-19 as a subject line in phishing emails (Ramadad, 2021) but individuals home computers used to work remotely may be using technology that is past the end of life, missing security patches, have old anti-malware definitions (Retnowardhani, 2019).
	This study aims to better understand the perceived cybersecurity challenges when working remotely as well as if there is a relationship between attitudes towards cybersecurity and the self-reported risky cyber behavior. Most organizations, like most people, do not have an unlimited amount of resources, time or money. Focusing limited resources on the biggest risks will benefit all. In this study, the population is limited to those individuals identified as being attacked more frequently than other individuals.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The work contained herein describes the development of organic fluorophores capable of excitation-dependent multiple emission. Included are the design and synthesis of compounds that 
are a fusion of two known fluorophores: 2-(2’-hydroxyphenyl)benzoxazole (HBO) and transstilbenoid, intersecting at the hydroxyphenyl moiety. Due to the HBO component, these 
molecules are capable of undergoing excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT), which 
gives rise to two emissive excited state species (enol and keto). A third species (the anion) may 
be generated via ground or excited state deprotonation of the phenol. Chapter 2 presents a 
systematic investigation of a series of compounds called PVHBOs. These compounds illustrate 
how the ESIPT process is sensitive both to the chemical environment in which the molecule is 
placed and the electronic distribution within the molecule. Chapter 3 contains the investigation 
into a bipyridyl substituted HBO molecule called bipyVPVHBO. This compound shows a more 
balanced emission spectrum between its enol and keto tautomers in solvents that preserve the 
intramolecular hydrogen bond (HB) while simultaneously displaying a sensitivity to the choice 
of excitation wavelength (i.e., excitation-dependent emission). Chapter 4 details an investigation 
into a series of HBO-based molecules incorporating a dicyanovinylene functional group at the 
5’-position. The parent compound, DiCNVPVHBO, will be shown to possess a near-IR 
fluorescence emission band that is believed to come from an excited state intermolecular proton 
transfer to the solvent. The last content chapter, Chapter 5, concerns the effect of benzannulation 
on the PVHBO series that was presented in Chapter 2. This new series of compounds, dubbed 
PVHNOs, have an additional benzene ring attached to the benzoxazole component and display a 
fluorescence that is red-shifted relative to their PVHBO counterparts while also having a 
different distribution of enol and keto contributions.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Monitoring data arising from a process a practitioner desires to be in-control is a typical task in Statistical Process Control (SPC). These data are generated sequentially over time, and the goal of a SPC tool called a control chart is to detect an out-of-control process with as little delay as possible while also minimizing false alarms. The assumptions made on the data generating process guides control chart design. We consider a general task called profile monitoring wherein the data being monitored are a set of noisy responses and predictors, and we wish to detect changes in the functional relationship $f$ between these two. Ideally, the profile monitoring method should minimize the number and strength of the assumptions about the data as much as possible while being computationally fast and having both desirable sensitivity and specificity. As such we consider estimating the functional relationship $f$ in either a semiparametric or nonparametric model. The dissertation involves two completed projects and preliminary results in a promising direction. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The first project proposes a semiparametric approach using a single-index model (SIM), where we monitor an $l_2$ based statistic on the parametric component called the index parameter. The SIM approach outcompetes its competitors in detection delay and is the first profile monitoring method to use SIMs to model $f$.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The second project provides a nonparametric control chart that is fast, has small detection delay, and is able to avoid false alarms magnitudes better than what is found in the control chart literature. Typically, control charts are designed to achieve an in-control average run length (ARL) of 200 or 370. The proposed eigenvector perturbation control chart achieves an in-control ARL that is greater that $10^6$ while needing only a small (often mere a single) number of out-of-control observations to correctly flag an alarm.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The dissertation concludes with a promising direction of research. Although the estimate of a SIM in the first project is computationally fast enough for many applications, it is insufficient for streaming data. The final project aims to fill this gap and we provide preliminary results demonstrating a faster approach that empirically gives the same predictive power as its competitor. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The biological carbon pump encompasses three main pathways that transport particulate organic carbon from the surface ocean to depth; gravitational sinking, subduction, and active transport by vertically-migrating organisms. These three pathways occur over different depth horizons leading to regeneration of CO2 at different depths and in different magnitudes. To assess the contribution of each POC pathway’s ability to sequester CO2 within the ocean we conducted 500-year Lagrangian modeling simulations to quantify sequestration efficiency as a function of both depth and carbon flux pathway. Molecules were considered no longer sequestered when they were entrained into the mixed layer.  CO2 molecules regenerated at 150-m depth remained sequestered for 237 years, and the max molecule regeneration depth of 1000m displayed a mean sequestration time of 1468 years. Most molecule entrainment occurred in the California Current or Equatorial Pacific. When modeling results were combined with field data from the California Current Ecosystem Long Term Ecological Research (CCE LTER) cruises, sinking was the carbon flux mechanism that showed the highest potential for carbon sequestration, with 58% of the relative contribution to total sequestration. Subduction was a substantial contributor to export from the euphotic zone, but due to a short remineralization length scale it was only responsible for 24% of total sequestration. Active transport was responsible for the least amount of sequestration (18%). In ENSO specific simulations molecules were sequestered for longer timespans when El Niño conditions persisted, yet evidence suggests reduced export productivity during these years which may make the effects of its sequestration potential negligible. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Given a friend who has committed a grave moral transgression against someone else, how should one react to them in the public sphere? In this paper, I focus on cases of unacknowledged, grave transgressions with a human victim, involving public figures. Based on the impact of expressions of blame and expressions of friendship in the public sphere, I argue that in the public sphere one should not show friendship with a moral transgressor; instead, one should publicly blame their friend. The kind of blame at stake in these cases is expressed, third-party blame, that is, blame expressed by someone who is neither the victim nor the transgressor of the wrong at stake.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>I conduct my argument through three steps. First, I argue that expressions of friendship are incompatible with public expressions of blame in the public sphere because they convey incompatible public meanings to those outside the relationship. When we show publicly that we are friends with someone we make an implicitly normative assessment. As we tend to be friends with those who we value, when someone has friends, we interpret that person as being valued. On the other hand, expressing third-party blame conveys the message that the blamed person deserves retribution, revision of our relationships with them, or being held accountable, among others. This message seems to be at odds with the message that is conveyed through expressions of friendship. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Secondly, after making the case that expressions of friendship might be perceived as expressions of support in some contexts, I argue that we should not express friendship with a wrongdoer in the public sphere because: (1) it might convey condonation; (2) it might generate testimonial injustice for the victims; and (3) it might serve to silence the victims. In reply to an objection from the supporting nature of friendship, which claims that friends should support each other especially in hard circumstances, I notice that my claim does not prevent private expression of friendship. My only concern has to do with the impact of expressions of friendship when performed in public, and hence perceived by bystanders and the victim. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Thirdly, I argue that, given a friend who has committed a moral transgression outside the relationship of friendship, we should express third-party blame to them in the public sphere. In favour of this path of action, I provide four reasons. First, because it conveys the message to our friend, and to the moral community that we find that behaviour blameworthy, and that we condemn it. Second, because it expresses support to the victim. Third, because it conveys the message to the moral community that, in similar situations, we support the claims of other presumed victims, and that we condemn the behaviours of other presumed transgressors. And fourth, because it conveys the message that such behaviour should not be part of those behaviours that we normatively expect from each other. Finally, I reply to the objection from the business condition, that is, the claim that expressing third-party blame might be an instance of meddlesome blame. I rebut this objection by appealing to the privileged position that a friend might hold in relation to another friend and appealing to the position of that friend as a member of the moral community.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Finally, I reply to three anticipated objections: the charge of judgmentalism, the objection that expressions of blame and of friendship are compatible, and the objection from disagreement. In response to the charge of judgmentalism, I have rejected this charge in cases involving friends, or severe moral transgressions; in response to the objection that expressions of blame and of friendship are compatible, I have argued that my argument works even though one rejects the incompatibility claim; and, finally, in response to the objection from disagreement, I have acknowledged it as a strategic assumption in my theoretical framework.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This dissertation explores the campus climate of a Historically Black University in the Southeastern United Sates by providing an overview of the campus’ sexual assault policy and Black women students’ and administrators’ perceptions of the climate surrounding sexual assault on the campus. The research questions that guided this study are (1) How does institutional context shape the policy development and implementation of campus sexual assault policy at an HBCU and (2) What are Black women students’ experiences of campus sexual assault policy implementation and reporting at this HBCU? The research design consists of semi-structured interviews with six administrators and six student participants that were analyzed using Counterstory. The significance of this dissertation is to contribute to the body of research which exists about campus sexual assault policies at HBCUs. The findings of this study include several themes that were identified from participant interviews including how the institution views their stance on campus sexual assault policy and then student perceptions of the policies. This study provides administrators with information that can assist in the development and implementation of campus sexual assault policy. There are also implications that in practice, cultural relevant campus sexual assault policies and programs should be created and tailored to meet the needs of the student body. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The genetic architecture of Alzheimer's disease is largely unknown. Imaging-wide association study (IWAS) that integrates brain imaging information with genome-wide association studies (GWAS) results have successfully enhanced the discovery of genetic risk loci for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, IWAS requires an individual-level reference panel that has matched brain imaging and genetic data. This reference panel can be limited in sample size and hard to acquire, which creates a challenge for IWAS. Here, we propose an integrative analysis method that directly integrates an arbitrary number of brain imaging GWAS summary results with the trait of interest GWAS results. As an illustration, we integrated GWAS summary results of several brain volume-related regions of interest from 8,428 individuals in UK Biobank with several late-onset AD GWAS results. For example, when reanalyzing to-date the largest AD GWAS results, our proposed method identified 98 AD-associated genes, 63 of which have been ignored by standard gene-based tests and transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS). 
On the other hand, the causation between AD and white matter microstructure remains largely unknown, although white matter abnormalities imply an early neuropathological event in Alzheimer's disease. To fill this gap, relying on existing GWAS datasets, we conducted Mendelian Randomization studies to identify the causal relationship between two pairs of phenotypes: 1) Alzheimer's disease and 105 tract-specific principal components for FA (top 5 PCs of FA measures for the 21 white matter tracts) and 2) Alzheimer's disease and 110 tract-average parameters (FA, MD, AD, RD, and MO for 21 white matter tracts and the whole brain average). MR results showed that the genetic responsibility of AD affects the first FA PC in cingulum (hippocampus), first FA PC in fornix-stria terminalis, second FA PC in corticospinal tract, second FA PC in genu of corpus callosum, fourth FA PC in corticospinal tract, mean FA of cingulum (hippocampus), mean FA of fornix-stria terminalis, mean MD of cingulum (hippocampus), mean RD of cingulum (hippocampus), mean AD of fornix-stria terminalis, mean MO of fornix-stria terminalis, and mean MO of fornix (column and body of fornix). In summary, these newly identified genes and brain imaging information provide new insights into the etiology of AD.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In meta-analysis practice, effect measures from individual studies are synthesized to produce an overall result. Researchers frequently face studies that report the same outcome differently. The first scenario is that continuous outcomes are measured on different scales. In this situation, the mean difference (MD) may not be pooled in the same meta-analysis. For transforming the outcomes on the same scale, the standardized mean difference (SMD) is commonly used to ensure the unit is uniform across studies. The first part of this dissertation investigates the performance of standardized mean differences when the continuous measures follow different types of distributions. We conducted simulation studies to compare the performance of standardized mean difference and mean difference.The second scenario is that some studies report a continuous variable (e.g., scores for rating depression), while others report a binary variable (e.g., counts of patients with depression dichotomized by certain latent, unreported depression scores). For combining these two types of studies in the same analysis, a simple conversion method has been widely used to handle standardized mean differences and odds ratios (ORs). This conventional method uses a linear function connecting the standardized mean difference and log odds ratio; it assumes logistic distributions for (latent) continuous measures. However, the normality assumption is more commonly used for continuous measures, and the conventional method may be inaccurate when effect sizes are large, or cutoff values for dichotomizing binary events are extreme (leading to rare events). The second part of this dissertation proposes a Bayesian hierarchical model to synthesize standardized mean differences and odds ratios without using the conventional conversion method. This model assumes exact likelihoods for continuous and binary outcome measures, which account for full uncertainties in the synthesized results. We performed simulation studies to compare the performance of the conventional and Bayesian methods in various settings. The Bayesian method generally produced less biased results with smaller mean squared errors and higher coverage probabilities than the conventional method in most cases. Two case studies were used to illustrate the proposed Bayesian meth-od in real-world settings.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Some of the most innovative and exceptional music of the Seicento is found in the theorbo works of the Italian adventurer, poet, artist, musician, and composer Bellerofonte Castaldi. However, because his music is written for the theorbo, which has diminished in popularity since the seventeenth century, Castaldi has not gained any widespread notoriety. Many of his works remain unperformed. Therefore, to further promote interest in Castaldi and his music, arranging and performing his works on more popular instruments such as the guitar, which shares many traits with the theorbo, would be necessary. This effort would also benefit the guitar community, adding to the guitar’s limited baroque repertoire. This study then serves as a guide to arranging and performing the solo theorbo works of Castaldi on guitar. It also adds to the currently limited literature and research on his life and music. The study begins with a brief biography focused on important life events and influences that molded Castaldi’s eccentric compositional style. This provides an essential context for understanding the unique performance style needed to portray his music authentically. This is followed by a discussion on arranging his theorbo music for the guitar. This includes examining what Castaldi’s playing style would have been like and how guitarists can imitate it. These methods are then put into practice by discussing the arrangement and performance of four of Castaldi’s works in detail. These works, Tempestamento detta chiacchierino, Fantasia detta pegasea, Tasteggio soave, and Arpeggiata a mio modo are each taken from Castaldi’s four most significant genres, the passeggio, fantasia, tasteggi, and prelude respectively. As many of the most prevalent and complex issues in Castaldi’s repertoire are found in these works, they serve as excellent models for arranging and performing his other pieces. Examinations of each of these works include discussions on the style, background, interpretation, arrangement, and issues unique to each piece. This study concludes with an overview.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to analyze music theory requirements in music therapy curricula across the United States. Since the 1950s, there have been calls for change in the music therapy curriculum, with scholars citing its fullness and stating they struggle to meet AMTA and NASM demands. Decreasing “studies in music” (i.e., music theory) requirements could make room for other areas and skills music therapists desire in the curriculum. Universities offering an undergraduate degree in music therapy were gathered from the AMTA directory and divided by AMTA region. Of the 83 universities found that offered an undergraduate degree in music therapy, 81 were analyzed. Results showed that universities require approximately 7 traditional theory courses (TTCs) and approximately 15 theory credit hours (TCHs) on average, but most commonly required 8 and 16, respectively, across the US. This reflects requirements established in 1952. Surprisingly, the minimum/maximum TTCs required across the US was between 3 and 12, with a range between 4 and 25. Although many universities followed the same theory sequence  established in 1952, many universities had interesting variations to their theory sequence. Review of the NASM Handbook revealed flexibility in requirements as long as professional music standards are met. Notable variations from universities, implications, and radical ideas for the future of the music therapy curriculum are discussed. In conclusion, it is possible to alter universities’ theory sequence in a variety of ways that could benefit music therapy students and in turn, the profession.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Most biomolecular NMR experiments rely on 1H detection because it offers high sensitivity, but 1H NMR experiments are limited by the chemical shift dispersion of 1H which presents significant challenges for accurate peak identification and quantification. Direct detection 13C NMR experiments offer improved peak resolution and provide more information about molecular dynamics and structure, but 13C has inherently low sensitivity arising from its small magnetogyric ratio and the limited natural abundance of 13C. Therefore, improvements in 13C sensitivity which make direct detection 13C experiments feasible are especially advantageous in the metabolomics and natural products studies. This work is primarily focused on the application of high-temperature superconducting resonators in cryogenic microprobes with the aim of developing high sensitivity NMR probes for direct detection 13C experiments. 	It is challenging to design HTS resonators that produce a sufficient B1 field for 13C NMR experiments due to the limited current capacity of thin-film HTS resonators. In this project, the current distribution of HTS resonators with varying numbers of turns and numbers of arms has been simulated to better understand the limiting factors and opportunities for improvement. A trial multi-arm spiral was fabricated, and the current capacity compared experimentally to a similar single-arm design.  The multi-arm spiral resonator design has an improved current capacity which results in a significant reduction in the B1 pulse length.
	 Typically, high Q factor NMR probes offer significant sensitivity gains but also are challenged by distorted transmit pulse shapes and insufficient bandwidth due to long ring up and ring down times. NMR tests of a 1.5-mm 13C-optimized NMR probe are reported here. The probe demonstrated a 33% improvement in 13C mass sensitivity over the most sensitive 13C-optimized NMR probe. While 1H performance was unexpectedly poor in comparison to a previous version of this probe, it was adequate for 1H decoupling. 
	 Finally, we report progress towards designing a pulse sequence to simultaneously detect de novo lipogenesis and chain lengthening in fatty acids. By using selective pulses, the long T1 time of the carboxyl group can be leveraged against the relatively short T1 of the methyl group to create a nested pulse sequence. However, in uniformly labeled samples, phase distortions likely arising from long-range carbon-carbon coupling presented a significant challenge to quantification.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Carbon fiber (CF) composites are implemented into more and more engineering applications due to their superior strength to weight ratio over traditional materials. However, inhomogeneous microstructures of composite laminates may bring some challenges when implemented into applications. For example, due to the manufacturing methods typically used to manufacture the composite parts, there may be a resin-rich layer between the carbon fiber layers which will ultimately end up reducing the overall mechanical properties of the composite. Use of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are a promising step forward in composite materials as evidence shows an improved strength to weight ratio over that of carbon fiber with the addition of having multifunctional capabilities. Furthermore, CNTs are at the nano or sub-microscale, and are potentially able to reduce resin-rich issues that are present in traditional composites. In this research, we focus on the scale-up study of selected CNT and CNT/CF hybrid composite concepts using continuous CNT materials, aerospace certified resin matrices, and aerospace quality manufacturing processes. The goal of this research is to gain a fundamental understanding of new CNT/CF hybrid microstructures and microstructure-property relationships of these new composites.We manufactured highly aligned CNT sheet composites via stretching process, the results show the high mechanical properties which are comparable to unidirectional carbon fiber laminates. The high degree of alignment, self-assembling, and dense packing achieved within the CNT networks are major factors which contribute to the performance of the composite. We also successfully manufactured unidirectional yarn composites via filament winding and stretching processes. The results show an attractive method of scalability to manufacture high strength CNT panels. To study the effect of CNTs on the GIC of laminates, we manufactured aerospace-quality and ASTM standard double cantilever beam test samples with different CNT layer configurations, the preliminary results show the weak interfacial bonding present within the CNT networks resulting in the low GIC property. Finally, we manufactured CNT yarn/CF hybrid unidirectional laminates to the study the effect on the microstructure and mechanical properties with the addition of aligned CNT layers. The goal is to increase overall reinforcement volume fraction and simultaneously reduce resin rich areas. Each of these results advance the fundamental understanding of the effect of CNT sheets, socks and yarns on manufacturing processes, microstructure, mechanical properties, and failure modes on traditional carbon fiber laminates for potential scaled-up structural applications.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Applying 21st century machine intelligence to the evolving transportation management systems is under detailed investigation all around the world. The major goals of this investigation are quite noble and multifaceted including safety, mobility, resilience, energy conservation, and emission reduction. Computer vision and remote sensing are playing an integral role in this evolution contributing toward the smart, connected, and resilient transportation infrastructure systems. Considering the variety of imagery data sources (i.e., satellites, CCTV, drones) and their unique advantages and challenges, there is a need to conduct detailed research on using imagery with a specific focus on transportation big data analytics. Thus, this dissertation aims to use various imagery data with remote sensing applications combined with deep learning techniques and Geographic Information System (GIS)-based spatial and statistical analyses to provide end-to-end solutions and tackle challenging problems in transportation engineering and disaster resilience. Parallel with this goal, several case studies are conducted using variety of imagery sources and providing solutions to different aspects of transportation infrastructure.First, satellite imagery was used to evaluate the relationship between air pollution and vehicle traffic in the wake of COVID-19. The COVID-19 outbreak and ensuing social distancing behaviors resulted in a substantial reduction in traffic, making this a unique experiment on observing the air quality. Such an experiment is also supplemental to the smart city concept as it can help to identify whether there is a delay in air quality improvement during or after a sharp decline in traffic and to determine what, if any, factors are contributing to that time lag. As such, this case study investigated the immediate impacts of COVID-19 causing abrupt declines in traffic and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO¬¬2) concentrations in all Florida Counties through March 2020. Daily tropospheric NO¬¬2 concentrations were extracted from the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite and vehicle mile traveled (VMT) estimates were acquired from cell phone mobility records. It is observed that the overall impacts of the COVID-19 response in Florida have started in the first half of March 2020, two weeks earlier than the official stay-at-home orders, and resulted in 54.07% and 59.68% decrease by the end of the month on NO¬¬2 and VMT, respectively. Further, a cross-correlation based dependency analysis was conducted to analyze the similarities and the associated time lag between 7-day moving averages of VMT and NO¬¬2 concentrations of the 67 counties. Although such reduction is unprecedented for both data sets, results indicate a strong correlation, and this correlation increases with the identification of a time lag between VMT and NO¬¬2 concentration. The majority of the counties have no time lag between VMT and NO¬¬2 concentration; however, a cluster of South Florida counties presents an earlier decrease in NO¬¬2 concentration compared to VMT, which indicates that the air quality improvements in those counties are not traffic related. Investigation on the socioeconomic factors indicates that population density and income level have no significant impact on the time lag between traffic and air quality improvements in light of COVID-19.
Second, satellite-based multispectral images were employed to evaluate post-hurricane vegetative debris, focusing on the faster recovery on roadway networks. Transportation systems are vulnerable to hurricanes and yet their recovery plays a critical role in returning a community to its pre-hurricane state. Vegetative debris is among the most significant causes of disruptions on transportation infrastructure. Therefore, identifying the driving factors of hurricane-caused debris generation can help clear roadways faster and improve the recovery time of infrastructure systems. Previous studies on hurricane debris assessment are generally based on field data collection, which is expensive, time consuming, and dangerous. With the availability and convenience of remote sensing powered by the simple yet accurate estimations on the vigor of vegetation or density of manufactured features, spectral indices can change the way that emergency planners prepare for and perform vegetative debris removal operations. Thus, this case study proposes a data fusion framework combining multispectral satellite imagery and various vector data to evaluate post-hurricane vegetative debris with an exploratory analysis in small geographical units. Actual debris removal data were obtained from the City of Tallahassee, Florida after Hurricane Michael (2018) and aggregated into U.S. Census Block Groups along with four groups of datasets representing vegetation, storm surge, land use, and socioeconomics. Findings suggest that vegetation and other land characteristics are more determinant factors on debris generation, and Modified Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI2) outperforms other vegetation indices for hurricane debris assessment. The proposed framework can help better identify equipment stack locations and temporary debris collection centers while providing resilience enhancements with a focus on the transportation infrastructure.
Similarly, the third case study employed satellite imagery from various Landsat missions for a comparative damage assessment among five historical hurricanes and storms. Performing an accurate damage evaluation and identifying the patterns based on the strengths of these extreme weather events are essential for emergency professionals. A critical problem associated with this damage assessment is the logistics of quickly coordinating and implementing an extensive ground-based damage survey. Another significant challenge in developing a predictive understanding of the long-term effects of storms on coastal communities is the development of quantitative models that can relate the storm intensity and the resulting severity of damage on the different zones of the impacted areas. It is also unclear how urbanization and critical infrastructure affect the extent of the damage caused by them. Thus, this case study introduces a remote sensing-based approach that can rapidly analyze the damage caused by catastrophic storms with different strengths while providing a weighted statistical comparative assessment. Additionally, an existing debris volume estimation method developed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) was evaluated and the results were compared to validate the proposed model. Findings indicate that suburban and urban areas as well as moderate and high roadway density areas have generated more debris than rural and low roadway density areas. This relationship was also observed based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) reductions. Findings of this study can help to perform more accurate and faster damage assessments using satellite imagery and remote sensing techniques.
The fourth case study switched the focus from the remote sensing to computer vision as an object detection algorithm was retrained to identify crosswalks over high-resolution aerial images and develop a statewide inventory. Pedestrian fatalities have been rising sharply in the U.S. over the last decade. To reverse this trend, several pedestrian safety countermeasures were developed by the authorities, particularly for the uncontrolled crosswalks where majority of those fatalities occurred. Although geocoded and categorized crosswalk inventories are essential to determine where to implement the most appropriate countermeasure, building such an inventory database may take years with manual observations. Thus, this case study proposes a framework using Aerial Imagery and Artificial Intelligence (AI2) to map all crosswalks on Florida public roadways according to their control strategy. Freely available high-resolution aerial images and existing crosswalk locations in the OpenStreetMap database were used to retrain an object detection algorithm. Using this detector and a comprehensive preprocessing approach, approximately 160,000 crosswalks were identified and mapped. For validation, two case studies were conducted with a manually generated ground truth data set. It was found that the proposed approach can inventory the crosswalks with 85.9% completeness (recall) and 88.7% correctness (precision). Also, the performance of the model was significantly better on identifying signal crosswalks (92.5%) and uncontrolled major road crossings (96.6%) regardless of zebra or non-zebra pavement markings. The final results revealed that there are 861 mid-block, 30,784 signal, and 29,307 driveway crosswalks on the state roads in Florida. The proposed framework can be adapted in other locations where the appropriate imagery and vector data are available and is expected to contribute on the wider use of machine learning in transport policy.
Finally, the fifth case study presented the literature review and the state of the art on drone utilization for traffic monitoring with the desired traffic data while providing the background on computer vision and particularly on the Multi Object Tracking (MOT) methodology with a preliminary case study to perform a real-time object detection on webcam. The provided summary of drone utilization among the U.S. transportation agencies can help stakeholders on how to benefit from UAS technology on their day-to-day work. Moreover, uniform traffic study manuals can be updated with the presented desired data analysis to help practitioners perform drone-based traffic monitoring. Furthermore, the benchmark MOT algorithms along with their data sets and performance metrics were introduced and a case study for real-time object detection was performed to pave the way for real-time naturalistic trajectory extraction and analysis. A small program was developed using python programing language, and the code was shared to apply real-time object detection on the images extracted from users’ webcam.
Overall findings of this dissertation depict that regardless of the imagery data source or image processing method, a comprehensive pre-processing step should be performed with a focus on the targeted end data. In addition, satellite imagery and remote sensing methods powered by GIS, provide free and exhaustive data that can be used for smarter cities. Deep learning methods have extensive power over image data; in fact, some models for certain tasks have already surpassed human performance. However, it requires serious understanding to convert commonly known neural network models to perform slightly different tasks than what they were initially trained for. Tethered drones have also been promising solutions to collect continuous and automated traffic data. However, there is a trade off since the operation is too sensitive to weather events such as wind.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>	My 21st Century Big Budget Apocalypse is a collection of free verse poetry which derives influence from the Romantics and 19th Century French prose poets. The manuscript’s centerpiece is a long-form narrative journey through a post-modern consumeristic hellscape through which readers follow a protagonist known as “The Body” as well as his Virginity manifested as a talking head. Over the course of the episodic poem, the protagonist becomes increasingly enmeshed in the fabric of Hollywood and entertainment culture, as his Virginity ascends to the top of the internet’s celebrity hierarchy. Ultimately, he comes to understand every mundane moment of his life is commodifiable; he agrees to reinvent himself in order to better fit the talking head’s public narrative and the expectations of his Virginity’s fans. 	In between the long poem’s episodes, short-form pieces titled as ‘simulations’ and ‘trailers’ contribute to the manuscript’s hyperreal ecology by panning outward to expand on the cartoony universe and primary rhetorical themes. In their formal arrangement, they also parody the way in which the long poem’s protagonist finds his own story interrupted, buried, compromised, and distorted. So, the structural architecture functions as satire and a means of furthering the reader’s immersion into the other worldly atmosphere. 
	After a long first section, which culminates with the conclusion of “The Virginity that Goes Hollywood,” readers are treated to three short sections arranged around tone and aesthetic choices. Section Two consists of humor poems, which provide the readers a bit of a breather. Section Three is a tiny offering of darker and more somber poems, which contrast with Section Two. Finally, Section Four consists of poems themed around change, new destinations, arrivals, and departures.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The study examines how a training workshop on teaching in a recently introduced active learning classroom at Nazarbayev University (Kazakhstan) helps faculty participants integrate active learning and shift their teaching to an active learning classroom. A case study approach was employed, with data collected through surveys, interviews, and embedded research. Out of 20 participants, two cases implemented active learning and prepared to teach in an active learning classroom, one case resulted in an integration of active learning with an interest to develop an active learning training program for Kazakh language teachers. For each case, activity systems analysis was used to explore the individual activities.During the training sessions, participants discussed the ways the active learning classroom could support their teaching and enrich learning experiences. Four barriers for active learning implementation were identified: time and workload, student participation, instructional design concerns, and concerns about university support. In general, the faculty members considered the training workshop helpful in reconsidering their teaching practices. These findings add to the body of research on active learning classrooms and faculty training, focusing on how teacher innovativeness can be supported by the university administration

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>While most saxophonists are aware that the vocal tract is involved in playing the saxophone, the pedagogy surrounding the topic of the vocal tract is inconsistent; different lineages of pedagogy address it to varying degrees. Most pedagogical literature relies on imagery or trial and error-based practices, while research conducted on the vocal tract tends to be difficult to digest for younger players. This disconnect between how the saxophone is taught versus how the mechanics of the vocal tract function will persist unless we find a more specific way to approach saxophone pedagogy via a true understanding of the vocal tract. The Estill Voice model provides decades’ worth of research and methods to enhance the performer’s awareness and control over the vocal tract. This treatise aims to provide a more complete understanding of the vocal tract’s function through the Estill Voice Model to help saxophonists gain a stronger understanding and awareness of their anatomy and physiology, how the anatomy functions in saxophone performance, and new pedagogical techniques to incorporate into their teaching. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The current study examined (1) the characteristics of the advice networks of six Innovation schools among educators within grade-level PLCs in a city, South Korea, and (2) the extent to which these social network characteristics are related to the outcomes of teacher work, including collective actions, grade-level efficacy, and collective satisfaction. Building on social capital theory and using SNA, this study offered a unique contribution by focusing on teachers’ advice and/or information-seeking networks around the discussion of teacher instructional practices. In particular, grade-level teams in six Innovation schools emerged as critical conduits of social capital as to course content, PLC knowledge, and student assessment. Results support the idea that the characteristics of teachers’ social relationships at the collective and individual levels may be important elements for nurturing teachers’ collective learning and productive outputs. Along with the social connections at work, the role of trust has given credence to the necessity of organizational improvement. This study also found that classroom teachers who occupied leadership roles (grade-level headteachers, academic affairs headteachers, etc.) played an important role in advice networks, but principals and assistant principals did not highly engage in the advice networks. 
Results indicate that for current Innovation PLC reforms to be successful, there needs to be an understanding of the teacher social networks embedded within professional learning communities. To improve teacher outcomes and eventually student achievement, policymakers and scholars have to highlight the significance of collaborative structures and targeted professional learning opportunities in the school context.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>After decades of research biogeochemists have identified several intervals of variable marine oxygenation throughout Earth’s history. These fluctuations in oxygenation have been proposed to directly correlate to changes in ancient biodiversity, and potentially be primary drivers for these observed changes in faunal richness. The Ordovician was a dynamic time in terms of marine biodiversity, as it hosts the largest increase in biodiversity events in the Phanerozoic, which occurs in the Early to Middle Ordovician commonly referred to as the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event (GOBE). This major marine radiation is subsequently terminated by the second largest mass extinction in Earth’s history that occurs in the Late Ordovician, commonly referred to as the Late Ordovician Mass Extinction (LOME). While the primary causal mechanisms for both events remain under debate, an emerging field of study has associated an increase in marine oxygenation with the GOBE, while a decrease in marine oxygenation has been proposed for the LOME. Using a suite of paleoredox proxies, we present new geochemical datasets surrounding key intervals of the GOBE and LOME to elucidate the paleoredox landscape surrounding these events and link the known changes in biodiversity with fluctuations in marine oxygenation. These paleoredox proxies include local proxies that have previously been shown to constrain basinal changes in redox, which allows the use of global proxies to identify global changes in redox which might influence global biodiversity. These local redox proxies include manganese concentrations, iodine-to-calcium ratios, iron speciation, and pyrite sulfur isotopic compositions, while the global redox proxies include thallium isotopic compositions, vanadium, uranium and molybdenum concentrations, and carbonate-associated sulfate isotopic compositions. 	The major increase in faunal richness associated with the GOBE is thought to begin after the Cambrian‒Ordovician boundary, however paleoredox conditions surrounding this interval of time is largely under constrained. Currently a singular paleoredox dataset has been published to constrain paleoredox conditions across this boundary, however this dataset is limited in stratigraphic range, and is not tied to changes in biodiversity. New geochemical datasets from the Baltic Basin presented here from modern day southern Sweden (Scania) provide additional context for paleoredox conditions during the initiation of the GOBE. A progressive increase in oxygenation succeeding the Cambrian‒Ordovician boundary is interpreted based on trace metal dynamics and thallium isotopic compositions, which may be providing enhanced metabolic efficiency and new niche space due to newly oxygenated shelf areas leading into the later Ordovician. 
	The Middle‒Late Ordovician is associated with peak faunal diversity which has been attributed to enhanced marine oxygenation. Similarly with the Cambrian‒Ordovician boundary, very few studies have provided direct paleoredox evidence for a progressive increase in marine oxygenation, and thus redox conditions surrounding this integral period of diversification. New geochemical datasets from the Baltic Basin show a long-term increase in marine oxygenation throughout this interval though novel thallium isotopic compositions. 
	The primary causal mechanisms for the LOME remains unclear, however there is growing evidence that anoxia is playing a larger role than initially thought. Classically, the LOME occurs between two extinction pulses, the first being attributed to climatic cooling and subsequent expansion of Gondwanan glaciation which resulted in widespread habitat loss, while the second pulse is associated with climatic warming, deglaciation, and an expansion of globally reducing conditions. New geochemical evidence from three carbonate successions derived from hydrographically dispersed basins show evidence of persistent reducing conditions throughout the Late Ordovician though low iodine-to-calcium ratios, while carbonate-associated sulfate isotopic suggest an overall reduction of global pyrite burial. 
	Lastly, new thallium isotopic compositions from two Upper Ordovician basins of predominantly organic-rich shales identify highly variable global burial of manganese oxides which is intimately linked to marine (de)oxygenation and the two extinction pulses of the LOME. These thallium isotopic trends show that there were two major fluctuations between oxygenated and reducing conditions, which suggests that dynamic changes in oxygenation levels is a primary control on marine biodiversity, rather than the magnitude of reducing conditions.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that can impact an individual's academic and employment pursuits. There is little literature that acknowledges autistic employment within librarianship or other information fields. This study explored the experiences of autistic public library workers to better understand (a) motives for seeking employment in public libraries, (b) challenges autistic public library workers face, (c) strengths of autistic public library workers, and (d) support measures that impact employment success and retention. Respondents provided their experiences and perceptions as well as additional insights related to disclosure of ASD diagnosis and camouflaging/masking while at work. Many respondents desired to work in public libraries specifically, based on previous experiences within libraries or their unique skills and interests. An MLIS or equivalent was common in this study, though not everyone who had earned an advanced degree worked in a professional position. Work in public libraries was frequently described as fulfilling. Challenges in the workplace were categorized as (a) social, (b) cognitive, (c) physical, and (d) emotional. Strengths were categorized into four themes: (a) cognitive advantage, (b) efficiency, (c) unique autism-specific perspective, and (4) personal qualities. Themes were identified in desired support measures: (a) adjustment of schedule or tasks, (b) reduction of sensory stimuli, and (c) adaptation of communication. Discussion centered around the strengths of autistic individuals that suit library tasks and duties, challenges that often derive from a lack of awareness and understanding of autism, and fear of disclosure due to stigmatization and potential retaliation. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This work describes a simple and general approach to the design of new polyaromatic diradicaloids. The systematic approach starts with privileged core structures with the maximum number of Clar’s sextets, and explores the electron pairing topology by addition of CH2 radicals as spin probes at different positions. Computational results clearly illustrate how, for the same core, gain of a larger number of Clar’s sextets in the open-shell form increases the diradical character parameter y0 from 0 to 0.98 (where 1.0 indicates a perfect diradical).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To test this design, we have synthesized a tridecacyclic polyaromatic system where a gain of five Clar’s sextets in the open shell form overcomes electron pairing and leads to the emergence of high degree of diradical character. According to unrestricted symmetry-broken UCAM-B3LYP DFT calculations, the singlet diradical character in this core system is characterized by the y0 value of 0.98 (y0 = 0 for closed shell molecule, y0 = 1 for pure diradical). The efficiency of the new design strategy was evaluated by comparing the Kekulé system with an isomeric non-Kekulé diradical of identical size, i.e., a system where the radical centers cannot couple via resonance and the high-spin ground state is unavoidable. The calculated singlet-triplet gap, i.e., the ΔES-T values, in both of these systems approach zero:  -0.2 kcal/mol for the Kekulé and +0.3 kcal/mol for the non-Kekulé diradicaloids.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The isomeric Kekulé (K) and non-Kekulé (NK) systems were assembled using a sequence of radical peri-annulations, cross-coupling and C-H activation. Both molecules are NMR-inactive but EPR-active at room temperature. The magnetic properties of molecule K was further studied by superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) and experimentally measured singlet-triplet energy gap, ΔES-T (K) = -0.8 kcal/mol which is close to calculated values. The diradicals are kinetically stabilized by six tert-butyl substituents and (triisopropylsilyl)acetylene groups. The Kekulé diradicaloid has a half-life of 42h under ambient conditions (i.e., exposure to air at the room temperature) while the non-Kekulé diradicaloid has a half-life of 2h.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Early-life experience can influence behaviors that are important for survival and reproduction, two key elements of individual fitness. However, identifying a mechanism linking early-life experience to late-life behavior is a major challenge for the field of evolutionary biology. Telomeres are one such possible mechanism. Telomeres are repeated nucleotide sequences at the ends of chromosomes that protect DNA during cell replication. The rate of telomere attrition is influenced by natural processes and in somatic cells telomeres shorten with individual age. Oxidative stress increases the rate at which telomeres shorten while telomerase influences the rate at which they may lengthen. Understanding the factors influencing initial telomere length (TL) and early-life TL attrition will provide a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying longevity and reproductive strategy decisions. This Master’s thesis aims to understand how early-life events influence initial TL and dynamics by investigating: (1) How do pre-natal factors relate to initial telomere length? And (2) How does early-life experience predict telomere dynamics in nestling lance-tailed manakins? I answered these questions using a population of lance-tailed manakins in Western Panama. To address whether parental factors predict initial TL, I quantified chick sex, and parental TL and age in chick hatch year, and compared each of these to initial offspring TL using linear mixed effects models. To identify how rate of TL attrition is affected post-hatch, I addressed influences on TL from environmental and local nest factors experienced by chicks. I quantified change in nestling TL while in the nest and compare change in nestling TL to maternal age, presence of a sibling, and environmental effects of that hatch year. I found that pre-natal factors did not predict initial telomere length, but that in cooler and wetter months, chicks lost more telomere kilobase pairs during development than chicks hatched in hotter and drier months. These findings indicate that environmental factors play an important role in nestling telomere dynamics, but the effects of temperature and precipitation are clearly influential in the post-hatching period. This research emphasizes the importance of the early rearing environmental conditions for chick telomere dynamics, and identifies an important source of variation in telomere dynamics for young birds as they reach independence.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Aging is associated with decreased synthesis and increased degradation of muscle, bone, and connective tissue, leading to decrements in body wide structure and function. This depression in tissue turnover can lead to sarcopenia in skeletal muscle, and osteopenia/osteoporosis in bone, both of which are associated with increased injury risk and decreased function and are consequently widely studied. Surprisingly, age related losses in collagen is not well studied, even though it is the most abundant protein in the human body and a major constituent of muscle and bone. Collagen is not only a major component of the extracellular matrix (ECM), connecting muscles to bones, and bones to bones, but is also responsible for force transmission and locomotion. Additionally, age and activity related losses in collagen occur at a higher rate than muscle and bone, rendering collagen containing tissue, such as tendons and ligaments, more susceptible to injury. Injury to collagen containing tissue can lead to chronic inflammation and pain, resulting in decreased function and participation in sports. Approximately 19 % of the U.S. population is afflicted with chronic pain, with increasing incidence in active and aging populations. Pain can limit physical activity and activities of daily living (ADLs), resulting in declined mental, physical, and social health, as well as cause and proliferate disabilities. Long term pharmacological interventions to manage pain have negative side effects, which creates a need for alternative therapies. Currently, nutritional interventions for pain target inflammation or joint health, but few influence both. One such alternative therapy is supplementation with collagen peptides (CP). Supplementation of these peptides has shown positive effects on pain, function, and inflammation. The effects of collagen peptides on collagen containing tissue are thought to be due to bioactive peptides of the three main amino acids found in collagen—glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline—increasing collagen transcription and connective tissue repair. While short term studies have observed positive effect on pain and function, as well as body composition, a majority of the research has been conducted in diseased and injured populations, and few have assessed the effects of CP supplementation long term in healthy fit populations. PURPOSE: To determine the effects of daily CP consumption over 3, 6, and 9 months on a variety of measures of pain and function, range of motion, body composition, bone mineral density, inflammation, and bone and collagen turnover in healthy active older adults. METHODS: This study was a double-blind randomized control trial with three treatment groups (Placebo, 10 g/d, and 20 g/d). Survey measures of pain, range of motion, blood draws, and DXA to determine body composition and bone mineral density, were administered at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 9 months. Mixed model ANOVAs assessed group by time (baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 9 months) interactions in all primary measurement outcomes. Additionally,  the moderating effect of exercise frequency as well as sex differences were assessed. Significant interactions were further assessed via simple repeated measures ANOVA tests using Bonferroni corrections. RESULTS: Improvements in ADLs were observed with 10 g/d while, only slight differences were observed in the 20 g/d group over 6 months of supplementation. Pain was also reduced in the 10 g/d and 20 g/d groups over 6 months of supplementation, but only in high frequency exercisers. Additionally, survey measures of quality of life (QOL) related to mental health were improved in the 10 g/d group, while scores decreased in the 20 g/d group over 9 months of supplementation. The improvements in survey measures observed in the 10 g/d group were accompanied with favorable shifts in biomarkers, while few significant improvements were observed in the 20 g/d group, compared to the placebo group. Conclusion: These findings suggest that 10 g/d of CP supplementation for 3, 6, and 9 months compared to 20 d/g or placebo had benefits on ADLs, pain, mental health, and improvements in biomarkers of bone and collagen turnover, while 20 g/d seemed to not be as effective.

            <DISS_para>A numerical technique is developed for the design and optimization of the microstructure of proton exchange membrane fuel cells. The technique is based on evaluating the sensitivity functions of the different variables that need to by optimized (such as the two-dimensional or three-dimensional platinum distributions in the catalyst layers and the distributions of the porosity and carbon content in the catalyst and gas diffusion layers) and is using a gradient based technique to compute the optimum of these distributions. The sensitivity functions are computed using a novel adjoint-method approach that is presented in detail in this dissertation and which proves to be robust, reliable, and numerically efficient. This optimization technique is relatively general and can also be applied to the optimization of other variables of the fuel cells, such as geometric dimensions and cell structure. Our numerical results show an increase of 10-15% in the power density of conventional fuel cells as a result of keeping the total amount of platinum constant but properly redistributing it throughout the catalyst layer. We also show that one can increase the power density of conventional PEMFCs by approximately 20% by optimizing the distributions of the Nafion, carbon, and catalyst content in in the cell simultaneously. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>There is a growing trend of invoking the Middle Ages to ground modern identity in something familiar and historic (Utz, 2022). In an increasingly interconnected yet insecure world, Russia and Turkey have emerged as regional powers, or in the case of Russia, a great power with imperial aspirations, and are attempting to secure their place in the new multipolar world order. Dmitri Trenin (2013) suggests there is an “astonishing likeness” in the twenty-first century development of Russia and Turkey. These countries have adopted Western institutions and had, at one point, sought integration with the West. At present, however, disillusionment with the Western model and a desire to restore past glories of empire have encouraged the governments of these nations to distance themselves from Western influence, setting them down a path hostile to its values and concerns. This is compounded by what Russian author Eugene Vodolazkin (2016b) calls the “ever-present twofold issue of excessive individualization and the secularization of life” (p. 35) synonymous with liberal society that the ruling governments of Russia and Turkey present as detrimental to traditional culture and values underpinning their civilization-states. While a wide variety of positions exist within the respective cultural and political discourses in Russia and Turkey, the governments of Presidents Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan have instrumentalized mythologized narratives of national identity, rooted in the Middle Ages, to decouple themselves from and “otherize" the West in pursuit of revanchist foreign policies and autocratic domestic policies.The result has been the top-down imposition of national identity founded on the myths of the glorious past. Reaching back to the Middle Ages, which is regarded as the era of “civilizational birth” for Russia and Turkey, myths, characters, symbols, and values of the imagined past are being reconstructed to question the “individualized and secularized” character of modern society. Governments and institutions have sponsored cultural medievalism in media, with TV and film being among the most popular and widespread. State-sponsored medievalism has become a silver screen staple in these countries, with shows like Sophia (София, 2016) in Russia and The Great Seljuk (Büyük Selçuklu, 2020) in Turkey being financed partly or entirely by their respective governments. Literature, or more specifically books by elite writers, however, remain outside of overt government control. In this study, I will consider/treat/examine Laurus¬ (published 2012, translated 2015) by Eugene Vodolazkin and ¬My Name Is Red (published 1998, translated 2001) by Orhan Pamuk – two titles with stories set in the Middle Ages and themes that relate to the questioning of national character, identity, and self. ¬My Name Is Red was written before neo-Ottoman medievalism in popular culture became a widespread, state-sanctioned phenomenon in Turkey. Laurus, conversely, was written when medievalism was instrumentalized by the state to legitimize concepts such as the “Russian world.” I will determine how these works of medievalism summon the Middle Ages to respond to issues of national identity and provide insight on the author’s positions vis-à-vis their respective government and institutions. 
This analysis seeks to identify and label a trend of invoking the Middle Ages in Russia and Turkey under the framework of what I propose to call “national medievalism.” I will provide examples of national medievalism in context and explain how it is utilized in the interrogation and propagation of national identities. This study of medievalism will provide insight on how the Middle Ages are perceived and instrumentalized in Russia and Turkey and provide context to the rise of popular medievalism in their respective cultural discourses.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>There is a well-established relationship between the olfactory and the endocrine systems. At the center of this relationship sits the olfactory bulb, which acts as a relay station for the sense of smell. In fact, neurons in the olfactory epithelium and the olfactory bulb express a myriad of metabolic receptors. Mitral cells are the major projection neurons in the olfactory bulb, and they express receptors for important metabolic factors such as glucose, insulin, and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). GLP-1 is a gut hormone that aids in the regulation of blood glucose by promoting the release of insulin following a meal. The main source of GLP-1 is the intestinal L-cells, but it is also released from neurons in the central nervous system. Mitral cells in the olfactory bulb express the receptor for GLP-1 (GLP-1R). The GLP-1R is a G-protein-coupled receptor that is mechanistically coupled to adenylyl cyclase, which catalyzes the conversion of ATP into cAMP, leading to the activation of cAMP-dependent Protein Kinase A (PKA). GLP-1R action increases neuronal excitability by reducing the hyperpolarizing currents in mitral cells through an unknown mechanism. The main voltage-gated potassium channel in mitral cells is Kv1.3. Since the effect of GLP-1 on mitral cell excitability is lost in Kv1.3-/- cells, it is hypothesized that GLP-1R activation leads to an inhibition of Kv1.3 activity. My project focuses on describing the signaling pathway that leads to Kv1.3 inhibition upon GLP-1 stimulation. Previous reports conclude that GLP-1R activation in multiple tissues leads to a partial inhibition of potassium channels, usually via phosphorylation. To test this, I transfected Kv1.3 and the GLP-1R in a heterologous expression system (HEK293) and performed both electrophysiological and biochemical assays. GLP-1 stimulation leads to an overall decrease in currents generated by Kv1.3 without affecting the channel’s kinetic properties for activation, inactivation, or deactivation. This effect is lost in mutant versions of Kv1.3 that are resistant to Serine phosphorylation. In parallel, I performed an immunoprecipitation of Kv1.3 from transfected cells following GLP-1 stimulation. As revealed by immunoblotting, Kv1.3 protein extracted from cells co-expressing the GLP-1R show a marked increase in Serine/Threonine phosphorylation when compared to the control. Taken together, my results indicate that GLP-1R activation does indeed lead to Serine phosphorylation of Kv1.3, causing a partial inhibition of its activity without apparent changes in its kinetic properties. An exception would be the triple mutant S3A-Kv1.3, wherein the half-point to maximal activation (V1/2) shows a depolarizing shift without a reduction in the generated currents. Because of this, my results point to a role for S105 in the activation of Kv1.3 that is independent of ionic conductance. GLP-1-induced inhibition, however, is not as strong as the one previously observed in mitral cells. I hypothesize that the phosphorylation is mediated by cAMP-dependent PKA activation, but I discuss the possibility of different pathways affecting Kv1.3 that are part of the complex reaction cascade triggered by GLP-1. In conclusion, GLP-1-mediated phosphorylation of Kv1.3 might lead to the disincorporation of Kv1.3 channels from the membrane, effectively reducing the hyperpolarizing currents in the cell without affecting the kinetic properties of channel activity. My results point to possible therapeutic targets that may contribute to the modulation of mitral cell activity and, through it, olfactory ability and metabolic regulation. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Fusicoccin A is a diterpene glycoside phytotoxin which stabilizes 14-3-3 protein-protein interactions. The unique structure contains a 5-8-5 carbotricyclic framework which, when decorated with distinct substitution patterns, is found in a distinct array of natural products. With the goal of optimizing fusicoccin as a starting point to design small molecules which are potent and selective stabilizers of 14-3-3 PPIs, we designed a synthetic strategy to access fusicoccin in a divergent way. Herein, the design and implementation of said strategy will be discussed and progress towards the total synthesis of fusicoccin will be reported. Additionally, the requirement for reaction development provided an opportunity to gain insight into organotitanium chemistry. This work will also be outlined in the following document. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Anthropogenic climate change is shifting the risk of wildfires worldwide. The influence of climate change on fire hazards is diverse and complex and varies by region. Regional studies provide a more local perspective on the changing climate. In this study, the fire threat in the Southeast United States is investigated and the association between soil dryness and lightning-ignited wildfires in the Apalachicola National Forest (ANF) is examined. The relationship between pre-fire season dryness and the number of fires during the fire season is quantified with a statistical model. Soil dryness in the duff layer is estimated using the Keetch-Byram Drought Index (KBDI) which is a measure of moisture deficit based on temperature and net rainfall computed using daily summary-of-the-day values from the nearby first-order weather station. The probability of daily wildfire occurrence in the ANF is found to increase by 27% for every centimeter increase in daily soil moisture deficit and by 14% for every 100 daily lightning strikes. Given the strong statistical relationship between the KBDI during April and wildfires in the ANF from May to July, a seasonal prediction model is constructed to skillfully portend the occurrence of wildfires. Results show nearly a 20% increase in the average rate of wildfires from May through July for every one-centimeter increase in soil moisture deficit during April. Long-term upward trends in soil dryness are also shown, with the trend most pronounced during the driest months. This analysis indicates the potential for a greater risk of fires in the ANF in the future. Finally, the opportunity for future work is highlighted, and another model is proposed to further distinguish between a season with many small fires versus a season with a few big fires. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Democratic engagement and socially just leadership education are emergent approaches to community engagement and leadership education. Three critical and timely tensions set the stage for this study: tensions between higher education’s exclusionary roots and public purpose; tensions between leadership education’s neoliberal foundations and social justice values; and tensions between community engagement’s oppressive foundations and democratic principles. The study used case study approach to explore how the principles of democratic engagement and socially just leadership education are operationalized through community engagement initiatives. Data collection involved the review of 26 documents and interviews with 13 participants, including community partners, faculty, administrators, and students. 	Findings from this study revealed accreditation, professional competencies, and the curriculum; the international alternative spring break program; and case-based learning allow for democratic engagement’s enactment. Democratic engagement’s enactment is restricted by a lack of centralized structure, disconnects with and within partnering community organizations, and a lack of horizontal integration in the curriculum. Conditions allowing socially just leadership education to be enacted include accreditation and professional competencies, the diversity and social justice course requirement, and the diversity, equity, and inclusion strategic plan. Socially just leadership education was restricted by a mismatch in leadership and social justice terminology and internal college dynamics. 
	The study’s major themes have broad implications for higher education’s community engagement movement in a multitude of ways, including findings which illustrate universal definitions of community engagement do not exist, democratic engagement and socially just leadership education are mostly synonymous, minimal institutionalized support structures exist for leadership education, and community partners are co-educators in social work education. This study proposes a model for situating democratic engagement as the operationalization of socially just leadership education in the social work profession. Implications for community partners, faculty, and administrators include considerations that social work educators are socially just leadership educators, significant power dynamics are at play in community-university partnerships, community engagement is diversity, equity, and inclusion work, and the transdisciplinary of community engagement should not be underestimated.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Halide perovskites have shown rapid development in opto-electrical applications, such as solar cells, light-emitting diodes, and photodetectors owing to their superior optical and electrical properties. Particularly, halide perovskites surpassed the state-of-art efficiency of semiconductor compounds such as CdTe and copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) used in solar cells in just about a decade. Perovskite's ease of synthesis in ambient environment and its simple sandwich device structures indicate the potential of this thin-film solar cell technology to become a low-cost alternative to the commercially available photovoltaic technologies. However, the halide perovskites suffer from moisture-induced degradation, which holds up the commercialization. Long-term operation in the ambient environment for halide perovskites without costly encapsulation is in great demand.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Recent research in optoelectronics has diverted from the use of the original 3-dimensional (3D) halide perovskites to 2-dimensional (2D) halide perovskite materials. Besides the inherited superior optical and electrical properties from their 3D counterparts, the 2D halide perovskites that are composed of the hydrophobic organic ligands feature satisfying stability against moisture. In this dissertation, the desirable properties of 2-dimensional (2D) halide perovskite for photovoltaics were discovered via electrical transport study and numerical simulation. Probing with electrical and optical stimuli, the transport process including injection, drift, diffusion, recombination, and extraction of photoexcited charge carriers were investigated using a scanning probe technique called scanning photocurrent microscopy (SPCM), and then numerically simulated via the finite element analysis.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Below-bandgap energy states were discovered at the crystal edge of the 2D halide perovskites. The desorption of the long-chain organic ligands that served as spacers between the 2D inorganic sheets caused the formation of 3D halide perovskite-like crystalline near the edge. Using the combination of SPCM measurement and finite element analysis simulation, we proved that type-II heterojunctions were formed at the interfaces between the 2D perovskite and 3D perovskite, and these rectified junctions could efficiently facilitate electron-hole dissociation and suppress the energy loss through charge recombination. As our most important finding, this type-II heterojunction is rooted in the boosted photovoltaic efficiency reported previously. Adopting the bulk solar cell structure, we further proposed the design idea for utilizing such rectified heterojunction in 2D perovskite-based photovoltaic devices, promising higher stability and efficiency in the future perovskite-based solar cell.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Significant developments in the performance and stability of 3D perovskite-based opto-electrical devices were also demonstrated in this dissertation by embedding 3D halide perovskite nanoparticles in a more stable compound. Light-emitting diodes based on host-guest structure of inorganic 3D halide perovskite CsPbBr3 and non-perovskite material Cs4PbBr6 showed highly enhanced device stability and power-conversion-efficiency. The inorganic composition of the emitting material and the self-assembled encapsulation of 3D halide perovskite nanoparticles led to improved device stability under continuous operation. The shallow trap-states generated at the CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 interfaces resulted in strongly enhanced photoluminescence and quantum yield that led to improved device efficiency.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The studies in this dissertation indicated great potential of halide perovskite towards more stable and efficient optoelectronic devices. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Since their formation in 1965, the Grateful Dead have consistently captivated audiences, both young and old, on such a large scale that the Dead fanbase have their own, unique label and subculture. Though scholarship on the Dead and the Deadhead community has always existed, The Young Dead deserve attention. The Young Dead are Deadheads that were born post-1995 who, despite not being able to see the band perform live, still identify as significant members of the Grateful Dead fandom community. Moreover, not only have fans of the Grateful Dead persevered throughout the band’s existence, but even after the death of Garcia in 1995 (the assumed “end” of the band) the persistence of Deadhead fans, and their culture, within society, literature, and scholarship shows a possible connection to digital media convergence and digital spaces. Thus, The Young Dead allow us to see not only the persistence of a culture and phenomenon over more than half a century, but a recreation, reiteration, and reformation of the Deadhead fan base itself that seems to be directly related to technology and digital spaces/environments.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In order to understand how The Young Dead community is composing and communicating within convergent online spaces to form significant bonds, I outlined four research questions: (1) How do The Young Dead interact in convergence spaces? (2) How do The Young Dead describe themselves? (3) How do The Young Dead describe their fandom? (4) How does the fandom function as a community within these spaces? To answer these questions, I used a multimethod methodology and collected qualitative and quantitative data through surveys and interviews. In order to analyze the data, I used an inductive coding scheme based on the data I collected. Through the survey and interview method, I was able to gain a deeper understanding of The Young Dead community and shed light on the communicative and compositional practices that they are employing within convergent online spaces. These findings provide insight into online fan communities that have possible implications in rhetorical and compositional pedagogical practice, digital archive work, and fandom studies. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Short-range structural ordering is critical to functional properties such as ion migration and ferroelectricity. The discovery and development of high-performance functional materials rely on advanced characterization tools and theoretical models. This dissertation focuses on solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and imaging (MRI) studies of fast-ion conductors as solid electrolytes (SEs) and ferroelectric materials to understand the structure-property correlation, aided by computational investigations.All-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) which employ SEs, have gained much attention due to their improved safety and energy density compared with the current commercial liquid-electrolyte-based lithium-ion batteries. However, challenges such as limited power density, narrow electrochemical stability window, poor interfacial contact, and dendrite growth associated with current SEs urge an in-depth fundamental understanding of their working mechanism and strategies to address these challenges.
The mechanism of dendrite formation and propagation in solid electrolytes is different from that in liquid systems, and the challenges in non-invasively tracking the process in real-time leave the exact mechanism elusive. In Chapters 2 and 3, dendrite growth in solids at both the interface and bulk of different depths in Li/ Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) /Li solid cells is probed using three-dimensional in situ and ex situ MRI non-invasively. We show that the accumulation of Li microstructure kicks off from the surface of Li metal electrodes before hard shorting the Li/LLZO/Li cell. More importantly, we identified Li dendrite originated from both the interface and the bulk LLZO electrolyte, which is supported by quantitative experimental evidence from tracer-exchange NMR.
Halide-based SEs recently gained much attention due to their improved ionic conductivity compared with oxide-based electrolytes and good chemical/electrochemical stability. Chapter 4 introduces a series of Br-doped Li3YCl6. XRD has shown increased lattice parameters, with broadened channels for Li+-ion conduction. 7Li, 35Cl, 79Br NMR are employed to study the local structure, and the results reveal distortion in the symmetry due to defect formation. Li3YCl4Br2 has short T1 relaxation time, which is an indicator of high Li+ ion mobility. NMR and AIMD calculations show that introducing Br into the Li3YCl6 structure changes it from a one-dimensional to a three-dimensional conductor.
By revealing Li dendrite formation mechanisms and understanding the origins of fast Li+-ion conduction in SEs with combined experimental and computational studies, we hope to achieve rational designs of SEs for the next-generation batteries. 
The centrosymmetric polymorph of KNaNbOF5 undergoes a reconstructive transition from a rare A-site vacancy ordered perovskite to a unique non-perovskite high-temperature phase. Previously, the high-temperature phase was proposed to exhibit dynamical disorder with mixed occupancy of O and F on the anion sites owing to hopping rotations of the [NbOF5]2− octahedra. In Chapter 5, 19F NMR techniques demonstrate the dynamic anion configurations through this reconstructive transition. Based on NMR experiments and first-principle calculations, we conclude that the high-temperature phase exhibits Cmcm symmetry with hopping rotations of the [NbOF5]2− octahedra occurring only about the Fapical−Nb−O axis of the octahedra such that there are no O/F mixed occupancy anion sites. We use these results to refine the microscopic description of the reconstructive transition and its driving force. This work demonstrates the efficacy of 19F NMR techniques combined with electronic structure calculations to understand thermodynamically driven changes in heteroanionic materials.
Solid-state NMR spectroscopy, microscopy, and relaxometry combined with computational investigations prove to be powerful to unveil structural modulation-property correlations providing insights and guidelines for new material discoveries.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Lake Jackson in Leon County Florida is a shallow perched dissolution lake, which sits above the Cody Scarp and is formed from the coalescence of sinkholes. Lake Jackson currently has two open sinkholes, Porter Sink and Lime Sink. Periodic draining of the lake through Porter Sink is integral to the ecological health of the lake because of its shallow, flat-bottomed, closed-basin geology. Increased inflow of polluted stormwater is commonly in the form of nitrogen, phosphorus from fertilizers, which feeds the growth of algae and depletes the water of dissolved oxygen. This process is controlled through periods of draining in which the sun bakes the muck at the lake bottom. Dry-down event water from Lake Jackson’s Porter Sink flows directly to the Upper Floridan Aquifer, creating an understudied vulnerability to the local drinking water source.	Carbonate dissolution conditions with respect to calcite saturation were geochemically modeled for Lake Jackson over storm and draining periods as well as at two sites downgradient of the lake: the Florida State University (FSU) Well and Wakulla Springs. Dissolution conditions are represented as saturation indices with respect to calcite (SIC) and were calculated using Visual MINTEQ 3.1 with values for temperature, pH, Ca2+ concentrations, Mg2+ concentrations, and total alkalinity as CaCO3. Calcite saturation conditions at the Wakulla Springs site did not provide a distinct event- water signature, likely due to dilution effects and multitude of sources. Distinct shifts in Lake Jackson and FSU Well SIC values compared with PCO2 values calculated by Visual MINTEQ and normalized against atmospheric CO2 identified the arrival of event source water. These arrivals were supported by the conceptual geochemical understanding of the study sites and event water for draining event conditions and for low-inflow, exposed Porter Sink conditions. In addition to identifying Porter Sink event water at the FSU Well, SIC versus PCO2 relationships may be used to further investigate reactions and source waters responsible for shifts in Upper Floridan Aquifer hydrochemistry. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The actinide series is of great importance, possessing applications in clean energy, space travel, medicinal use, and even household smoke detectors. Despite everyday applications, our knowledge of the actinides is severely limited compared to the rest of the periodic table. Low available quantities of these elements, in addition to hazardous radiotoxicity, presents a unique set of challenges when studying them. Nuclear energy presents grand opportunities for clean energy and is a leading source adopted by many countries; however, difficulties in recycling and separating these elements from nuclear waste proves to be a pervasive task. Furthering the limited understanding of bonding and electronic properties characteristic of the actinide series will present new opportunities for recycling and waste separation techniques.	Historically, f-electrons were thought to be chemically inert, only participating in electrostatic interactions and displaying heavily localized behavior. Actinides were thought to act like their lanthanide counterparts; however, this is now known to be false. Actinide−carbon bonding showed the first evidence of covalency in the actinide series, differentiating their bonding properties from the lanthanides. Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated how the greater radial extension of the 5f orbitals beyond the 4f orbitals results in greater reactivity and a lower degree of localization of the 5f electrons. Chapter 1 will provide background information on the actinide series, as well as its historical importance and applications. Information regarding the importance of organometallic actinide chemistry, intervalence charge transfer, and challenges in working with these elements is discussed. Chapters 2 and 3 build a baseline for intervalence charge transfer studies within the actinide series, presenting a series of dinuclear systems with neptunium, plutonium, and various lanthanide analogues. These complexes allow for flexible redox studies and will be applied for the synthesis of mixed-valent systems displaying the delocalization of f-electrons, pushing the boundary on our understanding of these fundamental properties.
	Chapter 3 transitions from the localized properties of f-electrons to their unique bonding properties by introducing an organometallic synthetic precursor. Metal−carbon bonding is a nearly untouched field in transplutonium elements, which is surprising considering the reported differences in covalency between the actinide−carbon and lanthanide−carbon bonding, as well as the prevalence of americium and curium in nuclear waste. Chapters 5 demonstrates how the addition of azine bridging ligands to these organometallic systems allows for the tuning of covalency in actinide−nitrogen bonding, a common target in improving separations techniques. Chapter 6 presents the first reported structural characterization of a curium−carbon bond, opening doorways to a new field of actinide chemistry: organocurium chemistry. In addition to unexpected bonding differences between curium and its samarium analogue, organometallic curium demonstrates never before seen optical properties, including significantly redshifted emission in a putative Cp′3Cm, as well as the quenched photoluminescence of (Cp′3Cm)2(μ−4,4′−bpy). This work introduces actinide systems that serve as a baseline for intervalence charge transfer experiments and the delocalization of f-electrons, as well as a series of transplutonium complexes possessing actinide−carbon bonding, possessing bonding and electronic properties never before observed with these elements.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The projected increase in the population of older adults (ages 65 and older) brings with it concerns about unavoidable loss through age-related chronic illnesses like dementia, cancer, or arthritis (Jaul &amp; Barron, 2017). Successful aging is a multidimensional concept that acknowledges potential morbidity but offers a compelling alternative to unavoidable loss by incorporating dimensions of aging other than physical health (Rowe &amp; Kahn, 1998). As successful aging is an inherently multidimensional concept it should not be limited to being explored in a unidimensional manner. However, there have been few attempts to study it comprehensively. Instead, many studies tend to examine unidimensional aspects of successful aging, particularly focusing on physical health (Cosco et al., 2014). Latent variable analysis offers a methodological approach that allows for a flexible understanding of successful aging. However, few studies have utilized such an approach (Mana &amp; Bezdicek, 2020), leaving it ripe for further development.There is potential in utilizing the marital relationship to promote successful aging through improving relationship processes. The marital relationship, specifically, is a critical focus as it has the possibility to shape health outcomes through the distinct processes of support and strain (House et al., 1988). However, outside of a few exceptions (Ko et al., 2007; Tracy &amp; Utz, 2020), there has been little exploration of the marital relationship processes that may affect a person’s overall health and well-being and subsequent ability to age well.
Based on the assumption that successful aging is a multidimensional concept, these two studies work together to better understand the multiple factors contributing to successful aging, particularly the marital processes of support and strain. As such, both papers are interrelated.
Study 1 was designed to apply the LPA statistical method as a strategy to produce a comprehensive outcome for successful aging. The samples included N=2,257 participants from the MIDUS 2 and N=3,351 participants from the MIDUS Refresher.
Latent profile analysis (LPA), a statistical method that allows for the grouping of individuals without using preconceived determinants, (Gibson, 1963), was applied to various indicators of the dimensions of physical, mental, and cognitive function and active engagement with life. To evaluate the criterion validity of the identified latent profiles in the MIDUS 2, the same measures were analyzed in a demographically matched cohort of adults from the MIDUS Refresher. To evaluate the content validity of the profiles, demographics including race, age, sex, ethnicity, and educational attainment were explored with the profile assignment for both MIDUS 2 and MIDUS Refresher, respectively.
Results from Study 1 indicated four distinct profiles two demographically matched data sets: the MIDUS 2 and the MIDUS Refresher. These profiles were reproduced in a demographically similar cohort of adults. Finally, the demographic correlates of the profiles of successful aging do follow patterns like those observed in single dimensional assessments of health, and identified latent profiles generally comport with descriptions of health in the general population. The results from Study 1 provided an expanded understanding of successful aging by verifying the validity of the latent profiles.
Study 2 used the profiles created in Study 1 and multinomial logistic regression to explore the contributing factors for spousal support and strain at time one (MIDUS 1), on the successful aging profile at time two (MIDUS 2). The goal of this study was to explore the impact of the relationship processes of marital support and strain on successful aging. The final sample included n=868 participants from the MIDUS 1 and MIDUS 2 who were married at time one and had been married only once by time two. Marital dissolution (i.e., separation, divorce, widowhood) by time two was also explored as a covariate. Potential gender differences in the association of spousal support and spousal strain with successful aging were also explored as an interaction model.
Results from the multinomial logistic regression model for Study 2 indicated that spousal support at time one was not associated with less detrimental profiles of successful aging at time two, and spousal strain at time one was associated with more detrimental profiles of successful aging at time two. There was no significant relationship between spousal support, spousal strain, gender, and successful aging profiles in the interaction model. This study exemplified the potential to apply family science measures to a multidimensional successful aging outcome.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The increasing shift for higher education institutions to recognize career readiness as an institutional priority (Cruzvergara et al., 2018) is leading the need to identify ways to scale student engagement in at least one high-impact practice (HIP), such as experiential learning opportunities, prior to graduation (Huang et al., 2018).  Traditionally, higher education institutions have relied on academic schools and colleges to embed experiential learning in academic program requirements highly dependent upon the learning goals and outcomes for each individual major (Swenson &amp; Greiman, 2018).  Now that many institutions are launching experiential learning graduation requirements, higher education administrators are actively seeking ways to enhance institutional capacity to foster student engagement in experiential learning in the form of a centralized, interdisciplinary experiential learning curriculum.Research has shown that high-impact educational practices (HIPs) are positively beneficial for college students from many backgrounds and include gains in developing skills that are essential in the workplace (Kuh, et al., 2017; Wolniak &amp; Engberg, 2015; Kinzie, 2012).  While a formula for implementing experiential learning as a high-impact practice that will work on every campus for every student does not exist (Coker &amp; Porter, 2015), career services offices should be leveraged to implement new experiential learning institutional models and programs (Huang et al., 2018).  Lastly, a centralized, interdisciplinary experiential learning curriculum should demonstrate to external stakeholders, such as policymakers, families and hiring employers, contributions to a student’s understanding and growth in attainment and application of career readiness competencies.
In June 2019, Florida State University (FSU) became the largest public university to institute an experiential learning graduation requirement, publicly committing that “every student should – and can – participate in transformative, career-building experiential learning” (Farnum-Patronis, 2019, June, para. 3). The Experience Recognition Program (ERP) is a Career Center and institutional mission-critical program or service as it is currently the only approved low-cost (zero-credit, noncredit hour course) or no-cost option (co-curricular certificate) available for undergraduate students to satisfy the experiential learning graduation requirement. Despite the long-running nature of ERP for almost 50 years, no program assessment is on record.  This implementation study reviewed the program components in regards to criteria for effective high-impact practice implementation as well as industry principles for supervising students engaged in experiential learning activities and career readiness education to offer insight into programs successes and suggested areas of improvement.   This implementation study evaluated ERP’s components of student-supervisor preset learning outcomes, hands-on oversight from qualified faculty and periodic, structured reflection on learning outcomes (Burke &amp; Carton, 2013) through content analysis and instructional faculty interviews.  Findings indicated that ERP components were designed in alignment with key elements of high-impact practices that make them effective, industry best practices for faculty facilitation of student engagement in experiential learning activities and career readiness education.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In order to survive the perpetual abuse and subjugation of a White supremacist patriarchy, Black women have historical operated within the ideological framework of Black Feminist Thought. The onset of colonial expansion, along with the caste system of Slavery, act as catalysts for the racist institutions prevalent in our contemporary world. In order to ensure upward social mobility for both her and her family, Black women are required to navigate the rhetorics of capitalism. This navigation is underscored by a rejection of society’s controlling images, a push for self-definition in public spaces, and activism from everyday Black women. This paper seeks to understand how the rhetoric of capitalism police images of Black womanhood. This journey is to be analyzed using Black Feminist Thought as both methodology of analysis and a subject to be defined. This investigation demands consideration because a Black female experience can offer society insights into how to effectively combat social injustice.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The interactions of charged polymers, polyelectrolytes, on surfaces and in solution have gained a lot of attention throughout the years. Depositing alternating layers of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes forms multilayers, PEMUs. Their association in solution leads to phase separations forming materials termed polyelectrolyte complexes, PECs. The repeat unit of the oppositely charged polyelectrolyte can be varied.  The functional group linked to the repeat units dictates the strength of ion pairing.  Their self-assembly in solution creates polymer nanoparticles and, in a network, produces polymer nanocomposites. These materials have been used for a variety of applications such as coatings, electronic devices, and drug delivery systems. Adding a certain salt concentration to the material can influence the polymer/polymer interaction within the complex. This work features three main interfaces at which polyelectrolyte interactions were studied: on a substrate through PEMUs, in solution through polymer nanoparticles and in nanocomposites. The pairing strength of a polythiouronium polyelectrolyte having a positively charged thiouronium group, like the guanidinium, was evaluated by the formation of PEMUs at various salt concentrations.  Polyguanidiniums such as polyarginine are known to form like-charge ion pairings and hydrogen bonding. The same unusual characteristics cause the strong interactions of the polythiouronium with polyanions. High concentrations of salt dissociated the strong polythiouronium/polyanions complexes. The polythiouronium was selected to seek another example of a strong polycation and to form a PEMU with polyzwitterions, which are known for their weakly interacting strength and net-neutral charge.
The second interface consists of the self-assembly of a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) with positively charged end groups in solution, and as a nanofiller, in a nanocomposite. Polydimethylsiloxane is biocompatible and highly hydrophobic; however, when self-assembled exhibits poor stability and tends to collapse. Introducing a glassy shell of polystyrene sulfonate enhances the stability of these polymer nanoparticles and improves the mechanical properties of the nanocomposite which exhibited thermal resistance. Using x-ray scattering and atomic force microscopy, the nanocomposite’s unique morphology was deduced. Its hydrophobic properties were probed using a solvatochromic dye and were used to encapsulate inorganic nanoparticles. The gold nanoparticles are hydrophobically capped and they appeared to be encapsulated within the PDMS core. Their assembly was studied by x-ray scattering in the presence of a PSS shell in solution and the loading capability of the nanoparticle was determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The newly formed material is a novel polymer nanoparticle/polymer nanocomposite that takes advantage of the PDMS malleability and biocompatibility. The nanoparticle can thus be used for biological applications such as bio-imaging and sensing.
The last section compares the interactions of different polycations with lipid layers (monolayer or bilayer) to mimic the mechanism of surface sterilization. The functional group varied between a primary or tertiary ammonium, a guanidinium and two different thiouronium groups. Ammoniums are known for their ability to disrupt lipid bilayers and for their use in disinfectants. Polyarginine, a strong positively charged polymer, is recognized for its cell-penetrating ability due to its unique salt-bridge like interactions. Radioactive unilamellar phosphocholine vesicles were prepared and used to deposit a monolayer on a hydrophobic scintillator and a bilayer on a hydrophilic one. The interactions of the layers and the deposition were monitored by radiocounting. Polyarginine and the polymer with a higher composition of a hydrophobic thiouronium exhibited the strongest interactions. 
These investigations of the interactions between polyelectrolytes at different interfaces serve as a guide to design a variety of functional materials. Understanding the structure-property polymer relationship allows the build-up of materials with tuned properties.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Understanding the factors that influence a species’ geographic range and the overlap between the ranges of distinct species remains a central question in both ecology and evolution. Here we investigate the influences of hybridization and the breakdown of reproductive isolation and a key innovation, matrotrophy (the provision of energy for embryonic development after fertilization), on species ranges and range overlaps in the fish family Poeciliidae. We assessed whether pairs of species that hybridize have different amounts of range overlap than pairs of species with similar divergence times that do not hybridize. We also assessed whether matrotrophic species have larger ranges than lecithotrophic species (lecithotrophic species provide all energy for embryonic development before fertilization). To investigate our hypotheses, we reviewed the literature on poeciliid fishes and plotted the ranges of all extant species in ArcGIS. The data we worked on was compiled by M. Tobler and Z. Culumber in 2019 and consisted of museum collection records for individuals of distinct species. We quantified the ranges for 407 different fish species. We then we added data on the estimated time of divergence between sister taxa, based on the phylogenetic tree (Furness et al. 2019). We found that the areas of overlap between sister taxa depended upon time since divergence.  However, the slopes of range overlap and divergence time were of opposite sign between species pairs that hybridize and species pairs of similar divergence times that do not hybridization and range overlap (km2). Based on our results, we believe that the species that are closely related but not hybridizing have smaller areas of overlap because they are still in the stage of primary differentiation, are experiencing secondary contact after prior geographic separation that no longer exists or are in a stable hybrid zone. When comparing the ranges of closely related placentals and non-placentals, we found that multiple closely related species that shared the same reproductive strategy did not have any range overlap. This lends support to the theory that placentation evolved separately in different geographic areas. A future question that researchers could answer using these data would be what is causing the geographic overlap between species. Another future biogeographic study may be an evaluation of whether water features are leading to a decline in species diversity based on habitat preferences or their normal range. </DISS_para>

      <DISS_content>
         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Conducting courses are a common feature of the choral music teacher education curriculum. However, practicing teachers often place lower value on conducting skills than other skills necessary for effective teaching. There may be a disconnect between the emphasis placed on conducting in the undergraduate curriculum and the relevance of conducting skills for beginning teachers in the K-12 choral classroom. The purpose of this study was to examine the pedagogical values of undergraduate choral conducting faculty as they relate to the needs of practicing choral educators through a survey of course content, teaching methods, and suggested curriculum additions.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Current undergraduate choral conducting faculty (N = 173) from NASM-accredited institutions responded to an online questionnaire. Participants rated how much they emphasize conducting topics in their undergraduate choral conducting classroom and how important those same topics are for practicing choral educators using Shulman’s Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK) framework (Shulman, 1986). In addition, faculty participants responded to open-ended questions regarding the purpose of conducting skills, effective methods of curricular instruction, and suggested additions to the undergraduate choral conducting curriculum. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Participants rated Content Knowledge (CK) Skills as their highest priority followed by Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK) Skills and Pedagogical Knowledge (PK) Skills for both emphasis in conducting curriculum and importance to practicing educators. However, in individual ratings, emphasis and importance of PCK topics did not match—faculty rated PCK topics as highly important but not emphasized in the conducting curriculum. Results indicated a need for conducting curriculum redesign to better serve the needs of preservice teachers. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Most faculty reported instructor feedback and conducting demonstrations to be effective methods of teaching undergraduate choral conducting. Participants also indicated a need for increased time spent on rehearsal skills in the choral conducting curriculum. Because the purpose of conducting skills for practicing educators takes the form of both conductor-related and rehearsal-aid purposes, additional conducting curriculum time spent on rehearsal skills would be advantageous. It should also be considered that many participants reported a need for increased diversity, equity, and inclusion practices in the choral conducting curriculum.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Conducting taught in combination with pedagogical skills might provide a more holistic conducting-teaching experience that is relevant to the multifaceted nature of classroom teaching. Though CK skills are highly emphasized and valued by current conducting faculty, they also find PK and PCK skills important to add to the conducting curriculum. Currently, CK skills are emphasized in the choral conducting curriculum, though adding PCK and PK elements will help preservice teachers be better prepared for classroom instruction. Additional implications are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Aucilla River Basin consists of archaeological sites temporally ranging from Paleoindian to Mississippian periods. Along with the archaeological sites, quarry outcrops utilized for stone tool production by past populations are scattered visible, and hidden throughout the landscape. Here, I look at the raw material at sites, Page-Ladson (8JE591), Little River Rapids, Half Mile Rise Sink (8TA98), Sloth Hole (8JE121), and Ryan-Harley (8JE1004),  to determine if the people who stayed at these locations were using local or non-local raw material for stone tool production. This observation is following the Uwharrie-Allendale model established by Randy Daniels (2001), to determine if people were ‘mapping on’ locations based on in response to local chert quarries. I also macroscopically and microscopically analyze the diagnostic stone tool of Little River Rapids, determining the raw material source based on criteria laid out by Upchurch et al. (2008) quarry cluster approach.  </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a gammaherpesvirus that causes Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) and two lymphoproliferative diseases. We previously reported KSHV ORF52/KicGAS (KSHV inhibitor of cGAS) to inhibit cGAS (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase), the principal sensor of cytosolic DNA. Compared to its target protein, cGAS, whose intracellular localization is closely regulated, the predicted molecular weight of ORF52 is relatively small (14 kDa) but remains excluded from the nucleus. As a late-phased lytic protein of KSHV, we also previously reported that ORF52 is required for progeny viral production, likely during virion assembly, a process that takes place in the cytoplasm of host cells. Thus, we speculated its controlled localization to be important for the proper functioning of ORF52. We first performed extensive microscopy and characterized the intracellular localization of KSHV ORF52 in detail. Under different experimental conditions, we observed primarily homogeneous localization of the protein in the cytoplasm, but also saw different patterns of bright focus, perinuclear halo, or wire-loop bundling in a minor population of expressing cells. Furthermore, we confirmed the focus pattern was likely formed by ORF52:DNA condensation, which was due to relocalization of cytoplasmic ORF52 signal induced by cytosolic DNA. 
Looking into the underlying molecular controls, we located a region near the N-terminus that is critical for the exclusively cytoplasmic localization of ORF52. Further analyses revealed two CRM1-dependent nuclear export signals (NESs), one at the N-terminal domain satisfying a PIK-NES, which is functionally more important. Similar NESs were also identified in other γ-2 (RRV, MHV68, HVS, EHV-2, and BHV-6), but not in γ-1 herpesviruses (EBV, MaHV4). Point mutation at the nuclear-localized EBV ORF52 (BLRF2) at S36 to hydrophobic residues enables relocations to the cytoplasm, suggesting the designated area to be essential for the localization of gammaherpesviral ORF52s, but evolutionarily bifurcated at genus level. 
Interestingly, even though there are two functional NESs were recognized in it, we noticed that KSHV ORF52 remained cytoplasmic upon treatment of Leptomycin B (LMB), a CRM1 inhibitor. Furthermore, we also observed inconsistencies in response to LMB between KSHV ORF52 and its truncational mutants, as well as among its homologues, suggesting additional controls to the localization that are specific to KSHV. In our attempt to explain this phenomenon, we performed nuclear export reporter assays and mRNA-exporter luciferase reporter assays only to find KSHV ORF52 may inhibit CRM1-mediated nuclear export. 
Finally, we tested KSHV ORF52 mutants for its inhibition of cGAS-mediated-IFN response, inhibition of CRM1-mediated nuclear export, production of infectious KSHV progeny virion during viral reactivation, and enhancement of microtubule cytoskeleton bundling/polymerization. In each experiment, we observed the key residues for NES that are critical to the cytoplasmic localization to be required. Altogether, these data suggested versatile functions of KSHV ORF52 and the importance of intracellular localization for its normal functioning in the KSHV life cycle, which shed light on future studies on KSVH-associated pathogenesis.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation sought to investigate the Hierarchical Model of Vocational Meaning (HMVM), a theoretical model that could be used to explore constructs of meaning thought to be associated with vocation.  There is a gap in the literature between what is provided and what is needed to research vocational meaning effectively.  The HMVM represents a theoretical paradigm for examining four levels of meaning that include (1) Survival, (2) Egocentrism, (3) Group Welfare, and (4) Universal Connection. Each level of meaning is measured by the Vocational Meaning Survey (VMS) that assesses the respective meaning constructs in terms of importance.  The four scales of the VMS consist of Basic Needs (Survival), Self Enhancement (Ego Centrism), Team Enhancement (Group Welfare), and Transcendence (Universal Connection). The investigation of the HMVM employed the use of the VMS to explore the model with respect to (1) the relationship of the HMVM constructs to each other, (2) whether the constructs are associated with age, gender, and race, and (3) the extent to which the constructs predict (a) meaningful work and (b) life satisfaction in the presence of age, gender and race. The sample population consisted of n=252 MTurkers. The participants were at least 18 years of age and resided in the U. S. The strength of the relationships among the four constructs of the HMVM was investigated through Pearson correlations and structural equation modeling (SEM).  The relationship between the four HMVM constructs with respect to (a) age was through Pearson correlations, to (b) gender through t-tests, and to (c) race through MANOVA.  Hierarchical regression was employed to ascertain whether the four dimensions of the HMVM predict (a) meaningful work (MW) and (b) life satisfaction (LS) in the presence of age, gender and race.  
The results of the analyses revealed that all correlations between pairs of HMVM constructs were statistically significant (r = .159, p &lt; .05), and that the correlations between Self Enhancement and Transcendence and between Team Enhancement and Transcendence exceeded practical significance (r &gt; .50). No dimensions of the HMVM were significantly (p &lt; .05) associated with age.  The dimensions Team Enhancement and Transcendence significantly (p&lt; .05) differentiated genders with males scoring higher than females.  All four dimensions of the HMVM differentiated among four racial/ethnic groups with Blacks earning higher scores that the respective comparison groups. The dimensions Team Enhancement and Transcendence captured significant (p &lt; .001) independent variation in predicting both meaningful work and life satisfaction.  The background variables age, gender and race failed to perform as mediating variables and were unrelated to either criterion variable, MW or LS. 
Implications of the results for refinement of the HMVM theory and for improving the psychometric quality of the VMS, as the operational form of the theory, are discussed.

            <DISS_para>Using Hedwig and the Angry Inch, Head Over Heels, and The Knife as a starting point, this thesis explores the representation of transgender characters in musical theatre. While other forms of queer representation have found a home on the musical theatre stage, depictions of transgender characters are extremely limited and written from the perspective of cisgender people, for cisgender people. While some aspects of the characters ring true (for example, the ideas of touch), there are points that do not accurately represent how the trans experience unfolds for many trans people. Most of the portrayals tend to devolve into stereotypical representations, which leads to unintended consequences, ranging from problematic comments to blatant transphobia. This affects how trans people see themselves represented and also how cisgender people understand who trans people are. This thesis aims to look at these representations in order to show how these depictions influence the perception of transgender people. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Introduction: Due to the high metabolic demand of sport, it is essential that athletes meet their caloric need to support training, recovery, and muscle growth. Consuming protein before sleep may have positive effects on sleep, overnight recovery, muscle protein synthesis, and performance. Additionally, consuming carbohydrates before sleep may improve hours of sleep and reduce wake episodes throughout the night. Pre-sleep fat consumption, particularly saturated fat, may also increase wake episodes throughout the night, therefore decreasing quality. Furthermore, sleep is a time where growth and recovery occur; metabolic activity is at its lowest point, and higher rates of growth hormone are secreted, thus promoting recovery. Sleep is typically the longest post-absorptive period, so examining the potential effects of pre-sleep food consumption is warranted for the impact on both sleep and recovery. Currently no data exist to assess pre-sleep nutrition habits in elite female athletes, particularly soccer players. Methods: In a retrospective study, 14 Division I female soccer players (mean ± sd: age 20.8 ± 1.4 years; height 167.9 ± 4.87 cm; weight 64.1 ± 6.9 kg; BMI 22.7 ± 0.5 kg/m2) from four universities wore a WHOOP, Inc. band 24h a day for the entire 2020-2021 competitive season to measure activity, sleep, and recovery. Surveys were administered through the WHOOP app every 3 days over the season to collect data on pre-sleep feeding habits and their effects on sleep quality, sleep quantity, and markers of recovery (as defined by resting heart rate [RHR], heart rate variability [HRV], and a WHOOP, Inc. generated recovery score). Descriptive results were completed using R studio. Results: Average pre-sleep nutritional intake (mean ± sd: kcals 330 ± 284; pro 7.6 ± 7.3 g; fat 12 ± 10.5 g; cho 46.2 ± 40.5 g) was recorded. No significant differences between high versus low kilocalorie (p = 0.10, 0.42), protein (0.69, 0.65), fat (p = 0.16, 0.81), and carbohydrate (p = 0.17, 0.81) pre-sleep consumption were reported on metrics of sleep, including hours of sleep and wake episodes, respectively). Furthermore, no significant differences existed between high versus low pre-sleep kilocalorie (p = 0.84, 0.84, 0.81), protein (p = 0.64, 0.70, 0.06), fat (p = 0.26, 0.76, 0.81), and carbohydrate (p = 0.66, 0.93, 0.92) consumption and metrics of recovery, including RHR, HRV, and recovery score, respectively. Conclusion: These findings suggest no significant impact of pre-sleep feeding on metrics of sleep or recovery. However, the meals consumed were small, and may not have been enough to elicit any positive responses in sleep or recovery. Further research is warranted to examine the effects of pre-sleep feeding on athletes in a controlled, laboratory-based setting. This study was sponsored by WHOOP, Inc.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para> This dissertation contains three studies which focus on how health policies affect women. The second chapter examines how public health policies can lead to unintended effects that undermine their efficacy. Beginning in the mid-1930s, most states enacted policies requiring serological syphilis tests prior to receiving a marriage license. Using novel county-level health statistics, I find no evidence suggesting that the policies were effective at reducing the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections. The serological testing policies had two unintended consequences that potentially reduced their effectiveness. First, the increased cost of marriage deterred marriage for young couples. Using microdata from the U.S. Census, I find that these policies delayed marriage and fertility and increased female educational attainment and employment. Second, marriage licenses decreased in counties with pre-marital testing policies and increased in bordering counties, suggesting that couples traveled to marry in less restrictive states.  
 Chapters 3 and 4 address the effects of professional guidelines on health decisions. In 2014, to address concerns of overtreatment, a panel of experts released new guidelines on the amount of normal tissue to be excised around a tumor in breast conserving surgery (BCS) for early-stage cancers. In a differences-in-differences set-up utilizing the variation in timing of the guidelines and clinical stage at diagnosis, I find that women with stage 1 and stage 2 breast cancer receive fewer re-excision surgeries following initial BCS and are less likely to receive mastectomy after the guidelines relative to women with more advanced disease. The decrease in mastectomy is driven by patients who would have gone on to receive further reconstructive surgery. In Chapter 4, I study the effects of changes to cervical cancer screening guidelines recommending screening begin at age 21 rather than age 18. The guidelines significantly decreased the probability young women report having ever been screened relative to women over the age of 21. The delay in recommended screening also delayed receipt of other services from specialist providers. For example, I find suggestive evidence that the guidelines decreased the probability of using long acting reversible contraceptives for young women and increased the use of contraceptive methods with higher typical use failure rates.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The prediction of financial time series is an essential topic in quantitative investment. In this dissertation, we proposed two types of new models. They are bidirectional encoder representations from Transformers-based financial sentiment index enhanced (BERTFSIE) models and analysts' recommendation index enhanced (ARIE) models. Compared to statistical time series models, BERTFSIE models and ARIE models involve not only the assets log-returns but also the financial sentiment of investors' reactions and analyst recommendations individually. Furthermore, an adaptive epoch size selection strategy, an early stopping for sequential data strategy, and a novel hyperparameters selection strategy (Score voting) are proposed to solve the over-fitting problem in the training process of a neural network model when its size is large, and the training data is limited.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>An experimental study is conducted examining the BERTFSIE models and ARIE models. Additionally, they are compared with statistical time series models (e.g., Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Explanatory Variable (ARIMAX) model, and the Vector Autoregressive Moving Average (VARMA)), machine learning models (e.g., Long short-term memory (LSTM)), and hybrid models (e.g., ARIMA-LSTM, VARMA-LSTM) in terms of predicting the log-returns and direction movements of two stocks from four industries (Technology: Alphabet Inc., Verizon Communications Inc.; Finance: Citigroup Inc., The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.; Pharmaceutical: Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, AbbVie Inc.; Retail: Costco Wholesale Corporation, Target Corporation) with three testing proportion: 10\%, 20\%, 30\%. To be more specific, the forecastability of different models is evaluated in two separate ways: the prediction ability of the assets log-returns is assessed by root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), and the prediction ability in the direction of the assets log-returns are judged by weighted $F_1$ score and weighed AUC score. Meanwhile, one step ahead forecasting and rolling forward with expanding windows are selected in the experimental study.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The results of the experimental study indicate that BERTFSIE models perform almost uniformly better than the other models in terms of weighted $F_1$ score and weighed AUC score. In addition, with the increase of the validation size and testing size, the performance difference among these models is diminishing. At the same time, ARIE models have competitive performance with BERTFSIE models in some selected industries.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study is exposition on the themes of method and mysticism in the work of Simone Weil. Nearly a decade before the onset of her first mystical experience, Weil developed a method to be rigorously applied in daily philosophical reflection. She outlines this method in her dissertation on Descartes (1929-1930). I examine the question of how Weil applied method to philosophical reflection on her mystical experiences (onset 1938-1939). I analyze Weil’s mystical experiences as a type of transformative experience in L. A. Paul’s strict sense of the term. On Paul’s view, an experience is transformative if it is both epistemically and personally transformative. An experience is epistemically transformative if the only way to know what it is like to have it is to have it yourself. An experience is personally transformative if it changes your point of view, including your core preferences (Paul, 2014). I present a thought experiment and textual evidence to motivate the claim that Weil’s mystical experiences meet Paul’s conditions for transformative experience. I then propose two epistemological facts that can be revealed by philosophical reflection on mystical experience. First, it is possible to read meaning erroneously in the appearances of things. Second, it is possible to come to hold to the certainty of a conviction for reasons that elude the intellect. My findings suggest that Weil’s late views on philosophy accommodate these two epistemological constraints, thereby demonstrating a possible connection between Weil’s mystical experiences and her mature views on the nature, scope, and proper method of philosophy. However, my preliminary findings also suggest that Weil’s early work on method may have anticipated these epistemological obstacles prior to the onset of her first mystical experience. Thus, further exposition of Weil’s method is needed to support or elucidate the claim (Rozelle-Stone and Davis, 2021) that Weil’s epistemology underwent significant changes because of her mystical experiences. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Indigenous people around the world maintain worldviews that emphasize the interconnection between living and non-living entities and the spiritual and physical worlds. Healers in these communities believe that imbalance occurs when these connections are lost and use Indigenous healing knowledge of medicinal plants, prayers, and rituals to reinstate balance. However, healers perceive that due to the lasting effects of colonization the Indigenous knowledge is in the process of being lost. This study aims to illustrate how Yucatec Maya women healers in Belize explore their identities, agency, and empowerment using the Indigenous healing knowledge as tools of decolonization to resist and transform institutional structures. This study will use a decolonizing methodology, the Tree of Life, to explore the healers’ lived experiences through their stories of acquisition, practice, and transferal of their Indigenous healing knowledge.Keywords: Indigenous research methodology, Indigenous healing knowledge, healers, decolonization, education

            <DISS_para>First-generation, low-income students currently complete higher education degrees at lower rates than their peers. It is well established that focusing on a students’ academic and social integration during their first four semesters can aide in their degree persistence.  This study aims to provide ways in which higher education professionals can support low-income first-generation students on their path to obtaining a college degree. Specifically, it investigates academic and social integration efforts that aided in their success.To further research the lived experiences of first-generation, low-income students, individual interviews were conducted with nine students at the University of Florida. Student-participant responses were coded and analyzed using NViVo12 software. The findings highlighted several ways in which Student Affairs practitioners can support the academic and social transition of their students. 
These results suggest that, while each students' integration experience is unique and varied, there are consistent concepts that should be considered when supporting this population of students to degree completion.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Over the past few decades, U.S. communities have become increasingly unequal in terms of aggregate educational composition. Extant research shows that educational composition predicts community prosperity and community wellbeing consistently and strongly. Research on changes in community educational composition over time suggests that internal migration—movement within a country—plays a key role in such change, but this research does not often quantify or measure the role of internal migration. Therefore, this dissertation closely examines the role of internal migration in heightening or mitigating between-community educational disparity. I use 2013-2017 American Community Survey (ACS) data to estimate several measures of migration at relatively small geographic units, covering every square mile of the United States. These geographic units serve as “communities” for which I also construct a measure of educational capital (EC)—the proportion of the population ages 25 to 64 with at least a bachelor’s degree.The current study has four analytic chapters with related research goals. The first analytic chapter explores the relative contributions of origin and destination community EC in shaping the educational composition of migration flows between origin-destination pairs. The second analytic chapter examines the effect of extant community EC on net migration patterns by education group—bachelor’s degree and higher (BA+) and less than bachelor’s degree (&lt;BA)—and age group to evaluate the potential for internal migration to exacerbate or mitigate between-community disparity. The third analytic chapter articulates population processes underlying migration-induced changes in community EC. And the fourth analytic chapter estimates the effect of migration-induced change on community EC annually and over one generation. All analyses focus on ages 25 to 64.
Findings in the first analytic chapter indicate that migration flows from a single origin can have widely different educational compositions depending on destination EC. Educational sorting occurs to destinations such that destinations with highly educated populations attract migration flows that are even more highly educated than the destination and the origin, on average. Analogously, destinations with low levels of education attract migration flows with even lower levels of education than the destination and the origin, on average. 
Findings in the second analytic chapter measuring net migration for each community indicate that current internal migration patterns reinforce existing between-community spatial disparity in EC. Not only do communities with high extant EC receive positive net migration of the BA+ group, but these highly educated communities experience negative net migration of the &lt;BA group. At the same time communities with low EC experience positive net migration of the &lt;BA group and negative net migration of the BA+ group. Thus, migration of the &lt;BA group contributes to between-community disparity in EC in tandem with the migration of the BA+ group. Further findings reveal a life cycle in this pattern for the BA+ group, while the &lt;BA group has no such life cycle.
The third analytic chapter exploring the processes of migration-induced change indicate that changes in the number of BA+ adults in communities occurring via migration more commonly result from differences in the educational compositions of in-migrants compared to out-migrants rather than the sheer number of in-migrants compared to out-migrants.
The fourth analytic chapter demonstrates the magnitude of migration-induced change in EC for each community over a generation if migration patterns remain unchanged, ignoring for the moment other population processes. In this scenario, mean community EC decreases as measures of variability (i.e., standard deviation) increase. Communities already at the top continue to pull ahead, and many at the bottom see sizeable decreases in community EC over time. I also highlight exceptional cases.
Overall, findings reveal a self-reinforcing pattern of selective internal migration between U.S. communities that exacerbates spatial disparity in community EC by conferring further advantage to EC-rich communities at the expense of those that are already disadvantaged.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The atmosphere and the ocean interact through air-sea heat and momentum fluxes. Thesefluxes are critical in ocean, atmosphere, and coupled modeling across a broad range of spatial
and temporal scales, from large-scale global modeling to very high-resolution regional studies
and from climate studies to operational forecasting. It is important to minimize the air-sea flux
errors in order to obtain accurate and realistic model results. This study investigates two sources
of air-sea flux errors within the Gulf Stream region during winter months: the horizontal model
resolution of the atmosphere and the ocean, and the dynamical coupling and current feedback
between the ocean surface currents and the wind stress. Four different atmospheric and ocean
coupled model simulations are completed with various combinations of 2 km (submesoscale
resolving) and 6 km (submesoscale permitting) grid spacing. Four additional model simulations
are completed using the same model resolutions defined in the first four experiments, but the
coupling and feedback between the surface currents and the wind stress is included.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The dynamical coupling and the current feedback lead to large changes in the surfacestress and stress curl patterns. This leads to a reduction in the ocean’s mean and eddy kinetic
energy, which largely controls the Gulf Stream path. The dynamical coupling is also found to
control the physical gradient related to the atmospheric horizontal momentum advection. The
stress gradient largely explains the variability in the horizontal advection when the dynamical
coupling is not included, while the current gradient across current direction largely explains the
variability in the horizontal advection when the dynamical coupling is included. Additionally, the
dynamical coupling and current feedback is found to be important in regulating the mixed layer
depth and SST throughout the warm water to the right of the Gulf Stream path due to the
horizontal heat advection in the mixed layer. A high-resolution ocean model is found to also be
important in influencing the Gulf Stream path, as well as constraining the submesoscale vertical
heat fluxes to the ocean’s mixed layer. The atmospheric model resolution is found to impact the
magnitude of the stress, wind work, sea surface height, and surface currents, in addition to the
strength of the horizontal and vertical winds throughout the atmospheric column. The dynamical
coupling and current feedback, as well as having a high-resolution atmosphere and ocean, is
further found to be important in the vertical extent of the state parameter fields, as well as in the
atmospheric circulation patterns.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Two-year state and community colleges provide convenient and affordable educational opportunities with open admissions policies, which make them “value-added institutions that are uniquely different than traditional colleges and universities” (Grubbs, 2020, p. 205). Students across the nation enroll in 2-year colleges to pursue their academic goals because of distinct variations, which include flexible admissions and enrollment policies. However, the lack of deadlines at open-access institutions may contribute to entry and retention challenges for students who apply late, particularly for those who may be un- or under-prepared for college. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Few studies have considered the relationship between admissions application timing, characteristics of traditional first-time in college students, and 1st-semester academic outcomes, which was the focus for this research. The study population was chosen because admissions offices have greater access to high school students through recruitment efforts such as college fairs and classroom visits. Central to this work were the hypotheses that applicants who apply early in their senior year tend to have higher high school GPAs, are more likely to enroll in the fall following high school graduation with better 1st-semester outcomes and are more inclined to return in the subsequent spring semester. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The study involved an examination of admissions application data for 3,479 first-time, 1st-semester applicants who applied to a public college with open access policies requiring only a standard high school diploma or GED. Demographic data, high school academic performance, and factors related to college preparation were collected from the institution’s student information system and the date the admissions application was submitted. The study population was limited to high school seniors who applied to the institution for the fall semester immediately following graduation. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The hypotheses were analyzed using chi-square tests, ANOVA, and a series of regression models. Variables related to admissions application timing, which were segmented into distinct recruitment periods to include the fall prior to high school graduation, spring of high school graduation, and summer after high school graduation, were used across all models. These periods correspond to blocks of time representing opportunities for admissions offices to implement targeted and actionable strategies to influence first-time student enrollments. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The analysis of the models suggested variations in student characteristics across the recruitment periods. Students who apply to an institution with open access policies in the fall prior to their high school graduation tend to enter with higher GPAs and although they enroll at a lower rate, they are more likely to attempt and earn more credit hours in their 1st semester. Additionally, earlier applicants tend to have higher 1st semester GPAs and yet are less likely to return for the subsequent spring semester. In contrast, applicants who apply to the institution in the summer after high school graduation have lower high school GPAs and 1st semester academic outcomes if they enrolled. The results of the study indicate applicant characteristics vary depending on when first-time, 1st-year students apply to the institution, and these findings may influence strategies admissions offices at open-access institutions employ to attract and enroll traditional high school students while also considering initiatives to increase first semester student outcomes. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>We examine two wave function optimization methods for producing the ground state. The first is a novel method for optimizing the location of the nodes of the fermion ground-state using a combination of diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) and projected gradient descent (PGD). A PGD iteration shifts the parameters of a node-fixing trial function in the opposite direction of the DMC energy gradient, while maintaining the cusp condition for atomic electrons if necessary. The energy gradient required for this is calculated from DMC walker distributions by one of three methods derived from an exact analytical expression. The energy gradient calculation methods are combined with different gradient descent algorithms and a projection operator that maintains the cusp condition of atomic systems. We apply this PGD method to trial functions with randomized variational parameters, for simple atomic systems and the homogeneous electron gas, and the nodes are dramatically improved. For atomic systems, PGD lowered the DMC energy to the same level as nodes optimized by variational Monte Carlo (VMC). This PGD method departs from the standard procedure of optimizing the nodes with a non-DMC scheme such as variational Monte Carlo, Density function theory, or configuration interaction based calculation, which do not directly minimize the DMC energy. The second ground state optimization method that we examine implements imaginary-time time-dependent Density functional theory (it-TDDFT) propagation to periodic systems by modifying the Quantum ESPRESSO (QE) package. This implementation of it-TDDFT propagation converges to the exact energy produced by the standard self consistent field (SCF) method in all but one case, where it converged to a slightly lower value than SCF. This suggests it-TDDFT is a useful alternative for systems where SCF has difficulty reaching the Kohn-Sham ground state.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The purpose of this dissertation in practice was to understand how women faculty and mentors influenced black women's career pathways in technology. The setting for this study was graduates from a 4-year public, mid-level university in North Florida, Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University. The exploratory study design was used through a qualitative case study to investigate outcomes associated with Black women's experiences of having a mentor or women instructor as an undergraduate in the Computer Information Systems (CIS) department at Florida A&amp;M University (FAMU) selecting technology as a career choice. The study focus was measured through the experiences and perceptions of how women faculty and mentorship shape career pathways of CIS graduates. The analysis resulted in the identification of four a-prior codes with four additional themes becoming sub-themes, and two additional themes were identified in the coding cycles. Nine total themes were identified. Findings highlighted the importance women faculty and mentors had on Black women career pathways in technology. Implications discussed for FAMU CIS department were to expand career knowledge and opportunities, enhance mentorship for Black women and improve women hiring and visibility.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Flaviviruses are positive sense single-stranded enveloped RNA viruses, most are mosquito-transmitted viruses that cause systemic infection as they disseminate through the bloodstream in vertebrate hosts. The members of the flavivirus genus are highly similar in structure and genome organization, however, some viruses have been associated with neurological complications in humans, like Zika virus (ZIKV) and West Nile Virus (WNV); while others have been linked to hemorrhagic fever like Dengue virus (DENV) and Yellow Fever virus (YFV). In the context of brain neuroinvasion, viral entry into the brain can occur through different mechanisms, for example, direct infection of brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) or breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) homeostasis. The specifics of how flaviviruses gain access to the central nervous system (CNS) remain incompletely understood, highlighting the need for researching the viruses’ phenotype in the context of the BBB and CNS. In our lab, we use human pluripotent stem cell derived BMECs (iBMECs) and different CNS cellular units including primary astrocytes and stem cell derived forebrain organoids to model the brain microenvironment in vitro. Comparing viral infection phenotypes between ZIKV, DENV and other flaviviruses in the BBB we seek to understand the different neuroinvasion mechanisms used by flaviviruses. We have evaluated how a variety of neurotropic and non-neurotropic flaviviruses might use different mechanisms to access the brain, which is typically protected by blood-brain barrier (BBB), we utilized iPSC-derived human brain microvascular endothelial cells (iBMECs) to study virus-BBB interactions. These iPSC-derived cells exhibited functional and physiological BBB properties and faithfully recapitulated the in vivo neuroinvasiveness of flaviviruses. We further developed a BBB model consisting of cocultured iBMECs and astrocytes in transwell setups. This model exhibited high TEER value and selectively blocked non-neurotropic flaviviruses from crossing the barrier.
We next focused on developing bacterial-virus co-infection models to understand how bacterial cell wall components may alter barrier function and viral permeability. To this end, I have discovered an unknown mechanism where bacteria cell wall components may increase BBB permeability and allow for traditionally non-neurotropic viruses to establish infection in the iBMECs and the brain
Overall, we were able to effectively model flavivirus neuroinvasion using iBMECs. Our research led to the description of brain-invasion mechanisms that modulate the ability of viruses to infect this physiologically relevant protective brain barrier. Highlighting the importance of virus’ ability to directly infect the iBMECs and the relationship between the cellular response to inflammation and virus permissiveness.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Due to the high prevalence of anxiety disorders and their associated impairment, elucidating neural mechanisms that underlie these disorders has been increasingly prioritized. Specifically, the error-related negativity (ERN) has been identified as a neural marker that indexes risk for anxiety across development. Approximately half of the variance in the ERN can be attributed to factors other than genetic inheritance, including factors such as parenting style and stressful life events. The present study sought to examine associations between the ERN and another factor — sleep difficulties. This study serves as a novel examination of the associations between self-reported naturalistic sleep difficulties, anxiety, and the ERN. In a sample of 221 females, ages 8 to 15 years old, we first examined the relations between chronic (i.e., over the past month) and recent (i.e., over the past week) sleep disturbances and the ERN. We then investigated whether a specific chronic or recent sleep difficulty uniquely predicts the ERN. In exploratory analyses, we assessed whether the ERN moderates and/or mediates the relationship between sleep difficulties and anxiety. Results indicated that youth who report chronically shorter sleep duration, chronically worse sleep, and recent shorter sleep duration on school days over the past week have a larger ERN. In addition, recent sleep duration on school days over the past week uniquely predicted the ERN. Exploratory analyses indicated the ERN moderates the associations between chronic sleep quality and total anxiety, as well as that between chronic sleep quality and child social anxiety. Finally, results suggested the ERN may partially mediate the link between sleep problems and anxiety.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Chapter One examines the possibility of labor upgrading during the financial crisis of 2008-2009.  We use granular information on the intended demand of foreign workers by publicly traded U.S. firms during 2005–2012 to examine firm-level labor decisions. The financial crisis has a negative impact on the labor demand in general, but we find that larger firms with lower leverage, higher market-to-book, and larger R&amp;D-to-assets are more likely to upgrade their work force by requesting highly skilled foreign workers during the financial crisis.  Furthermore, firms that upgrade their demand of foreign workers during the financial crisis are more productive in innovations, as proxied by more patents granted, during the post-crisis period. The evidence suggests that some firms indeed take advantage of the crisis to upgrade their labor force and such an upgrading has real economic benefits for those firms. Chapter Two examines how an exogenous shock affects analysts’ forecasts. Utilizing the art market, this study leverages artist death as an exogenous setting to explore how it impacts the accuracy of analysts’ pre-sale price estimates. In the year following an artist’s death analysts’ accuracy decreases by 14% on average. Subsample analysis indicates that the market attention and artists’ reputation are the likely economic mechanisms influencing this decrease. These findings suggest that analysts perform poorly following information shocks which is pertinent for all capital market participants. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>A longitudinal study is a research design that collects observations measured repeatedly from particular individuals over prolonged periods of time. Nowadays, longitudinal studies are widely used in health sciences, social science,  education, economics, and marketing. However, several challenges are raised from longitudinal studies in the real world. For example, the complex data structure and variable-length sequential data invalid the conventional longitudinal models. The long-term sequential data and missing data from incomplete experiments add difficulty to the model prediction. To cope with the complex real-world data, we put the focus of this project on the exploration of innovative methods.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The main goals of this study are to seek and propose new algorithms for the prediction of the longitudinal response and the cross-sectional response with the time-invariant and time-variant predictors during the specific prediction window. To achieve the main goals, we propose four prediction frameworks, including Multi-phase Deep Learning Prediction Framework (MDL-PF), Self-attention Recurrent Neural Networks Prediction Framework (SARNN-PF), Multi-phase Deep Learning Longitudinal Progression Prediction Framework (MDL-LPPF), and Global Attention Recurrent Neural Networks Longitudinal Progression Prediction Framework (GARNN-LPPF). We conduct the simulation study on the proposed models to test the model's reliability and generalization in different data settings and display the models' behaviors and performance.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We focus on the medical domain and financial market in the application part. In the first empirical data analysis, we utilize the Framingham heart study (FHS) dataset. The FHS is one of the early longitudinally-followed large cohorts and can be used to study the contributors of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and predict the disease progression. We conduct two experiments: the prediction of the incident CVD event during a specific prediction window and the prognosis of the patient's functional status in Heart Failure. In the second real-world data analysis,  we extend our models to Credit Card Default dataset. We also have two experiments: the prediction of credit card payment default and the prediction of the remaining amount in the current month. The proposed prediction architectures show absolute superiority and outstanding performance in the simulation study and empirical data analyses. Compared with the conventional RNN-based model, the Attention Mechanism displays the advantages of overcoming the complexity and heterogeneity of long-term longitudinal data.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The impact of including Sea Surface Temperatures (SSTs) of differing horizontal grid spacings in simulations of river and sea breeze related weather has not been studied extensively in the Cape Canaveral area of Florida. This study assesses whether simulations using a 1 km SST product, which better captures the complexity of the region’s coastal geography, improves simulations incorporating a 6 km SST product that does not define the geography of the region as well. The Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) was used to simulate days with river and sea breeze development around Cape Canaveral during the warm season. Simulations utilized two-way nesting with horizontal grid spacings of 3 and 1 km. Output from the 0900 UTC run of the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model was used to initialize the WRF model. SSTs of 1 or 6 km grid spacing also were used in initializing the WRF model.The impact of using the higher resolution SST dataset is presented by analyzing simulations of 2 m temperature and convective initiation, which is an important factor for operational planning at Kennedy Space Center. In addition, dynamic and kinematic properties of the thermal circulations simulated using the two SST products are presented. The analyzed characteristics include the location and timing of river and sea breeze passages, which are also important for planning operations at Kennedy Space Center.
Observations of water temperatures from buoys in the Atlantic Ocean near Florida’s Space Coast and water temperature sensors in the Banana and Indian Rivers were compared to those depicted in the two SST products. Somewhat surprisingly, results show that the water temperatures of the Banana and Indian Rivers, as well as the SSTs in the Atlantic Ocean, were better represented by the 6 km SST product rather than the 1 km product. Additionally, simulated 2 m temperatures were closer to observed 2 m temperatures in simulations using the lower resolution SST data. Mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) between the two SST products were calculated for the water temperatures of the two inland rivers and Atlantic Ocean. The same metrics were determined onshore for the simulated 2 m temperature based on the two SST runs. MAE and RMSE values for depictions of the SSTs and river temperatures were found to not improve in the 1 km SST product. For simulations of onshore 2 m temperatures, MAE and RMSE were also found to not improve when using 1 km SSTs in simulations. The differences in MAE and RMSE values between both SST runs for both the depictions of the water temperatures and simulated onshore 2 m temperatures were found to be significant at the 95% confidence interval.
Improved simulation of convective initiation was found when increasing the SST resolution. The amount of improvement depended on the flow regime. The greatest improvement occurred during the onshore flow regime when using the higher resolution SSTs. Inconsistent improvements were found using 1 km SSTs when observed single cell convection develops over Merritt Island.
Simulations of the dynamical and kinematic aspects of the Banana and Indian River breeze generally were improved when using the 1 km SSTs. The return flow of the three local breezes was successfully simulated and generally found to be stronger when using 1 km SSTs. Simulations using 1 km SSTs also were found to better locate the Banana and Indian River breezes. In addition, the use of both SST resolutions simulated stronger maximum ascents for all three breezes than found in previous studies, along with slightly greater simulated depths of the sea and two river breezes.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Sir John Tavener’s music brings two disparate spheres together, his music being a bridge between the earthly and the Divine. Tavener’s works are written within the sphere of Classical music but incorporate many styles of sacred music, most notably Byzantine chant, but with large influences from sacred Indian chant and ragas as well. Tavener’s six solo piano works are no exception to his sacred compositional style. This treatise aims to show the effect of the religious and the spiritual in Tavener’s life and piano works, and how Tavener holds a distinctive place as a composer in the history of music.   </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Sure Thing is a collection of short stories set primarily in Southeastern Wisconsin, in the fictional suburb of Forest Hills, south of Milwaukee. The stories take place between 2008 and 2018 and document the daily lives of the people of Forest Hills—failing relationships, failures to communicate, drug and alcohol abuse, depression, death—as well as the development of the city itself. Over the course of the collection, a father attempts to repair his relationship with his pregnant daughter, a son discovers the rocky foundation his parents’ marriage is built on, a brother turns to pharmaceuticals to cope with his sibling’s death, a friend returns home after five years of radio silence. Overconfidence is challenged. Again and again these characters interrogate a fundamental question: Are we happy here? Sure Thing follows in the footsteps of other regional writers whose work focuses on the people of the Upper Midwest, like Stuart Dybek, Emily Fridlund and Dan Chaon, among others, and showcases a variety of narrative modes.

            <DISS_para>American conceptions of regicide rarely garnered scholarly attention, an issue this thesis addresses by examining the differing reactions to the Swedish regicide of 1792 and the French regicide of 1793. These years witnessed an outpouring of American emotions and opinions on regicide, as the discussion faded somewhat in later years. The Swedish king Gustav III and his 1792 regicide offered little for Americans emotionally, as his nation had little impact on the young republic. Americans interested in international republican revolution closely followed the story through articles that took joy in the Swedish monarch’s painful death. In contrast, Americans grieved for the 1793 regicide of Louis XVI due to his perceived status as a founding father of liberty in two nations, in addition to his connection to colonial American conceptions of mythically good kings. A few Americans challenged this paradoxical republican mourning for a hereditary authority, but their opinion formed a minority. This thesis also explores the ways Americans understood the term regicide itself. Much like their reaction to the killing of Gustav III and Louis XVI, that understanding was not constant but contextual.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>	A large number of tensor datasets have been appearing in modern scientific research, attracting much attention to the analysis of such datasets. Tensor data often have high dimensionality and tensor structure that contains extra information. Handling the high dimensionality and utilizing the structural information is essential for analyzing tensor data. Feature screening is a popular method to deal with high dimensionality. In the first part of this dissertation, we study the smoothness structure of tensors and propose a general framework for tensor screening called smoothed tensor screening (STS). We establish the SURE screening property for STS under mild conditions.  In the second part, we study the tensor Gaussian graphical model, which reveals the conditional independence structure within tensor data. With normally distributed $M$-way tensors, the key to high-dimensional tensor graphical models becomes the sparse estimation of the $M$ inverse covariance matrices. To overcome the high computational cost of the existing cyclic approaches, we propose a separable and parallel estimation scheme. We provide numerical studies to demonstrate its performance. In the third part, we study the optimality theory of tensor discriminant analysis (TDA) in high dimensions. We provide a systematic investigation on the theoretical properties of TDA. We obtain the minimax lower bound for both coefficient estimation and misclassification risk. We further show that one existing high-dimensional tensor discriminant analysis estimator is minimax optimal.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The role that high schools play in the preparation of college students has long been under debate. There are differing perspectives presented by those who make up the secondary and post-secondary systems. However, the most critical voice in this debate continues to be the voice of the student. This study will provide a comprehensive review of previous studies as well as bring forward the perspectives of current students and their lived experience with math learning and their transition from a high school setting to a seat in a college math classroom.  The findings suggest that more must be done to ensure that the math learning experience is coordinated and planned by teachers, advisors and the administrators that make up high schools and colleges. The study concludes with a list of recommendations that address the shared responsibility held by secondary and post-secondary stakeholders.

            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to explore the lived experiences of black women band directors at the secondary and collegiate levels. The goal was to understand their experiences that shaped them as educators and contributors to the profession. A secondary goal was to explore the personal and structural factors that served as support systems and challenges for their careers. This study looked to uncover the participants’ perception of the following questions using the methodology of narrative inquiry: (1) In what ways have participants in the study experienced support and challenges in the advancement of their careers? (2) What values do participants in the study hold as an educator? (3) How has the intersectionality of being black and female informed or shaped the careers of the participants in the study? The participants were seven black females that are current or retired secondary or collegiate band directors. An analysis was done in order to find commonalities across the data. Those data consisted of interview transcripts of fourteen individual interviews from the seven participants. The study resulted in six themes being developed: (1) racial and gender discrimination, (2) representation, (3) resilience, (4) philosophy on teaching, (5) inspiration to pursue music, and (6) support.   </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Tonic Immobility (TI) is a common defensive response in situations involving extreme fear such as physical and sexual assault. Although TI is adaptive in certain circumstances, it has been shown to contribute to increases in negative emotions, particularly guilt and shame, along with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Psychoeducation regarding the nature, prevalence, and common misconceptions about TI may help prevent or address these symptoms. However, TI is not directly addressed in current evidence-based interventions for trauma survivors. Thus, the current study sought to develop and evaluate a brief TI-focused psychoeducation intervention (TIP). Fifty-four participants were recruited based on prior TI experience and elevated PTSD symptoms. During the pilot phase, 6 participants completed the TIP intervention and provided feedback to inform revisions. Pilot results demonstrated high acceptability. During the RCT phase, 48 participants were randomly assigned to the TIP or control condition (HET) with assessments at pre-intervention, post-intervention, week 1, and month 1. Hierarchical linear regressions demonstrated significantly greater reductions in post-treatment guilt, but not shame, in the TIP condition as compared to HET. No effects of treatment condition were found on week 1 or month 1 outcomes. The current study was limited by its small mixed sample of undergraduate and community participants, relatively brief follow-up, and lack of assessment regarding post-intervention skills practice. Despite its limitations, results suggest that TIP is a promising intervention that may be used to reduce negative feelings and trauma-related symptoms associated with TI. Future work is needed to establish the efficacy of the TIP intervention, particularly among vulnerable populations.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this thesis, I will examine how activist athletes, particularly Naomi Osaka, construct their self-identity within social media. In Osaka’s case, I will explore how Naomi Osaka’s identities as black and a woman interact with her activism and politics through social media, and if Osaka’s activist messaging is responded to by producers and consumers of social media. Do they respond to Osaka’s activism, and what dominant structures are produced, reproduced, and perpetuated by this phenomenon? 	The main interpretive framework that I employ is Black Feminist theory, and specifically toward examining how black women have historically been erased in the discourse surrounding social justice issues. In other words, Western patriarchal society has not allowed black women to tell their own stories, nor adequately represent themselves in the social justice discourse. In this thesis, I examine Osaka’s construction of her identity and activist ideals through her Twitter posts. These posts run parallel to social justice movements (i.e., Black Lives Matter), and sport events that Osaka participates in (i.e., U.S. Open and Cincinnati Masters).
To carry out this project, I use Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) to examine the social, cultural, and political implications regarding the language (and thus sentiments) of media and fans that respond to Osaka’s activism vis-à-vis tweets that she produces. I explain how and where Osaka’s activism (i.e., what she chooses to speak out about within the societal order) originates, if producers and consumers of social media respond to it, and what that tells us of where we are as a culture in the United States today. The results indicate that sentiments from repliers to Osaka’s activism were highly contested; some repliers agreed with Osaka’s expressed concern for marginalized groups, while others found it inappropriate for an athlete to speak on socio-political issues. Studying Naomi Osaka’s construction of her activism and politics, moreover the responses to it, will aid in understanding how mediated identities are formed in contested ways – and whereby black women continue to find new ways towards liberation from systems that seek to erase them.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Technology has become commonplace in day-to-day activities, permeating our interactions, relationships, and intimacy. While it allows connectedness to those that are physically far, it also consumes our attention distracting us from being present with friends, family, and loved ones. This can take place in various forms including, but not limited to, texting, social media, video games, and entertainment applications. Phubbing, or phone snubbing, is the extent to which someone uses their phone in the presence of others. Phubbing can look like partners using their phone in the middle of a conversation, ensuring access to their phone at a moment’s notice, or using their phone during quality time spent together. Phone use has become expected when people are around each other; however, limited research has been done regarding the impact it has on relationship satisfaction. More specifically, phubbing as it relates to adult attachment and relationship satisfaction. This study explored how perceptions of phubbing behaviors can inform the established relationship between attachment and relationship satisfaction for the individual and the relationship. A sample of 116 couples was recruited through snowball and convenience sampling methods. Participants completed an online survey comprised of measures for demographic information, adult attachment, relationship satisfaction, and partner phubbing behaviors. The data was analyzed using an Actor-Partner Interdependence Moderation Model, or APIMoM, to identify the moderating role of phubbing on the actor and partner effects of attachment and relationship satisfaction. Perceptions of phubbing were found to moderate the relationship between an individual’s anxious attachment and avoidant attachment to their partner’s reports of couple satisfaction. This supports the interdependent nature of phubbing and the impact it has on the understanding of attachment and couple satisfaction. Future research should explore a larger sample over time to understand long-term impacts of this moderation. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Computer vision is an interdisciplinary scientific field that deals with how computers can gain high-levelunderstanding from digital images or videos. The tasks of computer vision include methods for
acquiring, processing analyzing and understanding digital images. In this dissertation, we present
approaches for obtaining meaningful representations in computer vision. The second chapter proposes
a new method for dictionary learning that uses Feature Selection with Annealing (FSA) to
control the representation sparsity directly. This method obtains a smaller reconstruction error
than LARS or IRLS and the sparse representation can be used for image classification, where it
obtains a smaller misclassification error than LARS and IRLS. In the third chapter, we introduce
a novel neuron formulation that can be used for obtaining a tight representation near the training
examples and thus preventing high confidence predictions on examples that are far away from the
training data. The proposed a neuron uses ReLU as the activation function and has compact support,
which means that its output is zero outside a bounded domain. We also show how to avoid
difficulties in training a neural network with such neurons. Furthermore, the experimental findings
on standard benchmark datasets show that the proposed approach has smaller test errors than the
state-of-the-art competing methods and outperforms the competing methods in detecting out-of-distribution
samples on two out of three datasets. In the fourth chapter, we prove that a neural
network with such compact support neurons has the universal approximation property. This means
that the network can approximate any continuous and integrable function with an arbitrary degree
of accuracy. In the last chapter, we use the feature of CSNN for few shot learning by recognizing
data from a new class as out-of-distribution data and it shows good performance.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Animal shelters as an institution serve a fundamental role in the United States as public safety administrators and as animal welfare advocates; however, animal shelters have only rarely been researched from a communication standpoint. In this dissertation, three studies were conducted utilizing grounded theory and autoethnography to create a better understanding of communication from both shelter outsiders’ and insiders’ points of view. Analysis suggests that popular Eurocentric media relies on common stereotypes when depicting shelters, including portrayal of “evil” dogcatchers and grim shelters. However, the image created by shelter self-representation suggests a very different understanding of a growing and changing industry focused on the wellbeing of shelter animals but struggling to communicate these changes to the public. Ultimately, these discourses come to a head in the so-called “kill/no-kill” debate surrounding the destruction of animals in shelters, which has become one of the most contentious and prominent concerns for animal shelters today. This dissertation explores each of these issues in depth and offers suggestions for shelter communication practitioners and academics alike to better evolve our understanding of sheltering communication.</DISS_para>

      <DISS_content>
         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In Metamorphoses, Ovid outlines the progression of human generations as being made first from clay, then blood, then stone. The humans made from clay represented a leftover unity between heaven and earth, which had only recently been separated according to the creation myth: “Maybe the earth that was freshly formed and newly divorced / from the heavenly ether retained some seeds of its kindred element.” Raindrops from heaven mixed with the dirt of the earth which Prometheus could then mold into the likeness of gods. Ovid describes this time as an Earth at peace, not yet broken even into separate seasons or into individual homes, when the earth was “untouched by the hoe, unscathed by the ploughshare.” </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>I live as we all do, in a world of breakage. Between the self and others, ancestors and their lineage, the past and the present. Where do they overlap? Many myths point to the earth on which we stand as the intermediary between the underworld and ours. The soil is not a thing but a process. It is ever metabolizing, re-forming, and transforming itself. Our myths themselves function similarly: as they are told, parts of them morph and graft onto each other like a plant accruing other meanings. Composition is akin to turning over a stone to see its underbelly. There you can glimpse the breakdown of life with its peachy mush of worms, but also new creation. It is repulsive and enthralling, the slight exhilaration of decay.  I write when I feel lonely, searching under stones for love. But language is only part of my search for communion. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Virginia Woolf perhaps said it best in A Room of One’s Own when she discussed how women must form their own syntax, their own language. Of the woman writer she wrote, “Perhaps the first thing she would find, setting pen to paper, was that there was no common sentence ready for her to use.” The tools passed down for her to speak through had been created for someone else.  I find other ways to communicate; through my feet on the earth I converse with ghosts and missing mothers. There is a pair of mourning doves that live in my backyard. Every day I see them bobbing across my brick patio, pecking at the ants and tiny insects between each sandy crack. My couch faces a window overlooking the patio, and I was sitting there this morning, wrapped in a blanket. I thought about how much I would prefer to be sitting on the couch with my mother. When I was a teenager we would sit there together often, on weekend mornings. We drank coffee slowly and read together, our feet touching as we each reclined against opposing arms of the couch. She read passages aloud to me, would pick up a book from the pile behind the couch at random and read me the synopsis on the back. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This morning, alone on my own couch, I watched one of the mourning doves thud against the window. I had never seen either do this before and was surprised at the drama of the glass vibrating and the dove cooing loudly as it flew backwards in confusion. Luckily still alive, it careened upwards out of view, but a pile of its feathers unfurled in its absence. Little feathers, like bits of smoke, falling to the ground. Memories are just like smoke - there but not there all at once. I could call my mother whenever I liked, or even sit on that same couch on visits home, but I could never reach that feeling I had been remembering, never return to that time where I had yet to find my own place in the world. Before that lonesome journey of leaving home in order to find it. But it felt so real, and who’s to say it wasn’t, this trip I took in my mind? Her voice and her feet, the weight of our blanket. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Writing is the thud that brings me back to the room. Its mess, its light, its smallness. But the room encompasses everything - my past, the world’s past. I didn’t feel so lonely anymore, watching the dove’s feathers in the aftermath. Everything was there with me, greeting the rest of the day and all its sun. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>As High-Performance Computing (HPC) applications with data security requirements are increasingly moving to execute in the public cloud, there is a demand that the cloud infrastructure for HPC should support privacy and integrity. Incorporating privacy and integrity mechanisms in the communication infrastructure of today’s public cloud is challenging because recent advances in the networking infrastructure in data centers have shifted the communication bottleneck from the network links to the network endpoints and because encryption is computationally intensive.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In my Ph.D. research, I consider incorporating encryption to support privacy and integrity in the Message Passing Interface (MPI) library, which is widely used in HPC applications. In this dissertation, first I will present the baseline encrypted MPI library. I have used this baseline library to measure the performance overhead for both point-to-point and collective communication. Then I will discuss the optimization techniques I have used to optimize point-to-point communication for both small and large messages. After that, I will discuss the techniques used to design novel encrypted algorithms for the Scatter collective operation. I have performed evaluation on three platforms and also using Docker containers. The results show that my techniques achieve significantly higher performance than the data encryption method of the Docker swarm. The evaluation on three platforms indicates that the proposed techniques are more effective when the network speedis significantly higher than single-core encryption performance, a likely scenario in the future.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The impinging jet flowfield observed during take-off and landing of a STOVL aircraft is known to be associated with several adverse effects such as strong acoustic emission, unsteady structural loads, loss of engine efficiency due to hot gas ingestion, thermal stresses on the deck surface, and loss of lift. This flowfield has been well studied from the standpoint of characterizing the induced lift forces and moments caused by fountain flows, unique to such a flowfield. However, in the scenario of two such jets operating in tandem where properties are influenced by jet-jet interaction and coupling, are relatively unknown. Also, there is a lack of understanding of the consequences of difference in the momentum-flux and temperature of the two jets on the flow and acoustic properties. Therefore, the fundamental goal of this study is to systematically assess how different parameters such as momentum-flux and temperature affect the flow and acoustic properties of supersonic dual impinging jets. Thus, the three objectives of this study are: (1) How are the characteristics of supersonic dual impinging jets different from those of a supersonic single impinging jet? (2) What is the effect of relative momentum-flux between the two jets, on the aeroacoustic characteristics of supersonic dual impinging jets? (3) What is the effect of relative temperature, on the aeroacoustic characteristics of supersonic dual impinging jets?</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To address the first objective, experimental investigation of the flowfield associated with two, under-expanded impinging jets operating at a Nozzle Pressure Ratio (NPR) of 2.65, discharged from identical converging nozzles with an exit diameter of 25.4 mm, is performed. Comparisons with a single impinging jet, operating at the same conditions are provided through shadowgraph flow visualizations, nearfield acoustics, and surface pressure measurements. Fountain flow produced by the interaction of wall jets, a unique feature of dual impinging jets, is found to be relatively strong at short impingement heights and contributed to additional loads on the ground surface. Overall flow unsteadiness in dual jets is less than that in a single jet at conditions involving resonance and the fountain upwash plays an important role in the process. Although the feedback mechanism that drives the resonance in both impinging jet configurations is similar and the corresponding instability mode shapes are retained, there are differences in the strengths of the instability modes between the two configurations.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To address the second objective, flowfield is characterized by systematically varying the relative jet momentum-flux between the jets. A converging and converging-diverging (CD) nozzle pair, with identical throat and exit diameters, respectively, is employed during the study. The CD (right) nozzle is held at a fixed over-expanded nozzle pressure ratio (NPR) of 3, and the momentum flux of jet from converging (left) nozzle is varied by changing its expansion ratio (ER). Schlieren flow visualization and ground plane surface pressure measurements indicate that the fountain flow position and strength exhibit a strong dependence on the jet momentum flux and a weak dependence on the impingement height. Further, an increase in momentum of the left jet causes the resonance in the right jet to lose its strength and its influence on the unsteadiness of the left jet, owed to the proximity of the fountain flow to the resonating jet. The presence of fountain upwash is found to alter the symmetry of streamlines, shear layer growth characteristics, and turbulent kinetic energy of the right jet. Under certain conditions, the fountain is close enough to significantly interact with the right jet and change the characteristics of the inner shear layer. Thereby, the processes constituting the feedback mechanism are notably altered and culminates in a weaker resonance.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To address the third objective, the flowfield is characterized by systematically varying the relative jet temperature between the jets by increasing the temperature of only one of the jets (right). The NPR of the two jets are held fixed at conditions same as those used for the second objective. Qualitative visualization of the flowfield suggests that the left jet and fountain regions remain nearly unaffected by the right jet temperature. However, a corresponding increase in the jet velocity occurs in the right jet. Both the fountain position and its strength are independent of relative jet temperature and a strong function of the jet momentum flux. The increase in jet temperature also results in additional noise in the nearfield and increased unsteadiness on the impingement surface, although the latter is limited to short impingement heights and the region close to the right jet. At higher temperatures, short impingement heights are found to be more susceptible to resonance, with the chief source of resonance originating in the heated jet. At a fixed impingement height, while the jet instability mode shapes are retained, the corresponding impingement tones in the heated jet experience a systematic increment in frequency with rise in temperature. A detailed study of the velocity field suggest that, for a pair of jets at a given relative jet momentum flux, their fountain upwash could contribute to increased unsteadiness in the region around the nozzle (under-surface of the aircraft) at higher jet temperatures.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The present experimental study significantly enhances the understanding of the impinging jet flowfield and its associated impacts on the parent aircraft, noise field and nearby structures. From an engineering standpoint, the results from this study will help inform aerodynamicists and structural engineers about the consequences of multi-jet-impingement configurations in STOVL applications. This is done through a systematic characterization of several parameters, which would provide the design guidelines. The three key findings of this study are: (1) Dual impinging jet flow and acoustic fields are strongly influenced by the fountain flow; (2) Fountain strength and placement relative to the jets, plays an important role in influencing the ground induced adverse effects. This in turn depends on the momentum of the jets; (3) Jet temperature can also worsen these effects, although this is a weaker factor than jet momentum</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>From a scientific stand point, the results from this study provide a high fidelity database for the validation of numerical tools on dual impinging jet configuration. Furthermore, the present study provides the baseline data to help study flow and noise control techniques for dual impinging jets.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The role of implicit processes during police-civilian encounters is well studied from the perspective of the police. Decades of research on the “shooter bias” suggests that implicit Black-danger associations potentiate the perception of threat of Black individuals, leading to a racial bias in the decision to use lethal force. Left understudied are civilians’ possible associations of police with danger and how these associations pervade behavior and explicit views of the police. The current work begins to address this gap. In two within-subjects studies, we separately assess police-threat (i.e., safety/danger) and police-valence (i.e., good/bad) associations as well as their relative influences on explicit perceptions of police. A third study examined defensive physiological outcomes of police evaluations. Study 1 revealed that implicit threat evaluations (police-danger associations) more strongly predicted negative explicit views of the police compared to implicit valence evaluations (police-negative associations). Study 2 replicated these findings and suggests that individuals evaluate the police as more dangerous vs. negative when each response is pitted against each other within single misattribution procedure trials. Study 3 revealed that threat evaluations of the police extend to defensive physiological responses. The possible implications for explicit attitudes towards police reform and behavior during police-civilian encounters are discussed. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Current research has suggested that college student-athletes are at an increased risk for experiencing mental illness but utilize mental health support services at a lower rate than the general college student population. Stigma toward mental illness has been identified as a factor that can influence student-athletes’ decision to utilize mental health support services. The aim of this study was to analyze the relationships between the demographic variables of socioeconomic status, sport played, class, race and gender and levels of stigma toward mental illness and peers that utilize mental health support services. This study also investigated college student-athletes’ perceived attitudes toward the benefits and barriers to utilizing mental health support services. The participants in this study were 141 NCAA student-athletes who completed an online survey assessing stigma and attitudes toward peers that utilize mental health support services. Follow-up interviews were conducted with seven participants to gain a deeper understanding of the salient attitudes toward the benefits and barriers to utilizing mental health support services. Analyses were conducted to identify relationships between demographic variables and high stigma levels. Results indicated that there was a significant relationship between sport played, class, and gender and stigma levels within the sample. Also, qualitative analysis indicated that self-awareness was identified as a perceived benefit to utilizing mental health support services, but mental health illiteracy, fear of being labelled, and stigma were perceived barriers to utilizing mental health support services in this sample. Findings from this study have implications for how college athletic departments deliver effective mental health support programs to their student-athletes.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This document, which is divided into two main parts, explores works written for the piano that bridge the art forms of music and dance. Part I of the document focuses on two sets of twentieth-century suites written by French composers: Maurice Ravel’s Le Tombeau de Couperin and Francis Poulenc’s Suite francaise d’après Claude Gervaise. Part II discusses my collaboration with composer Badie Khaleghian on a new work, entitled Electric Sky Blue (2022), for piano, dance, and interactive intermedia.	In Part I, my examination of Le Tombeau de Couperin and Suite française highlights the extent to which both Ravel and Poulenc retain traditional elements of past dance forms while adapting the dance suite to their own individual musical languages. By tracing the infusion of the French dance tradition into the works of Baroque and pre-Baroque composers, and subsequently, into the twentieth century, I seek to illuminate the ways in which gaining a thorough understanding of this tradition––including its history, dance forms, and aesthetics––contributes to a more informed, effective study and performance of these 20th-century suites. Further, I briefly discuss the effects that both piano works had on the twentieth-century French aesthetic and musical identity in the years surrounding World War I.
Part II of the document serves as an account of the collaborative and compositional processes of producing a new multidisciplinary work, Electric Sky Blue, which incorporates both dance and piano. I also provide an analysis of the dialogue between these media along with interactive visuals and audio throughout the piece and, further, the structural and expressive significance of this dialogue. Lastly, I discuss reasons for the importance of producing multidisciplinary, intermedia works for twenty-first-century audiences.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Change is a constant in organizations, especially public institutions. Without change everything remains the same and nothing improves. Organizations that adopt the idea that change is inevitable do far better than those who deny the process (Al-Ali et al., 2017; Davis &amp; Fifolt, 2018). Change should be done with the purpose of improvement and implemented strategically. Ascher (2013) states “organizations must develop better practices and policies aimed at generating a greater organizational continuous learning culture that embodies innovation, creativity, and proper training and its implementation” (p. 39). Gordon and Fischer (2015) also argue strategic planning is an effective tool for an organization’s continuous improvement and success. The purpose of this study was to examine the change management practices implemented at a public university to address policy compliance. The research specifically focused on change management practices and the involvement of change leaders and agents within the College of Medicine (COM). Nine COM leaders were interviewed to discuss their implementation of eight change management strategies identified in change management literature. Their responses helped answer the research questions: (1) What change management strategies were implemented at COM to improve policy compliance? (1a) How were the strategies implemented by change agents? (1b) Why were the strategies implemented by change agents? (2) How did the university’s monthly compliance report scores change after the implementation of change management strategies?
Findings revealed the most frequently implemented change management strategies were communication, leadership, and management to improve policy compliance. Participants discussed how and why they implemented the eight change management strategies. Communication, bringing awareness, setting expectations, monitoring and providing feedback, and providing a sense of ownership and value for stakeholders were frequently implemented within the change management strategies discussed.
The review of data from the university’s monthly compliance report revealed the desired downward trend for each of the five metrics for the College of Medicine as a whole. Compliance report data by individual departments also showed a similar downward trend. Although the implementation of the change management strategies cannot be directly correlated to the downward trend on the monthly compliance report for COM, the report does show improvement in policy compliance during the time the change management strategies were implemented. 
It is recommended that when performance improvement efforts are needed within higher education, multiple change management strategies be implemented. Findings from the study support the realization that change management strategies have overlapping elements such as communication, bringing awareness, setting expectations, and providing feedback.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Prior to selecting a YouTube video, users encounter video previews (i.e., thumbnail images) and heuristic cues (i.e., number of views, likes, date of period), which may influence their selection of a YouTube video over other potential options. This online experiment employed a 2 (valence: positive/negative) x 2 (view count: low/high) within-subjects design to examine how both factors (i.e., valence and view count of YouTube thumbnails) individually and via their interaction, influence participants’ (N = 95) selection of the YouTube video, sharing intentions, and memory recognition of Thumbnail content. The results from this study showed no significant differences in selection of videos or recognition memory of thumbnail images that vary in positive and negative valence. However, there was a significant interaction between valence and the selection of thumbnail images while controlling for participants’ frequency of neck pain as a covariate. The results showed that the more frequent neck pain resulted in a greater selection of positively-valenced thumbnail images than negatively-valenced thumbnail images. Moreover, as predicted, YouTube thumbnail images with high view counts were selected more than YouTube thumbnail images with low view counts. These results support prior research on heuristic cues (i.e., view counts) while failing to support the negativity bias hypothesis. The practical implications from this study indicate that content creators should design thumbnails with positively-valenced imagery and with popularity cues, such as high view counts, if the goal is to increase video selection among YouTube users.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>African American students have been historically targeted for exclusionary discipline practices and as a result have had severely impacted by the amount of missed instruction. Zero tolerance policies have curated the phenomenon known as the School to Prison Pipeline which has disproportionately criminalized student behaviors and funneled them into the juvenile justice system.   KIPP Baltimore has experienced a spike in suspensions. This study examined teachers’ perceptions, beliefs and practices that contribute to student’s missed instruction.  The primary focus of this study was to understand teachers’ perception of behaviors and the discipline policy designed to address behaviors.  To do this, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 KIPP middle school teacher participants. Purposeful sampling was used to identify teachers who taught at KIPP for three or more years and have been in the teaching profession for five or more years.  Constant comparison analysis was used to analyze teachers’ responses. The findings highlighted the need to consider importance of teacher beliefs and experiences in shaping their work as educators as well as their interactions with students.  The results suggest teacher inclusion in policymaking in an effort to transform culture and the need to provide in-depth, meaningful, and consistent professional development opportunities to teachers.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This dissertation is focused on studying the effects of mixed-anion sublattice on Li+-ion conduction. Mixed-anion sublattice comprises multiple anion species in a structural framework which increases the degrees of freedom in tuning structural properties due to the differences in the anion radii, electronegativity, and polarizability. Thus, properties such as ionic vs. covalent bonding, local polyhedral distortions, and anion site disorder can be tuned for fast Li+-ion transport. Utilizing strategic synthesis of mixed-anion materials with compatible chemistries and advanced characterization techniques, structure-property correlations are established to understand the origin of fast Li+-ion conduction. The mixed-anion materials examined are the argyrodite Li6-xPS5-xClBrx, Li3PO4 – LiI, and 2LiX-GaF3 (where X = Cl-, Br- or I-). Solid-state synthesis accompanied by high-energy milling is utilized to synthesize these materials. X-ray and neutron diffraction are employed to study long-range structures whereas nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Pair Distribution Function (PDF) analysis are used to determine local structures. Additionally, NMR relaxometry and EIS spectroscopy are utilized to study ion dynamics and transport and correlate these properties with refined structures. In the argyrodite structural framework, mixed-site occupancy of Cl-, Br-, and S2- is shown to enhance lithium transport properties by increasing the frequency and lowering the activation energy of lithium jumps. In the Li3PO4 – LiI composite, I- anions are used to interrupt the ordered PO43- network in Li3PO4, which destabilizes Li+-PO43- interaction and liberates Li+-ions with enhanced ionic conductivity. A similar mechanism is found in the 2LiX-GaF3 (where X = Cl-, Br- or I-) by the formation of complex GaXaFb anions that weaken lithium-anion interactions, yielding high ionic conductivity. In the Li1.05Hf0.05Ta1.95PO8 – 0.15LiF, the addition of LiF is shown to stabilize the Hf-doped LiTa2PO8 and improve the grain boundary transport properties. Overall, anion diversification is shown to be effective to enhance ionic conductivity by flattening the energy landscape for ion conduction. Additionally, metastable phases are observed that exhibit enhanced performance with this strategy. The fundamental understanding of lithium-ion transport mechanism in anion engineered framework in this study provides guidelines for designing high-performance materials as solid electrolytes for all-solid-state batteries and can be applied to materials beyond Li+-ion conductors, such as Mg2+, Ca2+, Zn2+, K+, and Na+-ion conductors.xx
Furthermore, the mixed-anion strategy can be used to make new metastable phases that may exhibit unprecedented functionality.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this Dissertation in Practice was to examine the perceptions and attitudes of faculty members at Florida State University - Panama City and then to further explore, through interviews, why the faculty hold a positive, neutral, or negative view of intrusive advising.  The goal of this project was to understand the barriers for faculty to accept and support intrusive advising as a mechanism to increase retention rates and student success, especially for vulnerable populations.  The local context of this study is a branch campus of a major research one university, where the campus is transitioning from a non-traditional student campus, to one of a residential campus, newly accepting first time in college students.  This study utilized mixed methods to effectively answer the three research questions posed.  This study employed quantitative methods, using descriptive statistics and bi-variate correlation to analyze faculty surveys and then qualitative methods to evaluate faculty interviews to gain a deeper understanding of their perceptions and attitudes towards intrusive advising.  Findings relate that communication with the faculty about student interventions and administrative directives are crucial and that faculty need information about these interventions to formulate their opinions.  Implications of the faculty’s attitude toward towards student retention efforts, workload, time management and professional advising as an intervention will also be discussed.  </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>SEARS Family Portrait of the Artist is a memoir that depicts the author’s recovery from molestation that occurred approximately from his age 5 in 1987 until his age 8 in 1990 at the hands of a family friend. The author narrates from age 40 in the year 2022, though he begins the story by reflecting specifically on the year 2008 when he moved back home with his parents as an unemployed adult. The story moves back and forth in time between deep recollection of the 1980s and recent recollection of the 2000s and dramatizes episodes of traumatic flashback. The main plot thread follows his reconciliation with his family, whom he had grown resentful of. Near the end of the story, the author reveals that the molester attempted to contact him, unwelcomely, as recently as 2018. The voice, the candor, and the sensibility of the memoir was heavily influenced by contemporaneous memoirs such as Her by Christa Parravani, Poster Child by Emily Rapp Black, Men We Reaped by Jesmyn Ward, and Heavy by Kiese Laymon.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Cognitive control guides non-habitual, goal directed behaviors allowing us to flexibly adapt to ongoing demands. Previous work has suggested that multiple cognitive control processes exist that can be classed according to their action on present-oriented/external information versus future-oriented/internal information. These processes can be mapped onto the prefrontal cortex (PFC) such that increasingly rostral areas are involved in increasingly future-oriented/internal control processes. Whether and how such processes are organized to support goal-directed behavior remains unclear. On the one hand, the PFC may flexibly adapt which processes are most influential for cognition based upon demands. On the other hand, there may be a consistent control architecture that organizes control processes. Previous work using fMRI in humans during a comprehensive control task that engaged several control processes at once found that an area in mid-LPFC consistently exerted widespread influence throughout the PFC. These data suggested that the mid-LPFC forms an apex of a putative control hierarchy that organizes control processes. However, whether such an architecture generalizes across tasks remains to be tested. Here, we utilized a modified comprehensive control task designed to alter how control processes influence one another. Univariate fMRI activations revealed distinct control-related activations relative to past work. Despite these changes, effective connectivity modeling revealed a similar directed architecture to previous findings with the mid-LPFC exerting the most widespread influences through PFC. These results suggest that the fundamental architecture of the PFC and control processes is relatively fixed, and that different demands are accommodated through modulations of this fixed architecture.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Depictions of China and Chinese culture and influence are prominent in Vladimir Sorokin’s fiction from the late 1990s to the early 2000s. This thesis argues that Sorokin’s depictions of China are based off of actual geopolitical occurrences from that time period. More specifically, this thesis argues that Sorokin’s depictions of China are representative of many of the ‘soft power’ strategies China has employed on the international stage since the 1990s, including the use of both cultural and economic soft power tools.  This thesis examines two novels by Sorokin which have significant depictions of Chinese soft power influence: Blue Lard (1999), and Day of the Oprichnik (2006).  In both novels, China has achieved great cultural and economic successes similar to those successes experienced by the real-world China since it began its ‘peaceful rise’ in the 1990s. China is depicted as being a dominant cultural and economic force, as Chinese language and culture are privileged by the societies in these novels. Conversely, Russia is depicted as backwards, while Russian language, literature, and culture are not afforded the same prestige as Chinese. These depictions of the futuristic relationships between China and Russia are indicative of Sorokin’s awareness of China’s real-world growing geopolitical soft power influence and the belief that China may indeed rise to become the dominant world power, while Russia’s increased authoritarianism may lead to it occupying an inferior position on the world stage.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This dissertation explores how digital methods reveal ways in which soundscapes and landscapes function in William Wordsworth’s complete poetical works, Lord Byron’s Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage, and Charlotte Smith’s collected poetry. My agenda for this project is two-fold. My first objective is to engage in a meaningful discussion of sound and space in Romantic-era poetry. My second objective is to provide a practical model for digital methods in Romanticism. By using these digital methods, this project 1) generates several visual models, such as word clouds and maps, to explore sound and space in poetry, and 2) creates an alternative way to present literary research. These visualizations are intended to catalyze my larger discussion of sound and space in the Romantic Period and also reinforce my corollary argument that digital methodologies are necessary tools for the humanities.To explore this topic, my dissertation works with a larger corpus than traditionally expected, which allows me to garner a broader sense of sound in the field. I investigate sound’s relationship to space in these poets’ works and how digital methods can help reinforce, refute, or make discoveries in Romantic poetry. This process is what I term as “middle-reading,” which balances close and distant reading methods for reading large literary corpora. Middle-reading unifies the objectives of close and distant reading methods to be legible to two different audiences, those who perform traditional literary scholarship and those who experiment with digital technologies and try to redefine the field.
My dissertation project is part of a larger academic movement to re-imagine dissertations in the humanities. This dissertation and its corresponding website document an English Literature Ph.D. Candidate’s journey carrying out the “next generation” of Ph.D. This dissertation isn’t just a compilation of five chapters—it is accompanied by a blog-style website and Github repository where much of my labor and time was spent. For the sake of transparency, I made all of my digital methods, corpus materials, and resources available through blogging on my website, writing explanatory footnotes, and building an appendix that showcases my code and data. Just as my methodology of middle-reading requires the reader to re-evaluate how they read, my dissertation challenges both myself, my committee, and readers to reconsider what it means to write a humanities dissertation.

            <DISS_para>When designing professional development for math teachers, teacher confidence, math anxiety, and student performance are factors to consider. St. Lucie Public Schools in Florida has seen a decline in performance in fifth-grade mathematics, where students are first asked to showcase their knowledge on operations for fractions. As a curriculum department, it is essential to design future professional development to meet the needs of teachers. Professional development plays an important role in supporting teachers in providing quality instruction to students. For mathematics, professional development is often designed using three different approaches: content knowledge, pedagogical strategies, or pedagogical content knowledge. This quantitative method study sought to investigate if teachers provided pedagogical content professional development reduces teachers' math anxiety, increases their confidence in teaching fractions, and increases student achievement. The study found that teacher confidence and student achievement increased with professional development, not specific to pedagogical content knowledge. Math anxiety was decreased with professional development, not specific to pedagogical content knowledge. These findings are discussed, and recommendations for the district are offered in the final chapter. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study is about the formation of elite lay Buddhist societies in late 16th-century and early 17th century Hangzhou. In this era, many classically trained Confucian scholars were not only philosophically inclined to Buddhist doctrines but also financially supportive of monastic construction projects in remote mountains as a deliberate attempt to create an ideal site for their exclusive enjoyment. I heuristically call these Confucian scholars the “Late-Ming Beats”—they were usually either politically frustrated officials or failed civil service examinees. They fantasized about living a reclusive life, retired from politics at a young age, regularly visited and patronized Buddhist monasteries, befriended the monastics, funded the constructions and renovations of the monastic buildings, and practiced meditation under their favorite Buddhist masters.	One may entertain the idea that the foundation of Buddhist societies in the late Ming was an analog to the Beat Generation of the last 1950s’ in the United States. Despite the different socio-historical contexts, what connects these two social phenomena are their counterreaction against repressive societal norms in which Buddhism became the alterity. The Buddhist society fellows were mostly politically frustrated scholar-officials and continuously failed civil service examinees. Many deliberately forfeited their future political careers due to factionalism and partisanship in officialdom. I use Tu Long 屠隆 (1542-1605) as an example to examine his gradual disenchantment with politics and increasing interest in religious practices. What Buddhism signified was a “spritual” escape from the profanity and meaninglessness of politics.
	In this study, I give historical details about the formation of lay Buddhist communities and the monastic responses to these laities’ presence. I focus on three elite societies—the Society of Fragrant Adornment, the Society of Tranquility, the Society of Vegetable and Bamboo Shoot. The establishment of these societies helped the Late-Ming Beats to conceive an elitist lay Buddhist identity. They believed the literati are the most authentic Buddhists who appreciate the essence of Buddhism and combine Buddhist doctrines with Confucian teachings. I focus on their cultural and financial patronage to the monastery, the society’s monthly gathering program and activities, and their literary style and achievement. Their support and furnishing of cultural artifacts in monastic institutions led to the flourishing of Buddhism in the Hanzhou region. Through their literary productions on local monasteries, their historical treatises, and their compilations of gazetteers, the literati constructed their own version of Buddhism.
	Then, we shift away from the literati construction of Buddhism to the monastic accommodations to their activities. I focus on the guesthouse, tearoom, ritual, and meditation rooms exclusively created for the literati’s enjoyment in the monastery—in other words, the physicality of literati’s “places of socio-leisure.” By comparing earlier canonized monastic codes with later renditions of these codes that circulated in the early 17th century Hangzhou, I identify the emergence of several monastic “hospitality” office posts—such as special chef for the guest and the charity workers. These findings suggest an increase in interaction between the monastic and the elite laity. Catered to attracting more literati, the powerful monasteries in the mountains also expanded their institutional reach by building sub-temples (xiayuan 下院) or branch temples (ziyuan 子院) in the city. For these monasteries in remote areas, the operation of sub-temple and branches overcame their geographical disadvantages. 
Finally, through this microhistory of Buddhism in the Hangzhou region, I wish to complicate existing scholarship of Buddhism in the late imperial era by suggesting that the “late-Ming Buddhist revival” was a co-creation of the literati’s imagination of the Buddhist monastery as an otherworldly place of leisure and the monastic institutional accommodation to their imagined space. In this sense, the flourishing of Buddhist monasticism was predicated on the fantasies of elite lay Buddhist patrons. I argue that it is essential to understand the historical development of Buddhism from both external and internal contingencies of patrons and monastic institutions.

            <DISS_para>Shear banding, or the discontinuity of shear rate in flowing materials, has been reported for a broad range of industrially important systems, including wormlike micelles, powders, foams, emulsions, and liquid crystalline polymers. Amongst these systems, wormlike micellar solutions (i.e., self-assembled aqueous surfactant structures) are easy to prepare and handle and therefore are feasible as a model fluid for studies of shear banding. Additionally, they are relatively easily understood; their linear rheology at long time scales is well described by a Maxwell element with a single relaxation time. Most practical flows of shear banding materials are strongly time-dependent during initial startup of deformation before a quasi-steady flow is developed. Therefore, it is crucial to examine the kinetics of shear banding flow formation in these systems before a steady shear-banded flow is established. Recent theoretical studies suggest that kinetics of shear banding flow formation in wormlike micelles depend strongly on fluid elasticity, initial ramp up rate of the flow, micellar viscosity ratio, entanglement density, and the curvature of the flow geometry. These theoretical predictions have remained largely unexplored experimentally. The surfactant/salt chemistry and the micellar microstructure may also affect the kinetics of flow formation.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this project, we study the effects of the fluid elasticity, the initial ramp up duration of the applied shear rate, the entanglement density, and the micellar microstructure.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Synthesis and degradation of proteins in a cell must be carefully balanced to ensure organismal health. The 26S proteasome is a large protein complex that carries out most regulated protein degradation in eukaryotes. The assembly, structure, and function of proteasomes is highly conserved throughout the eukaryotic kingdom, and proteasomal proteolysis regulates nearly every biological process. Since degradation is irreversible, it is critical for proteasomes to function in a tightly regulated manner. Dysfunction of the proteasome is associated with multiple human diseases, including cancers and neurodegeneration, so it is imperative we gain insight into the requirements for proteasome activation and efficient turnover. The work described in this dissertation aims to uncover the mechanistic underpinnings of the proteasomal substrate processing toward the goal of therapeutically exploiting the proteasome for clinical intervention. 
The proteasome comprises over 70 individual subunits that must work in concert to selectively bind, unfold, and proteolyze substrates. Communication between subunits is a complex language dependent upon substrate-binding, ATP-binding, ATP-hydrolysis, conformational shifting, and more. Recent studies have contradicted what was long thought to be what triggers the proteasome to opens its central channel for substrate entry, so closer inspection was required.  The first chapter of this dissertation sought to uncover how ATP-binding induced proteasome activation and opening of the central channel through which substrates are translocated to the peptidase active sites. Intersubunit communication is further explored in the second chapter with the investigation of how the smallest and sole intrinsically disordered subunit of the proteasome, Sem1, is responsible for enhancing substrate degradation despite making up less than 0.4% of the mass of the mature proteasome. Together, this work provides new insights into the mechanism of substrate degradation and furthers our understanding of how these processes may be compromised in proteostasis-imbalanced diseases. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Talk about what people are able or unable to do is ubiquitous. Despite that fact it's unobvious just what it comes to to be able to do something. For that reason alone it would be worthwhile to explore what our abilities consist in, but another reason is the traditional philosophical question about whether we are ever able to do otherwise than we in fact do, a question that has played a large role in the debate regarding free will and moral responsibility. My goal is to explain what it is to be able to do something and to argue that we are often able to do otherwise than we do, even if determinism is true. To that end I draw on work done to understand the causal powers and dispositions of inanimate objects, like the fragility of a vase or the conductivity of a wire. Our abilities can be understood as phenomena of the same kind, differing in part that our abilities are exercised for reasons while the powers of inanimate objects are not. First, I argue that one and the same object can have opposing powers, that is powers that have compatible stimulus conditions and incompatible manifestations, so that if both stimulus conditions occur at most one of the powers will manifest. Second, I argue that if externalism about mental content is true, then many of our abilities, even to perform mental actions, are extrinsic properties. That is, if what mental states we are in depends on some of our extrinsic properties, like what exists in our environment, then many of our abilities are also extrinsic properties, even when those are abilities to perform mental actions, like deciding to get a glass of water. Third, I critique existing attempts to understand our abilities along the lines of causal powers or dispositions more generally. The extant proposals all face significant shortcomings of various kinds. Finally, I propose a theory that overcomes the shortcomings of the existing theories, and that claims that we are able to do otherwise by having opposing powers of the sort discussed above, along with some other conditions.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Mediation analysis seeks to quantify the portion of the effect of an exposure on an outcome that occurs through a postulated causal pathway. Changes in an observable mediator variable reflect activity on the pathway. To measure effects within mediation analysis, one needs estimates of both the outcome and mediator that might have occurred had a subject’s exposure been different; such unobservable values are called potential outcomes. Using the assumptions of sequential ignorability and non-parametric identification, Imai et al. (2010a) proposed a flexible approach to measuring effects in mediation analysis within a frequentist framework. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We address mediation analysis within complex data settings, where the complexity lies within the distribution of the data or the study design. For the scenario with complex data distribution, we develop a simple, but flexible, parametric modeling framework to accommodate the common situation where the responses are mixed continuous and binary. We apply this method to a zero-one inflated beta model for the outcome and mediator, show how to estimate both average and quantile mediation effects for boundary-censored data, and show how to conduct a meaningful sensitivity analysis. For the scenario with a complex study design, we develop a framework to estimate mediation effects for a two-stage SMART within the context of a single mediator, measured at one point in time. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation is a mixed methods study of race, language, and writing using the racial equity gaps in student success data as a starting point for the conversation that calls the fields of Rhetoric and Compositions, Literacy Studies, and Higher Education to act more intentionally towards creating equitable spaces in our writing classrooms. With a research circle drawn around the First-Year Composition (FYC) classroom level at open access institutions within the Florida College System’s twenty-eight colleges, this project challenges the priorities, practices, and policies that have shaped the systems enacted in current first-year writing whose student success data demonstrates continued inequities. Situating this work at the course or individual classroom level and specifically through the voices of instructors versus the program or institutional level provides an intentionally narrow lens through which to look for ways to impact these inequities more effectively. The study has been designed to  (1) identify barriers to success for students of color in First-Year Composition within two-year open access colleges, (2) identify current priorities, practices, and policies in First-Year Composition courses, (3) place the current priorities, practices, and policies  in conversation with the interdisciplinary scholarly conversations, and (4) establish points of leverage or shifts needed in First-Year Composition that could establish more equitable learning experiences for students of color in the writing classroom. Results from this study conclude three main points of leverage that FYC could more intentionally enact. The first point of leverage includes enacting an increase in reflective optimism or the belief/mindset that all students can be successful in FYC courses. The second point of leverage includes enacting an increase in teacher efficacy or the instructor’s confidence and belief that they have the knowledge to facilitate the practices necessary for enacting equitable learning spaces in FYC courses. The final point of leverage includes an increase understanding of the connection between race, language, and writing.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Increasingly scholarship reveals art museums, their exhibitions, and collections, are instrumental in shaping visitors’ larger social and cultural values (Hooper-Greenhill, 2000; Luke, 2002; Sandell, 2002) and identity (Leong, 2005; Rounds, 2006).  My qualitative study aimed to understand Black students’ experiences within a Historically Black College and University (HBCU) art gallery.  This study serves, in part, to assist my role as a HBCU art gallery director by examining the cultural value of an art gallery through student voices.  I hope this study will inform museum professionals and other institutional stakeholders by providing first-hand accounts of HBCU students.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study is to explore the art gallery experiences of a sample of Black students attending a southeast region HBCU.  The primary research question is what do the participants experience, relating to their racial and cultural identity, while engaging with art exhibitions at this HBCU art gallery?  This basic qualitative study utilized multiple data collection methods, such as interviews, meaning mapping, and content analysis..

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Designing systems that can allow for increased control of electron transfer processes at dye-semiconductor interfaces is useful in a wide variety of applications, but specifically in the field of dye-sensitized devices such as dye-sensitized solar cells and dye-sensitized photodetectors.In trying to maximize regeneration rates and minimize recombination rates in DSSCs through metal ion coordination to the non-surface bound carboxylate groups of the dye, it was discovered that doing so can ideally slow recombination rates, however it was unclear if the additional steric effects or charge of the metal ion were the cause of this behavior. Using three differently charge mediators it was ultimately discovered that electrostatics may influence regeneration rates, but steric bulk of the components used ultimately had a greater effect on the overall device performance.
With this result in hand and contemplating on the simple geometric restrictions imposed by the mesoporous nature of high surface area metal oxide substrates, we sought to determine the role porosity has on multilayer assembly loading, electrolyte diffusion, and subsequent device performance. Through modifying the porosity of the film through sintering procedure modifications and loading the film with dye molecules, it was found that porosity should be considered when designing multimolecular architectures as to have enough space to load the number of components desired and leave room for mediator diffusion.
Finally, a prototype dye-sensitized photodetector was designed with efficient charge separation characteristics in the red to infrared wavelength range. This device utilized the same device structure as DSSCs and the performance metrics for the device were measured and reported for this first of its kind device. Seeking to improve the devices performance through applying an external bias, it was determined that the metal oxide had to be shifted from TiO2 to ITO and insulating layers of atomically thin metal oxides were added in order to stabilize the performance of the device under bias.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>A qualitative study was conducted to identify the beliefs and attitudes of preservice special education teachers regarding teaching use of tangible symbols for students with multiple disabilities. Using tangible symbols is a promising practice with an emerging evidence base that supports communication development for students with complex communication needs. Preservice special education teachers participated in individual interviews, verbally reacted to a video of a child with multiple disabilities, and completed an application exercise. Data were analyzed using the Technology, Pedagogy, Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework and constant comparison to identify preservice teachers’ beliefs and attitudes about implementing communication intervention using tangible symbols for students with multiple disabilities. Participant beliefs about tangible symbols, systematic instruction, individualized instruction, characteristics of students with multiple disabilities, and communication intervention were identified. Participants expressed positive attitudes towards tangible symbols use. Suggestions for meeting future preservice education needs are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>At the end of 2016, approximately 1.5 million people were incarcerated in state and federal prisons (Carson, 2021), and more than half of these prisoners are parents of at least one minor child (Maruschak et al., 2021). Upon their release, most offenders return to their communities with the goal of making a better life for themselves. This includes finding employment, securing housing, overcoming addiction, and desisting from crime. Despite their intentions, many prisoners fail to achieve ‘reentry success’ due to the barriers they face after release. For example, offenders often lack the education and employment history necessary to find jobs or are unable to find resources that address substance abuse. Other barriers directly related to their incarceration, such as criminal records, may bar offenders from finding housing or increase their likelihood of experiencing stigma. The reentry process for parents is even more complex and often ladened with additional hardships. For example, parents may have difficulty providing financially for their children or finding childcare. Other parents may struggle to regain custody/visitation rights they lost while in prison, causing more financial burdens and emotional turmoil. After release, offenders may also be reunited with family. Establishing positive relationships with family members can increase family support and decrease family conflict, both of which are associated with better reentry outcomes (Berg &amp; Huebner, 2011; Cobbina et al., 2012; Mowen &amp; Visher, 2015; Boman &amp; Mowen, 2017; Liu &amp; Visher, 2021). However, released offenders often experience family tension, receive minimal support from family members, or have abusive relationships. For parents, reuniting with family also includes reuniting with their children. Few studies on parenthood during reentry have examined the impact of parents’ relationships with their children, and what studies do exist find mixed results (e.g. Ganem &amp; Agnew, 2007). To the extent that relationships with children operate similarly to other social ties, securing these relationships may be crucial for parents’ reentry success. 
Furthermore, reentry processes, including ‘reentry success,’ vary by gender (Steffensmeier &amp; Allan, 1996; Bloom et al., 2003; James &amp; Glaze, 2006; Belknap, 2007; Byrne &amp; Trew, 2008; Bakken &amp; Visher, 2018; Pettus-Davis et al., 2018; Mowen &amp; Boman, 2019). Women’s histories with victimization, poor mental health, lower levels of education, tendency towards passive emotions, and inward coping styles contribute to their greater likelihood for problems with addiction and mental health after release. Men’s histories of violence, longer criminal records, and tendency to cope with active emotions (e.g. anger) contribute to their greater likelihood for criminal behavior after release. Gender differences are also found in samples of mothers and fathers. Mothers are more likely to be their child’s primary caregiver, suffer from mental illness, and express more emotions towards their children (Brown &amp; Bloom, 2009; Glaze &amp; Maruschak, 2010; Maruschak et al., 2021). Fathers are less likely to live with their children, serve longer sentences, and emphasize issues with gatekeepers (Glaze &amp; Maruschak, 2010; Kjellstrand et al., 2012; Hlavka et al., 2015; Charles et al., 2019; McKay et al., 2019). However, available research often relies on narrative accounts from released parents and does not include samples of both mothers and fathers. 
This dissertation seeks to extend research on reentering parents by comparing samples of parents and non-parents, including a measure of parent-child relationship quality, and analyzing differences between mothers and fathers. To that end, data from the Serious and Violent Offender Initiative (SVORI) were used to examine the effect of parenthood, parent gender, and parent-child relationship quality on criminal behavior and mental health 15 months after release. Data consisted of four waves of interviews: 30 days prior to release and 3, 9, and 15 months after release. The final sample included 580 parents and 334 non-parents. From the parent sample, 151 participants were mothers and 429 were fathers. Four measures of criminal behavior were used, including re-incarceration, self-reported drug crimes, self-reported minor crimes, and self-reported interpersonal crimes. Two measures of mental health were used. The first measure was constructed using the Global Severity Index (GSI), which measured symptoms of psychological distress. The second measure was a self-report item that asked respondents to rate their overall mental health status from ‘excellent’ to ‘poor’. 
In examining the reentry outcomes of released parents, several noteworthy findings emerge. Although not statistically significant, non-parents tended to have worse outcomes in criminal behavior. However, parenthood did appear to have an indirect effect on minor crimes. Parents were more likely to receive family support which in turn decreased their likelihood of minor offending. Key findings for the effects of gender also emerged. Fathers had worse outcomes in criminal behavior, although not significantly worse, and mothers had worse outcomes in mental health. Furthermore, gender had an indirect effect on re-incarceration. Specifically, mothers were less likely to return to prison due, at least in part, to their greater likelihood of being primary caregivers and lesser likelihood of having antisocial peers. Findings also highlighted the importance of parent-child relationships. For example, better relationships with children significantly reduced the likelihood of minor offending. Better parent-child relationships also had an indirect effect on symptoms of psychological distress. Parents who had better relationships with their children also had more family support and less family conflict, which subsequently improved their mental health. Lastly, gender conditioned the effect of parent-child relationship quality on re-incarceration. Better relationships with children reduced the likelihood of returning to prison for mothers but not for fathers. 
In sum, these findings underscore the need for additional research on reentering parents. Theoretical implications can be made for theories of social bonds/control, general strain theory, and gender paradigms. Additionally, findings support the use of prison-based parenting programs (PBPPs) and provide suggestions for programming to better address the unique needs of parents, particularly as they relate to addressing differences between mothers and fathers. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The purposes of this exploratory survey research are: (1) to examine the degree to which best practices on language acquisition instructional strategies and resources are used across the ten schools in Monroe County School District (MCSD), (2) to understand the relationship teachers’ preparation and background characteristics and language acquisition instructional strategies and resources, and (3) to investigate how the use of effective strategies and resources are associated with academic achievement and achievement growth of English Learners in MCSD.  Closing the achievement gap between English Learners and their White native English-speaking peers has been a priority for the Monroe County School District (MCSD). Although instructional quality is critical for achievement of English Learners, little is known about what language acquisition instructional strategies and resources have been used by teachers of English Learners across ten schools in MCSD. Based on a districtwide survey of 169 teachers across 10 schools, I found that Hispanic teachers are significantly more likely to use effective instructional strategies and resources to assist English Learners. The study also found that teachers were more likely to use the effective instructional strategies and resources if they have attended an AVID, ELLevation, and WIDA professional development opportunity. Another significant finding is that secondary teachers are less likely than elementary teachers to use effective instructional strategies and resources. Recommendations and findings were shared with the Monroe County School District leadership team.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Purpose: There is a rich history of research investigating victimization and juvenile offending.  The purpose of this dissertation is to explore the relationship between childhood victimization and juvenile reoffending in a sample of juvenile justice involved youth.  Research has consistently demonstrated that there is a relationship between childhood victimization and delinquent and criminal behavior.  Still, most youth who are victimized do not go on to offend.  Nevertheless, many youth who have offended also report being victims.  Therefore, it is important to understand the mechanisms through which victimization influences offending.  Through the framework of Robert Agnew’s (1993, 2001) general strain theory, this dissertation assesses whether victimization is one of the strains most likely to lead to delinquent and criminal behavior.  Additionally, Agnew (2002) specifies negative emotionality as the mechanisms through which strain leads to offending.  This dissertation also assesses the mediating role negative emotionality plays in the strain-crime relationship using a sample of juvenile justice involved youth in Florida from January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2015.  Additionally, this research builds upon prior evidence by examining a high-risk population where all of the youth in the sample have offended.  By doing so, it is a more nuanced assessment of reoffending with a high-risk sample that is more likely to have experienced victimization along with having a longer delinquent/criminal history.  Furthermore, this research makes a significant contribution to prior research on negative emotionality by having a more complete measures that more closely parallels what was originally specified by Agnew (2001).  Methods: In order to determine the effects of strain on negative emotionality, OLS regression is utilized while a series of logistic regression models are used to assess the direct effects of strain on juvenile reoffending and the mediating effects of negative emotionality.  To further examine the magnitude of which negative emotionality mediates the relationship between childhood victimization and official juvenile reoffending, two techniques—the Karlson-Holm-Breen (KHB) decomposition method and marginal effects—are used.  The decomposition method determines the percentage of relationship that is due to the mediator—in this case, negative emotionality.  The marginal effects allow for a comparison between youth low and high in negative emotionality and how those levels impact the likelihood of juvenile reoffending.
Results: Childhood victimization—exposure to violence, neglect, verbal abuse, and poly-victimization—has a direct effect on juvenile reoffending.  When accounting for negative emotionality, the size of the direct effects are reduced indicating that mediation is occurring.  The KHB decomposition method indicates the direct effect of victimization and juvenile reoffending is reduced between twenty-six and sixty-one percent when accounting for negative emotionality.  Additionally, youth who are high in negative emotionality are between fifty and sixty-two percent more likely to reoffend than youth who are low in negative emotionality.
Conclusion: This study finds support for Robert Agnew’s (2002) concept of negative emotionality as a mediator between strain and criminal and delinquent behavior.  While it does so only partially, the findings of this study imply that interventions targeting negative emotionality (e.g., positive coping mechanisms) can be directed towards youth who experience victimization.

            <DISS_para>Meta-analysis is a valuable tool to synthesize evidence and pool results from multiple sources. It plays an integral role in evidence-based medicine and may have a direct impact in the clinical setting. This dissertation explores several topics related to research synthesis methods and their application to evidence-based medicine. Chapter 2 methodologically assesses the current systematic reviews and meta-analyses on COVID-19. COVID-19 has caused an ongoing public health crisis. Many systematic reviews and meta-analyses have been performed to synthesize evidence for better understanding this new disease. However, some concerns have been raised about rapid COVID-19 research. The current systematic reviews and meta-analyses on COVID-19 might suffer from low transparency, high heterogeneity, and suboptimal statistical methods. In chapter 3, we investigate the performance of several methods commonly used for meta-analyses of diagnostic studies, including the summary ROC (SROC) approach, bivariate linear mixed model (LMM), and generalized linear mixed model (GLMM). The variation of estimates calls into question the appropriateness of the normality assumption required by the SROC method and LMM. In cases of notable differences presented in these methods’ results, the GLMM is preferred.Network meta-analysis (NMA), an extension of pairwise meta-analysis, is a statistical method often used to draw conclusions about multiple treatment comparisons. It simultaneously synthesizes both direct and indirect evidence, where the direct evidence comes from head-to-head trials, and the indirect evidence comes from indirect comparisons with common comparators. The prior choice of between-study heterogeneity is critical in Bayesian NMAs. Chapter 4 assesses recent NMAs published in high-impact medical journals to evaluate how conclusions differ based on the application of various prior distributions. We re-analyze the NMAs using 3 commonly-used non-informative priors and empirical informative log-normal priors. The informative priors produce substantially more precise estimates than non-informative priors, especially for NMAs with few studies. The surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) and the P-score are increasingly used to quantify treatment ranking under the Bayesian and frequentist NMA frameworks, respectively. They provide summary scores of treatments among the existing studies in an NMA. Clinicians are frequently interested in applying such evidence from the NMA to future decision-making. The heterogeneity between existing studies in the NMA and the future study needs to be considered in this prediction process. Chapter 5 extends the frequentist treatment ranking measure, P-score, to the Bayesian framework and the future study setting, focusing on NMAs with binary outcomes. Two empirical examples are used to illustrate the proposed measure. Chapter 6 considers an extension of the approach presented in chapter 5 beyond binary data. Using an extensive database of NMAs identified in a recent survey, we re-perform all eligible NMAs and calculate the differences between treatment ranking measures and those between predictive treatment ranking measures. We investigate the empirical distribution of these differences and assessed the changes of treatment ranking measures when making predictions. The predictive P-score can help inform medical decision-making in future studies. Clinicians may use these findings to interpret the magnitudes of differences between treatment ranking measures and quantitively assess treatment rankings in future NMAs.

            <DISS_para>Traditionally, if two files are considered identical, they are understood to be byte-by-byte equivalent.  However, many files are semantically identical without being byte-to-byte identical.  We assert that by using a contextual or implicit notion of alikeness, new recovery mechanisms, caching algorithms, security protocols, and backup tools can be developed with a reduced storage overhead penalty and robust guarantees regarding secure deletion.  To that end, we have developed and prototyped the Facets system, which leverages filtered provenance data to store and recover files, cache equivalent sets to improve performance, securely delete files, and minimize the overhead penalty incurred when performing backups.  We view the Facets approach as broadly applicable and extensible within the realm of storage.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Aaron Copland’s music is commonly identified with experiences and values associated with the United States. This link between the American nation and Copland’s music is a component of an enduring legacy that the composer began to construct during the apex of his career in the 1940s and 1950s. This dissertation interrogates the process of building this legacy and the lingering implications for America’s social and cultural landscape that were a consequence of its construction through a study of Copland’s works written specifically for and alluding to the theater, including Music for the Theatre (1925), Vitebsk (1929), Hear Ye! Hear Ye! (1934), The Second Hurricane (1937), Quiet City (1939), Rodeo (1942), Appalachian Spring (1945), and The Tender Land (1954). My project is informed by archival research in the Library of Congress and the New York Public Library, and interdisciplinary approaches drawn from critical theory, performance studies, and social psychology. The content of Copland’s theatrical music is discussed in relation to the social, cultural, economic, and political conditions of their production. In addition, I also evaluate how these works contributed to the solidification of Copland’s identification as an American and a composer of American music and the reification of a discernable white culture. In this dissertation the interpretation of meaning serves as a starting point for evaluating how Copland’s music influences the perception of reality across space and time. Analyzing what these works do, in addition to what they say, acknowledges their distributive authorship, the collaborative nature of their genesis, and the implications of actions Copland took to shape his own legacy. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Marine aquaculture, the farming of aquatic species in ocean environments, has substantial potential to contribute to the global supply of seafood. However, despite the global growth of marine aquaculture (mariculture) in recent years, there is substantial heterogeneity in where and to what extent the industry is developing. Additionally, biophysical growing conditions alone do not explain a large proportion of the variation in production, indicating that the geographic patterns of industry expansion are likely driven by other (e.g., economic, political, social) factors. As such, this dissertation examines the role of these non-biophysical factors in the development of the mariculture industry through a regional case study and a global analysis. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The regional case study evaluates the influence of governance mechanisms on mariculture production in the Caribbean, which has high production potential based on biophysical parameters but has only realized a fraction of its estimated potential. For this chapter, I developed a Mariculture Governance Index (MGI) to assess existing mariculture governance frameworks within each of 30 Caribbean countries. When compared to current production volumes, I found a significant association with the level of mariculture governance for a given country. Specifically, the few countries with production tended to have higher MGI scores. However, case studies of the few countries that produce mariculture but have low MGI scores found that training programs, professional organizations, and financing institutions could provide the necessary support for industry development in the absence of the governance components included in the Index. In addition to insights about mariculture development in the Caribbean, this chapter contributes an extensive literature review of governance in relation to mariculture generally and a systematic index that can be used to assess governance infrastructure in other regions. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the global analysis, I expand on the Caribbean findings to quantitatively assess the extent to which governance, socioeconomic, and biophysical factors explain country-level patterns of mariculture production. Using multivariate statistics and global datasets, I assess the impact of 11 predictor variables on 1) whether a country has any mariculture production (yes or no) and 2) what volume of mariculture production a country has. The results of my analysis indicate that countries with large wild fisheries industries and high levels of development are most likely to have some level of mariculture production. Further, both of these factors as well as the existence of a freshwater aquaculture industry are associated with higher volumes of mariculture production. This chapter is the first multivariate, interdisciplinary assessment of factors influencing mariculture production and provides a foundation for a new research agenda that will improve our understanding of where and why the mariculture industry develops.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The findings from the regional and global analyses indicate that governance and socioeconomic dynamics are highly influential but poorly understood drivers of the expanding mariculture industry. Geographers are well-positioned to explore and provide insight on these dynamics but have been relatively absent from the mariculture scholarship, particularly in comparison to other disciplines. To account for geographic participation in the mariculture literature, I conduct a review of the top 50 geography journals (as ranked by Clarivate Analytics), identifying 45 publications from 1990-2020 that focus on farming seafood in ocean spaces. In my review of this literature, I identify existing foundations for a maricultural geography in the arenas of political economy, political ecology, and science and technology studies and trace the evolution of these discourses over time. Lastly, I outline three pathways for further disciplinary engagement through the lenses of food and feminist geographies as well as social studies of science.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Taken together, these chapters spatially and theoretically engage with mariculture and situate the industry within geography’s broader agro-food discourses.  Further, this work contributes to a nascent body of literature seeking to understand the role of mariculture in our global food system. Here, I have started to untangle the network of socionatural assemblages that shape the development of the mariculture industry by looking at development at different scales and employing both qualitative and quantitative techniques.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>There has been recent discussion of a puzzle posed by emotions that are backward looking. Though our emotions commonly diminish over time, how can they diminish fittingly if they are an accurate appraisal of an event that is situated in the past? In this paper I give some background information on the problem, and I explain Agnes Callard’s solution to what she terms “the eternal anger argument.” I explain some problems with her account as well as insights of her account that have influenced my own. I then argue that anger can fittingly diminish even when there is lack of contrition, and I propose a sort of permisivism about fittingness by showing that anger is not the only fitting response to blameworthy behavior, compassion is also a fitting response. I then respond to some worries my account raises, and I clarify some details of my account to show that it is not unrealistic to the way some of our anger actually does diminish.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Online courses have become an important part of a student’s academic career. The variety and number of online course offerings grow each year. Unfortunately, there are a few drawbacks to current online courses, including differences between success rates of general education courses and their face-to-face counterparts. Current research indicates the difference in success rates can be attributed to interpersonal communication barriers, collaborative learning issues, and the lack of online support systems. With online science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) courses, the difference in success rates can be as high as 14%—compared to only 5% for general education courses. Multiple studies have examined why STEM courses fare so much worse than general education courses online. Research has yet to identify any student characteristic that can explain the difference. In this dissertation, I argue the primary issue relates to interpersonal communication. Interpersonal communication is vital in developing a successful online course. STEM courses introduce an interpersonal communication barrier between faculty and students because they often involve special symbols, characters, and a problem solving process that cannot easily be typed. The inability of students to handwrite a note or sketch the process used to solve a problem creates a transactional distance in communication, which can lead to delays, misunderstandings, and frustration for students and faculty within the course. In this study, I introduced the ability to handwrite directly in assessments through the addition of a sketchpad and a show-your-work box on every question in homework, quizzes, and exams. The difference between intervention and control students’ exams was ≈4%. Pell Grant-eligible students performed ≈6% better on exams, improving more than the average intervention student. The largest improvement was seen among students who had no previous grade point average (GPA), meaning they were first-time college students. These students in the intervention group scored an average of 10% higher on exams when compared to similar students in control courses—the largest difference found in this study. The ≈4% difference in intervention and control groups did not vary by race, gender, or first-generational status. Students with high previous GPA’s saw little to no difference in exam scores; their exam scores were above average in both intervention and control courses. There was little difference in female students in the intervention and control courses. Female students scored, on average, higher than their male counterparts in both conditions. However, male students in the intervention courses showed significantly higher scores than male students in the control courses, thus closing the gap between female and male achievement. Students who were not Pell Grant-eligible showed less than the average 4% difference between conditions. 
Beyond higher exam scores, students in the intervention classes had 4% lower withdrawal rates when compared with students in the control classes. Students indicated improved interpersonal communication and instructor feedback positively influenced their experience. When combined, higher exam scores and lower withdrawal rates led to a 7% improvement in overall success rates in the intervention courses. This finding, when compared with students in the control classes, translates into seven more students across three intervention classes succeeding and moving on to the next math course. Findings reinforce the importance of interpersonal communication for student success in online courses. Students with no previous GPA and Pell Grant-eligible students can benefit from targeted extra efforts in communication that help improve the probability of successful course completion.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation investigates the complexities of improvisatory practices in Balinese kendang (drumming), focusing on solo and paired drumming styles found within the gong kebyar ensemble. Improvisation studies scholar Paul Berliner states that “improvisation depends, in fact, on thinkers having absorbed a broad base of musical knowledge, including myriad conventions that contribute to formulating ideas logically, cogently, and expressively” (1994, 492). Drawing from Berliner’s statement, I demonstrate how Balinese drummers think and talk about improvisation and how those cognitive and discursive processes manifest in actual performance practice. In particular, I focus on the improvisatory approaches, practices, and philosophy of the renowned gong kebyar drummer I Ketut Sukarata in three different contexts: paired drumming, solo drumming, and drumming for dance accompaniment. Although several authoritative works have been written on drumming in Balinese music (e.g., Asnawa 1991; Bakan 1999; Tenzer 2000a; Hood 2001; Sudirana 2009; Tilley 2019; Pryatna 2020), most of the ethnomusicological literature to date has given little if any significant attention to the improvisational dimensions of drumming. This has resulted in a lacuna of research on improvisation in Balinese music and drumming, to the point that improvisation has come to be regarded as a relatively minor component of drumming practice, at least until very recently. However, my research and more than twenty years of performing and experiencing Balinese drumming, including seventeen years of intensive studies with Sukarata, shows that improvisation is indeed a fundamental and essential component of the art form. My research, which combines the methods of music ethnography and music-theoretical approaches, as influenced most specifically by the work of other researchers engaged with the interdisciplinary field of music scholarship known as analytical approaches to world music (e.g., Tenzer 2006a; Tenzer and John Roeder 2011; Roeder and Tenzer 2012; McGraw 2008; 2013; McGraw and Kohnen 2016), fundamentally reconstitutes analytical methods to the study of improvisation in Balinese drumming and, by extension, in Balinese gamelan music more broadly.

            <DISS_para>A wide adoption of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) is anticipated in the near future given their demonstrated benefits of the in terms of safety, mobility, and environmental sustainability. Such prediction highlights a need to prepare the roadway infrastructure to facilitate safer and more reliable operation of these technologies. While acknowledging this notion, many state and local planning agencies have developed multiyear infrastructure programs for successful deployment of CAVs in a timely manner within their limited budgets. Meanwhile, the traffic environment does not remain static but will evolve over time as CAV technologies become available (i.e., toward the mixed environment of autonomous and human-driven vehicles), which requires infrastructure plans specific to different planning terms (i.e., short-, middle-, and long-term) to accommodate changing infrastructure needs. To develop an effective long-range plan, planning agencies need to understand changing infrastructure needs over time, identify alternative infrastructure options for different planning terms, and develop an optimal portfolio of CAV infrastructure projects, based on the varying infrastructure needs of the traffic environment. This study develops an analytical framework to guide a holistic approach to multiyear infrastructure planning for CAVs. To be more specific, the proposed framework uses a five-step approach. First, the framework uses a systematic literature review to identify a group of infrastructure options to support CAV system functions (e.g., merging and platooning). The next step is to prioritize roadway locations in need of infrastructure improvement based on the potential contribution of CAVs to their local traffic through a geographical information system analysis. To predict future infrastructure needs, the framework develops a generalized Bass diffusion model to forecast CAV adoption rates for short-, medium-, and long-term planning phases. Fourth, a traffic micro-simulation model is employed to evaluate the performance of the future mixed traffic environment under various infrastructure planning scenarios. Lastly, a genetic algorithm-based metaheuristic optimization model is proposed to guide effective selection of an optimal infrastructure plan that improves traffic performance in the entire network while minimizing the cost of implementation of infrastructure options for each planning term. As a proof concept, this study demonstrates the application of the proposed multiyear infrastructure planning framework for CAVs with a case study of selected freeway segments on Interstate-4 in Florida state. Results of the analysis indicate that the proposed method can identify optimal infrastructure plans comprising of optimal set of infrastructure improvements that can minimize travel time while satisfying budgetary constraints. It is also observed that the proposed framework consistently allocates more than 50% of the budget to the long-term planning phase while it seeks to evenly distribute the remaining budget between the medium-term and short-term planning phases. This analytical framework can therefore serve as a useful tool to decision makers to guide an effective multiyear CAV infrastructure plan for their transportation system. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>ABSTRACTPublic speaking is considered a valuable and necessary skill in professional, academic, and social contexts. However, research shows that public speaking anxiety is the top social fear for most people. Whereas public speaking anxiety exists among physical, cognitive, and behavioral dimensions, psychological approaches to intervention typically target cognitions. Negative self-talk is a component of cognitive anxiety, and interventions to improve self-talk have been widely implemented in clinical and sports psychology disciplines. This study examined the effects of a novel online self-talk intervention on public speaking anxiety reduction and speech performance ratings. The study also explored participants’ perceptions of the intervention on reducing speech anxiety, improving speech performance, improving speech self-talk, and increasing speech self-efficacy of students in the college public speaking classroom context. This quasi-experimental research study utilized a convenience sample of 149 students enrolled in the public speaking basic course at a small, rural, state college in the southeastern United States region. The study included experimental and control groups. Data were analyzed primarily using quantitative methods with a smaller qualitative component. Results showed no significant differences between experimental and control groups in speech anxiety reduction, as assessed by the Personal Report of Public Speaking Anxiety (PRPSA) (McCroskey, 1970) and the Speech Anxiety Thoughts Inventory (SATI) (Cho et al., 2004) when comparisons were made from the beginning of the semester until the end. Speech anxiety in both the experimental group, which received skills training and the online self-talk intervention, and the control group, which received skills training alone, decreased from pre-test to post-test. Hierarchical multi-regression analyses revealed no significant predictor variables in terms of groups (experimental or control), gender, ethnicity, or college classification; however, PRPSA and SATI pre-test scores were found to be significant predictors of speech anxiety reduction. Results suggested that the majority of participants in the experimental group perceived the intervention as at least somewhat beneficial in reducing their speech anxiety, improving their speech performance, improving their speech self-talk, and increasing their speech self-efficacy. The participants indicated that the intervention was particularly beneficial in improving their speech self-talk and increasing their speech self-efficacy. Future research should focus on extending investigations on self-talk interventions on cognitive speech related variables, as the results here have implications for benefits not only to students, but for society at large.

            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study is to examine how name, image, and likeness (NIL) representations of female college athletes in social media endorsements may impact users’ attitudes and behavioral intentions with regard to female athlete’s personal brands, female athletics, and product brands. This study focused specifically on Florida State University (FSU), which boasts numerous highly successful female sports programs. Through the use of a survey, this study examined participants’ attitudes and intended behaviors after viewing two social media endorsements. The results of this study found that participants with greater fanship toward FSU sports and toward female sports in general reported more favorable attitudes towards the advertisements. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Using the Antarctic expeditions of Richard E. Byrd as a frame of reference, this dissertation places Antarctica in a more central role in our understanding of the United States in the mid-twentieth century. Scholarship on American imperialism frequently neglects the nation’s relationship with Antarctica, since the US never formally claimed territory on the continent, but Byrd’s efforts to establish an American territory or settler colony in the region challenge these assumptions. From his headquarters at the pseudo-frontier town of Little America, and back in the US, Byrd created an American alternative to the European polar explorers of the “Heroic Age” whom he admired, rooted in Southern concepts of honor and masculinity. While Antarctica lacked indigenous human populations, it did not prove a tabula rasa on which Byrd could easily replicate American colonization scrubbed of its less-pleasant elements, and a study of the exploration writing produced by Byrd and his contemporaries reveals the unique ways in which US Antarctic history is written. Often credited as an early promoter of the internationalist system codified by the 1959 Antarctic Treaty System, close analysis of Byrd and his influences complicates that understanding.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Research about how gender affects speech has until recently strictly involved cisgender men and cisgender women (Kiesling, 2019; Newman et al., 2008; Rosanti &amp; Jaelani, 2015). Because of this, the speech of transgender men and women has gone largely unexplored (Kiesling, 2019, p. 53). This study focuses on mitigating phrases, which are “a means of conveying vagueness purposely” (Rosanti &amp; Jaelani, 2015, p. 31); some examples in English are in my opinion and sort of. Previous studies have shown that cisgender women use mitigating phrases more than cisgender men (Lakoff, 1973; Priesler, 1986) and that socialization is a key factor in the development of speech patterns (Ochs, 1991; Zimman, 2018). This leads to the question of how transgender men’s speech patterns develop. In this research, a cisgender man will be defined as someone who was assigned male at birth and continues to identify as a man, and a transgender man is someone who was assigned female at birth but transitioned to identifying as a man socially or medically. I posit that transgender men who transition before the age of 13 will have patterns more similar to those of cisgender men due to socialization as men, and those who transition after the age of 13 will have patterns more similar to those of cisgender women due to socialization as a woman. This study measured the use of mitigating phrases in the Spanish speech of transgender men who transitioned before the age of 13 and after the age of 13 during a sociolinguistic interview. The interview elicited the use of mitigating phrases through questions that ask the participant about their life and experiences as a transgender person, which can be responded to in the form of an opinion (using mitigating phrases), or as a fact (without the use of mitigating phrases). Each mitigating phrase was categorized by internal and external factors, including type of mitigating phrase, if it is epistemic or affective, and age of transition of the speaker. The results revealed that although cisgender men used the most mitigating phrases on average, followed by transitioned before puberty and finally transitioned after puberty, individuals had no clear pattern. There was also not a gender preference for any type of mitigating phrase, rather a general preference for certain structures. Because of this, it is likely that gender is not the central factor in use of mitigating phrases, but rather environment. It is also possible that gender preference for this structure is a phenomenon within American English and does not extend to Spanish speaking communities. This research builds on queer linguistics theories in order to affirm the identities of trans people and finally include them in the body of research of gender and speech. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Over the past few decades, media and technology use have become increasingly significant components of everyday life. Given media’s ubiquitous usage across the lifespan, it is important to understand what puts individuals at risk for engaging in problematic media use. Thus, the current study aimed to explore youth affective-behavioral vulnerability and peer processes as predictors of excessive and problematic media use in young adulthood. Specifically, anxious solitude and peer exclusion trajectory classes in elementary school (3rd to 5th grade) were explored as predictors of young adult media behaviors. Further, membership in anxious solitude and peer exclusion trajectory classes in middle school (6th to 7th grade) were tested as explanatory processes (mediators) in the link between elementary school trajectory class membership and young adult media use. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>For the trajectory class analysis, participants were 688 youths who had taken part in the Multiple Trajectories in Anxious Solitary Youth study (female n = 354; 51.5%). Latent class growth analysis (LCGA) was used to identify trajectories of peer-reported peer exclusion in childhood (trajectories of peer-reported anxious solitude with this data have been identified in the extant literature; Gazelle &amp; Faldowski, 2019). Separate analyses were conducted for elementary and middle school to allow for different trajectory patterns to emerge after the middle school transition. Three peer exclusion trajectory classes were identified in elementary school (low-stable, moderate-stable, and high-increasing) and two in middle school (low-stable and high-increasing) with latent class growth analyses (LCGA). In Gazelle and Faldowski’s (2019) study, two anxious solitude trajectory classes were identified in elementary school (moderate-decreasing and high-increasing) and three in middle school (low-stable, low-increasing, and high-decreasing). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>For the main analysis, participants were 118 young adults (female n = 76; 64%; M age at survey completion = 22.8 years, SD = 0.84) who had been prospectively assessed from 3rd to 7th grade in the Multiple Trajectories in Anxious Solitary Youth study. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to investigate the influence of anxious solitude and peer exclusion trajectory class membership (in elementary school) on excessive and problematic media use in young adulthood. Further, middle school trajectory classes (both anxious solitude and peer exclusion) were tested as mediators of this link. In partial support of the direct effect hypotheses, membership in the elementary school high-increasing anxious solitude trajectory class and high-increasing peer exclusion trajectory class predicted more hours per day spent playing video games in young adulthood. Additionally, elementary school moderate-stable peer exclusion trajectory class membership predicted more time spent using social media and the internet for entertainment in young adulthood. Finally, although the mediation hypothesis was not supported, mediation analyses revealed that middle school low-increasing anxious solitude trajectory class membership fully mediated the link between elementary school high-increasing anxious solitude trajectory class membership and more time playing video games in young adulthood. Further, middle school high-increasing peer exclusion trajectory class membership partially mediated the link between elementary school high-increasing peer exclusion trajectory class and less time using social media in young adulthood.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study suggests that young adults with a history of anxious solitude or peer exclusion in elementary school may be especially vulnerable to excessive media use as young adults. Further, this study highlights how continuity and different developmental pathways of anxious solitude and peer exclusion may explain why some anxious solitary and excluded youths spend more (or less) time using media than their anxious solitary and excluded counterparts. Limitations, future research directions, and implications of the study are discussed. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Big-data applications typically involve huge numbers of observations and features, thus posing new challenges for variable selection and parameter estimation. In addition to being efficient, the desired algorithm is better to have implementation ease. An ad-hoc procedure may be fragile, and an algorithm design on the basis of optimization, rather than heuristics, is preferred. Meanwhile, methods such as LASSO or screening algorithms are derived assuming mildly correlated features. These assumptions make it possible to eliminate features in an aggressive manner, but may be too stringent to hold for real-life high dimensional applications.The paper proposes a novel “slow kill” (SK) technique on the basis of nonconvex constrained optimization, which gradually identifies and removes irrelevant variables with adaptive ℓ2-shrinkage and growing learning rate. That the problem size can drop during the iterations of SK makes it particularly suitable for large-scale variable selection. The interplay between statistics and optimization leads to insightful results on quantile control, stepsize and shrinkage parameters to relax the regularity conditions under which the desire order of statistical accuracy is guaranteed. The theoretical study justifies the optimal error rate and fast convergence of SK, without assuming asymptotic conditions or globally optimal solutions. The technique applies to a general loss that is not necessarily a likelihood function. In addition, no grid search is required to find a solution with a prescribed cardinality, which exempts the unnecessary expensive computational cost when tuning the regularization parameters.
Experiments on synthetic data show that SK outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in various situations while being extremely computationally scalable. Moreover, the performances on various real data examples including spam websites identification, digit recognition and gene expression further demonstrated the power of the proposed method.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>A new methodology has been introduced to detect flash droughts. This method is based off a new variable created called the drought index. This index is calculated using the cumulative daily anomalies of soil moisture, precipitation, and surface temperature. The viability of this methodology is tested using confirmed flash drought case studies from previous studies. The advantage of the drought index is that it allows for the identification of the flash drought period in a more objective manner than earlier studies. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>While relatively uncommon, it is possible for flash droughts to develop in the environment created post-landfall of an Atlantic Tropical Cyclone (TC). The new flash drought detection method created was then used to detect flash droughts in the wake of landfalling Atlantic TCs. Of the thirty landfalling Atlantic TCs examined between 2000 and 2018, only four cases resulted in the development of a flash drought. Despite TCs causing an increase in soil moisture, the decrease in precipitation and increase in surface temperature post-landfall in these four cases resulted in the development of a flash drought. When these flash droughts did occur, it was in conjunction with an already existing large-scale drought in the vicinity of the landfall. This suggests that the flash droughts extended the reach of the large-scale droughts to the landfall region of the TC. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Meta-analysis has been a popular statistical tool to combine scientific findings from multiple studies addressing the same topic. Publication bias and heterogeneity are two critical issues that may influence the validity of the synthesized results. This dissertation focuses on statistical methods and applications for assessing these two issues in meta-analyses of medical research, including empirically evaluating the trim-and-fill method, summarizing various Egger-type regressions, proposing a Bayesian model to assess publication bias, and extending the Bayesian framework to quantify between-study heterogeneity.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Firstly, we implement the widely-used trim-and-fill method, which can both detect and adjust publication bias, to a large database of meta-analyses in the Cochrane Library and investigate its overall empirical performance. The findings offer practical guidelines and recommendations for the proper application of the method. Secondly, we examine the most popular method, Egger’s regression test, to assess publication bias. As the error term in the original regression test was not specified, several variants of this regression are summarized and compared; their performance is investigated based on 51 high-quality meta-analyses collected from the BMJ. Thirdly, although Egger’s regression is simple and easy to implement, it shows inflated false positive rates for meta-analyses with binary outcomes. Therefore, we further propose a new approach to assessing publication bias via Bayesian hierarchical models to reduce the inflation of false positive rates for meta-analyses of odds ratios. The proposed method is evaluated by conducting simulations, real-world analysis, and sensitivity analysis. Lastly, the assessment of heterogeneity in the meta-analysis may be underestimated due to sampling errors. We extend the Bayesian framework to quantify heterogeneity in meta-analyses of odds ratios, which aims to account for the non-ignorable sampling errors. The Bayesian approach produces more acceptable results compared to the frequentist method in specific settings, especially for those meta-analyses of small studies with relatively rare event rates.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>While we imagine modern France as a nation with a vibrant and powerful public sector, many of its most essential tasks in resource and infrastructure management, as well as services such as water, gas and electric utilities are largely provided by private entities today.  This should not surprise us if we take a much longer view of French history as the early modern France state was firmly grounded in privatizing all kinds of public infrastructure and resources.  The French revolutionaries set themselves the task of abolishing the principles that undergirded the Old Regime, including privatization, and imagined a new ideal of public control of France’s infrastructure, taxes, and other kinds of public powers like justice.  But this process was halted by the fiscal realities of the fledgling French republic.  Instead of persevering with public administration of the nation’s greatest assets, the revolutionaries slowly reinstituted privatization as the dominant mode of administering France’s public services and properties.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>By challenging more typical narratives of the French Revolution as a break with the Old Regime past, this dissertation argues that it was more of a realignment and reimagining of Old Regime legal and financial tools for revolutionary purposes.  It further argues that the familiar modern dichotomy between, privatization and public control, is a product of the French Revolution.  The debates in revolutionary France over infrastructure and taxes crystallized new ways of thinking about the role of the modern state and its responsibilities to the public, the limits of that state, and framed powerful arguments about the desirability of privatization over public control.  Arguments that continue to dominate contemporary global debates over privatization and the ever-expanding control of public property by international corporations.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>	The purpose of this review was to examine and integrate the current available information on Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS) and gait performance of individuals with neurological disorders, to support music therapists’ clinical decision-making, and to identify the areas in which more research is needed. The subjects in this review (N = 37) were articles about the effects of RAS on neurological disorders that were gathered across three levels of searches according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Searches were conducted on FSU OneSearch, on Journal of Music Therapy and Music Therapy Perspectives, and on the list of research under RAS on the Academy of Neurologic Music Therapy website. Overall, RAS appeared to be an effective form of treatment for individuals with multiple neurological disorders. RAS led to statistically significant improvements in gait performance in treatment when compared with other forms of treatment. Certain aspects of gait performance, including balance and the temporospatial parameters of cadence, velocity, stride length, and gait speed were the most often assessed characteristics of gait. Clinical reasons for recommendation of treatment including RAS for neurological disorders were generally broad and exploratory. Though results of the review were positive, there was also a lack of research found on RAS with all neurological disorders and on the way in which RAS affects the many characteristics of gait. More research is needed to better understand the potential benefits of RAS and to determine how to give more specific clinical recommendations for individuals in the future. Further details will be discussed in this thesis.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>ABSTRACTPurpose. This study focused on factors that contributed to writing quality in adults who were pursuing a General Educational Development (GED) diploma through an adult basic education program and university students who were pursuing a college degree. We explored the role of transcription (handwriting and spelling), working memory, oral language, and discourse knowledge in the writing process and the extent to which each component contributed to the writing quality of adults.
Method. This descriptive study examined the relationship between cognitive skills and writing quality among students enrolled in an Adult Basic Education (ABE) program compared to undergraduate university students in the Southeastern United States. A hierarchical regression analysis was used to explore cognitive predictors of writing quality in these students. Participating students (N=49) provided two writing samples (i.e. narrative and expository) from the Test of Written Language and the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test-III. Each passage was scored using holistic quality rating scales from the standardized tests.  Students were also assessed using standardized measures of oral language, working memory, transcription, and an experimental measure of discourse knowledge.
Results. Results indicated that a significant amount of variance was explained by the cognitive and mechanics predictors included in our model. Furthermore, measures of phonological awareness, spelling, and handwriting accounted for unique variance in writing quality in both students in the ABE program and undergraduate students.
Conclusions. Results from this study suggested that there were important cognitive and mechanical skills related to writing quality in adults. These results were consistent with other studies of predictors in children and predictors of other literacy outcomes in students in ABE programs.

            <DISS_para>Ancient Roman bath complexes, both public and private, have been the source of curiosity for centuries. Scholars have studied the architectural forms of baths around the Mediterranean, although focus in Italy has been primarily reserved for baths located in Rome, Pompeii, and Herculaneum. Large and better-preserved baths at these sites have drawn the attention of the researcher, but hundreds of baths dot the landscape of Central Italy. This dissertation concentrates on traditionally glossed-over baths within the broader context of private and public bathing customs in Central Italy, creating a new, more thorough analysis of bath building practices in five chosen regions. Through this examination, this study proposes construction and design processes necessary to build, renovate, and maintain baths, as well as the interconnected nature of bath design. Moreover, this study adds to our knowledge of the people who were involved in the construction of these hygienic facilities – their roles and engagement in the building process.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Our understanding of men and women involved in Roman construction projects, particularly baths, is limited, although not lost entirely. Using literary, archaeological, and epigraphic evidence of general construction in Central Italy, I present a chaîne opératoire for the bath building industry in the surveyed regions. As a case study, I dissect the processes of constructing the small bathhouse at Cosa (Tuscany), incorporating the proposed chaîne opératoire into this analysis. Such studies have been performed for larger baths on the peninsula, and the case study of Cosa’s bath, which is part of the larger survey of baths in the surrounding regions, complements the current understanding of building processes through the lens of a smaller project.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The second half of this dissertation involves a diachronic analysis of bath building in Central Italy. To perform such an analysis, I have compiled a catalogue of the archaeological remains of nearly 250 baths. This catalogue is not exhaustive, but the foundation of a regional study of bath construction and bathing habits that augments the burgeoning field of cross-cultural bath studies. Individual bathing rooms and the overall designs of these baths, when the archaeology permits such a scrutiny, are surveyed, compared, and classified. From this examination, typologies emerge, although these categories of baths are not as rigid as those proposed in past scholarship. From these typologies, theories concerning initial steps of architectural design come to light. Channels of diffusion of bath building knowledge are also presented, which highlight evolutionary progressions evidenced in the archaeological record. With these illuminated interconnections between designs and room types, interconnections between the people integral to bath building in these regions of Italy emerge.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Despite the fact that high-quality preschool education is empirically acknowledged to facilitate short- and long-term personal, social, cognitive, and economic benefits, the professionals who teach preschool experience overwhelmingly poor working conditions that have historically been present as the role of childcare worker persisted throughout time. A contributor to these poor working conditions has been the gendering of the workforce—a reality that has often been justified with the perspective that women ‘naturally’ have caring instincts. However, those claims have been consistently contradicted and revealed that this feminization was historically centered on the commodification of breast milk—a concern that has since been mitigated by technological advancements.	To address this issue in the field, this dissertation begins to provide contextualized descriptions of preschool teaching that are informed by the lived experiences of preschool teachers working in a high-quality preschool. Findings revealed that the work environment of the Lead Teachers is the immediate context that children are developing in and that in that context their role is to facilitate and engage the children in informed, intentional, and appropriate reciprocal interactions. This runs counter to the notion that high-quality preschool teaching and caregiving requires essentialized feminine qualities, instead highlighting how central social-emotional development is to early childhood education and care as well as how definitions and perceptions of quality need to be holistic and specific to the community context being served.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Due to climate change driven sea surface temperature (SST) increase, tropical and sub-tropical corals have been experiencing temperature stress. This stress has manifested itself in multiple ways, one of which being the ‘tropicalization’ hypothesis. This is the idea that corals experiencing consistently high SST can expand their ranges into new environments where their temperature thresholds are met. This study attempts to explain how corals and their symbionts in the Florida Keys might adapt to the pressures of northward expansion. To do this, the photophysiological characteristics of the symbiont community harbored by the corals was assessed. Corals from the Florida Keys, Clearwater, and St. Marks were analyzed to determine the capabilities of symbiont photosystems in each region. Additionally, sub-tropical environments experience more pronounced seasonal temperature variation. Because corals are very susceptible to heat and cold, photophysiological analyses in summer and winter were performed. The photophysiological analysis provided context on how coral symbionts adapt to sub-tropical pressures and how capable Florida Keys’ corals would be to northward expansion.	This study found that corals in the Florida Keys had 41% more relative electron transport, 40% more light saturation capacity, and double the light dissipation potential than St. Marks. Corals in St. Marks and Clearwater showed photophysiological metrics generally indicating acclimation to lower light intensities. Surprisingly, St. Marks had a higher average light saturation threshold (Ek), maximum non-photochemical quenching (NPQmax), maximum relative electron transport rate rETRmax, and NPQ at Ek compared to Clearwater, although only NPQ[Ek] was statistically significant. This discrepancy supports a new hypothesis that there might be an environmental aspect to Clearwater that is affecting photophysiology. Seasonally there was little variation within all sites. During the summer light capture efficiency (α) was lower than winter, indicating light adaptation to elevated irradiance.
	With the poleward movement of tropical species, it is important to ascertain the coping strategies necessary to allow tropical corals to maintain holobiont metabolism under different environmental regimes.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Impostor Phenomenon (IP) is a psychological construct that causes high-achieving individuals to doubt their competence, intelligence, and sense of belonging. IP has only recently been examined among people in the music education community. The purpose of the current study was to examine the prevalence of IP among music student teachers. Through a mixed methods (sequential-explanatory) design, I surveyed music student teachers (N = 173) from across the U.S. to determine the extent to which they experienced IP. I then conducted a follow-up focus group with six participants to gain an in-depth understanding of their personal IP experiences as student teachers. Results indicated that IP is prevalent among music student teachers, with the majority experiencing it frequently or intensely. Findings from the focus group discussion confirmed many of the results from the survey portion and provided context for IP among music student teachers. Implications for music teacher education are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>There is a large body of research on the numerical abilities underlying math achievement, but less is known about mathematical reasoning and its relationship to other math abilities. The present study is the first step of a project with the following goals: 1) Developing a measure of mathematical reasoning, and 2) Assessing the relations between mathematical reasoning and other aspects of math ability. In this study, 74 undergraduates completed a novel Geometry and Number Theory Proof Construction Task designed to measure mathematical reasoning, followed by an algebraic equation solving task and a survey about previous math experience. Cronbach’s (1951) alpha was calculated to assess the internal consistency of the measure, and item-level statistics were used to identify some of its weaknesses. Confirmatory Factor Analysis was used to compare the fits of a one factor model and a two-factor model to these data. A hierarchical regression analysis and the first step of a mediation analysis were conducted to evaluate the relations between mathematical reasoning, algebra, and formal math experience. Some evidence was found that the Proof Completion Task measured a single latent Mathematical Reasoning construct. Results provided evidence that Geometry Proof Completion accounts for variance in Algebraic Equation Solving not already explained by Formal Math Experience, suggesting that the type of reasoning used to complete geometry proofs may also generalize to other areas of mathematics.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>One important area in materials science and engineering is the relationship between spatial and temporal scales and its influence on constitutive properties.  Fractal functions can be useful in studying materials where self-similarity across scales, often seen in nature, also influence  engineered  materials.   Examples  of  fractals  commonly  found  in  nature  include clouds, snowflakes, broccoli, arteries, and coastlines.  All these objects exhibit self-similar structures  over  a  finite  scale  range.   Fractals  have  been  found  to  better  describe  many natural phenomena relative to more conventional Euclidean geometry.  Further, it is also known that fractional derivatives are better equipped to quantify dynamics and mechanics of  fractal  structures.   The  use  of  fractal  functions  along  with  the  application  of  fractal or fractional operators can be useful when modeling complex phenomena such as viscoelasticity.  Incorporating fractional order calculus into models of fractal materials can more accurately describe the complex phenomena of these materials and allow for the advancement of applications in various fields of study.  We will demonstrate how these relations apply to dielectric elastomers (VHB 4949 and VHB 4905) and auxetic (negative Poisson ratio) foams.  We find that the fractional order of viscoelasticity is important in obtaining accurate prediction of rate dependent deformation in uncalibrated regimes.  We will demonstrate its effectiveness by comparing the models to experimental data and quantifying parameter uncertainty using Bayesian methods.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to conduct a content analysis of nine research articles related to the needs of African American parents/caregivers of preterm infants in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). The primary topics explored in this study were (a) parental needs, (b) African American stressors and premature risk factors, (c) racial disparities in medical care, and (d) cultural demographics. Additional topics investigated were what parents/caregivers of preterm infants need and want from medical professionals as well as high prematurity rates in African American women. A content analysis was done for research from 2012-2022 across 5 scholarly U.S.-based research journals. Results showed few articles that deal with culturally specific information about family-based care in the NICU. Included articles summarized that parental needs in the NICU consist of improved communication, addressing external stressors, parent education and support, and cultural sensitivity. More research is needed in order to fully understand the needs of African American parents in the neonatal intensive care unit.  </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Advancements in digital audio recording technology have allowed many people to engage in music creation for personal recreation. A longstanding trend in music production has been to 
incorporate audio effects into the creation process. Many researchers, including music therapists, 
have begun to explore the potential benefits of using music with audio effects applied. A scoping 
review was conducted to synthesize the research that has been conducted in this area. A total of 
54 articles were identified through the established search protocols of this research. Among 
them, a multitude of audio effects were used to achieve frequently significant results within the 
treatment of hearing disorders, developmental disorders, and many other kinds of applications. 
Effects also provide an additional dimension of musical expression that is largely accessible to 
persons with physical or cognitive limitations.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In response to the rising public interest in understanding intercultural couples’ relational experiences, particularly how couples respond to their differences in culture, I propose a new construct—relational cultural intelligence (RCI)—to describe an individual’s ability to learn and apply cultural knowledge about oneself and their partner in a relationship. In this dissertation, I define the construct of RCI and describe the development of a preliminary RCI scale. I conceptualize RCI as a type of social intelligence, and it entails three essential intellectual dimensions—awareness, skills, and knowledge. I surveyed 186 individuals who self-identified in a current intercultural romantic relationship. The findings of this study provided evidence for the validity and reliability of a three-factor scale with a total of 12 items. Findings also showed that RCI was related to important aspects of relational experiences such as relational stress, dyadic coping, commitment, and relationship satisfaction. Possible implications and future directions of RCI are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the commonest of adult epilepsies, often refractory to antiepileptic medications, whose prevention and treatment rely on understanding basic pathophysiological mechanisms in interlinked structures of the temporal lobe. The medial entorhinal area (MEA) is affected in TLE but mechanisms underlying hyperexcitability of MEA neurons require further elucidation. Previous studies have examined the role of the presubiculum (PrS) in mediating MEA pathophysiology but not the juxtaposed parasubiculum (Par). In this thesis, I report on an electrophysiological assessment of the cells and circuits of the Par, their excitability under normal and epileptic conditions, and alterations in functional connectivity with neighboring PrS and MEA using the rat pilocarpine model of TLE. I show that Par, unlike the cell heterogeneous PrS, has a single dominant neuronal population whose excitability under epileptic conditions is altered by changes in both intrinsic properties and synaptic drive. These neurons experience significant reductions in synaptic inhibition and perish under chronic epileptic conditions. Connectivity between brain regions was deduced through changes in excitatory and inhibitory synaptic drive to neurons recorded in one region upon focal application of glutamate followed by NBQX to neurons in another using a microfluidic technique called CESOP and TLE-related circuit reorganization was assessed using data from normal and epileptic animals. The region-specific changes in Par and neighboring PrS and MEA together with their unexpected interactions are of significance in identifying ictogenic cells and circuits within the parahippocampal region and in unraveling pathophysiological mechanisms underlying TLE.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this treatise is to introduce and discuss the development of cycles of twenty-four preludes by seven Russian composers. Shostakovich’s prelude cycle receives a thorough analysis, which provides clear evidence for the advancement of the prelude genre in Russia.The treatise opens with the historical development of the prelude since the fifteenth century, through the Baroque, and Classical periods, followed by its expansion during the Romantic and Impressionist periods. The discussion concentrates on the evolution of the prelude from its original capacity as an introduction into an independent genre. The treatise explores Western influences on Russian music, particularly the spread of Romanticism since Chopin, in conjunction with historical, political, and cultural background information. This explanation culminates with the birth of the Russian piano school and the significance of the prelude genre to Russian composers.
The social and historical context of the piano prelude cycle’s development in Russia is established by briefly reviewing six cycles in chronological order, from Felix Blumenfeld’s 24 Preludes, Op. 17 in 1892 to Lera Auerbach’s 24 Preludes, Op. 41 in 1998. The other sets discussed are by Scriabin, Rachmaninoff, Kabalevsky, and Kapustin. By juxtaposing the major musical characteristics of each set, the evolution of the prelude in a Russian context is evinced. 
The treatise also provides a theoretical analysis of Shostakovich’s 24 Preludes, Op. 34, composed in 1932-1933. The analysis focuses on the technical aspects of form, modality, tonality, harmony, melody, motive, meter and rhythm, style, compositional technique, register, and texture, as well as the social aspects of Shostakovich's life within a national and personal context. The nexus of these two points of analysis is an examination of Russian ethnic elements within the set of twenty-four preludes, including the influence of Russian folk songs.
This treatise confirms that the traditional aspects of preludes are still present in the modern day. Additionally, the similarity of musical styles and characteristics among these Russian composers seems to stem from the fact that they were either inspired by the same person or composed their music contemporarily. After the Russian Revolution and the subsequent political changes, their compositional traits are varied and more diverse.

            <DISS_para>This thesis investigates the surface pressure distribution on a 15-story mid-rise building model. The experiment was performed on a building with/without balconies; the data on the building without balconies being the reference pressure distribution for understanding the balconies effect on the surface pressure distribution. The experiment was simulated in an urban area setting (exposure B terrain) where the ABL height was estimated to be 0.73-m. The testing angles considered for the experiments were 0o, 45o, and 90o for a total of three angles. A scaling factor of 1/500 was considered for the testing to limit the blockage ratio to 3.23%. 15 pressure taps were predefined on the building specimen to observe the surface distribution. Of those 15 pressure taps, 3 were located on the roof, 4 on a side wall, and 8 on the front walls or 0o windward flow. The footprint section of the building specimen was (120X60) mm2 with a height of 100 mm. The wind tunnel test was performed using a Scannivalve Corp. ZOC 22B/32Px pressure scanner and a pressure sensitive paint from ISSI. The pressure sensitive paint (PSP) provides a 5% accuracy compared to the pressure scanner and is used as validation of the pressure scanner wind tunnel testing. For this experiment, a Binary UniCoat and Single UniCoat paint were used to estimate the wind pressure distribution. The experiment was conducted in the AME (Aero-propulsion, Mechanics, and Energy) wind tunnel of the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering which has a cross sectional dimension of (30 X 30) in2 and a testing section of 5-ft. The approach used to estimate the atmospheric boundary layer dimension and characteristics was made using the Irwin approach. The findings of the experiment concludes that the balconies influenced the surface pressure distribution on the building.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation examines José Campeche (1751-1809), a prolific artist of African descent who was born and lived his entire life in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Campeche created hundreds of works over the course of his career, as he participated in drafting projects administered by the Spanish colonial government, designed and constructed catafalques for state funeral ceremonies, created religious paintings of saints and Marian imagery for churches and for private devotion, painted the official royal portraits for coronation ceremonies, and executed portraits for the highest-ranking members of San Juan society, including governors, their wives, military officers, bishops, and members of the criollo elite. Campeche’s illustrious career coincided with an era of cultural transformation in Puerto Rico, when large-scale architectural projects commenced in San Juan to augment the city’s defenses and to renovate and reorganize urban spaces in the aftermath of the Seven Years War, and the population of the island increased exponentially through the end of the eighteenth and into the nineteenth centuries. Though Campeche lived and worked during a time of great social, political, and religious change in Puerto Rico and the Spanish Empire, the impact of these transformations and Campeche’s role as a social and artistic agent within them has yet to be extensively addressed in relation to his body of work. Most studies that exist on Campeche pursue questions about the artist’s biography and training, and attempt to classify his works, establish dates and provenance, and investigate source material with little examination of the artist’s lived condition as a colonial subject and its impact on his artistic production. This dissertation seeks to ameliorate the issues evident in the present state of the literature on Campeche and offers a different perspective on the artist’s life, career, and artistic production. It endeavors to examine the intersections between the creation and use of Campeche’s work, events and conditions specific to Puerto Rico during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, and the numerous changes taking place concurrently across the Spanish Empire under the Bourbon regime. This project considers Campeche as a complex historical subject of African descent embedded in a colonial system whose lived experiences and artistic production were shaped by and responded to both local and imperial forces and were further informed by the circulation of ideas, people, and things throughout the Caribbean and greater Atlantic World. As such, it argues that Campeche’s work provides an important lens into the ways in which he negotiated the opportunities, social realities, and contradictions of his specific late Spanish colonial milieu and served as a simultaneous product and agent of cultural transformation in Puerto Rico.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>An important objective in radiofrequency (RF) coil design for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is improving sensitivity. The low RF losses of thin-film high temperature superconducting (HTS) coils make them well suited to provide superior sensitivity in a variety of NMR experiments when compared to conventional coils. However, HTS resonators have yet to be widely implemented in commercial NMR probes and are only utilized when high-performance is required. In this dissertation, an examination of some of the technological barriers associated with the use of HTS materials for RF coils is presented, with a focus on providing a detailed look at these difficulties through the lens of an HTS probe build-out process. Thus, this work is centered around the development of a 1.5 mm multi-resonant all-HTS NMR probe optimized for 13C detection, which utilizes a recently introduced 13C resonator design engineered to significantly increase 13C detection sensitivity over previous state-of-the-art HTS probe designs. The probe is designed for operation at 14.1 T, has a sample volume of 35 microliters, and utilizes HTS resonators for 13C and 1H transmission and detection and the 2H lock.HTS NMR probes typically require multiple resonators to be located within a small volume near the sample. Coupling between the resonators shifts the resonances which affects both resonator design and post-production trimming. To increase the efficiency of the build-out process of HTS probes, a coupling model describing the interactions between the coils of the 1.5 mm HTS NMR probe was developed and tested. By measuring the magnetic coupling coefficients between individual coils, the general coupling matrix for six coupled resonators was solved to produce accurate predictions of the system frequencies. Results confirm that the assumption of purely magnetic coupling is sufficiently accurate to predict the required resonance adjustments for a set of HTS coils in a single pass.
Pulsed spectroscopy of many nuclides requires strong excitation fields. However, the fields that thin-film HTS resonators can produce are limited in comparison to normal-metal coils. The presented assessment of the new 13C HTS resonators shows a rapid increase in RF dissipation with increased power. A developed power testing procedure predicts that the coils are able to handle sufficient current to produce an effective 90° pulse without film degradation.
The performance results from preliminary RF and NMR testing of the 1.5 mm HTS NMR probe within a 14.1 T magnet are presented. To effectively implement the improved quality factor (Q-factor) of the new 13C resonators, the effect of adding a shorted transmission line stub to increase the bandwidth and reduce the rise/fall time of 13C irradiation pulses is demonstrated. The improved 13C coils facilitate a 330% increase in Q-factor and 33% increase in 13C sensitivity over a previous probe of similar design. The increase in 13C NMR sensitivity is made while simultaneously preserving a wide irradiation pulse bandwidth and avoiding distorted pulse shapes. The probe will be used for applications in metabolomics and natural products research.
The last section of this dissertation explores future directions for HTS coil design and use, with a focus on accommodating the large currents required of NMR transmit coils. A racetrack resonator with particularly adjusted finger lengths is predicted to improve current uniformity across the resonator. Importantly, the viability of using receive-only HTS coils for small sample NMR probes is investigated. It is shown that when sufficient isolation via field orthogonality is achieved with precise angular rotation of the normal-metal transmit coil, the HTS pair has the potential to provide improved sensitivity despite an increase in loss produced by the transmit coil.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>For colleges and universities, the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act (Clery Act) presents a significant set of challenges in pursuit of campus safety. The namesake of this law followed the tragic death of Jeanne Clery, a Lehigh University Student, who was sexually assaulted and murdered in her on-campus dormitory in 1986. Within the Clery Act, and under the umbrella of Title IX, exists a series of responsibilities and compliance regulations applicable to all institutions of higher education (IHEs) that receive federal financial aid. While there are significant benefits within Clery, its application to all IHEs comes with a great number of challenges exacerbated by tremendous penalties for noncompliance. Many of the challenges of Clery compliance have been heavily studied in the university system, though little research exists when it comes to community colleges. The purpose of this study was to explore both the challenges and the benefits of Clery compliance for Florida’s 2-year postsecondary institutions. There are 28 IHEs that make up the Florida College System and while many community colleges share a great number of attributes, they also each have unique characteristics which impact their Clery compliance efforts.
This qualitative research used an exploratory case study methodology and was bounded in the Florida College System’s (FCS) 28 colleges that make up its membership. To select a sample, first, the institutions were grouped into size categories based on student enrollment and categorized as small, medium, or large. From there, a purposeful criterion-based sample of 9 institutions was selected using a combination of random and network sampling. Included in this sample of 9 institutions were 3 residential campuses (1 from each size category) to encompass the additional requirements those institutions have under the Clery Act.
	Once the sample of institutions was selected, interviews were scheduled with the primary Clery Compliance Officer (CCO). They were asked a series of characteristic-based questions followed by the primary research questions in an open-ended format. Follow-up questions utilizing a convergent-question strategy were then used to fully explore the participants’ responses as a means of ensuring rich data was collected for each research question. From there, a cyclical and inclusive approach to data analysis was conducted following each round of interviews. Line-by-line coding was used to identify the primary codes before additional rounds of analysis were used to identify themes.
Research Question 1 focused on the challenges CCOs faced in pursuit of Clery compliance. Form the data collected a total of 46 responses were coded for this question. From the 46 responses, 9 themes were identified with the top 3 representing a lack of training (n = 11), lack of clarity (n = 10), and lack of dedicated Clery Compliance Officer/Staff (n = 7).
Research Question 2 focused on what CCOs do to remain compliant. From the data collected here a total of 29 responses were coded for this question. From the 29 responses, 6 themes were identified with the top 2 representing Training of Staff (n = 9) and Creating a Clery Team (n = 5). Though lack of training was cited as the number one challenge, it is evident that CCOs are attempting to compensate for this by developing their own training regimen and the same was found for lack of dedicated Clery staff.  
	Research Question 3 took a different approach and sought to answer what CCOs viewed as the most beneficial aspect of Clery compliance. From the data collected in reference to this question, 28 responses were coded into 6 themes. The top three themes identified here were Transparency (n = 12), followed by an even number of responses for both Identification of Issues (improved safety) and No Increased Benefit to Campus Safety (n = 5). The third most repeated theme was Increased Communication (n = 3) which included both internal and external channels. 
The data collected as part of this research provided a different perspective as to what challenges CCOs faced, how they met those challenges, and the benefits of Clery compliance in their institutions. While none of the CCOs interviewed suggested that Clery be rescinded, the challenges they experience are both real and difficult, but not insurmountable. CCOs acknowledge the benefits of Clery and subscribe to its intended goal, but they cannot easily overcome the challenges inherent in its compliance requirements. They are not (in general) asking for more, they simply want better resources—more accessible training, better clarity, and available staff, to maintain compliance and safe campuses.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>	Predominantly Black schools may struggle with ways to keep their students engaged. When Black students are not engaged in class, it could lead to low academic performance, which may reflect the lack of culturally relevant content in the curriculum. Student engagement is increasingly viewed as one of the keys to addressing problems such as low achievement, boredom and alienation, and high dropout rates (Martin &amp; Torres, n.d.).  Even if the school has predominantly Black teachers, one must not assume that the students will have an automatic academic advantage  (Gay, 2010). When teachers lack cultural understanding of their students, it may have a negative impact on their students’ academic achievement (Lin &amp; Bates, 2014).  This paper explores the attitudes of students in a United States History at an all-Black high school once they been taught under a culturally relevant curriculum such as an Afrocentric curriculum, or a curriculum that centers the students African and African American heritage and culture at the center of the content to which is being taught. The research concluded that students had positive feelings learning and an increase in engagement toward learning all content in United States history class, but only after learning about and appreciating their own history and culture. However, toward the end of the semester, the student’s engagement leveled equally, but did not falter below engagement prior to the insertion of the Afrocentric Curriculum. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In recent years, there has been an increased interest in studying military-connected children (Aronson &amp; Perkins, 2012; Chawla &amp; Solinas-Suanders, 2011; DePedro et al., 2011). Despite being the subject of much research, there exists a significant gap in the research literature concerning the voices of military-connected children. The 2019 Demographic Profile of the Military Community indicated approximately 1.6 U.S. million military-connected children worldwide, with 55.7% of the 1.6 million representatives of school-age children (DoD Demographics Report, 2019). As such, relocations resulting in frequent transitions for military-connected students have become commonplace. On average, military-connected students move at least 30% more than their civilian peers (Bradshaw et al., 2010). These frequent transitions were represented at Belvedere High School (pseudonym), located near Fort Powell (pseudonym) with a high military student population in the Northeastern United States. This study utilized semi-structured, in-depth interviews to explore the challenges experienced by military-connected children due to frequent transitions and their perceptions of the support they receive to mitigate those challenges. Six themes developed from a thematic analysis: Military-Connected Children Experienced Various Challenges During Frequent Transitions; Military-Connected Children Displayed Resilience Amidst Frequent Transitions; Military-Connected Children Perceived Counseling Support Programs as Beneficial in Addressing Academic and Social Issues; Military-Connected Children Perceived the School Administration at Belvedere to be Responsive to Their Needs; Military-Connected Children Perceived Parents and Siblings as the Most Significant Support System, and Military-Connected Children Appreciated Peer Support in Navigating the New School. Study participants perceived the available support programs at Belvedere adequate for meeting their needs and provide insights and recommendations on additional support programs that they believe could improve their overall experiences.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>I examine whether the FASB’s revenue recognition guidance (codified as ASC Topic 606) increases revenue comparability across firms and industries, and whether revenue comparability provides decision useful information to analysts. I extract firms’ revenue policy disclosures from 10-K filings to measure the textual similarity of these disclosures in order to compare revenue recognition policies across firms and industries. I find an increase in revenue comparability for economically similar firms in different industries upon adoption of ASC 606, which is consistent with the FASB meeting its objective to improve cross-industry revenue comparability with the new revenue model. In contrast, I find a decrease in revenue comparability for economically similar firms in the same industry. Further, I find evidence consistent with revenue comparability reducing analysts’ information processing costs and improving their forecasting performance when covered firms are economically similar, but the benefits of revenue comparability are diminished upon adoption of ASC 606. This finding suggests that the common revenue framework under ASC 606 reduces the usefulness of revenue comparability in the initial years after adoption. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Over the course of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, theatrical performance rose to become a significant component of British imperial culture. The proliferation of English performance styles and practices was largely due to the expansion of theatrical business during this era, which facilitated strolling players and their companies to reach audiences across Britain’s formal and informal empire. Theatrical managers utilized new technologies of transportation and ideologies of economic and political liberalism in furthering the influence and scope of theatrical business in British imperial spaces. This dissertation examines the records surrounding Anglophone theatrical performance in the British empire to reassess the role that theatre played in traditional narratives of imperialism as well as more recent narratives that have been written on British transitions toward modernity. In doing so, it argues that unique elements of theatre as an art form made it especially significant to the operations of imperial power overseas and to the development of narratives of imperial significance to audiences at home and abroad. As recognition of the significance of theatre to British imperial objectives became more prevalent, and developments in the wartime era of the twentieth century brought new challenges to the operations of touring companies, theatrical business followed an arc of increasing formalization and institutionalization. In order to maintain theatrical touring as a tool of British cultural influence and propaganda in the twentieth century, new institutions, including the British Council, had to be developed to regulate and subsidize its proliferation. Ultimately, this had the effect of transforming Anglophone theatrical culture from a component of imperial popular culture supported by the market in the nineteenth century, to a state subsidized representative of English national culture in the twentieth. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>"The Punished Woman Collects Her Body" is a collection of poems that center the queer femme’s experience, featuring a speaker who quests to reassemble her body after trauma and to discover the self through her senses and intellect with imaginative re-telling. The collection’s investment with the contemporary poetic tradition consists of intentional remembering, providing the speaker the agency to recount her narrative. The poems delineate the speaker’s journey as she navigates queerness, arriving at a place in which she has redefined family as it suits her and developed strategies for connecting her once polarized experiences of body and mind. 	</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Strong electron-electron correlations in physical systems can leadto phenomena that are not trivial composition of constitutent parts,
that the collective behavior lead to emergence of exotic phases and
behaviors. To describe exotic phases such as Mott insulators (MI)
within transition metal oxides, they must be treated as strongly correlated
systems, which can pose significant theoretical challenges unlike
their non-correlated counterparts. For the latter well-established
methods such as density-functional theory (DFT) is available, while
for the correlated problem a variety of approximate methods are employed,
as it is not immediate clear if there exists an universal recipe.
Dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) and Hartree approximations are
some of the many approximate methods that could be used to describe
correlated electron problems, and for the former there exists a subset
of methods such as iterated perturbation theory (IPT), rotationally-invariant
slave bosons (RISB) and continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo (CTQMC).
The selection of theoretical tools and whether a useful result can
be obtained often depends heavily on the approximate hamiltonian that
is proposed to model the physical system as well as capabilities of
the applied method. Therefore, in order to make successful theoretical
predictions, the robustness of a proposed model and the method applied
must be checked against a myriad of empircal evidences and physical
intuitions. In this dissertation, we first studied theoretically the
correlated physics in hydrogenic lattices using a variety of approaches,
followed by the emergence of Wigner-Mott crystallization in moire
heterostructures.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation composes of four chapters as well as appendices.The first two chapters are related to our study of hydrogenic lattices:
in the first, by applying methods of slave bosons and DMFT (SB+DMFT)
to the simplest charge-transfer model known as the Anderson lattice
model (ALM), we uncovered and remedied a formerly unknown limitation
of the SB approximation; in the second we modelled hydrogenic lattices
with charge-transfer ALM instead of non charge-transfer single-band
Hubbard model - our IPT and CTQMC calculations indicate that charge-transfer
not only the affects the nature of Mott transition, it also largely
suppresses the metal-insulator phase coexistence region. In the third
chapter we studied Wigner-Mott crystallization in moir\'{e} heterostructures
by solving the extended Hubbard model on a triangular lattice using
Hartree approximation in concert of DMFT. Our results are in good
agreement with experiments and we predict that: 1. fermi-liquid is
found when doped away from MI; 2. around the point that charge-order
disappears bad metal behavior is found. In the last chapter we present
our work using GPU and distributed computing to develop a IPT impurity
solver that offer drastic speed advantage over existing codes. We
find that the GPU implementation is significantly more efficient and
thus the superior implementation. Finally in the appendices we can
find detailed derivations of results for main chapters and a fast
root-search algorithm useful for DMFT calculations.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>	This dissertation describes the political origins and history of the scientific field of astrobiology, a discipline founded by NASA in the mid-1990s and whose practitioners search for and study extraterrestrial life and its potential evolution and origins. It argues that, despite the claims of scientists and past historians that astrobiology formed primarily because of new scientific developments, the field and the subsequent institution NASA created, the NASA Astrobiology Institute (NAI), were political products representative of changes in the relationship between space science and the American federal government in the 1990s. According to this dissertation, I argue astrobiology was a neoliberal science, born in an era in which the federal government expected sciences it funded to focus on the effect deficit cutting, balancing the federal budget, and connections with private industries. This political dynamic differed from the Cold War period when the government invested heavily in NASA to produce science and technology for national defense or competition with the Soviet Union. This emphasis on of neoliberal and fiscal and budgetary politics contrasts with how scholars have described NASA or astrobiology before. Overall, the dissertation asserts that astrobiology, while a singular example, is indicative of the differences in American scientific patronage and NASA’s national identity from the Cold War to the post-Cold War era.More specifically, astrobiology also reflected the constant financial, political battles NASA had faced since the 1970s when the agency tried to establish long-lasting relevance after the Apollo program. With Congress and the White House in the 1990s insisting the agency downsize or face potential closures and privatization, NASA administrator Daniel Goldin attempted to reinvent the agency and reassert its commitment to basic but cost-effective scientific research, including on extraterrestrial life. NAI was thus an instrument to appease the federal government and advance NASA’s larger goal of stabilizing its funding. In terms of research, the project employs a mixture of NASA archival resources at the NASA History Office in Washington, DC, and NASA Ames History Archives in Mountain View, California, as well as published primary and secondary sources. It also uses a series of oral histories I conducted with relevant astrobiologists.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Many institutions have turned to individualized holistic review to make admissions decisions, which is meant to take a comprehensive view of the quantitative and qualitative elements that comprise a single application. Prior research shows holistic review lacks a common definition and the gap between theory and practice has not been thoroughly addressed, particularly at institutions with high application volume. This study explored how the presence of holistic review components such as standardized test scores and contextual data affect first-time-in-college (FTIC) admission decisions at a large selective public institution. Additionally, it addressed the question of how holistic review can be more efficiently implemented. This study used a mixed-methods approach: a randomized controlled experiment followed by a think-aloud protocol. The main implications for practitioners based on the experimental results are that there were no significant decision differences between applications that included test scores but there were significant group differences in application review time. The shortest review time for applications that only presented test scores within the high school and neighborhood contextual data. Additionally, the overall average application review time was only two minutes. Results from the think-aloud protocol showed that participants did notice when application components were missing. High school transcripts were the most viewed and discussed, whereas test scores were more often overruled by other application components. Contextual information accounted for 30% of the shifts in cognitive decision-making. A qualitative content analysis of the think-aloud protocol showed three primary themes: context (external control), review (admissions staff control), and student effort (applicant control). Additional findings on the definition of holistic review and how it can be more feasibly implemented were also discussed. The results from this exploratory study identify many avenues for more future targeted research on holistic review that can help increase transparency and close the gap between theory and practice.

            <DISS_para>Cri de coeur is French for "cry from the heart," and indeed this work has an expressive intensity previously unseen (so far as I can tell) in my oeuvre. It would be cheap for me to say that this work, composed in the autumn of 2021, is a reflection of the disruptions caused by the pandemic. In truth, I have gotten through about as well as can be expected, but perhaps there was something stuck inside of me that needed to get out.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The initial inspiration for this piece came from Franz Schubert's fifteenth and final string quartet in G major, D. 887, a work of great originality, and power that, like so much of late Schubert, belies the image of the composer as a naive tunesmith. The opening idea of the quartet is reproduced quite faithfully at the beginning of this work, translated into a more post-tonal harmonic idiom but otherwise recognizable. This combination, Schubert's gesture and a harmonization that is wholly un-Schubertian, makes up the main thematic material of the piece. The other idea that stuck in my head from Schubert's quartet was the ghostly tremolo we first hear about a minute in, over which the first violin soars with a delicate melody. This idea, too, found its way into the first section of my work.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Bulimic syndromes (BN-S) capture a range of DSM-5 eating disorders characterized by binge eating and may be accompanied by low weight or inappropriate compensatory behaviors.  Emerging models have attributed the development and maintenance of BN-S to dysfunctional reward systems, including abnormalities in reward responsiveness and reward valuation as defined by the Research Domain Criteria.  The present study investigated the relationship between a neural measure of reward responsiveness, a behavioral measure of reward valuation, and severity of eating pathology in women with a history of BN-S (n=52) and non-eating disorder controls (n=14) enrolled in a longitudinal study. Participants were recruited to complete an electroencephalogram (EEG) session in which they completed a standard version and a modified version of a guessing task to measure the reward positivity when receiving food (RewPM&amp;M) or monetary rewards (RewPmoney) while in a satiated state.  As part of the parent study, participants completed progressive ratio tasks for food and non-food reward in fed and fasted conditions to measure reward valuation. BN-S and control participants did not demonstrate significant differences in RewP amplitudes for monetary or food rewards. Reward sensitivity measured by RewPmoney and RewPM&amp;M was not significantly associated with reward valuation for either progressive ratio task. Finally, reward sensitivity was not significantly associated with eating pathology severity. The lack of findings prompts questions of whether reward sensitivity is a relevant construct for understanding BN-S and methodological factors that might impact the ability to detect its relevance. Methodological changes in participant inclusion criteria, nutritional status during tasks, and calculation of RewP are discussed for the RewP tasks to enhance future determinations of potential disruption of reward sensitivity in BN-S. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This thesis studies a novel self- and mutual-exciting stochastic model to capture two essential features underlying a general type of discrete-time event data motivated by the practice: the dependence on the past event arrivals and associated sizes (i.e., self-exciting) and the behavioral interdependence between multiple activities (i.e., mutual-exciting). Despite the technical challenges in capturing these two features under a general discrete-time framework,  we are able to fully characterize the probability distribution for the proposed model (i.e., the closed-form characteristic functions),  theoretically quantify customer performance measures, and establish efficient maximum likelihood estimation. To illustrate the applicability of our model and validate its performance, we calibrate it with a customer deposit and withdrawal data set from one leading online money market fund. We analytically quantify the churn probability and expected activity level of customers as an illustration of performance measures and then compare our model with classic time-series and machine-learning models and show that our model can achieve high prediction accuracy.  The theoretical tractability and predictive accuracy of the proposed framework enable us to build optimization models to improve firm performance, and we illustrate one application through a personalized interest-rate optimization problem.
On a broader note, our model framework is generally applicable to characterize any discrete-time event data with self and mutual excitation in nature and to inform optimal policies for decision-makers. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Emergent literacy skills including alphabetic knowledge, print knowledge, oral language, phonological awareness, and emergent writing are foundational for future reading development. Many children with ASD are at risk for future reading difficulties (e.g., Brown et al., 2013; McIntyre et al., 2018; Nation et al., 2006). To support the emergent literacy development of children with ASD, preschool teachers need to have adequate pedagogical content knowledge. This study investigated public preschool teachers’ expertise related to teaching emergent literacy skills to children with ASD. Results from quantitative questionnaires and qualitative interviews revealed that the 10 participating teachers were generally knowledgeable about many aspects of emergent literacy content and teaching practices as well as characteristics of learners with ASD although there were certain subareas (e.g., phonemic awareness) in which they demonstrated a lack of knowledge. Interview and survey data generally corroborated each other. Despite this knowledge, teachers indicated a lack of capacity to effectively address the emergent literacy skills of children with ASD and expressed a desire for more training. Teachers reported differentiating delivery method, learning environment, and dosage of instruction for children with ASD to help them participate and learn more. Concrete supports, visual schedule and incorporating personal interests were perceived by teachers as useful strategies. However, teachers did not report to incorporate specific emergent literacy teaching strategies shown to be effective for learners with ASD. Teachers did not report emphasizing certain emergent literacy skills over others. But some teachers mentioned that they prioritized basic social skills for children with ASD over emergent literacy. These findings suggest the need for more training and research to guide emergent literacy instruction in preschool settings. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>	In modern statistics, many data sets are of complex structure, including but not limited to high dimensionality, higher-order, and heterogeneity. Recently, there has been growing interest in developing valid and efficient statistical methods for these data sets. In my thesis, we studied three types of data complexity: (1) tensor data (a.k.a. array valued random objects); (2) heavy-tailed data; (3) data from heterogeneous subpopulations. We address these three challenges by developing novel methodologies and efficient algorithms. Specifically, we proposed  likelihood-based dimension folding methods for tensor data, studied the robust tensor $\td$ regression by a proposed tensor $\td$ distribution, and developed an algorithm and theory for high-dimensional mixture linear regression. My work on these three topics is elaborated as follows.			
			In recent years, traditional multivariate analysis tools, such as multivariate regression and discriminant analysis, are generalized from modeling random vectors and matrices to higher-order random tensors (a.k.a.~array-valued random objects). 
			Equipped with tensor algebra and high-dimensional computation techniques, concise and interpretable statistical models and estimation procedures prevail in various applications. One challenge for tensor data analysis is caused by the large dimensions of the tensor. Many statistical methods such as linear discriminant analysis and quadratic discriminant analysis are not applicable or unstable for data sets with the dimension that is larger than the sample size. Sufficient dimension reduction methods are flexible tools for data visualization and exploratory analysis, typically in a regression of a univariate response on a multivariate predictor. For regressions with tensor predictors, a general framework of dimension folding and several moment-based estimation procedures have been proposed in the literature. In this essay, we propose two likelihood-based dimension folding methods motivated by quadratic discriminant analysis for tensor data: the maximum likelihood estimators are derived under a general covariance setting and a structured envelope covariance setting. We study the asymptotic properties of both estimators and show using simulation studies and a real-data analysis that they are more accurate than existing moment-based estimators.
			
			Another challenge to statistical tensor models is the non-Gaussian nature of many real-world data. Unfortunately, existing approaches are either restricted to normality or implicitly using least squares type objective functions that are computationally efficient but sensitive to data contamination. Motivated by this, we adopt a simple tensor $\td$-distribution that is, unlike the commonly used matrix $\td$-distributions, compatible with tensor operators and reshaping of the data. We study the tensor response regression with tensor $\td$-error, and develop penalized likelihood-based estimation and a novel one-step estimation. We study the asymptotic relative efficiency of various estimators and establish the one-step estimator's oracle properties and near-optimal asymptotic efficiency. We further propose a high-dimensional modification to the one-step estimation procedure and showed that it attains the minimax optimal rate in estimation. Numerical studies show the excellent performance of the one-step estimator. 
			
			In the last chapter, we consider the high-dimensional mixture linear regression. 	The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm and its variants are widely used in statistics. In high-dimensional mixture linear regression, the model is assumed to be a finite mixture of linear regression forms and the number of predictors is much larger than the sample size. The standard EM algorithm, which attempts to find the maximum likelihood estimator, becomes infeasible. We devise a penalized EM algorithm and study its statistical properties. Existing theoretical results of regularized EM algorithms often rely on dividing the sample into many independent batches and employing a fresh batch of sample in each iteration of the algorithm. Our algorithm and theoretical analysis do not require sample-splitting. The proposed method also has encouraging performances in simulation studies and a real data example.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Fast ion conductors (FICs), also known as solid electrolytes, are a key component of all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs), one of the most promising next-generation energy storage technologies. Among them, thiophosphates, such as Li10GeP2S12 and Li-argyrodites, have shown conductivities greater than 10 mS/cm, which are desirable for high-power applications. Cation doping is the common strategy to induce structural disorder for enhancing ion transport. However, cations such as Ge4+ and Ti4+ introduce unwanted redox centers and compromises electrochemical stability window. To leverage structural disorder for fast ion conduction without introducing undesirable redox reactions in solid electrolytes, the less traveled path of engineering the anion sublattice is explored. The viability and effectiveness of this method are examined across several thiophosphate-based FICs: Br-argyrodites (Li6-xPS5-xBr1+x), Br/Cl-mixed argyrodites (Li5.3PS4.3Cl1.7-xBrx), BH4-containing argyrodites (Li5+xPS4+y(BH4)2-z) and their glass-type analogues, (Li5PS4(BH4)2) and I-doped structures (Li5PS4(BH4)2-xIx). Advanced characterization methods including X-ray and neutron diffraction, solid-state NMR spectroscopy and relaxometry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, in conjunction with ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations, are employed to investigate the composition-structure-property correlations.  The results from this dissertation research have shown that the impact of anion doping on ion conduction is profound and manifested in four aspects: 1) changing the bottleneck size of ion transport channels, 2) altering the concentration/spatial distribution of charge-carrying cations, 3) shaping the energy landscape, and 4) inducing dynamical disorder via incorporating mobile polyanions into the structural framework. Several of these solid electrolytes have been tested in practical battery cells, which demonstrates exceptional compatibility with electrodes and long-term cycling stability. 
In summary, this dissertation comprises novel compositional design, optimal synthesis,  and comprehensive characterizations of FICs, and integrating these FICs into practical all-solid-state batteries. This work provides a panoramic view of high-performance FIC development, and the yielded fundamental insights will help overcome the barriers associated with technological applications of lithium thiophosphates in energy storage.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Fluid dynamic characterization of shock impingement on a flat surface has been studied extensively, whereas the material behavior induced by the shock has largely been ignored. The focus of this study is mainly on the material and structural characteristics of the deformable flat surfaces in the presence of shock impingement. Two structures, including a semi-infinite half-space and a flat plate, have been investigated.This study first investigates the elastic surface of a semi-infinite half-space subjected to surface tractions across an ideal inviscid shock. Anisotropic elasticity of material under the shock-induced discontinuous surface loading is evaluated using Stroh formalism. We find that a shear stress jump across an idealized shock impingement causes a stress singularity, while a pure pressure jump without shear does not produce a singularity.
Theoretical solutions of the idealized discontinuous surface loads are compared to finite element modeling. Besides the stress components induced by the surface tractions, these analyses also include the investigation of the contributions of an arbitrary vector h, which is constrained by the prescribed far-field conditions, to the solutions of Stroh formalism. In the cases of uniform loads and a pure pressure jump acting on the surface, the stress components using Stroh formalism have good agreements with those by the finite element method. However, in the case of a shear stress jump acting on the surface, there are some stress mismatches between the results of the two techniques.
Additional constraints are needed to solve the vector h in the Stroh method. Up to this point, Stroh formalism is further employed to study the case of an ideal Mach 5 shock by neglecting the stress mismatches caused by the jump in the shear components across the shock since those values are much smaller compared to the associated pressure components. The results illustrate that the highly localized stress singularity in the resultant von Mises stress \sigma_H can be treated as negligible, and the aluminum structure remains well within the elastic regime given inviscid Mach 5 flow conditions.
Although the aluminum surface remains elastic under the selected Mach 5 conditions, potential stress concentration or large deformation may occur in the structure involving more complex geometries, i.e., elastic plates. Keep this in mind, further investigations of the characterization of a flat plate surface are carried out when the plate is subjected to a typical wall pressure with no intermediate plateau using the techniques of two-dimensional isotropic elastic theory and Fourier sine series expansion. Various shock impingement points are studied. The results indicate that the normal stress in the span direction is the dominant stress component contributing to the resultant von Mises stress \sigma_H. As the shock impingement point is near the two ends,  the wall pressure acts more like a uniform load, which causes a more symmetric distribution of the \sigma_H. In these cases, the maximum of \sigma_H is also near the edge midpoint. More asymmetric distributions of \sigma_H  are obtained as the shock impinges at the positions away from the ends. The \sigma_{Hmax} moves towards the right end of the plate until its location reaches an upper bound. Meanwhile, the \sigma_{Hmax} keeps decreasing due to the fact that the average pressure loading goes down as the shock impingement point moves from the left end of the plate to the right.
However, the isotropic elastic theory is limited to the isotropic material properties and lacks the convenience to calculate the deflection of the plate. An extension of Stroh formalism is further introduced to investigate the deflections of the plates with relatively general anisotropic elastic properties. This work also provides the derivation process of the extended Stroh formalism by taking advantage of the material eigenrelation and other elegant mathematical treatments involved in the Stroh formalism, as well as the previous isotropic model. Notably, choosing appropriate functions for the stress potentials is critical when applying the Stroh formalism to the elastic problems. By taking the geometric boundary conditions of the plate problems into consideration, an exponential function of the thickness coordinate has been chosen. Furthermore, by employing the stress-strain constitutive law and the equations of equilibrium, a modified eigenrelation can be obtained with a relatively general anisotropic elastic tensor.
Finally, the material and structural characterization of an aluminum plate subjected to the shock impinging at various locations on its upper edge are studied using the Stroh-type formalism. Three back pressures are also involved. Here the von Mises stress \sigma_H and the transverse displacement {\widetilde{u}}_3 of the flat plate are employed to evaluate these effects of the different shock impingement points. In general, the shock-induced pressure loading on the plate acts more like a uniform load when the shock impingement point is near the two ends of the plate. As the shock impinges away from the plate ends, the distributions of \sigma_H and {\widetilde{u}}_3 become more asymmetric. Particularly, there is a mismatch between the locations of the maximum of \sigma_H and {\widetilde{u}}_3. When p_{back} is no greater than the mean pressure value after the shock, the associated \sigma_H and {\widetilde{u}}_3 of the plate gradually decrease as the shock impingement point shifts from the left end to the right. In contrast, in the case of p_{back}=1 atm, the associated \sigma_H and {\widetilde{u}}_3 of the plate gradually increase. Variations of the safety factors of the plate are further investigated with various span-to-thickness ratios P under the combined conditions with different back pressures p_{back} and the shock impingement positions {\widetilde{x}}_0. The cases with p_{back}=1 atm have the lowest safety factors compared to other cases with the same P. The associated safety factors are below 1 when the ratios P increase to 100 or greater. When p_{back}=0 and p_1, a smaller {\widetilde{x}}_0 causes a lower safety factor. Notably, the combination of p_{back}=p_1 and {\widetilde{x}}_0=0.75 leads to the highest safety factors compared to other cases with the same P. Even when P = 300, the safety factor is still greater than 1. However, a high span-to-thickness ratio may lead to a violation of the small strain assumption of the elastic model. Therefore, further investigations are suggested on the limitations of the elastic model in this Stroh-type formalism.

            <DISS_para>Behavior selection is a problem that AI development has faced for years, whether it be in video games or crowd-simulation software. While video game studios use methods like hierarchical task network (HTN) planners to control the behaviors of their non-playable characters (NPCs), different crowd-simulation software implement various forms of crowd model, some even recently proposing using utility-based behavior models. In this paper, I propose a framework for designing complex behavior structures that can be adapted for individual NPCs, groups of NPCs, or crowds of other AI agents that more closely mimic how people would naturally behave in almost any situation. This framework is achieved through combining the ability to compute the possibility of a future event with the ability to decompose abstract tasks into a plan of action through the use of HTN planners.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Child Care Apprenticeship Program of Pinellas (CCAP) was created by an advisory committee made up of local childcare facility directors, in 1989, in response to the need for better training in the community. CCAP is a two-year program that emphasizes 4000 hours of on-the-job-training and 288 hours of classroom instruction credentialing working preschool teachers. The program is designed for apprentices to complete only 2000 on-the-job training hours and 144 hours of classroom instruction when they pass an assessment during the orientation of the program. Upon completion of the program, apprentices receive the Florida Staff Credential for children ages birth to five years old and are eligible to teach voluntary prekindergarten (VPK) classes as part of the kindergarten readiness initiative through the Office of Early Learning (2019). This program is held online and face-to-face at two campuses in Pinellas County located in Clearwater and St. Petersburg, Florida. Overall, there are about 100 apprentices enrolled in the program between the two campuses. Currently, CCAP is in the implementation stage of providing a higher level and highly sought out credential, the National Child Development Associate (CDA). The program is also in review of the curriculum to update the framework standards by the Summer of 2022, as required by the Florida Department of Education Registered Apprenticeship office.	The purpose of this case study is to strengthen child care training and credentialing needs in Pinellas County through a case study of the Child Care Apprenticeship Program (CCAP) at Pinellas Technical College. CCAP has not updated its framework standards since 2007. In the fall of 2020, after an audit of the program by a representative from the Florida Department of Education Registered Apprenticeship Office, the coordinators were asked to formally update the program framework. Enhancing the CCAP curriculum will strengthen the early childhood education workforce in Pinellas County when the program is able to provide high-quality training for the enrolled apprentices by updating the program standards. 
This evaluative case study explores the following two research questions:
1.	What are the perceptions of the current CCAP curriculum?
2.	What are the perceptions regarding the National CDA versus the Florida Staff Credential?	
	Semi-structured interviews were conducted on eleven participants to include all six of the CCAP staff members, as well as five of the six advisory committee members. These interviews gathered their perceptions of the program curriculum and credentials. Transcripts and program documents were analyzed through two cycles using NVivo software and an inductive approach to create themes to identify recommendations for program improvement based on the perceptions of the participants in the study. There were two dominant themes interpreted from the analysis of initial codes and phrases that were determined through a word frequency count. However, these themes translated into differing meanings within the perceptions of the participants. As such, four sub-themes were developed to further clarify the data.
	The analysis from the data found that there is a perception that the child care industry is constantly evolving, and therefore an opportunity exists to review the current curriculum and make appropriate changes. Specifically, the data showed that the participants felt there were opportunities to fill the gaps in the curriculum related to three of the five current course components to include classroom management, leadership, and guidance. Additionally, an analysis of the data also revealed that there are opportunities outside of changes to the curriculum standards that can better support the apprentices, such as delivery method and preparation into the program.  
	In conclusion, there are very few studies on apprenticeship models in the early childhood education field. The opportunity for free high quality professional development and credentialing for the field is a positive attribute for Pinellas County. Thus, the need for ensuring that CCAP has a strong and robust curriculum, that meets the needs of the local community child care workforce in Pinellas County, is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the program and attracting more apprentices in the field. This case study provides an opportunity for CCAP to potentially strengthen the current early education workforce in Pinellas County and in-turn provide additional high-quality preschool options for the local community by updating its curriculum framework to best serve the industry needs. As such, further research, to include the perceptions of the past and current apprentices, would be beneficial to better determine which types of supports would be best suited the program needs, as well as specific content updates to the curriculum.

            <DISS_para>Select silencing of gene expression in one X chromosome in female mammals provides a means to overcome X-linked gene expression imbalances with males. Central to establishing gene silencing on the inactivated X chromosome are the actions of the long non-coding RNA XIST that triggers the repackaging of the chosen X into facultative heterochromatin. Additionally, microscopic and high throughput sequence-based studies have established that the mammalian inactive X chromosome (Xi) adopts an alternate conformation relative to the active X chromosome. Organized into several multi-megabase chromatin loops called superloops, the human Xi bears anchors at the base of these loops that are composed of large tandem repeat DNA, including DXZ4, Functional Intergenic Repeating RNA Element (FIRRE), and Inactive-X CTCF-binding Contact Element (ICCE). Furthermore, ICCE is nestled within the intronic region of a micropetide expressing gene established as NBDY, a novel protein that has been implicated to interact with components of nonsense mediated decay (NMD). Little else is known about the properties or origins of ICCE or NBDY and the role that XIST plays in maintaining chromatin at the human inactive X chromosome (Xi) has remained elusive. Here, we used bioinformatical tools to elucidate the nature of the ICCE repeat and observe the localization of NDBY with fluorescent microscopy under lentivirally induced overexpression conditions. With genome engineering, we were able to delete the promotor of XIST to knockout expression in non-cancerous diploid human somatic cells. We find that primary DNA sequence conservation of ICCE is only retained in higher primates, but that ICCE orthologs exist beyond the primate lineage. Like DXZ4, what is conserved is organization of the underlying DNA into a large tandem repeat, the physical location within the NBDY locus and short DNA sequences corresponding to specific CTCF and Yin Yang 1 binding motifs that correlate with female-specific DNA hypomethylation. Unlike DXZ4, ICCE is not common to all eutherian mammals, but analysis of certain ICCE CTCF motifs reveal striking similarity with the DXZ4 motif. Further examination of NBDY itself led to successful overexpression of the gene in RPE1 cells which was visualized as a diffuse signal in the nucleus and as pinprick cytoplasmic foci through fluorescent microscopy. Additionally lentiviral induction time trials revealed a shift in NBDY localization from the cytoplasmic to nuclear at the six-hour mark, with a strong signal detected overlapping with promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) bodies. In XIST knockout cells, some heterochromatin features exhibit limited change at the Xi, but two of those assessed showed significant reductions including histone H2A monoubiquitylation at lysine 119 and histone H3 trimethylation at lysine 27, both of which are covalent histone modifications catalyzed by the polycomb repressive complexes 1 and 2 respectively. Coupled with these reductions, we observed an occasional gain of euchromatin signatures on Xp, but despite these signs of chromatin instability, we did not observe appreciable changes in the reactivation of genes from the Xi. Collectively, these data reveal several novel insights about the NBDY gene and ICCE; the findings imply a further role for NBDY in PML body association and senescence and support an evolutionary relationship between DXZ4 and ICCE. Additionally, the data compiled on the absence of XIST are consistent with maintenance of dosage compensation at the Xi involving multiple redundant layers of gene silencing.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Site discovery is critical to submerged archaeology’s contribution to theoretical reconstructions of past peoples. Remote sensing tools help locate human activity and targets, and scientists are continuously devising new methods. Remote sensors primarily use an emitted signal as a method of detecting anomalies underwater due to the speed and accuracy of sound’s propagation through water. Understanding this and how different materials respond aid in the identification of underwater targets and potential sites. Preliminary research shows that material type of a knapped lithic has little effect on its resonant frequency. Its excitation frequency, shape, size, and volume do have an effect. With this information, it may be possible to detect knapped lithics at frequencies from as low as 2 kHz resting on the seafloor and embedded within. These data was subsequently used to develop the Human-altered Lithic Detection (HALD) method that uses acoustic excitation and remote sensing to detect lithics on and within the seafloor. The experiments conducted in this thesis tested factors affecting the HALD technique and can help archaeologists better understand how remote sensing aids in discovering and mapping submerged precontact sites (and others) and enhance preservation efforts by identifying archaeologically relevant sites more rapidly. We found that 38 out of 233 material samples tested positive for haystacks. This is just one new approach scientists have devised for potentially locating underwater precontact sites using geoacoustics.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>A multitude of research has already been conducted on the concept of cohesion in sport with the majority of research looking at the relationship between cohesion and performance. It has been found that the correlation between cohesion and performance is moderately strong and positive; however, little research has been conducted on potential antecedents and moderators that influence the development of cohesion. Three potential environmental inputs that have been scarcely found in the sport literature include previous success, tenure and group size. Usually analyzed at the same time as other variables of interest, research on success and cohesion in sport has found that for winning teams, cohesion remained consistent throughout the sport season while those on losing teams saw a decrease in cohesion over this same time period. Concentrated in the business domain, increased tenure has been shown to provide greater overall team stability and greater social cohesion. Research on group size has found that increases in the number of individuals on a sport team decreases cohesion while small to medium sized exercise classes provide enough social opportunities but larger classes see these opportunities decrease. When used as a moderator, the type of team has been found to not moderate the cohesion-performance relationship. With limited knowledge on antecedents of cohesion along with the potential moderation effect of team type and the changes in cohesion over time, the purpose of this study is to examine the relationships between previous season success, team tenure and group size and cohesion, see if team type moderates these relationships and explore how cohesion changes over time. It is hypothesized that the relationship between group size and cohesion will be negative while the relationships between previous success and cohesion along with tenure and cohesion will be positive. Additionally, the relationships between the three environmental variables of interest and cohesion will be stronger for those on coactive teams compared to interactive teams. A total of 118 current NCAA student-athletes partook in this study of which 57 were from coactive teams and 61 were from interactive teams. Participants completed an online Qualtrics composed of three sections: demographics, environmental inputs and the Group Environment Questionnaire (GEQ) to assess cohesion. At the end of this questionnaire, participants were asked if they were willing to partake in an additional questionnaire, containing only the GEQ, to contribute to the exploration of cohesion over time. Of the 118 total participants, 86 agreed to partake in the second questionnaire four weeks later with 37 responses recorded. Multiple regression analyses, the PROCESS macro and a paired samples t-test were conducted to see if there are any relationships between the environmental inputs and cohesion, if team type moderates these relationships and to explore changes in cohesion over four weeks respectively. Analyses found that previous success was a positive predictor for both Group Integration subscales of cohesion. Additionally, team type was found to moderate the relationship between tenure and both ATG cohesion subscales with tenure being found to be a significant predictor for the task cohesion subscales (ATG-T and GI-T) and team type being an additional predictor of ATG-T. While no significant relationships were found between tenure and ATG-S for both coactive and interactive teams along with the relationship between tenure and ATG-T for interactive teams, there was a significant negative relationship found between tenure and ATG-T for coactive teams. It was also found that cohesion did not significantly differ between the initial questionnaire and the second questionnaire administered four weeks later.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>There is an issue occurring in public schools that is not often addressed and that is the Black-White disparity in exclusionary discipline. The conversation often centers around the “achievement gap” or more recently the “opportunity gap”. But what are some of the factors that can be addressed in schools that are leading to these gaps? The main concept is first, students need to be in the schools to learn. Exclusionary discipline removes the students from their learning environment. In fact, exclusionary discipline affects Black students nationwide. According to the K-12 Civil Rights Data Collection’s (2017) 2015-2016 nationwide report where Black students made up 15.4% of enrollment while 48.9% of the students were White. That same collection period nationwide identified 37.2% of the students receiving one out-of-school suspension were Black, while 33.6% of students were White. These disparities align with historical research as well as the research conducted for this study which focused on elementary schools and non-violent behaviors in a large school district in the Southeastern United States, the research states that Black students are underrepresented in the district, yet over represented in exclusionary disciplinary outcomes. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This led to the purpose of this research which was to examine the degree of Black-White disparity in exclusionary discipline based on non-violent behaviors and to identify school characteristics such as school size, poverty level, and racial diversity level, that are associated with Black-White disparity in exclusionary discipline based on non-violent behaviors of elementary students. A quantitative approach was taken for this research due to the fact that the goal was to solely identify the elementary schools with the greatest Black-White disparity and determine if a commonality of characteristics exists between them. A Pearson r correlation analysis was conducted and was determined that there was no significant association between suspension rate of any type and school background characteristics that were examined in this study. It was identified however that lower severity level non-violent behaviors had a Black-White disparity level as great as 48.4%.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Only 11% of students who are Pell-eligible and the first in their family to attend college graduate with a bachelor’s degree. Upward Bound is a federal-funded project that seeks to 1) improve the motivation and skills of disadvantaged students and 2) increase students’ likelihood of success at two- and four-year institutions. The study sought to understand how a specific Upward Bound program helped facilitate college readiness for economically marginalized Black students through the lens of the participants. The data for this project was collected through interviews with current and former participants. The findings revealed that familial-like relationships between the staff and students were the pillars of the program’s success. Having adult mentors created a climate of empowerment and high self-esteem for the students aspiring to attend and be attain success in their collegiate pursuits.  Pairing mentorship with the financial means to remove structural barriers in education through grant funds, cultivated outcomes that produced college entry and completion. These findings indicate a need for intentional college-to-career efforts that support post-secondary goals of students to include: identifying adults and college students to serve as mentors, training staff to embrace ideologies that work to combat structural barriers in education, and building relationships with local colleges and universities to utilize free resources and be abreast on admission trends.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This study aimed to determine the perceived value and frequency of singing, chanting, and additional vocalization techniques in school instrumental ensembles. Vocalization tools are meant to enhance student musicians' concepts of music. Music directors, both band and orchestra, in a southeastern American state completed a questionnaire that asked: (1) the frequency of vocalization techniques used with instrumental students, (2) the frequency of modeling vocalization techniques with students, (3)  the frequency of listening and discussion exercises with students, (4) the frequency of other rehearsal exercises, (5) the perceived importance of vocalization tools, (6) reasons for using singing exercises, (7) reasons for using rhythm-counting systems, (8) open responses for the goals of using singing exercises, and (9) open response for the goals of using rhythm-counting tools. The questionnaire included demographic questions to identify ensemble type (band or orchestra), educational level (elementary, middle, and high school), teaching experience (years), personal experience with choirs, singing comfort, and background. The study analyzed the primary teaching tools of directors' overall importance of vocalization techniques: singing with notes names, neutral syllables, solfege, and chanting rhythm. The 148 survey participants ranged in experience from 1 to 20 years of teaching. For singing techniques, the survey determined that the frequency of neutral syllable singing had the highest frequency of use and is used more than solfege or pitch-name singing. For rhythm techniques, the survey determined that chanting rhythm (rhythm-counting) had the highest frequency of use followed by sizzle/tizzle/bop. Chanting pitch names and multiple systems were infrequent and had the highest percentage of responses with at no rehearsals. The frequency of the modeling techniques (singing, chanting, playing) had at every rehearsal as the highest percentage of responses, and a low percentage (less than 10%) of directors used modeling at few or no rehearsals. For non-performance exercises, the survey determined the frequency of guided listening to a band or orchestra recordings and open dialogue/discussion about repertoire had at some rehearsals as the highest percentage of responses, whereas listening to vocal ensemble recordings had at few rehearsals as the highest percentage of responses. For other techniques, the survey found that the frequency of clapping rhythms had at most rehearsals as the highest percentage of responses, while breathing exercises/breathing gym and student-led sectionals had at some rehearsals as the highest percentage of responses, and silent rehearsals had at few rehearsals as the highest percentage of responses. The perceived value of pitch/melody and rhythm-counting vocalizations had very important as the highest percentage of responses. The most common response directors gave for using vocalization (pitch/melody and rhythm-counting) in rehearsal was the choice “I know from experience it works.”  Surveyed directors indicated 94.6% were comfortable singing for their students, 51% had experience singing in a choir, and 78% had experience teaching a choir. The majority of directors responded that vocalization was important for instrumentalists, but the frequency of vocalization techniques indicated a difference in actual practice.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Data skewness widely occurs in present-day statistical applications. Various distribution families have  been recently proposed to model skewed data, many enforcing different scales in reference to the median or the mode. We argue that the pivotal point  to incur unsymmetrical scales is not identical to  a location shift parameter in the presence of skewness, and propose a framework of Skewed Pivot-adaptive Estimation with Unsymmetrical Scales (SPEUS). SPEUScan construct a skewed density family with continuity  given any density function that may be nonsymmetric and nonunimodal, and includes many previously proposed skewed distributions as special cases. The framework allows us to simultaneously estimate the pivot, location, and scale parameters, and can be adapted to a skewed hurdle model with joint variable selection to cope with semicontinuous outcomes that contain with excessive zeros and skewed positive values, in addition to a large number of predictors. The computational issues brought by nonconvexity and nonsmoothness  are tackled with a surrogate constructed by linearization and blockwise coordinate descent,  the resulting   algorithm having both implementation ease and guaranteed convergence. Moreover, we also perform finite-sample  analysis to provide  provable guarantees for the obtained estimators which, though not necessarily globally optimal, enjoy the desired order of statistical accuracy  at the occurrence  of skewness Experiments and real-life data  applications to the medical expenditure panel survey data (MEPS) illustrate the excellent performance of the proposed method.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>From the foundation of the People’s Republic of China (in 1949) until now, Chinese women’s social status has been improved and their identities have been shifted with the changes in the social system. However, in the new century, they are experiencing a hard time in balancing careers and domestic work. Although Chinese women proactively contributed to the nation’s formation, construction and development, the traditional gender norms still confine women’s roles as “ideal mothers”. Through in-depth interviews, this study explores how motherhood is understood by highly educated female faculty with leadership positions within a higher education institution in China. By analyzing faculty mothers’ experiences and perspectives of motherhood, the findings investigate how motherhood as a negotiated identity is constructed and reconstructed by the social, cultural, economic and political context. Motherhood is understood as a process of becoming and evolving, and not something that is static, despite being shaped by the broader social structures and gendered ideologies.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para> Thanks to the advancement of data-collecting technology in brain imaging, genomics, financial econometrics, and machine learning, scientific data tend to grow in both size and structural complexity, which are not amenable to traditional statistical analysis. In this dissertation, we developed novel high-dimensional methodologies for dimension reduction, discriminant analysis, and tensor data.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>    In the first chapter, we proposed a unified framework, called subspace estimation with automatic dimension and variable selection (SEAS), to extend many existing low-dimensional sufficient dimension reduction (SDR) methods to the high-dimensional setting. The flexibility of SEAS considerably widens the application scope of many SDR methods. Our proposal only relies on a double-penalized convex formulation, which can be solved efficiently. From the theoretical perspective, we established a satisfactory convergence rate for our proposal, which is optimal in a minimax sense.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>    In the second chapter, we established a population model for the reduced-rank linear discriminant analysis (LDA) problem, which arises naturally in many scenarios. We also developed an efficient algorithm and derived the non-asymptotic results in the high-dimensional setting.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>    In the last chapter, we studied how two data modalities associate and interact with each other given a third modality, which is a crucial problem in multimodal integrative analysis but has no available statistical solution. We formulated this problem as a tensor decomposition problem and proposed a novel generalized liquid association analysis (GLAA) method. A high-order orthogonal iteration algorithm is provided accordingly. Furthermore, we established the non-asymptotic results for the proposed estimators.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Strongly correlated insulators (SCIs) are proposed as a promising material for photovoltaics because the strongly correlated \textit{d} electrons can facilitate the creation of multiple electron-hole pairs per incoming photon through a process called \textit{impact ionization}, which would lead to increased device efficiency. The material of interest in this document LaVO$_3$ is among the SCIs that are shown to have a fast impact ionization rate with a narrow bandgap. In this dissertation, we report the growth of off-stoichiometric LaVO$_3$ thin films using pulsed laser deposition, and the characterizations that are to study how deviating La:V stoichiometries affect the electronic properties of LVO thin films. We find that the off-stoichiometry clearly alters the physical properties of the films. Structural characterization shows that both La-rich and V-rich films have different levels of structural distortion, with La-rich (V-rich) films showing a larger (smaller) out-of-plane lattice parameter compared to what one would expect from epitaxial strain effects alone. Both types of films show deviation from the behavior of bulk LVO in optical measurement, i.e., they do not show signatures of the expected long-range orbital order, which can be a result of the structural distortions or the presence of structural domains. In transport measurements, La-rich films display clear signatures of electronic phase separation accompanying a temperature-induced metal-insulator transition, while V-rich films behave as Mott insulators. The out-of-plane lattice parameter plays a crucial role in determining the transport properties, as the crossover from Mott-insulating to disorder-induced phase-separated behavior occurs around a lattice parameter value of 3.96~\AA, quite different from what has been previously reported. This dissertation also includes the study on strongly correlated metal SrVO$_3$, which is planned to work as electrodes in the prototype photovoltaics. We successfully grow SrVO$_3$ thin films at different thicknesses. We find it maintains good conductivity at a thickness of 15 nm. These studies have laid the foundation for future research on designing heterostructures of strongly correlated oxides for photovoltaics.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This thesis is mainly focus on the 3D topological semimetal and 2D materials. If you ask a physicist to name the most significant discovery in solid-state physics over the recent 50 years, and highly likely, if not high-temperature superconductivity, will be topological materials or 2D materials. The study of them has profoundly impacted our understanding of the solid-state system, as recognized by four Nobel prizes.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter 1 is a brief introduction of topological semimetal and 2D materials.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter 2 focuses on a quantum oscillatory study on the Dirac type-II semimetallic candidates PdTe2 and PtTe2. In high-quality single crystals of both compounds, i.e. displaying carrier mobilities between 10^3 and 10^4 cm2/Vs, we observed a large non-saturating magnetoresistivity (MR) which in PtTe2 at a temperature T = 1.3 K, leads to an increase in the resistivity up to 5*10^4% under a magnetic field μ0H = 62 T. These high mobilities correlate with their light effective masses in the range of 0.04 to 1 bare electron mass according to our measurements. For PdTe2 the experimentally determined Fermi surface cross-sectional areas show an excellent agreement with those resulting from band-structure calculations. Surprisingly, this is not the case for PtTe2 whose agreement between calculations and experiments is relatively poor even when electronic correlations are included in the calculations. Therefore, our study provides a strong support for the existence of a Dirac type-II node in PdTe2 and probably also for PtTe2. Band structure calculations indicate that the topologically non-trivial bands of PtTe2 do not cross the Fermi-level (εF). In contrast, for PdTe2 the Dirac type-II cone does intersect εF , although our calculations also indicate that the associated cyclotron orbit on the Fermi surface is located in a distinct kz plane with respect to the one of the Dirac type-II node. Therefore it should yield a trivial Berry-phase.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter 3 presents a study on the Fermi-surface of the Dirac type-II semi-metallic candidate NiTe2. In contrast to its isostructural compounds like PtSe2, band structure calculations predict NiTe2 to display a tilted Dirac node very close to its Fermi level that is located along the Γ to A high symmetry direction within its first Brillouin zone (FBZ). The angular dependence of the dHvA frequencies is found to be in agreement with the first-principle calculations when the electronicbands are slightly shifted with respect to the Fermi level (εF ), and therefore provide support for the existence of a Dirac type-II node in NiTe2. Nevertheless, we observed mild disagreements between experimental observations and density Functional theory calculations as, for example, nearly isotropic and light experimental effective masses. This indicates that the dispersion of the bands is not well captured by DFT. Despite the coexistence of Dirac-like fermions with topologically trivial carriers, samples of the highest quality display an anomalous and large, either linear or sublinear magnetoresistivity. This suggests that Lorentz invariance breaking Dirac-like quasiparticles dominate the carrier transport in this compound.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter 4 describes a study on a 2D superconductor. The superconducting α-phase thin molybdenum carbide flakes were first synthesized, and a subsequent sulfurization treatment induced the formation of vertical heterolayer systems consisting of different phases of molybdenum carbide— ranging from α to γ′ and γ phases—in conjunction with molybdenum sulfide layers. These transition-metal carbide/disulfide heterostructures exhibited critical superconducting temperatures as high as 6 K, higher than that of the starting single-phased α-Mo2C (4 K). We analyzed possible interface configurations to explain the observed moire patterns resulting from the vertical heterostacks. Our density-functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that epitaxial strain and moire patterns lead to a higher interfacial density of states, which favors superconductivity. Suchengineered heterostructures might allow the coupling of superconductivity to the topologically nontrivial surface states featured by transition-metal carbide phases composing these heterostructures potentially leading to unconventional superconductivity. Moreover, we envisage that our approach could also be generalized to other metal carbide and nitride systems that could exhibit high-temperature superconductivity.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In chapter 5, We introduce a new moire system: InSe/GaSe hetero-structure. To date, the moire physics has been constrained mainly by two factors i) the dimensionality, defined by the stacking of monolayers, and ii) the twist angle ϕ which unveils novel phases only at quite precise values (e.g. superconductivity, orbital magnetism, correlated insulator states). Here, we overcome these practical limitations through a new class of heterostructures composed of strongly coupled layers of γ-InSe on ϵ-GaSe revealing compelling evidence for the moire potential even in thick stacked layers and at arbitrary values of ϕ. We detect a pronounced interlayer exciton (Xi) of very small radius according to the Stark effect, that is composed of several superimposed emissions uniformly spaced in energy ΔE displaying a pronounced ϕ-dependence. In the interfacial area, similar behavior is also shown by the intralayer exciton of GaSe (X0(Ga)). The strong correlation between ϕ and δEimplies localization of excitations at the moire potential minima. In contrast to transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), the moire potential modulates the multi-component Xi over the entire range of ϕ due to their direct band-gap at the center of the Brillouin zone. Therefore, γ-InSe/ϵ-GaSe interfaces offer an unprecedented level of moire exciton tunability not yet achieved in other vans der Waals heterostructures. Our results unveil clear pathways for quantum optoelectronics while offering opportunities to study electronic correlations over a broad range of moire periodicities and layer thicknesses.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this thesis we develop a few algorithms that are useful for factoring linear recurrence operators. We approach the factorization problem from three directions.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>First, considering reduction modulo a prime leads to the study of recurrence operators in positive characteristic in Chapter 3, where we prove an unexpected relation between the singularities and the $p$-curvature. The result suggests desingularization accelerates the algorithm for computing the characteristic polynomial of the $p$-curvature. Useful information about factorization of a recurrence operator can be obtained by factoring the characteristic polynomial of its $p$-curvature. In particular, the irreducibility of the characteristic polynomial implies that of the operator.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The second strategy is to imitate the Beke-Bronstein algorithm for factoring differential operators. This requires solving recurrence systems for hypergeometric solutions, which can be done by a generalization of Petkovšek's algorithm. We work out the details in Chapter 4 and add several improvements, such as minimizing the number of candidates that the algorithm needs to consider.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Third, we consider solutions of recurrence operators. Some solutions of an operator are also solutions of a proper factor but most are not, even when the operator is reducible. We present an heuristic algorithm for constructing certain sequence solutions that likely lead to non-trivial factors in Chapter 5. This method raises the question of how to find the operator with the minimal order that a solution satisfies, which is solved in Chapter 6 by bounding degrees of factors.</DISS_para>
