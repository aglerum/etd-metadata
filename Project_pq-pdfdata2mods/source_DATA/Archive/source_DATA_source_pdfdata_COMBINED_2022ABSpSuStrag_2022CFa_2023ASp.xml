         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Florida is more at risk of sea level rise (SLR) and climate change compared with any other state in the United States. Due to its heavily populated coastal districts, moderately sloping low-lying geography, and strategic economic significance, Miami-Dade County, located in the southeast of Florida, is especially susceptible to SLR and climate change. Miami, which is the county's main metropolis, is frequently listed as one of the most susceptible and prone cities in the world to marine and groundwater flooding. Biscayne aquifer, the extremely pervious and porous (mostly limestone), is overlaid by Miami-Dade County which serves as the principal supply of drinkable water in the area. Thus, it is vital to evaluate the potential impacts of climate change and SLR on the aquifer. This work aimed to assess the response of the Biscayne aquifer to climate change and SLR. An existing coupled groundwater and surface water model has been used for this purpose. The model was built utilizing current hydraulic and hydrogeological data as well as an estimate of where the freshwater and seawater interface is located. The model is based on the MODFLOW-NWT. The projected rainfall values derived from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 (CMIP6) and SLR values from the literature were introduced in the model. The model does not have a user interface and this python programming and geographical information system (GIS) tools were utilized to process and present the input and output data. 
The findings reveal the impacts of climate change and SLR are marine and groundwater flooding and saltwater intrusion. The seawater will flood about 1241 km2 of coastal areas nearly 42 percent of onshore areas in 2069 under worst scenario due to SLR combined with low topography. Due to the high-water table brought on by SLR, roughly 2082 km2 the area is also vulnerable to groundwater floods. Although it is anticipated that water consumption would rise due to population expansion, saltwater intrusion limits the amount of freshwater that is available, making it unpredictable when households will have access to water. Therefore, while developing policies and plans for the county, policymakers and planners must consider the dangers brought on by SLR and climate change.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Inclusion in the schools has been mandated since the passing of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act in 1975 (EAHCA ; Public Law 94-142). Within the field of music education, historical events like the Tanglewood Symposium of 1967, the Goals and Objectives (GO) Project of 1969, and the Housewright Symposium of 1999 aimed to achieve the best and most equitable music education for all students (Madsen, 2000). Yet, for decades, music teachers have felt underprepared to teach students with disabilities (Cooper, 1999; Darrow, 1999; McCord &amp; Watts, 2010; Salvador, 2010; VanWeelden &amp; Whipple, 2014a). Researchers have examined music teachers’ perceptions of their preparation for teaching learners with disabilities (Davila, 2013; Gilbert &amp; Asmus, 1981; Hammel, 2001a), university curricula for special education coursework (Colwell &amp; Thompson, 2000; Culp &amp; Salvador, 2021; Salvador, 2010), and pre-service fieldwork experiences in inclusive settings (Bartolome, 2017; Smith &amp; Wilson, 1999; VanWeelden &amp; Whipple, 2005a). Elementary music teachers have felt especially challenged to meet the diverse needs of their students (Allan, 2020a; Grimsby, 2020a; Hammel, 2001a).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The primary purpose of this study was to examine elementary music teachers' perceptions of their preparation to teach students with disabilities. Its secondary purpose was to examine elementary music teachers' perceptions of their preparation so to reduce the three inclusion barriers – organizational, knowledge, and attitudinal – as defined by Adamek and Darrow (2018) when teaching students with disabilities. Data were collected through a researcher-created, web-based survey, which had four sections: (a) Organizational Strategies; (b) Disability, Legislative, and Interprofessional Knowledge; (c) Attitudes Towards Teaching Students with Disabilities; and (d) Open-Ended Questions. The first three sections of the survey aligned with the three inclusion barriers (Adamek &amp; Darrow, 2018). For the first two sections of the survey, participants indicated their perceptions of their preparation for organizational strategies and inclusion knowledge. In the third section, participants rated attitude statements; and in the fourth section, participants responded to short-answer questions in their own words. Participants (N = 87) were members of NAfME who indicated “elementary” as a teaching area and were from all six NAfME regions of the United States. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and a Friedman test, and qualitative data were examined through a coding process.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Results of this study suggested that music teachers need music content-specific preparation to teach students with disabilities and that a lack of training might be negatively affecting teachers’ attitudes towards teaching students with special needs. Most participants received their training outside of college through professional development opportunities, and most of the preparation at the undergraduate level was outside of the music department. Participants’ ratings of specific organizational strategies and inclusion knowledge revealed areas that might need further attention in music teacher preparation programs. Ratings of attitude statements showed music teachers’ desire and willingness to create the best opportunities for students with disabilities, but that they lacked preparation to do so. An analysis of participants’ open-ended comments supported quantitative results and prior literature findings. Implications and suggestions for future research are discussed.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Individuals form global attitudes toward their romantic partners that can have important implications for their subsequent relationship processes and outcomes. However, individuals likely hold other attitudes toward their partners’ specific qualities and characteristics (e.g., their weight, their race) that may interact with their global partner attitudes to predict relationship processes like partner-directed behaviors. I first examined this possibility in one dyadic study of newlywed couples, focusing on one partner quality toward which individuals tend to hold negative attitudes: obesity. When individuals had heavier partners and held relatively negative global attitudes toward their partners, more negative attitudes toward obesity were associated with more negative partner-directed behaviors. However, when individuals had heavier partners but held relatively positive global attitudes toward their partners, these positive global partner attitudes buffered against any deleterious effects of negative obesity attitudes on partner-directed behaviors. In a second study, I examined whether such effects extended to another partner quality: race. Contrary to predictions, participants’ global partner attitudes, attitudes toward Black people, and their partner’s race did not interact to predict partner-directed behaviors. Implications and future directions are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Owing to the onset of applications of technological devices in our everyday life, lanthanide elements are becoming continuously important. Traditionally known as rare earth metals, lanthanides (Ln) are categorized as critical materials by the technological companies. Their broad utilizations comprise catalysis, permanent magnetics, phosphorus, etc. Ln help creating clean energy by being employed in electric vehicles and technological devices like smartphones. The massive usages of Ln in industry, however, could have a drastic impact on the sustainable use of these elements. Thus, one needs to address this issue by studying the lanthanide separation where we can recover them and provide more resources for their re-use. This viral use of employment of lanthanides in high-tech economies and the limited understanding of their coordination environment will present new opportunities for lanthanide recycling from waste separation techniques. Historically, trivalent lanthanides were thought to be the only accessible oxidation state of these element, however, after successful synthesis of the divalent species nearly a decade ago, they start to attract lanthanide chemists. Becoming a new emerging subfield of lanthanides, divalent lanthanides (Ln2+) are still lacking many experimental and theoretical aspects of which thermodynamics properties are very important and make the experimental studies challenging since Ln2+ are very unstable species. This complexity introduces new opportunities to engage theoretical studies to uncover the complex behavior of these newlygrowing subfield of Ln. Chapter 1 will provide background information on the lanthanides, as well as their importance, applications, and the need for recycling them. Information regarding the need and challenges for theoretical studies of these elements is discussed. Chapter 2 builds a theoretical foundation for studying the divalent lanthanides theoretically. Given
the dynamics aspects of Ln2+ are of important and interest, potentials were developed for AMOEBA force field which is necessary to use in molecular dynamics (MD) simulation for solving Newton’s equation of motion. Since water is of great importance from many aspects, hydration of the two most stable Ln2+, Sm2+ and Eu2+, as well as their coordination
environment and phenomena affecting the coordination like water exchange mechanism is studied and analyzed in depth. Details about the coordination environment of high concentration of Sm/EuCl2 salts are provided, too. After paving the path for theoretical studies of Ln2+, chapter 3 lays the ground for studying the complexation of several Ln2+, Sm2+, Eu2+, Dy2+ and Yb2+, and one divalent actinide, Cf2+ and their halide (Cl−, Br−, I−) salts with dicyclohexano-18-crown-6 (DCH18C6) in two different solvents, tetrahydrofurane (THF) and acetonitrile. DCH18C6 is a promising crown ether that is used in an industrial scale in lanthanide separation. This crown ether has five common diastereoisomers of which cis−syn−cis, cis−anti−cis are the best complexants. Being able to form a bowl shape, the trans − anti − trans is also added to our study to observe if encapsulating the cations would lead to a better complexation compare with the mentioned diastereoisomers. It is worth mentioning that the latter diastereoisomer is not well studied like the other two. As such, the first step is to parameterize the mentioned new cations plus THF and DCH18C6 for AMOEBA force field. In the next step, MD simulations were carried to see the conformational changes of all diastereoisomers in the solvents. In addition, the Ln trend for both acids and bases were studied with Dy, Yb and Cf. Following the MD simulation, to gain better insight into the selectivity of these diastereosiomers, binding free energy calculations were performed with Bennet’s acceptance ratio (BAR) method for SmBr2 systems in the absence of experimental values. Chapter 4 demonstrates the complexation of Sm2+ and Eu2+ and their halide (Cl−, Br−, I−) salts with a larger crown ether, dibenzo-30-crown-10 (DB30C10). This crown ether shows larger conformational fluctuation because of having a larger polyether ring. As such, conformational analysis from both energy and structure
points of view has been done. Moreover, for comparing the complexation of this crown ether with the one mentioned in chapter 3, binding free energy of SmBr2 is calculated and reported without a direct comparison with experimental value. Finally, chapter 5 will provide the concluding remarks by comparing the obtained results.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Selective crystallization offers new opportunities for separating lanthanide elements, which have considerable importance in advanced materials. The first part is the second and third chapters, which investigated that the coordination chemistry and selective crystallization of Ln3+ cations with the water-soluble ligand, 5-(pyrimidyl)tetrazolate (pmtz−), dtp2− (H2dpt = 2,3-di-1H-tetrazol-5-ylpyrazine) and H2ibt− (H3ibt = 4,5-bis(tetrazole-5-yl)imidazole). In the second chapter, the wide range of coordination modes of pmtz allows for discrimination between Ln3+ cations, and five distinct compound types can be prepared that are dependent on the lanthanide employed, [La(pmtz)2(H2O)6]Cl (S1), [Ln(pmtz)3(H2O)3]·(3+n)H2O (Ce3+and Pr3+, S2). [(Ce(pmtz)2(H2O)3)2(μ-pmtz)]∙11H2O (S3), [(Ln(pmtz)2(H2O)3)2(μ-pmtz)]2(pmtz)2∙14H2O (Nd3+ and Sm3+, S4) and [Ln(H2O)8](pmtz)3·3H2O (Dy3+ to Lu3+, S5). This selective crystallization of Ln3+ cations based primarily on ionic radii provides a simple method for achieving group separations. The third chapter describes a series of lanthanides with two water-soluble tetrazolate-based ligands, dtp2− and H2ibt−. These ligands allow the separation of Nd3+ and Dy3+ through selective crystallization. The reactions of Ln3+ with the ligand Na2(dtp)·2H2O lead to two distinct phases, Na[Ln(dtp)(H2O)8](dtp)∙H2O (Lndtp1, Ln = La−Pr) and [Ln(H2O)8](Hdtp)(dtp)∙H2O (Lndtp2, Ln = Nd, Sm−Lu). Three structure types [Ln(H2ibt)2(H2O)6](H2ibt)·3(H2O) (Lnibt1, Ln = La, Ce), [Ln(H2ibt)((H2O)7](H2ibt)2·4(H2O) (Lnibt2, Ln = Pr, Nd), and [Ln(Hibt)(H2ibt)(H2O)4]·4+x(H2O) (Lnibt3, Ln = Sm−Lu) are obtained from reacting Ln3+ and Na(H2ibt)·3(H2O). Changing the pyrazine core in H2dtp to imidazole in H3ibt leads to different phases for Nd (Lnibt2) and Dy (Lnibt3), which allows for a crystallization-based separation of Nd/Dy in a short separation time.The second part is fourth, fifth, seventh chapters, which focus on the coordination of tetrazolate ligands with plutonium, reporting that the salt metathesis reaction of 5-(Pyrimidyl)Tetrazolate (pmtz‒), 2,3-di-1H-tetrazolate-5-ylpyrazine (dtp2‒), 5-(2-Pyridyl)-tetrazolate (pdtz‒) and 1,3-di(tetrazolate-5-yl)benzene (m-dtb2‒) with hydrated 239PuBr3 in an aqueous solution gives the mononuclear compound [239Pu(pmtz)3(H2O)3]·(3+n)H2O (n = ~8), dinuclear compound, [(Pu(pmtz)2(H2O)3)2(μ-pmtz)]2(pmtz)2∙14H2O,
xxvi
[239Pu(pdtz)3(H2O)3]·3.5(H2O), [Pu(m-dtbH)(H2O)8](m-dtb)·11(H2O) and [Pu(H2O)9](m-dtbH)3·9(H2O). All these plutonium compounds were synthesized and characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, in addition to solid-phase and solution UV–vis–NIR absorption spectroscopy. The comparisons between these compounds and their lanthanide isostructural complexes demonstrate the bonding differences between lanthanide and actinide ions of identical ionic radii. The Laporte-forbidden 5f → 5f transitions are assigned in the UV-VIS-NIR spectra for these f-element-tetrazolate coordination compounds.
The sixth chapter is about the synthesis and characterization of Am1, [Am(pdtz)3(H2O)3]·3.5(H2O) through single-crystal X-ray diffraction, solid-phase, solution UV–vis–NIR absorption spectroscopy and pressure study. The comparisons between Am1 and its lanthanide isostructural complexes demonstrate the bonding differences between lanthanide and actinide ions of identical ionic radii. The Laporte-forbidden 5f → 5f transitions are assigned in the UV-VIS-NIR spectra for Am1. Also, with the increasing of the pressure, the broad, split and blue shift of these transition from 8S7/2 are observed. The seventh chapter concludes the dissertation.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Declines in iron status are frequently reported in those who regularly engage in strenuous physical activity. A proposed reason is increases in the iron regulatory hormone hepcidin, which functions to inhibit dietary iron absorption and can be induced by the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6. Prolonged physical activity results in an inflammatory response, and circulating hepcidin is consistently shown to increase with physical activity &gt;60 min in duration, typically peaking 3-6 h following completion of exercise. Thus, physically active individuals may experience declines in iron status overtime due to reduced dietary iron absorption. However, current evidence using stable iron isotopes is conflicting on whether dietary iron absorption decreases in the post-exercise state. Furthermore, while inflammatory signaling of hepcidin is the leading hypothesis for post-exercise increases in hepcidin, evidence suggests that gluconeogenic signals in response to low energy availability may also contribute. In Chapter 1, the literature is reviewed on hepcidin’s regulation of systemic iron homeostasis and its proposed role in the declines in iron status with physical activity, with a particular emphasis on the mechanisms that induce hepcidin. Chapter 2 details a published study that sought to determine the effects of a prolonged bout of running on hepcidin and dietary iron absorption, compared to rest, in trained collegiate cross country runners. Following the run, circulating hepcidin increased and dietary iron absorption decreased compared to the rest condition, however, evidence for inflammatory signaling of hepcidin was not convincing. These findings provided rationale for the study in Chapter 3, which aimed to investigate the contribution of REDD1, a known target of IL-6 and gluconeogenic hormone signals, on the responses of hepcidin and its regulators following prolonged treadmill running. Liver mRNA expression of hepcidin and its regulators were measured in REDD1 knockout and wildtype mice after rest or 1, 3, or 6 h recovery from 60 min treadmill running. Both treadmill running and REDD1 knockout increased expression of hepcidin, gluconeogenic regulators of hepcidin, and markers of gluconeogenesis. Moreover, hepcidin was correlated with gluconeogenic regulators of hepcidin and markers of gluconeogenesis, indicating a possible role of gluconeogenic signaling of hepcidin following prolonged physical activity. Findings presented in this dissertation indicate that post-exercise increases in hepcidin may lead to declines in iron status due to decreased dietary iron absorption following exercise. Second, post-exercise hepcidin may be influenced by gluconeogenic signaling in the post-exercise state, which potentially informs dietary strategies to mitigate the post-exercise hepcidin response and prevent declines in iron status with frequent physical activity.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Chromatin profiling in single cells has been extremely challenging and almost exclusively limited to histone proteins. In cases where single cell methods have shown promise, many require highly specialized equipment or cell type specific protocols and are relatively low throughput. Here, we combine the advantages of tagmentation, linear amplification and combinatorial indexing to produce a high throughput single cell DNA binding site mapping method that is simple, inexpensive, and capable of multiplexing several independent samples per experiment. Targeted Insertion of Promoters (TIP-seq) uses Tn5 fused to protein A to insert a T7 RNA polymerase promoter adjacent to a chromatin-bound protein of interest. Linear amplification of flanking DNA with T7 polymerase provides much higher starting material prior to sequencing library preparation and yields &gt;10-fold higher unique reads per single cell compared to other methods. We apply TIP-seq to map histone modifications, RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) and transcription factor CTCF binding sites in single human and mouse cells, and demonstrate proof-of-principle for haplotype-phased protein-DNA interaction mapping. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Individuals with posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) have been shown to use a variety of safety behaviors to manage their distress. When used in the absence of true threat, safety behaviors serve to maintain PTSS by preventing the individual from collecting disconfirming evidence about the dangerousness of the situation. Thus, individuals with PTSS may benefit from eliminating their maladaptive safety behavior use. The current study aimed to develop and evaluate a brief, computer-based safety behavior reduction intervention, Safety Behavior Elimination for Traumatic Stress (SBETS). Seventy-four participants were recruited based on lifetime trauma exposure and elevated PTSS. Participants were randomly assigned to the SBETS condition or a physical health control condition (Modifiable Behavior Intervention [MoBI]). At the end of the intervention, participants selected two behaviors to reduce or eliminate over the coming month. Participants were sent reminders to reduce those behaviors twice a week, and treatment outcomes were assessed at two-week and one-month follow-up. Hierarchical linear regressions demonstrated significantly greater reductions in safety behavior use at two-week follow-up in the SBETS condition, as compared to MoBI. Further, individuals in the SBETS condition demonstrated significantly greater reductions in PTSS at one-month follow-up. Additionally, change in two-week safety behavior use fully mediated the relationship between treatment condition and one-month PTSS. The current study was limited by its relatively homogenous sample and brief follow-up period. Despite its limitations, results suggest that SBETS has a significant effect on safety behavior usage and PTSS, and may represent an acceptable, accessible treatment option for future trauma survivors. Additional research is needed to establish the efficacy of the SBETS intervention among diverse trauma-exposed populations.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Women have historically been underrepresented in the field of trumpet, including as performers, trumpet pedagogues, and composers. For many collegiate trumpet studios, standard repertoire includes works predominantly written by men. This canon is self-perpetuating, as it is easy to obtain music from the standard repertoire and it is natural to perform and assign repertoire for study that is familiar. There are many works by women that can positively supplement existing repertoire taught in the collegiate trumpet studio setting and can contribute to a balance of standard and newer works. This treatise investigates the pedagogical value and uses of eight 21st-century works for solo trumpet by women: “Fantasia” by Lauren Bernofsky, “Sonata for Trumpet and Piano” by Elaine Fine, “Trumpet Songs” by Jennifer Higdon, “Framed” by Cecilia McDowall, “Golden Hour” by Cait Nishimura, “Kupala Night” by Elizabeth Raum, “Stories for Our Time” by Faye-Ellen Silverman, and “Nostalgia” by Barbara York. While there are countless valuable works composed by women to be studied, the works selected for this document are meant to represent a varied group of styles, difficulty levels, and potential pedagogical uses. Biographical background is given for each composer accompanied by a pedagogical discussion of their work and basic programming information, including challenges regarding flexibility, range, endurance, technique, articulation, musicality, coordination with accompaniment, and potential use of each work in a collegiate trumpet studio setting. Advice on addressing pedagogical challenges and suggestions of books, etudes, and exercises that can assist with preparation of these works are provided.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Environmentally conscious science education is of great importance due to dramatic anthropogenic effects on the environment.  The World Health Organization reports 25% of children deaths, ages five and under, are the direct result of pollution (Osseiran &amp; Chirscaden, 2017). Anthropogenic climate change has resulted in the higher severity and frequency of storms.  The damage from Hurricane Michael caused $8+ billion in damages to Florida excluding flood damage (Associated Press, 2018).  Despite overwhelming scientific consensus, anthropogenic environmental issues, especially global climate change, the topic is still politically debated (Oreskes, 2004).  The National Science Teachers’ Association released a study, in which they find science teachers feel uncomfortable teaching politically contentious material without a scientist present (NSTA, 2017). Melillo, Richmond, and Yohe (2014) report that “because environmental, cultural, and socioeconomic systems are tightly coupled, climate change impacts can either be amplified or reduced by cultural and socioeconomic decisions” (p.5).  UNESCO’s Global Education Monitoring Report states “increased educational attainment helps transform lives by reducing poverty, improving health outcomes, advancing technology and increasing social cohesion. It can also enable individuals to better cope with, and reduce their vulnerability to, the dangers associated with climate change” (UNESCO, 2016, p.10).  There have been a few case studies which support these assertions.  Schools have been able to make substantial environmental changes through collective community engagement (Howley et al., 2011; McNeal et al., 2017; Schelly et al., 2012). While these case studies represent the limited research regarding environmental science teachers, there is little to no research on EPD and how teachers choose to expand their environmental science knowledge.  McNeal et al., interviewed middle school science teachers who actively taught issues surrounding anthropogenic environmental issues – most often anthropogenic global climate change (2017). In this study, McNeal et al. found that teachers were most influenced by direct experiences with environmental issues.  This study will focus on teachers who have actively chosen environmental professional development (EPD) programs, in an attempt to ascertain more in-depth information about the reasons teachers have to take EPD and if/how it changes classroom instruction.

            <DISS_para>The purpose of this paper was to examine the relationship between childhood maltreatment, dysfunctional career thinking (DCT), and career adaptability. The primary goal of this paper was to explore the potential overlap between the long-term impact of childhood maltreatment and the potential link to an individual’s dysfunctional career thinking and career adaptability. The present study explored the relationship between childhood maltreatment using the Maltreatment and Abuse Chronology of Exposure (MACE; Teicher &amp; Parigger, 2015), dysfunctional career thinking using the Career Thoughts Inventory (CTI; Sampson et al., 1996a), and career adaptability using the Career Adapt-Abilities Scale (Savickas &amp; Pofeli, 2012). </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The aim of this work is to understand the relation between pulse parameters, plasma characteristics and chemical synthesis/degradation of organic and inorganic compounds. Plasma properties include electron density and electron temperature. Electron density varying in a single pulse was calculated using the Stark broadening of H-Balmer series lines i.e., H_α and H_β. Electron temperature was calculated using the line intensity ratio method. PFOA was used as an example to understand the relationship between plasma characteristics and chemical degradation of organic compounds. Two nanosecond pulsed power supplies with varying frequency between 1-100kHz and pulse width between 40-200ns were used to study the degradation of PFOA to form F-. Degradation of PFOA was directly correlated to the peak electron density. Also, in this work NO was used as OH scavenger to understand oxidative pathways in our continuous gas-liquid flow film reactor. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Anxiety among teachers is an important area to study because of the potential for anxious teachers to pass their anxiety to some of their students. From a growing body of research, we see that both preservice and practicing elementary school teachers can also experience anxiety when teaching math. Given that elementary school teachers often teach all school subjects, it is possible that this anxiety about teaching is not distinct for math but could also be experienced when teaching other subjects as well, especially when teachers are early in their careers. From the current literature, we also see that these levels of anxiety, whether about math or about teaching, can vary depending on the grade level the teacher is teaching as well as how long a teacher has been teaching. Using a sample of 296 kindergarten through third-grade teachers, we examine if teachers’ general math anxiety and anxiety about teaching math differ depending on the grade level they teach and the length of time they have been teaching, and whether teachers’ anxiety about teaching varies by school subject, the grade level they teach, or by the length of time they have been teaching. We found that teachers of earlier grades had more general math anxiety than teachers of upper grades. We also found that the 281 teachers who taught multiple subjects not only experience anxiety when teaching math, but also when teaching other subjects as well, especially at the upper grades. For these teachers, gaining teaching experience was associated with decreases in anxiety when teaching different school subjects. These findings provide evidence for future studies examining anxiety experienced by elementary school teachers who not only teach math, but who teach other subjects as well.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This paper addresses the role of tuition on retention rates for full-time students across in 2 and 4-year public institutions in the United States.  Multiple regression on tuition variables was performed by using institutional data on demographic, pre-college characteristics, and institutional characteristics as controls.  The results show that an increase in tuition for low-income students reduces retention rates for 2- and 4-year public institutions.  Additionally, an increase in institution profits off full-time students’ credit hours decreases retention rates at 2-year public institutes.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation examines market-based shifts in moral reasoning within nineteenth-century England’s lucifer matchstick industry. Lucifers were the first widely-produced friction matches, able to be struck on any surface thanks to a compound including elemental (also called white or yellow) phosphorus on the matchstick head. Unfortunately, it was recognized very early in the industry’s life that workers exposed to white phosphorus were at risk of developing a gruesome jaw disease. Osteonecrosis of the jaw, colloquially referred to as “phossy jaw”, caused gum soreness, tooth loss, bone deterioration, and, in the most serious cases, death. As I argue, over the history of lucifer manufacture, the moral dilemma of industrial disease came to be addressed as a market problem that required a market solution. By focusing on primary sources and moral responses in the early lucifer industry, this dissertation traces the development of a market-based moral response to phossy jaw. I argue that the moral solutions to the dilemmas of the matchstick industry preserved a host of harmful arrangements while casting them in the optimistic light of progress towards a just market. In short, the market could not solve the problems that the market was causing.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In order to clarify this dynamic, I build on Karl Polanyi’s theory of the double movement of marketization and protectionism that came to be characteristic of market society. Over the course of the nineteenth century, the move to treat “the market” as something separate from society that also ought to arrange society, had deleterious effects on the social bonds between human beings. The requirement to work for a wage and the imperative to produce commodities to sell at profit required that human activity and nature be treated as commodities. On a large scale, this resulted in harm to people and the environment, but this harm was addressed through social, political, and legal forms of protectionism that addressed the damage while preserving the market imperatives that caused it. On a smaller scale, phossy jaw and the lucifer industry provide a case study in the ways that this grand movement impacted the daily lives of children, women, and men who produced matchsticks.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>After the introduction, the next two chapters tell the history of two constants in the industry: the production of phosphorus-tipped matchsticks and phossy jaw. Chapter Two is the history of phosphorus production from its discovery to its application in matchstick manufacture. Chapter Three, “A Grinning Death’s Head”, analyzes several early medical reports of the disease itself and contains graphic accounts of the disease and its clear link to lucifer production. Chapters Four and Five illustrate the ways that responses to the industry’s dilemmas preserved the production of a harmful commodity while casting its preservation as a moral good using the emerging categories of the logic of the market. Chapter Four uses Henry Mayhew’s London Labour and the London Poor to illustrate the wide-ranging reach of the industry, from factory laborers to street laborers. Mayhew’s work witnesses to the ways that, in Polanyian terminology, the social was being subsumed to the demands of the market. Mayhew illustrates the interconnectedness of society even while categorizing human activity in market terms, thereby reproducing the conditions necessary for society to become arranged to primarily support commodity production. Chapter Five examines the ways that a factory commissioner’s report in the early 1860s provides the moral framework to justify the continued production of lucifers. The report does so by changing every aspect of the industry except the commodity itself. The conclusion illustrates the ways that these approaches solved the problem of phossy jaw without ever solving the problem of phossy jaw and, more broadly, the way that market-based solutions failed to solve market-induced moral dilemmas.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>School librarians are specialized educators who lead technology initiatives and who adjust their programs annually to local and national trends.  The profession’s changing nature requires perpetual learning unmatched in other educator positions.  In this survey study, school librarians reported their perceptions of professional learning in Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, and LinkedIn using a quantitative questionnaire.  In addition, participants described their perceptions through comments.  The study sought answers to three research questions: 1) how do school librarians perceive user roles, activities, motives and barriers in different platforms used for professional learning, 2) how do results compare among platforms, and 3) how do results divided into user roles align across platforms.  This multi-factor research captured four-facets of professional learning in one study, creating platform and user role profiles.  Most participants used multiple platforms for learning, but they used platforms differently.  Twitter and Facebook were the most popular platforms, followed by Instagram.  Most participants reported few habitual activities, but diverse motives.  Barriers were limited.  The Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram profiles indicated rich learning opportunities, whereas the Pinterest and LinkedIn profiles indicated narrow use.  Participants selected user roles based on their learning goals: Community Leader, Contributor, Networker, Active Lurker, and Passerby.  Most participants identified as Active Lurkers.  The user role profiles were more comprehensive than the traditional lurker-poster dichotomy.  The school librarian results affirmed many findings in educator populations, but also suggested differences may exist between the populations.  This exploratory study opens new avenues for population-specific research in how school librarians approach professional learning in a dynamic field.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Cigarette smoke is a known exacerbator of age-related pathologies such as cardiovascular (CV) disease, atherosclerosis, and cellular aging (senescence). However, the role of nicotine and its primary metabolite cotinine in these processes is yet to be elucidated. With the growing number of nicotine-containing aerosol use in recent years, the impact of nicotine on health is a relevant concern. A number of recent studies and health education sites focus on nicotine aerosol-induced adverse lung function, neglecting cardiovascular (CV) impairments and diseases. Critical review of the present scientific literature leads to the hypothesis that nicotine mediates the effects of cigarette smoke in the CV system by increasing mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling and cell migration, inflammation and oxidative stress through NADPH oxidase 1 (Nox1) to induce vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) senescence. Accumulation of senescent VSMCs in the atherosclerotic lesion cap is detrimental as it increases the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis by promoting an unstable plaque phenotype. Thus, nicotine, and most likely its metabolite cotinine, adversely influence atherosclerosis. In addition, changes in gut microbiota are associated with many diseases including CVD; an area not explored in relation to E-liquids. Other harmful compounds in E-cigarette aerosols include flavorings, which have been shown to negatively influence endothelial cells (ECs), however their effect on VSMCs remains to be elucidated. Thus, this dissertation tested the hypothesis that E-cigarette aerosols have similar sex-dependent detrimental effects as cigarette smoke in vascular senescence and atherosclerosis and that menthol exacerbates the effect of nicotine aerosols in the cardiovascular system and alters the gut microbiome in atherosclerotic ApoE-/- mice. The hypothesis was tested through two aims: aim 1 examined the role of sex in the effects of cigarette smoke in vascular senescence and atherosclerosis in vivo in ApoE-/- mice and in VSMCs function in vitro and aim 2 determined the contribution of E-cigarette aerosol components (vehicle, nicotine and menthol) to senescence and atherosclerosis and gut microbiome dysbiosis in ApoE-/- mice. Overall, we found aerosolized nicotine E-liquid exacerbated atherosclerosis and vascular senescence and caused changes in the gut microbiome in a sex-specific manner.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this treatise is to examine the phenomenon of embodied experience in selected solo piano works of five Black composers of the United States and United Kingdom: Shawn Okpebholo, Hannah Kendall, Brian Raphael Nabors, James Lee III, and Eleanor Alberga. I use the term “embodied experience” primarily to consider how their music embodies African American and African identity, memory, and cultural expression. I also use it to describe my perspective as a performer having studied and engaged deeply with these works.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Shawn Okpebholo	ψαλμοὶ καὶ ὕμνοι καὶ ᾠδαὶ πνευματικαί (2012), Amazing 	Grace (2006)
Hannah Kendall	Processional (2018)
Brian Raphael Nabors	Piano Sonata (2016), Nocturne (2022)
James Lee III 	Recuerdos Diaspoìricos (2018)
Eleanor Alberga	Jamaican Medley (1983), Oh Chaconne! (2014)</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The music of these five composers represents a synthesis of their cultural heritages, personal identities, musical backgrounds, values, and creative interests. Their piano works reflect the diversity of music by Black composers writing in the “classical contemporary” idiom. As the titles suggests, these works are shaped by both Western European and non-Western musical traditions, namely from East and West Africa, the United States, Papua New Guinea, the United Kingdom, Guyana, Australia, Cuba, and Jamaica. My treatise seeks to portray a balanced understanding of Black composers writing contemporary classical music and to promote further study of their music. Each chapter begins with biographical information and a summary of the composer’s musical style, followed by an analysis of their respective piano works focusing on style elements and aesthetic aspects as they relate to the idea of embodied experience. Throughout the discussions, I offer ways to approach and engage with this music, as well as my perspectives on ways it expands and enriches the canon. My conclusion chapter invites readers and performers to consider their own embodied experiences, as well as their roles as active participants in “culture care,” as they engage with music and everyday life. It also considers implications this music has for the classical music and future generations of Black musicians and composers.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Improving the accuracy and efficiency of methods has always been the pursuit of scientific computing. In this dissertation, we developed several methods to improve the computational efficiency and accuracy of Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT) and orbital-free density functional theory (OF-DFT). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Random-phase approximation (RPA) correlation functional greatly improved the accuracy of KS-DFT and has gained much attention. For example, RPA correlation energy gives more accurate lattice parameters and atomization energies of solids, producing reasonable phase transition pressure for the $\alpha$-$\gamma$ transition of cerium, and much-improved adsorption energies of CO molecule on various transition metal surfaces. In Chapter 2, we developed a stochastic method, based on the kernel polynomial method (KPM), to calculate the RPA correlation energy. To accelerate the sampling efficiency, we introduced an atom-based correlated sampling (ACS) scheme to accelerate the convergence of the energy-difference calculations of two similar systems. Our method may be applied to calculate the adsorption energies of molecules on transition metal surfaces in the future.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>OF-DFT is a promising tool for large-scale metal simulations. Its accuracy is determined by two factors: (a) the quality of the kinetic energy density functional (KEDF) and (b) the quality of the local pseudopotentials (LPSs). Compared to simple metals, it is challenging to develop reliable KEDFs and LPSs for transitional metals due to the localized d electrons. In Chapter 3, we built high-quality LPSs for both main-group and transition metals by letting the LPSs reproduce the atomic orbital energies and orbitals (beyond certain radii). For the magnetic systems (Fe, Co, and Ni), our LPSs are also required to reproduce the energy difference between the high-spin and non-spin atomic states. Our LPSs were tested against the projector augmented wave (PAW) and the all-electron (AE) results by calculating various phases' lattice constants, bulk moduli, and energies. Our LPSs agree well with the PAW and AE results in most cases. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Lastly, we collaborated with Prof. Biwu Ma’s group at the Florida State University to study the absorption and emission spectra of various binuclear platinum (II) complexes. Linear-response time-dependent density functional theory (LR-TDDFT) was used to explain the photophysical results of these complexes with various Pt-Pt interactions. It was found that strong Pt-Pt interactions lead to pronounced metal-to-ligand charge transfer absorptions in the lowest energy peaks (between 450 nm to 500 nm). </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The Spinozan theory of belief fixation is the result of some remarks made by Baruch Spinoza about the nature of the mind in The Ethics. Modern scientific methods applied to human minds have yielded evidence supporting Spinoza’s insights. In this dissertation, I explore some of the implications of the Spinozan theory of belief fixation. Insights from the Spinozan theory of belief fixation are applied to topics in epistemology, metaethics, meta normativity, and the nature of propaganda. Two appendices appear at the end. The first appendix provides a survey of the evidence supporting the Spinozan theory of belief fixation. The second appendix provides additional support for the claims made in chapter 2. The Spinozan theory of belief fixation is an interesting and provocative account of our cognitive architecture. Those who are interested in the Spinozan theory of belief fixation will find themselves with an embarrassment of riches when considering which of its myriad philosophical implications to explore. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>While rape and sexual violence is a topic that has been well-covered in the areas of Classics and Biblical Studies, there has been relatively little written about this subject that focuses exclusively on late Antique Christianity. Previous work in these fields has been oriented around legal definitions of rape in antiquity, the modern concept of consent, or theological engagement with biblical rape stories. This project uses modern philosophical approaches to sexual violence to analyze the rhetorical function of sexual violence in early Christian literature of primarily the 4th-6th centuries CE in the Latin West. The first two chapters explore how rape threats are used in fictionalized Christian literature, across a variety of genres, to shape expectations for appropriate behavior for Christian women. The threat of sexual violence is a tool deployed by anonymous authors and ecclesiastical and ascetic leaders, such as Ambrose of Milan and Jerome, to keep Christian women, and virgins in particular, in line. Sexual violence was not, however, merely an imaginary horror, but a very real one, too. Chapter three addresses the leap from the imagination to reality, and how ecclesiastical leaders like Augustine of Hippo and Pope Leo I addressed and categorized the raped virgins in their flock. This project offers a study of sexual violence across genres, across time, and across imagination and reality to demonstrate the rhetorical usefulness of sexual violence, both as a threat and as a lived experience, in early Christian literature. Sexual violence, and the threat thereof, helped shape the spiritual hierarchy of early Christian communities and revealed changing attitudes about physical embodiment, purity, and virginity. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation explores the time-dependent equation-of-motion coupled-cluster (TD-EOM-CC)framework for the accurate calculation of the excited electronic states within molecules, with a
focus on lowering the computational cost of the TD-EOM-CC time simulation. Chapter 1 is an
introductory chapter, presenting the mathematical foundation for the methods discussed, descrip-
tions of the treatment of the electronic ground state in Hartree-Fock and coupled-cluster theories,
and discussing the ways in which electronic excited states can be calculated in electronic structure
theory. Chapters 2 and 3 cover ways to reduce the computational cost of a TD-EOM-CC proce-
dure. First, because the choice of integrator has a significant effect on the cost of the simulation,
we study an implementation of the short iterative Lanczos (SIL) scheme as an integrator for TD-
EOM-CC methods and benchmark the cost and accuracy compared to the previously utilized 4th
order Runge-Kutta scheme. We then discuss the use of the core-valence separation (CVS) approx-
imation within the TD-EOM-CC framework for the calculation of core-electron excited states of
molecular systems. Chapter 4 outlines a TD-EOM-CC framework for the calculation of molecular
absorption spectra in the presence of finite external electric fields, and compares the stability of
propagation within a finite field and propagation where the light is treated perturbatively when
complex eigenvalues are present within the eigenspectrum.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>On a global scale, peatlands contain 530 ± 160 Pg carbon, which is equivalent to &gt;50% of the atmospheric pool. The fate of this enormous C reservoir could significantly impact the climate trajectory. Yet, two puzzling phenomena persist regarding C cycling dynamics in Sphagnum-rich peatlands (“bogs”): (1) their extraordinarily slow C mineralization rates; and (2) their high (relative to predicted) CO2:CH4 production ratios. This dissertation investigates three mechanisms thought to contribute to one or both phenomena. It also investigates the effects of temperature on C cycling dynamics within peat bogs and assesses the ability for incubation experiments to predict peatland climate responses. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The first mechanism that we investigated involves interactions between phenolic compounds and enzymes. We hypothesized that these interactions would significantly limit C mineralization rates in bogs given that (1) these interactions cause enzyme immobilization and decreased C mineralization rates; and (2) bogs are postulated to contain an abundance of phenolics. The second mechanism that we investigated, “non-enzymatic browning”, consists of a series of abiotic reactions involving a metabolite of Sphagnum spp. (galacturonic acid). Given its propensity to expel CO2 and limit bio-available nitrogen, we hypothesized that non-enzymatic browning would elevate CO2:CH4 production ratios and suppress overall decomposition rates in peat bogs. The third mechanism that we investigated, “organic matter hydrogenation”, involves the addition of H2 (a biproduct of fermentation) to organic matter. As organic matter hydrogenation has a higher energy yield than methanogenesis (which also uses H2), we hypothesized that this mechanism would elevate bog CO2:CH4 production ratios (via methane inhibition). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Using a combination of incubation experiments and field measurements, we determined that the extraordinarily slow C mineralization rates associated with bogs are influenced by both phenolic-enzyme interactions (mechanism 1)—which inhibited CO2 and CH4 production rates by 62 ± 16% and 54 ± 19, respectively—and non-enzymatic browning (mechanism 2)—which caused changes to the dissolved organic matter pool consistent with bioavailable N sequestration. We determined that non-enzymatic browning could also account for the high (relative to other peatland habitats) CO2:CH4 production ratios frequently observed in bogs—as evidenced by our observation that abiotic bog incubations with minimal hydrolytic enzyme content yielded CO2 production rates equivalent to ~8% of control treatments (bioactive) at 23℃. We demonstrated a positive and significant correlation between inferred indicators of organic matter hydrogenation (mechanism 3; based on analyses of dissolved organic carbon) and CO2:CH4 production ratios. While this finding is consistent with the hypothesis that organic matter hydrogenation elevates CO2:CH4 production ratios in bog peat, further research regarding our methodology is necessary for this hypothesis to be thoroughly assessed. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Using a series of temperature-controlled incubation experiments, we determined that production rates of CO2 and CH4 increase exponentially with temperature across a range of 1-26°C. Combining these results with seven years of field CH4 flux measurements, we assessed the extent to which soil temperature, alongside basic field data (water table position and permafrost depth), could accurately model CH4 emissions. The model produced yearly estimates that were within 5-60% of all measured values, or 5-34% when excluding two outlier years. These findings suggests that (1) three variables currently undergoing significant change—temperature, water table position, and permafrost depth— have a collectively significant effect on methane fluxes; (2) incubations can serve as useful tools for understanding this interplay; and (3) understanding the impact of additional variables (other than temperature, water table position, and permafrost depth) on methane fluxes could lead to improved model performance.   </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The main goal of the present work was to introduce a new conceptual framework for quantifying and classifying the environment by imposing a structure for sequencing contextual influences that echoes the study of genes. According to Bronfenbrenner’s Bioecological Model of Human Development (BMHD), children’s developmental outcomes are the result of an interplay of biological propensities that contribute to children’s individual characteristics and the many layers of environments in which children exist and interact with people and things. I proposed a framework for identifying and measuring context systematically based on the resources that provide the raw materials for proximal processes, the main drivers of development. Specifically, three resource categories were introduced: physical, social and symbolic, and they were defined and described within the context of the developmental outcome of reading achievement. Physical resources capture the tangible and intangible “stuff” that makes up the environment, including the actual physical spaces, structures, and items (i.e., books) that comprise a child’s context, as well as the quiet, space, and time needed for a child to interact with others. Social resources are the people within a child’s contexts, including their parents, siblings, teachers, peers and other social partners, as well as the knowledge, experience, ideals, beliefs, and attitudes of these social partners. Symbolic resources are the meaning and stability with which interactions are imbued, and they are characterized by the existence of routines and norms within a context, as well as a context’s overall climate, or feeling. For instance, the sense of safety and belonging a child feels as well as the qualities and actions that are celebrated and prioritized in an environment are examples of symbolic resources. In order to test this proposed framework for context, a proof-of-concept analysis was conducted using publicly available data from the US Census Bureau to capture the neighborhood environment and state-specific department of education websites, as well as the NCES and CRDC websites to capture the school environment. The study sample comprised 163 students (93 first graders and 70 second graders, Mage = 11.99 years old, SD = 2.22 years, 56% girls) from the National Project for Achievement in Twins, a federally-funded study exploring the development of reading and math skills in twins across the United States. A single twin was randomly chosen from each twin pair, and a total of 28 states were captured in the study sample. Reading was measured using the DIBELS Nonsense Word Fluency subtest. Neighborhood physical resources were captured by census tract-level measures of income, cost of living, household space, having health insurance, and household computer and internet access. Neighborhood social resources were captured by family size, percent couple-headed households, and percentage of coresident grandparents within a census tract. Neighborhood symbolic resources were captured by neighborhood climate, which was comprised of the educational attainment of residents within a census tract, as well as the percentage of residents on public assistance and unemployment, and rurality. School physical resources were captured by school-level average per pupil expenditure, student enrollment, and free or reduced-price lunch eligibility. School social resources were captured by pupil-teacher ratios, teacher quality (i.e., teacher experience, teacher certification) and peer composition and achievement influences at a given school (i.e., percent LEP students, percent LD students, average test score trend and average learning rate). School symbolic resources were captured by school climate, which was measured by student demographic density, the percentage of negative incidences at a school, and average student attendance. The analysis used to test the viability of this proposed framework for context was conditional inference random forest (RF-CI), a non-parametric analysis that allows for the use of different types of variables measured on a variety of scales. In support of the proposed contextual framework, the results of the RF-CI analysis, which explained 30% of the variance in NWF scores, demonstrated that all three resource categories (physical, social, and symbolic) are vital to include in a context-based prediction model of children’s early reading skills. Additionally, in line with the BMHD, the results showed that both proximal environments – neighborhoods and schools – not only play a role in children’s NWF performance separately, but they also work interactively to influence child outcomes. These results align with the idea that each environment is multifaceted and requires a systematic approach like the one presented here in order to make sure all aspects of a given contextual framework are accounted for, rather than zeroing in on only a single resource category. Thus, the proposed theoretical framework for measuring context systematically is recommended for future work exploring the influence of the environment on development. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Background: Aligning energy intake with the biological circadian rhythm and extending periods of fasting within a 24-h cycle improves whole-body metabolism. However, it is unknown if these improvements are related to changes in intestinal nutrient absorption. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of early time-restricted eating (eTRE) on energy and macronutrient digestibility, metabolizable energy, gastrointestinal (GI) function, and cardiometabolic health markers. Furthermore, we sought to determine predictive factors of digestibility. Methods: Healthy adults (n=16, age 31.1 ± 5.2 y, BMI 23.8 ± 3.4 kg/m2) participated in a 9-d randomized, crossover, controlled feeding trial where they followed an eTRE schedule (i.e., all calories consumed between 0800 and 1400) and a control eating schedule (i.e., all calories consumed between 0800 and 2000). After a 3-d acclimation to the study diet and eating schedule, all stool and urine were collected for 3-d. The energy content of the diet, stool, and urine was measured by bomb calorimetry and the results were used to calculate energy and macronutrient digestibility and metabolizable energy. An ingestible capsule was used to measure intestinal transit time and hydrogen gas production. Additional outcomes included resting energy expenditure, thermic effect of food, mean 24 h glucose, glucose variability, fasting and postprandial glucose, insulin, and lipids, and circadian gene expression. To determine the relationship between digestibility and GI function, components of energy expenditure, and cardiometabolic health markers, participants were dichotomized based on median digestibility (91.4%) during the control eating schedule and classified as an absorber (digestibility above median) or excreter (digestibility below median). Multivariable regression was used to assess predictors of energy digestibility. Results: When following a controlled, weight maintenance diet, eTRE had no impact on energy digestibility (eTRE, 91.7 ± 2.3% vs. CON, 91.7 ± 1.5%, P=0.97), metabolizable energy (eTRE, 88.0 ± 1.5% vs. CON, 87.8 ± 2.3%, P=0.71), whole-gut gastrointestinal transit time (eTRE, 23.3 ± 8.6 h vs. CON, 26.1 ± 8.6 h, P=0.32), or hydrogen production when normalized by transit time (eTRE, 4.2 ± 7.6 % H2 vs. CON, 1.4 ± 1.5 % H2, P=0.44) when compared to a control eating schedule, respectively. Compared to the control eating schedule, eTRE decreased 24 h glucose (eTRE, 95.0 ± 18.1 vs. CON, 101.1 ± 18.5 mg/dL; P&lt;0.0001), fasting glucose (eTRE, 87.3 ± 6.4 vs. CON, 93.6 ± 7.3 mg/dL; P=0.01), insulin (eTRE, 10.1 ± 3.9 vs. CON, 13.5 ± 7.4 µIU/mL; P=0.008), HOMA-IR (eTRE, 2.2 ± 0.9 vs. CON, 3.2 ± 1.7 mg/dL; P=0.001), VLDL-C (eTRE, 14.6 ± 6.9 vs. CON, 16 ± 6.1 mg/dL; P=0.03), and triglycerides (eTRE, 73.3 ± 34.1 vs. CON, 80.2± 30.3 mg/dL; P=0.03). eTRE did not affect resting energy expenditure (eTRE, 1484 ± 315 vs. CON, 1480 ± 321 kcals/d; P=0.75), thermic effect of food iAUC0-4h (P=0.59), or postprandial metabolism (iAUC0-4h, all metabolites P&gt;0.20). Lastly, after characterizing participants as an absorber (digestibility above median) or excreter (digestibility below median), absorbers had slower colonic transit time (absorber, 34.0 ± 15.8 h vs. excreter, 17.6 ± 9.5 h, P=0.04), greater glycemic variability (CV%: absorber, 21.9 ± 3.6 vs. excreter, 14.9 ± 3.3; P=0.002), and lower fasting insulin (absorber, 9.9 ± 4.5 vs. excreter, 17.1 ± 8.2 µIU/mL, P=0.05). Moreover, daily wet-weight (R2=0.79,P&lt;0.0001) and dry-weight (R2=0.78, P&lt;0.0001) stool production, glucose variability (R2=0.60, P=0.0007), colonic transit time (R2=0.40, P=0.02), age (R2=0.39, P=0.01), resting energy expenditure (R2=0.35, P=0.02), whole-gut transit time (R2=0.29, P=0.03), and gross energy intake (R2=0.28, P=0.04) were all predictive of digestibility. Conclusions: In this randomized, crossover trial in healthy adults, eTRE was more effective for reducing 24 h mean glucose, fasting glucose, insulin, insulin resistance, triglycerides, and VLDL-C. However, intestinal energy and macronutrient absorption were not impacted by eTRE. These findings suggest that changes in intestinal absorption do not seem to mediate the clinical benefits traditionally observed with eTRE. Intestinal absorption is an understudied component of nutrition and physiology. We found that energy digestibility was associated with gastrointestinal function and glucoregulatory factors. Determining factors that predict individual energy digestibility may aid in the development of personalized nutrition recommendations.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Online discourse facilitated by information and communication technologies (ICTs) has become a vital aspect of modern political life. Such discourse is heavily valued by politicians, corporations, and other political actors, with digital comment sections serving as popular hotspots of political debate for ordinary people. The comment sections of news sites have become a particularly meaningful host for partisan rhetoric, liminal experiences (temporary, space-specific, and personally impactful processes), and identity development for both conservative and liberal political actors. To investigate the political and uniquely liminal processes that guide this phenomenon, the top stories of two liberal-leaning and two conservative-leaning notable partisan U.S. news websites were collected for 53 concurrent days, as well as the comment sections of these stories, with 200 articles and 9575 comments studied in total. An inductive content analysis of emotional, political, civility and political themes, and chi-square tests of these conversations revealed the significance of “liminal browsing” and online political liminality in driving this phenomenon, while also illustrating specifics on how liminal and collective identities manifest in certain digital spaces. A “digital liminality framework” is established using these findings, one which highlights three key components: accessibility, encouragement, and feedback, as key to digital liminal behavior. I chiefly argue that certain digital spaces should be considered liminal environments in a similar capacity (and political capability) to physical liminal spaces. Collective identity behavior was useful in driving various behavioral trends throughout the sample, but was less impactful than predicted, and especially less influential when compared to liminal identity enactment and behavior, with key differences based on partisan influence. Participants in these forums used these liminal processes as a means of political identity development and attunement with partisan rhetoric, in ways that may not have been possible without the unique aspects of these liminal spaces aiding this process. These findings support the idea that online forums, as liminal spaces, keep ordinary citizens “connected and engaged” to political rhetoric over time, especially when these spaces provide a direct link to emerging political rhetoric. These findings have significance for the development of political culture within digital spaces, the importance of ICT-influenced liminal processes in informing identity development, and the future of the political significance of online forums. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Duocarmycin and other natural products that possess prominent anticancer properties are vital to understand for chemotherapy and other forms of treatment. With an ever expanding breadth of  reactions to design a synthesis from, there will always be room to improve prior total syntheses of small molecules. Our lab foresaw a  novel strategy that would encapsulate the pyridazine N-oxide photochemistry into a concise total synthesis in building the core framework of duocarmycin. While this thesis does not provide a synthesized route to the desired framework, an initial investigation has been accomplished in understanding and determining the reactivity of diamino pyridazines and how to build such a substrate. In addition to this synthesis, a mechanistic study was conducted to understand the selectivity and unique nature of an auto-oxidation of a key [5.8.5] carbotricycle. Wherein, the opportunity to perform a more facile oxidation could replace the current cumbersome MTO oxidation used to generate a hydroxy-enone. We have shown that the diastereoselectivity is dependent on the species of O2  where triplet oxygen incorporation results in a mixture of diastereomers, and singlet oxygen results in a selective addition over the olefin resulting in a highly diastereoselective  auto-oxidation.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The work disclosed in this dissertation explores using two-center/three-electrons and electron upconversion in C-N bond formation. In particular, three areas will be discussed in detail: 1) computation exploration into intermolecular C-N bond formation between a methyl radical and various nitrogen nucleophiles; 2) DFT calculations are used to investigate electron upconversion in an intramolecular C-N bond formation between dimethyl malonitrile and anilines; 3) An intramolecular C(sp3)-H amidation which opens a new path to hydroxyisoindolines.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter One begins with a broad overview of N-heterocycles, their applications, and general approaches for constructing them. One approach, C-H activation, is expanded upon as a promising method for constructing and functionalizing N-heterocycles. Four general methods for C-H activation are introduced: 1) direct activation, 2) C-H activation with delayed C-N bond formation, 3) nitrogen assisted C-H activation, and 4) independent N-H/C-H activation. This final approach activates both the N-H and C-H bonds and transforms them into reactive intermediates. For instance, the formation of a radical and a (persistent) anion (typically C-radical and N-anion) can be used to productively form a three-electron bond. Due to the extra electron is “upconverted” and creates a species with a higher oxidation potential capable of being oxidized by a mild oxidant, such as molecular oxygen. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter Two further expands upon the concept of “electron upconversion” as a synthetic method for constructing C-N bonds. When the orbitals of the two centers mix two new orbitals are created, a bonding and anti-bonding orbital. When three electrons are used to make a bond two of those electrons will be stabilized in the bonding orbital and a single electron will be destabilized in an anti-bonding orbital. The result is a net stabilization of a single electron. Additionally, by moving a single electron from a non-bonding orbital to a higher energy anti-bonding orbital one transforms the reactant from a weaker reductant to a more potent reductant, allowing for a facile electron transfer. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter Three uses DFT calculations to probe the effects solvent polarity has on intermolecular three-electron bond formations as well as the ability to trap a methyl radical with a range of N-nucleophiles. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter Four explores if oxidation under basic conditions allows the formation of three-electron bonds (resulting in “upconverted” highly-reducing radical-anions). The benefit of this “upconversion” process is in the ability to use milder oxidants (e.g., O2) and to avoid high-energy intermediates. Comparison of the two- and three-electron pathways using quantum mechanical calculations reveals that not only does the absence of a strong oxidant shut down two-electron pathways in favor of a three-electron path but, paradoxically, weaker oxidants react faster with the upconverted reductants by avoiding the inverted Marcus region for electron transfer.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter Five presents An intramolecular C(sp3)-H amidation proceeds in the presence of t-BuOK, molecular oxygen, and DMF. This transformation is initiated by the deprotonation of an acidic N-H bond and selective radical activation of a benzylic C-H bond towards hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). Cyclization of this radical-anion intermediate en route to a two-centered/three-electron (2c,3e) C-N bond removes electron density from nitrogen. As this electronegative element resists such an “oxidation”, making nitrogen more electron rich is key to overcoming this problem. Remarkably, this reaction also converts a weak reductant into much a stronger reductant. Such “reductant upconversion” allows mild oxidants like molecular oxygen to complete the first part of the cascade. In contrast, the second stage of NH/CH activation forms a highly stabilized radical-anion intermediate incapable of undergoing electron transfer to oxygen. Because the oxidation is unfavored, an alternative reaction path opens via coupling between the radical anion intermediate and either superoxide or hydroperoxide radical. The hydroperoxide intermediate transforms into the final hydroxyisoindoline products under basic conditions.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The endocrine system manages the body’s organ function and growth in harmony with each other and the environment. This system is a network of glands that control themselves and other organs via hormones. Building a healthy hormone secretion pattern begins at the cellular level, where the calcium dynamics in coordination with the membrane potential dynamic plays a key role. The elevated calcium concentration promotes hormone secretion, which is strongly correlated with the rate of bursting behavior compared to spiking in membrane electrical activity of endocrine cells. Many studies have focused on deterministic modeling of electrical activity in the endocrine cells such as pancreatic β-cells, pituitary lactotroph cells, and pituitary corticotroph cells. But the stochastic nature of excitable endocrine cells, like other biological systems, is the missing factor in a fully deterministic model. In other words, stochasticity cause behaviors that are not predictable in the deterministic models. Therefore, throughout our work, we utilize stochasticity in the modeling to explain electrical behavior and as a source for the heterogeneity in empirical studies. In the first project, we show the phantom bursting mechanism in the modeling of isolated β-cell is capable of producing slow bursting even if noise is present. In the second project, in collaboration with biomedical researchers at the University of Edinburgh, we demonstrate the effect of stochastic BK ion channels on tiny corticotroph cells, especially its vital role in stress hormone secretion from cells of chronically stressed animals. The other novelty of our work is the use of fast/slow analysis to understand the mechanism of these stochastic behaviors from the dynamical systems point of view. This method uncovers both the bifurcation structure of the fast subsystem of stable and unstable equilibria and also demonstrates that the bifurcation of the invariant manifold and the heteroclinic orbits are essential to reveal the bursting mechanism of a hybrid model with the stochastic variable. In the final project, we used tools from network theory to study a network of electrically coupled endocrine cells where secretion accumulation depends on their synchronized activity. Unlike β-cells in islets with a uniform network, pituitary endocrine cells are organized in a scale-free network. In this novel modeling study of the lactotroph cell network, we demonstrate that the degree distribution of the functional network, where links between nodes represent synchronized cells, is related to its betweenness centrality density in the structural network. We also find that structural hubs (cells with extensive coupling to other cells) are typically not functional hubs (cells synchronized with many other cells). Overall, the dissertation describes research on endocrine cell electrical activity at both the single-cell and network levels.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Sinking particles transport organic carbon produced in the surface ocean to the ocean interior, leading to net storage of atmospheric CO2 in the deep ocean. The rapid growth of in situ imaging technology has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of particle flux attenuation in the ocean; however, estimating particle flux from particle size and abundance (measured directly by in situ cameras) is challenging. Sinking rates are dependent on several factors, including particle excess density and porosity, which vary based on particle origin and type. Additionally, particle characteristics are transformed while sinking. We compare optically-measured particle size spectra profiles (Underwater Vision Profiler 5, UVP) with contemporaneous measurements of particle flux made using sediment traps and 234Th:238U disequilibrium on six process cruises from the California Current Ecosystem (CCE) LTER Program. These measurements allow us to assess the efficacy of size-flux relationships for estimating fluxes from optical particle size measurements. We find that previously published parameterizations that estimate carbon flux from UVP profiles are a poor fit to direct flux measurements in the CCE. This discrepancy is found to result primarily from the important role of fecal pellets in particle flux. These pellets are primarily in a size range (i.e., 100 – 400 µm) that is not well-resolved as images by the UVP due to the resolution of the sensor. We develop new, CCE-optimized parameters for use in an algorithm estimating carbon flux from UVP data in the southern California Current (Flux = ∑_(i=1)^x▒〖n_i A〖d_i〗^B ∆d_i 〗), with A = 15.4, B = 1.05, d = particle diameter (mm) and Flux in units of mg C m-2 d-1. We caution, however, that increased accuracy in flux estimates derived from optical instruments will require devices with greater resolution, the ability to differentiate fecal pellets from low porosity marine snow aggregates, and improved sampling of rapidly sinking fecal pellets. We also find that the particle size-flux relationships may be different within the euphotic zone than in the shallow twilight zone and hypothesize that the changing nature of sinking particles with depth must be considered when investigating the remineralization length scale of sinking particles in the ocean.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This thesis describes the relevant background, process, and results of two measurements of the cyclotron frequency ratio (CFR) of  H2+/D+ as measured using a hyperbolic Penning trap, to determine the deuteron-to-proton mass ratio m(d)/m(p). The first of these measurements was done using the ``alternating-technique" in which the  H2+ and D+ ions are simultaneously trapped, but measured separately, with the ion being measured centered in the trap as the other ion is held in a 2 mm cyclotron orbit before exchanging the positions of the ions to measure the newly centered ion. This measurement resulted in a value of m(d)/m(p) = 1.999 007 501 274(38), which has an uncertainty three times smaller than the current CODATA value. The second measurement detailed in this thesis attempted to improve upon the precision of the first by performing simultaneous measurements of cyclotron frequency on the H2+ and D+ ions. This method, which was developed at MIT and only used for four ion pairs of m/q ~ 30, had not been used in over a decade, and never for light ions such as H2+ and D+. Using this method we obtained a value of m(d)/m(p) = 1.000 007 501 272(9), reducing our uncertainty by a factor of 4 from our previous measurement. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Cyclotron frequency ratio measurement using H2+ is complicated by the 20 bound vibrational energy states and over 200 metastable rotational energy states which it can be found in. These energy states shift the mass of the H2+ due to the mass energy relation E=mc^2, and must be accounted for in the precision measurement of the CFR. The vibrational energy states could be observed using the alternating measurement technique and clearly identified using the simultaneous measurement technique. This, to our knowledge, is the first demonstration of observation of quantum excitation through direct mass-measurement. Correction was made for rotational quantum energy to the alternating-technique results by the approximation of mass shift through maximum likelihood estimation using a model of rotational excitation. Increased resolution using the simultaneous measurement technique allowed the fitting of specific rotational states to measurements taken, using the minimization of chi-squared when comparing our data to known rovibrational energy levels, drastically reducing the contribution to uncertainty from rotational quantum excitation.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study examined the factors contributing to the underrepresentation of women studying undergraduate Computer Science (CS) at Florida Research University (FRU), a preeminent public university. Even as the growing popularity of computing technologies has boosted enrollment numbers in CS majors over the past decade, women’s attrition rate remains much higher than that of their male counterparts (FL DOE, 2021). The research literature on women in science and math majors identifies a number of reasons for this gender gap, including the lack of pre-collegiate exposure, stereotype threats from both society and the classroom, and embedded biases in the curriculum itself (Holmberg-Wright &amp; Wright, 2018; Ellis et al., 2016). To date, there has not been an in-depth look into women’s experiences enrolled in the CS major at FRU, and this research was intended to fill that void.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Black and Brown college students with autism are missing in the higher education research surrounding the college experience and college readiness. This is important because understanding the college experience and college readiness for college students center many debates and research queries within higher education practice and policy (Carnevale et al., 2010; Hurtado et al., 2020). Research also asserts these barriers are further compounded when considering the intersection of disability and minoritized identities (Chiang et al., 2012). The dominate narrative regarding these college barriers for autistic college students is centered around the experience of White college students with autism. This inadvertently pushes the nuanced experiences of Black and Brown students with autism to the margins and assumes homogeneity for the autistic college experience. Critical theories on race, education, and disability, question the notion of a homogenous experience for all college students with autism and call researchers to intentionally interrogate such notions. Therefore, the purpose of this quantitative study was to describe the experiences, and expectations for Black and Brown college students with autism. The findings of this study demonstrate there are differences for Black and Brown students with autism and their White autistic and non-autistic peers for factors of college readiness and the relationship for College Involvement and Degree Aspiration. The results of this study helped to shed a light on the factors that may influence their perceptions of college readiness for Black and Brown College students with autism, and reiterate that the intersection of race and disability needs to be examined. Further this study served as a resistance to the current autism literature that inadvertently conceals Black and Brown experiences.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>High critical current density (Jc) in MOCVD REBCO coated conductors is accomplished by highly engineered artificial pinning centers (APC) nanostructures that are, however, difficult to control in repetitive long-length production. Adding APC contributes to the crystallographic Jc anisotropy, where Jc varies considerably with the angle (θ) of the applied magnetic field to the tape-plane. These strong correlated APC result in additional point pins around the nano-columns that provide extra, uncorrelated pinning below 45 K, further complicating the pinning landscape. For accurate magnet quench modeling, wide-ranging Jc(B,T,θ) data is needed, where 72-108° is typical of the important angular range for solenoids (θ=90° when B||tape plane). Here we report on four tapes purchased to the same advanced vortex pinning specification that showed substantial variation in the low T, high B current density for BꞱtape (0) and 108° which correlate well with the varying APC size, volume fraction and density. Jc(B,T, 108°) measurements, ranging from 1 T &lt; B &lt; 15 T at 4.2 K &lt; T &lt; 77 K, were probed using a Ginzburg-Landau model of vortex pinning. To further understand the detailed correlation of nanostructure to Jc, the four tapes underwent detailed Jc(B,T,θ) measurements using a novel torque magnetometer at fields up to 30 T, temperatures from 4.2 K &lt; T &lt; 45 K, and angles from 30°-150°. Tapes with higher densities of long, thin nanorods showed a wider ab-plane peak, while the tape with a low density of thick, short nanorods had a sharp, narrow peak. The tape with the lowest Jc for BꞱtape and a low nanorod density however had the highest Jc(B||ab) at all measured B and T. In summary, we find that substantial variations of the Jc magnitude  exist for these 4 representative samples and that the common optimization of tape behavior for BꞱtape is not optimum for angles closer to the ab-planes where many important magnet properties are determined. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Best There Ever Was, The Best There Ever Will Be operates at the intersections of sports and performance studies. This dissertation builds upon Joseph Roach’s concept of surrogation, first outlined in 1996’s Cities of the Dead, with a primary focus on the performances of four specific players in the sport of basketball: Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, and Candace Parker. I argue that each performs Roach’s surrogation through media, race, and gender. I also examine the history of women’s basketball, arguing that basketball is an inherently gendered sport in both its origins and practices over the course of its evolution in more than a century. 	The Best There Ever Was, The Best There Ever Will Be uses performance theory, critical race theory, and gender studies to examine how basketball has become a unique performance tradition. First, I analyze a process called mediatization, arguing that Jordan, James, and Bryant’s performances of mediatization shape how we think of them in basketball culture. I then examine Jordan’s performance as “The Man” of his team and the NBA, using Black masculinity and performativity to create a specific basketball masculinity which James and Bryant surrogate in their own ways. In the third chapter, I pivot to Candace Parker and the WNBA, tracing the history of women’s basketball to argue that basketball itself is an inherently gendered sport through both language and the body. I conclude the project by offering up theoretical concepts of possibility and potentiality, drawing these terms from Daniel Sack’s After Live to argue that they can help us think deeper about surrogation and basketball. Surrogation is key to analyzing the sport of basketball because basketball itself is its own performance practice, one that will be passed down and endure for future generations.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>	This dissertation explores several aspects of microwave spectroscopy of  two-dimensional electron systems (2DES), motivated by the microwave signatures of Wigner crystal phases that can exist in these systems. The spectroscopy is carried out by means of coplanar waveguide transmission lines patterned onto the top of semiconductor samples. 	
	
	Wigner crystals form from otherwise mobile charge carriers when inter-carrier Coulomb repulsion  overwhelms the kinetic energy.  This occurs when the 2DES is sufficiently dilute, for low  temperature and small disorder.  These solids are insulating due to pinning by disorder, and in the rf or microwave range exhibit ``pinning'' modes, in which pieces of the crystal oscillate within the disorder potential.  In high magnetic fields these pinning modes are known to be sharp and can vary widely in frequency.  I describe  high magnetic field measurements of a series of nominally identical devices with unprecedented low disorder and which only vary in the thickness of the quantum well that house the 2DES.  This research has demonstrated the lowest frequency pinning mode observed to date, and further shows that the pinning  is due to alloy disorder in the confining barriers that form the quantum well.   A self consistent model of the wave functions of the quantum wells gives a good explanation of the pinning frequency as a function of well thickness.  
	
	Wigner crystals are predicted to form in zero magnetic field as well, although at much lower carrier densities, and should have microwave signatures.  An excellent candidate for housing such a solid is AlAs.  In exploring 2DES in AlAs to search for microwave signatures of Wigner crystallization at zero magnetic field, we found a novel type of cyclotron resonance, in which plasma shift due to finite sample size is absent
	
	In another step toward studying 2DES at extremely low carrier density I developed a new type of transmission line, a coplanar waveguide whose slots are filled with resistive film, a resistively loaded coplanar waveguide (RLCPW), to measure 2DES. The RLCPW applied to the sample hosting the 2DES provides a uniform metallic surface serving as a gate, to control the areal density of the 2DES.  As a demonstration of this technique I present measurements on a Si metal oxide field effect transistors (MOSFET) showing that the RLCPW can be used for quantitative measurements of 2DES microwave conductivity, and additionally measured a heterojunction insulated gate field effect transistor (HIGFET), a type of device that is particularly promising for study of zero magnetic field Wigner crystals.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This study builds on prior literature that examines the importance of Black male teachers in the K-12 public education system. I began by exploring the differential attitudes of Black male teachers and the systemic, institutional, and organizational factors that contribute to their growth or stagnation within the profession. Through the lens of critical race theory, I conducted a narrative inquiry to discover Black male teachers’ experiences in one school district. In an effort to bring attention to the factors, be they support systems or barriers, I acquired an understanding on what they see as critical in shaping their decision to stay in K-12 public education. I explored the extent to which the perceived notions of Black male teachers’ workplace experiences differ from their actual narratives. Findings indicated there is a lack of supports specific to the needs of in place for Black male teachers in place to aid them in their career as teachers. Implications for future research is presented at the conclusion of the study.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>With the use of sponsorship, the company was especially successful in establishing itself as a sports media brand, primarily within action sports industries. However, in addition to sponsoring entertainment media, Red Bull also financially supported scientific research. Thus, despite the intensified public scrutiny placed on the health risks of energy drinks, the company’s involvement in funding academic work allowed it to indirectly participate in relevant scientific discourse or policy debates concerning the regulation of energy beverages. When using a critical political economic lens, both the work of sponsored athletes and sponsored scientists can be understood as similar types of corporate public relations work and subjected to similar pressures of commercialization. Given the complex power dynamics at play within sponsorship agreements, critical political economy’s emphasis on re-emphasizing the undermining of labor evaluation within cultural work is a fruitful foundation for revealing the ways in which corporate sponsors such as Red Bull have used such agreements to sway the creative efforts of athletic performers and university professionals toward their own interests.The results of this analysis reveal that Red Bull actively facilitates the creation of neoliberal discourse through its sponsorship of action sports media and contrarian academic research. As illustrated by the answers to RQ1 and RQ2, the company has extensively invested organizational resources toward developing sponsorship networks within both action sports and nutrition science. Regarding the company’s sponsorship of action sports, at the time of this study, nearly 90% of sponsored athletes listed on Red Bull’s official U.S. website compete in non-traditional sport disciplines. Within research related to energy drinks, the results of this dissertation revealed the company is heavily involved within academic discourse. Out of the 112 studies examined, 27 (or 24%) featured authors with disclosed associations with Red Bull. Not only did this make the organization the most prolific sponsor of energy drink-related research, but out of the 27 studies, 25 exclusively focused on topics disputing scientific evidence indicating potential health risks linked to the use of energy drinks. When contextually examining the political economic dynamics of company’s athletic and academic sponsorship networks, the results to RQ3 highlight Red Bull’s organizational emphasis on unlimited growth is all-encompassing, including not just athletic performance, but all human potential in general.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>People with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) consistently have deficits in performing adaptive behaviors (Kenworthy et al., 2010; Perry et al., 2009; Pugliese et al., 2017), which are skills needed to care for oneself, have social interactions, and to function at home, in school, at work, or in the community (Harrison &amp; Oakland, 2015), and may be linked with deficits in executive functioning.  Across the United States, diagnoses of ASD continue to increase (Baio et al., 2014; Kogan et al., 2018), suggesting that more children and adolescents with ASD enter adulthood with deficits in adaptive skills (Kanne et al., 2011).  Along with deficits in adaptive skills, those with ASD also display deficits in executive functioning (Lind &amp; Williams, 2013), suggesting a possible link between executive functioning and adaptive skills in those with ASD. Executive functioning is the ability to incorporate goal-directed behavior overriding automatic processes for desired processes (Garon et al., 2008). To examine the relationship between these three constructs, the following research questions were asked: 1) What is the association between ASD behaviors and adaptive skills? 2) What is the association between ASD behaviors and executive functioning? 3) Do executive functions moderate the relationship between ASD behaviors and adaptive skills? 4) Does the cognitive triad of executive functioning (inhibition, cognitive flexibility, working memory) moderate the relationship between ASD behaviors and adaptive skills?.  The current study included 79 participants (M = 9.92 years; Females = 29%).  The results indicated that ASD behaviors have a significant negative relationship with adaptive skills and executive functioning.  The findings suggest that executive functioning moderates the association between adaptive skills and ASD behaviors.  Because executive functioning is malleable and an area of intervention (Kenworthy et al., 2014; Sasser et al., 2017), these findings are important because they indicate that executive functioning is an area to intervene and improve skills.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>ABSTRACT    Social-Emotional Learning (SEL), the process of developing and utilizing interpersonal skills for everyday life, has become a primary vehicle for structuring students’ social and emotional health in the United States and across the world. In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the importance of understanding SEL practices, is increasingly at the forefront of many discussions in education today. Since “non-academic factors” like SEL were added to U.S. education law (ESSA, 2015), the state of Florida has also added two mandates concerning SEL (Florida Senate Bill 7026: The Marjorie Stoneman Douglas Act and FS 1003.42; Rule 6A-1.094121: Curriculum mandate for four hours of SEL as part of mental health education). This has led to the adoption of SEL programming in schools. In 2018, Martin County Public Schools adopted the BASE Education learning program, an SEL approach that aimed to help high school students, identified as at-risk after a discipline infraction, to “learn about and apply psycho-social concepts through supportive, therapeutic dialogue” (MCSD Code of Conduct, Chapter V, 2022, p.18). BASE Education is an online program currently being implemented in all high schools within the Martin County School District. In purchasing BASE for implementation into the disciplinary process and SEL supports, the district projected that BASE Education would increase self-awareness and increase responsible decision making, thus decreasing discipline referrals. This study examines two components of the disciplinary experience of MCSD students: (1) The SEL experience of high school students referred to BASE Education intervention programming in the Martin County School District, and (2) How students who have participated in [personalized] BASE Education modules describe the nature of their pathway within the online experience. This study represents the first time that an analysis of the student referral experience data and online SEL intervention experiential pathway program data has been undertaken in Martin County Public Schools. 
Key Words: BASE Education, CASEL, SEL, Social Emotional Learning, SEL Blended Learning, SEL competencies, Responsible-decision making, self-awareness, social-awareness.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Fossil fuel-derived materials are readily incorporated into the built environment without much knowledge about how they can impact the long-term well-being of natural ecosystems and public health. Ultrahigh resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) has allowed for the molecular characterization of complex fossil fuel-derived materials, such as crude oil and asphalt binder, and their photoproducts that are produced as a result of exposure to weathering processes (i.e. solar irradiation). Photooxidation from sunlight has been identified as the primary phototransformation process responsible for the transformation of fossil fuel-derived materials in the environment. As photooxidation affects these materials, the generation of newly formed oil- and water-soluble compounds becomes a concern and new evidence points to the consideration of these materials as emerging environmental contaminants. Thus, it is important that knowledge regarding the molecular composition, structure, and subsequent behavior of fossil fuel-based photoproducts is acquired as it is valuable in understanding the long-term effects that occur from the use of materials such as crude oil, asphalt binder, and pavement sealant. Specifically, much remains unknown regarding the toxicity of water-soluble photoproducts from fossil fuel-derived materials that can contaminate waterways after introduction to the environment. It is essential that the effects of these potentially toxic compounds in the built environment are understood to combat their effects on the ecosystem, wildlife, and human health.Chapter 1 provides an introductory overview on FT-ICR MS and how it has been used to provide relatively comprehensive molecular profiles for complex unweathered and weathered petroleum-derived materials. Chapter 2 describes the work done to characterize photochemically produced asphaltenes (PPA), a newly formed oil-soluble fraction of crude oil. PPA are of interest as they can persist in the environment due to their inability to degrade over time.
Chapter 3 explores an emerging contaminant of great concern, coal tar pavement sealant. This work seeks to provide a relatively comprehensive understanding of petroleum-derived and coal tar-derived sealants and compares how they are transformed after photooxidation which includes molecular characterization, dissolved organic carbon production, and toxicity analysis. Chapter 4 continues to explore coal tar pavement sealant and compares it to another road paving material, asphalt binder. This work focuses on the solubility fractions, maltenes and asphaltenes, from asphalt binder and coal tar sealant and determines their contributions to the production of water-soluble photoproducts. Lastly, Chapter 5 focuses on the potentially harmful water-soluble photoproducts generated from asphalt binder and coal tar sealant that are introduced in Chapters 3 and 4 and seeks to determine their structural profiles by MS/MS techniques. This work also proposes and discusses photochemical pathways that result in the production of different types of water-soluble compounds. This work is of great importance since structural motifs contained in water-soluble photoproducts from fossil-fuel derived materials have yet to be explored. Collectively, this work aims to demonstrate the consideration of fossil fuel-derived oil- and water-soluble photoproducts as emerging environmental contaminants due to their molecular and structural compositions.

            <DISS_para>A basket trial evaluates one or more treatments for efficacy among more than one cancer type in a single clinical trial. Although the treatment targets the common genetic aberration that is associated with different cancer types, the possible heterogeneity in the treatment effects poses challenges in modeling. Compared to traditional designs, basket trials can reduce the time required for testing and, by pooling across cancer types, they also allow the drugs to be tested for rare cancers. Basket trials are gaining increasing importance with advancements in precision medicine. Using covariate information has shown merit for improving efficacy of these trials. We incorporate subject-level biomarker information to aid identification of responsive and non-responsive baskets. We model subjects’ responses using a two-component Bayesian mixture model where the mixture weights depend on a measure of similarly among subjects’ biomarker values. We demonstrate the performance of this model using simulation. We also illustrate a two stage implementation of the model and discuss the application in case of multiple covariates. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Unlike other Western Boundary Currents (WBCs), the Kuroshio Current, experiences bimodal path flux variations known as the Kuroshio Large Meander (LM) on the southeastern coast of Japan. In this manuscript, the extent to which the Kuroshio LM on the southeastern coast of Japan can be identified through sea surface temperature (SST) spatial patterns is investigated. The methodology in this manuscript varies from previous work which identified the Kuroshio LM through sea surface height (SSH) data.  While SSH data is not found in atmospheric datasets, SST data is often available in atmospheric reanalysis datasets allowing for consistent investigation of ocean-atmosphere interactions using a single dataset.  The SST LM index developed in this study is valid in wintertime months, with the highest correlation found in February. The index developed in this study used to investigate both the time-mean near surface wind divergence/convergence (NSWD/NSWC) and precipitation rates within this region. Further criteria explored includes identifying changes in these variables while atmospheric fronts are present in the Kuroshio LM region and is shown that the presence (or absence) of the Kuroshio LM on the southeast coast of Japan has noticeable influence on the impacts related to frontal boundaries, allowing the small-scale SST-induced diabatic signal to be analyzed. The results of this study aid in explaining the time-mean NSWC of atmospheric fronts over this region, except for a small area off Japan, which is shown to have heightened and intensified time-mean non-frontal NSWC and moderate precipitation rates during the Kuroshio LM on the southeastern coast of Japan, which was previously poorly understood. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Teacher perception has been demonstrated to be a key contributor to instructional practices within the classroom. As additional technologies become available to enhance and supplement instructional practices, game-based learning has emerged as an included component to classroom strategies for improved student achievement. With primary focus within the educational field placed on decreasing the achievement gap, emphasis on approaches that demonstrate affective ways of promoting the achievement of minority students has increased over the past few decades. Primary measurements of student achievement begin in 3rd grade. The purpose of this study was to identify and evaluate teacher perceptions on the use of game-based learning software within the contemporary classroom, specifically in the 3rd and 4th grade ELA domain. Survey responses from 823 3rd and 4th grade ELA teachers provided insight to factors contributing to teacher perception on the implementation of game-based learning into the ELA curriculum. In addition to the quantitative survey results, 37 face-to-face interviews were conducted to elicit qualitative information on the factors influencing teacher perception. Analysis of the results indicated that teachers have a generally positive view of the incorporation of GBL into the ELA curriculum. One of the key factors contributing to GBL implementation is an increased level of student engagement. Prior experience with GBL implementation also served as a primary element impacting teacher perception.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This dissertation study sought to examine the relationship between risk-taking behaviors and meaning in life. A United States sample of adults ranging from 18-40 were surveyed via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk platform. Statistical analyses of the relationships between meaning in life group and risk-taking behaviors were assessed using a multivariate analysis of covariance, while treating age as a covariate. Additional statistical analyses of the predictive relationships between variables were assessed through five hierarchical regression models. 	Results of the study indicated that there were significant group differences for risk-taking behaviors based on meaning in life group. Further examination indicated that there were significant group differences for ethical, financial, and social risk-taking behaviors. Consistent with previous research in risk-taking behaviors and meaning in life, the results also suggest that meaning in life does have a significant predictive relationship with risk-taking behaviors. This study highlights the importance of assessing meaning in life and continuing to expand on the interrelation between presence of meaning and search for meaning on current behavioral functioning. Given that risk-taking behaviors could have negative effects on the individual displaying the behavior, elevate the risk for maladaptive behaviors later in life, and puts others at risk, it becomes apparent that risk-taking behaviors could have lasting negative consequences. Therefore, meaning in life has been identified as a potential protective factor to assess in future research and clinical settings when considering risk-taking motivation or interventions.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The newly emerged medium-voltage (MV) silicon carbide (SiC) MOSFETs, spanning 2.5 kV to 15 kV range, are under the rapid developments and have received increasing attention recently. Compared to Si devices, SiC MOSFETs have significant improvements on the blocking voltage, specific on-resistance, switching speed and operating temperature. Therefore, MV SiC MOSFETs have a great potential to improve the efficiency and power density of MV converters, and meanwhile to drive down the system complexity. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>As the interface between MV SiC MOSFETs and control circuits, gate driver (GD) performance is critical to fully leverage the potential benefits of SiC devices as well as to enhance the reliability, such as the sufficient common-mode (CM) transient immunity (CMTI) and fast fault protection. Since there is little commercial GDs for MV SiC MOFETs, the research on MV GDs is still being explored, mainly focusing on the isolated GD power supply (GDPS) and fault protection designs. Existing MV GD solutions exhibit bulky size and high cost, since they not only require bulky GDPS to transmit GD power, but also need costly fiber optics (FOs) to transmit gate/ fault signals. State-of-the-art (SOA) GDPSs have demonstrated a reduced size aiming at the MV insulation requirement, but the total GD volume is still comparable or larger than the MV SiC devices. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation proposes the power-signal integrated GD for MV SiC MOSFETs to minimize the GD footprint, which helps to integrate the GD into MV SiC device packages. This concept is utilized to firstly propose a 20-MHz dual-transformer-based isolated GD with power-signal integrated transmission. It not only removes costly FOs and bulky GDPSs, but also achieves the good timing performance including the full PWM duty-cycle range operation, low propagation delay time, and high PWM duty-cycle resolution. The solid-dielectrics-based insulation scheme is applied for proposed GD, which enables an insulating voltage &gt; 10 kV rms for MV requirements as well as a moderate coupling capacitance to enhance the CMTI. The experimental results have verified the validity of proposed 20-MHz dual-transformer-based power-signal integrated GD for 3.3-kV and 10-kV SiC MOSFETs. To further reduce both the coupling capacitance and footprint of the power-signal integrated GD for MV SiC MOSFETs, a 50-MHz single-transformer-based design is then proposed, and its performance has been experimentally verified by driving 10-kV SiC MOSFET. The PD performance of GD transformer under the high frequency, high dv/dt PWM voltage excitation is also characterized using photo-multiplier tube method.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Due to the lack of comprehensive and quantitative design principles, the conventional DESAT protection circuit parameters usually require trail-and-error efforts to achieve both the sufficient noise immunity to high dv/dt and fast fault response time. To address this issue, the quantitative design constraints and optimization methodology for DESAT circuit parameters are developed with little tuning work. The proposed DESAT circuit parameter design and optimization methodology has been experimentally verified on 3.3-kV SiC MOSFET module.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The conventional DESAT protection scheme cannot be applied into switched-capacitor-based converters due to the inrush current spike occurring at the converter commutation. To eliminate the false-triggering issue induced by the inrush current, a novel charge-based DESAT protection scheme is proposed, where the "fault charge" rather than "fault current" is selected for the fault diagnosis. The proposed charge-based DESAT protection scheme considers the accumulation of fault current over time and thus can screen the narrow inrush current spikes with high magnitude. The proposed charge-based DESAT protection scheme has been designed and experimentally verified on 3.3-kV discrete SiC MOSFETs.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Flux synthesis is a very powerful and versatile technique for the exploratory synthesis of rare earth intermetallics. Reactions of rare earth metals and alkali earth elements with silicon in a Mg/Al flux or a Mg/Zn flux have yielded single crystals of a series of new complex intermetallic phases. The structures of products were determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. Identical reactions were explored in both fluxes; both yielded large crystals suitable for study using single crystal X-ray diffraction and magnetic susceptibility measurements, although Mg/Zn reactions produced higher yields and larger crystals. While elemental analysis indicates that the product formed in the Mg/Al melts contains traces of aluminum, no incorporation of zinc was observed in compounds formed in the Mg/Zn flux. Reactions of Eu, Ca, and Si in either Mg/Zn or Mg/Al yield products with two structure types depending on the ratio of europium to calcium in the final product. Calcium-rich reactions produce Ca1-xEuxMgSi (0 &lt; x &lt; 0.7) compounds with the orthorhombic TiNiSi structure type in space group Pnma. Increasing europium content led to the prevalence of Eu8-xCaxMg16Si12 (0 &lt; y &lt; 3.4) products with the hexagonal Ho5Ni19P12 structure type in space group P-62m.  In all the products, Eu is expected to be divalent, however there may be some switching to a trivalent state in the TiNiSi type compound due to chemical pressure. In all cases these compounds appear to order ferromagnetically. 
Ba6R1.8Mg18.2Si13 (R = Dy, Y) grow as large crystals from reactions of barium, silicon, and either dysprosium or yttrium in Mg/Al or Mg/Zn fluxes. The presence of the trivalent Y or Dy in the reaction mixture promotes the formation of Ba6R1.8Mg18.2Si13 in the Ho6Ni20P13 structure type (hexagonal P-6 space group) instead of the expected Ba5Mg19Si12 (Ho5Ni19P12 type).  The trivalent cations are incorporated at a specific amount in the compound, mixing on one particular Mg site in the structure. Magnetic susceptibility measurements on Ba6Dy1.8Mg18.2Si13 confirm the presence of Dy3+ and indicate magnetic ordering at 9 K. 
The low melting point of gallium flux enabled an in-situ neutron diffraction study of the reaction of Ce and Ni in excess gallium.  Initial formation of CeNi0.74Ga3.26 was seen at high temperature; this transforms into Ce2NiGa10 and Ce2NiGa12 below 600°C.  This information enabled isolation of the high temperature phase by quenching the flux reaction at high temperature.  CeNi0.74Ga3.26 is a strongly anisotropic ferromagnet below 7 K.

            <DISS_para>This work reports on the first efforts at FSU's John D. Fox Accelerator Laboratory to study the nuclear structure of states embedded in the continuum through particle-unbound angular correlations. As part of this work, two principle experiments were performed, both using the $^{12}$C($^{3}$He,$d$)$^{13}$N reaction at $E_{^{3}He}$ = 24 MeV in the Super-Enge Split-Pole Spectrograph (SE-SPS) to populate proton-unbound states in $^{13}$N whose decays were then measured in coincidence by silicon detector arrays. An angular correlation formalism was developed to utilize outputs from the reaction theory code FRESCO between the reaction products (deuterons) and decay products (protons) to connect the decay observables to the fundamental structure of the parent $^{13}$N states. This technique was found to work well for narrow, long-lived states with modest continuum coupling, but to reach its limitations for strongly continuum-coupled states like the broad ``superradiant'' where a more unified description of nuclear structure and reactions is required.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Rhetoric and Composition (R/C) practitioners have a variety of ways of enacting the object/motive (Russell, 1997) of the discipline: to study writers and writing. Differing approaches have been well documented in terms of pedagogical styles and their underlying philosophical assumptions (e.g., Berlin, 1982; Faigley, 1986; Berlin, 1988; Kopelson, 2003) or what “counts” as writing in the digital age (Yancey, 2004)—to name a few. Similarly, scholars have pointed out that the whole premise of “writers and writing” has and continues to support white ways of knowing and doing (e.g., Prendergast, 1998; Kynard, 2005; Kynard, 2013). Along with these scholars who contemplate the goals and objects of the discipline, recent Conference of College Composition and Communication calls for presentations (Lindquist, 2019; Hassel, 2020) suggest practitioners take a moment to (re)consider our values. This project offers another approach to answering the question disciplinary values examining how new R/C faculty navigate disciplinary values as they are instantiated in a specific genre, the academic research article (RA).The research article (RA) was chosen because it is an economically central feature of the tenure-track promotion process, as well as a pedagogically central feature of many writing programs’ curricula. Furthermore, the RA is philosophically central as a site where knowledge is authorized, reinforcing what writers and what writing counts as publishable. Finally, the RA is culturally central within the discipline as a socializing feature. Writers who wish to publish RAs—and thus participate with this powerful text in the discipline—must contend with the RA’s generic (genre) norms to produce a text that fits within the discipline’s expectation of what a RA should do. These assertions of how the RA functions in academic spaces echo central tenets of rhetorical genre studies (RGS). RGS, my theoretical framework, acknowledges genres as socialactions (Miller, 1984) that help writers to perform the function of communities, disciplines, or activity systems (Bazerman, 2003) and, as such, are also socializing mechanisms for those communities (Bawarshi, 2003, p. 354). Therefore, writers’ agency is located at the crux of social expectations and personal goals (e.g., Porter, 1986; Russell, 1997; Schryer et al, 2003). RGS also acknowledges that, given these features of genres, individuals are always navigating potentially competing (Russell, 1997) personal and disciplinary motives as they compose what Anis Bawarshi (2000) calls sites for the “articulation…and acquisition of desire” (p. 1-2).
This study joins traditional ethnographic methods used in RGS and builds in additional research steps to locate not just texts and their social actions but also locate what might have been left behind, the “rhetorical silences” or strategic omissions (Randazzo, 2015). RGS research methods typically use ethnographic methods for researching in addition to a rhetorical reading of genres (Paré and Smart, 1994). To study genres as sites of desires, I employ a unique methodology in RGS to understand just what sort of desires composers navigate as they engage in the RA-composing process. I surveyed 72 recently graduated R/C faculty, collect documents constituting the “genre set” (Devitt, 1991; Bazerman, 2003) of their RA-composing process, and conduct interviews (Schryer, 2011; Randazzo, 2015) to locate not only what rhetorical moves made it to the final, published products, but also what rhetorical silences, repressions, and/or defenses they may have enacted.
Studying “generic desires” helps describe the tensions between individual agency and community norms, but it also requires a different methodological approach to uncover just what desires writers negotiate and how, particularly the “repressions” and “defenses” writers may enact, which may not show up in a final draft (Bawarshi, 2000, p. 98). Bawarshi recognizes that writers exist in and across multiple communities and, similarly, even within a single community may occupy different social positions as writers take up different genres within the community (2000, p. 98). Generic desires are a potent concept for theorizing about genres, agency, and the potential for authors to impact community norms and values.
My findings suggest that individuals navigate personal and professional desires along with the desires of the discipline—enacted through the genre and enforced by the journal review process—as they engage in the composing process. These desires shift along the process, demonstrating that articulating and acquiring genres is a mutable, not fixed process. Thus, my findings demonstrate in writers’ own words how generic desire works and where the potential for disciplinary change through “knowledgeable resistance” (Powell, 2003) might exist in the RA-composing process.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation contains three essays that aim to better understand the topic of business-state relations in authoritarian regimes. To do this, I use various causal inference techniques and utilize Russia as my geographic focus. Below is an overview of each of the three essays.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The first chapter examines whether some judges are more willing to rule in favor of the state than others during business disputes. While previous researchers have studied the court system in authoritarian regimes, very few have examined the factors that shape judges' decision-making, especially in the commercial realm. In this regard, I argue that public sector (e.g., the court bureaucracy, prosecutor's office, investigative services, or other government agencies) judges are more likely to rule in favor of the regime because they may have similar preferences to the autocrat or they may have career incentives because of their lack of employment options outside of the state. To test this hypothesis, I use original data from the Russian commercial courts on the career paths of judges and a sample of more than 200,000 court cases from the last decade. For my causal identification strategy, I exploit the random assignment of cases to judges, ensuring that there are no significant differences in case characteristics that could potentially impact judges’ decisions. Ultimately, I found that public-sector judges are no more likely than private-sector judges to issue favorable rulings toward the state.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The second chapter examines whether corruption scandals impact the value of politically connected firms. While extensive literature examines whether and how political connections affect firm value, no studies have examined whether corruption scandals influence this. To answer this question, I take advantage of the release of a widely viewed Russian documentary film about an alleged corruption scheme involving former Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and the anti-corruption protests that followed in March 2017. To estimate the impacts of these events, I use data on political connections to Medvedev and daily stock returns from the Moscow Stock Exchange. For my research design, I use an event study to gauge how investors reacted to these events. In addition, I use synthetic controls to control for any confounding factors. In the end, I found that investors did not respond to either the video or the protests. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Finally, the third chapter explores whether economic sanctions impact the value of firms. While some scholars have examined how sanctions influence macroeconomic outcomes, such as trade or FDI, few have explored firm-level effects. To this end, I contend that investors would respond negatively to economic sanctions because they could cause firms to lose benefits, such as foreign direct investment, access to financing, and various goods and services. To test this hypothesis, I take advantage of the sanctions imposed on multiple Russian businesspeople and their firms for malign activity in April 2018. To estimate the relationship between sanctions and firm value, I utilize data on different firm-level covariates and daily returns from the Moscow Exchange. For my identification strategy, I use an event study to gauge how investors react to the sanctions. In addition, I use synthetic controls to control for any confounding events. Ultimately, I found that investors did not respond to the announcement about the imposition of sanctions against Russian firms or their leadership.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Researchers have reported an overall shortage of Black behavioral health practitioners in the workforce (West &amp; Schoenthaler, 2017).  This shortage is problematic because Black and African American people seeking behavioral health services often, at least initially, prefer a same-race practitioner (Swift et al., 2015).  Additionally, there is evidence that treatment duration increases (Ratts et al., 2016) and therapeutic outcomes improve (Swift et al., 2015) when there is a racial match between practitioner and client. There are several reasons contributing to this shortage; however, one reason is low retention of racially diverse (e.g. Asian, Black, Latinx) students in graduate training programs (Kaplan et al., 2018; Tinto, 1975; Wu et al., 2020).  Major factors involved in retention in graduate school relates to students’ college readiness, sense of belonging within the institution, financial instability, and experiences of racial microaggressions (Joseph, 2012). These factors become more prominent when the students are from racial minority backgrounds, indicating a possible connection to Pillerman’s minority status stress framework (Pillerman, 1988).  This framework identifies a unique set of stressors experienced by individuals whom are members of marginalized racial groups; specifically, Black/African American.  Additionally, research also indicates that those students experience psychological distress (e.g., anxiety, depression, stress) over and above their White counterparts as a result of their minoritized status. Mitigating or protective factors that are said to reduce development or maintenance of psychological distress can be racial centrality (i.e., race being a significant aspect of identity; Nioplias et al., 2018; Sellers et al., 1997) and attending a historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) (Joseph, 2012).  Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine associations between minority status stress and psychological distress (i.e., anxiety, depression, and stress) among Black students enrolled in behavioral health training graduate programs. Implications from this study will aid administrators and policy makers, at PWIs, in creating a safe and supportive environment for their students of color, which can ultimately impact these students’ persistence and degree completion. The results of the present study demonstrated a significant relationship between MSS and psychological distress (Research Question 1), along with the inclusion of racial centrality held constant (Research Question 2). However, the inclusion of school type (PWI, MSI, HBCU) had no effect on the degree to which MSS and psychological distress were correlated (Research Question 3).

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Mobile performance support systems (MPSS) are being adopted to support workforce performance across many industries and organizations. An MPSS provides just-in-time access to assist workers with their job tasks from anywhere with minimal help from others (Gery, 1995b; Hueftle, 2005; Layton et al., 1995; Ruffner &amp; Deibler, 2010). A review of the literature suggests that empirical research on MPSS is sparse and sporadic. Scholars from human performance technology (HPT), computer science, engineering, and business fields have called for additional studies on MPSS (Egger &amp; Masood, 2020; Porcelli et al., 2013; Rossett, 2011). To date, only a few studies have explored the use of MPSS in the context of HPT. 
The purpose of this study was to explore why MPSS is adopted in companies and organizations in North America to solve performance problems and meet organizational goals. The study focused on why MPSS is considered an appropriate intervention, the benefits of adopting MPSS, and the challenges in the adoption. The three research questions of the study are: 
I.  Why is MPSS adopted in the workplace? 
II. What are the benefits of adopting MPSS in the workplace?
III. What are the challenges that participants encountered in MPSS adoption?
To answer these questions, the study employed qualitative field interviews. Managers and leaders of MPSS projects from 13 companies and organizations in North America joined the study, representing government, military, transportation, aviation, health care, higher education, medical, restaurant, retailing, semiconductors, and manufacturing. 
The results led to the identification of ten main reasons, six salient benefits, and 12 top challenges reported by over 30% of participants. The main reasons for adopting MPSS were to improve efficiency, aid work in the field, lower costs, provide support in the moment, minimize human errors, manage content, meet job condition requirements, alleviate worker burdens, assist highly complex tasks, and support learning. The salient benefits for adopting MPSS were to boost performance, build confidence, encourage professional satisfaction, increase ROI, manage corporate knowledge, and enhance organizational reputation. The 12 prevailing challenges in MPSS adoption were grouped into four themes: change management (resistance, organizational culture, project planning, change implementation), technology usability consideration (Wi-Fi connection, interface design, device and infrastructure, environment), intervention design and development (development and delivery, content creation and maintenance), and project-related issues (cost and return, IT support).
The findings of the study provide insight about the adoption of MPSS in the workplace.  As the use of mobile technologies continue to expand and penetrate our daily lives, the results can help HPT professionals strategically adopt MPSS to support performance instead of blindly following current trends.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Many students experience writing anxiety, which may lead to students dropping out of or changing classes, majors, college, or professions to get away from writing requirements. This repeated measures random control trial tested the effect of an online scaffolded writing time management intervention on two outcome variables (1) writing performance and (2) writing anxiety. The intervention was designed to help students reduce their writing anxiety by providing structure and guidance to help students self-regulate (keep themselves on task during the pursuit of a goal; Zimmerman, 2000) in the context of a writing assignment. This study also explored the impact of five moderator variables: (1) writing self-efficacy, (2) self-efficacy for writing self-regulation, (3) procrastination, (4) gender, and (5) year-in-school. Participants of the study were 118 undergraduate students from fall and spring Educational Psychology courses. Participants were randomly assigned to either the control (business-as-usual) or intervention condition. Participants received pre-test measures at time 1 when the assignment was introduced, a writing anxiety and writing self-efficacy measure at time 2 during the week the assignment was due, and post-test measures at time 3 after students submitted their assignment but before receiving their grades. Only writing anxiety and writing self-efficacy were measured at all three time points. The main analysis of the effect of the intervention on writing performance was severely underpowered; however, the moderator analyses had some significant and adequately powered results. Student writing self-efficacy moderated the effect of the intervention on writing performance (? = .045). Specifically, participants in the intervention with below average writing self-efficacy at T1 had a significantly higher score (23.6%) on writing performance (? = .033, ? = -1.900). While the overall test of students’ self-efficacy for writing self-regulation did not moderate the effect of the intervention on writing performance (? = .203), it was underpowered and visually presented an interaction. Follow up tests revealed, that participants in the intervention with above average self-efficacy for writing self-regulation had a significantly higher grade (22.1%) on writing performance (? &lt; .001, ? = -2.186), leading to the overall conclusion that a student’s perceived self-efficacy for writing self-regulation does moderate the effect on writing performance. Results indicated that there was an increase in writing anxiety scores between T1 and T2 for all participants (? = .024) and specifically for the control group between T1 and T2 (? = .048), however, when corrected for Type I error these tests were not significant. The intervention also may have stabilized participants‘ writing anxiety. There were two moderators from the writing anxiety tests with enough power to form a conclusion. Both procrastination (? = .515, ηp² =.305) and self-efficacy for writing self-regulation (? = .269, ηp² =.304) did not moderate the effect of the intervention on writing anxiety. All other analyses were underpowered. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Suicide is a leading cause of death and a serious public health problem in the U.S., with certain age, gender, and ethnoracial subgroups being at greater risk. Incorporating dimensional models of psychopathology (e.g., Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology) into suicide prediction models may improve performance and effectiveness of the prediction of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs). Such efforts may be complemented by examining whether dimensional psychopathology and STB prediction models are valid and applicable across diverse identities, as samples in both dimensional psychopathology and STB literature tend to lack diversity. Thus, multi-group confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to assess structural invariance of the dimensional psychopathology model across sex assigned at birth and ethnoracial identity in a sample of substance-using young adults (n = 511). Additionally, hierarchical logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the associations between the dimensional internalizing and externalizing psychopathology factors and suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempts (SA) and whether these associations were moderated by sex assigned at birth and ethnoracial identity moderated the association between. Structural invariance testing results supported partial metric (i.e., weak) invariance of the dimensional internalizing and externalizing psychopathology model across sex assigned at birth and ethnoracial identity. Logistic regression models indicated internalizing psychopathology was significantly correlated with suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempts (SA) above externalizing psychopathology; follow-up mediation analyses showed the association between externalizing and SI and SA was fully mediated by internalizing. No significant moderation effects were found for ethnoracial status, indicating the association between internalizing and externalizing psychopathology and SI and SA did not differ across ethnoracial identity. Moderation results showed the association between internalizing and SI were stronger at higher levels of externalizing for females and lower levels of externalizing for males.  </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Historically, soldiers wore decorative uniforms to distinguish between friend and foe on the battlefield. During World War I, heavy casualties caused the French Army to recruit artists to develop camouflage patterns for their battlefield uniforms. Since then, military camouflage uniforms have been universally implemented for forest, desert, grassland, ocean, and snowy environments. Although many nations have international boundaries that border a large body of water, very limited research has been conducted to develop camouflage patterns for littoral environments. Currently, camouflage pattern effectiveness are evaluated by using the camouflage similarity index (CSI). This technique, however, has drawbacks due to the heterogeneity of camouflage designs and the under-representation of environmental features. Hence, the two overall goals for this research are to (i) create novel littoral camouflage patterns for Northwest Florida’s coastal environments, and to (ii) develop new camouflage assessment procedures. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the first goal, new littoral camouflage patterns were modeled after eight variations of military camouflage designs. These patterns were created by inserting dominant environmental colors for Northwest Florida’s littoral environments into eight custom-built digital camouflage templates. The dominant colors were extracted from three custom-built images datasets for Northwest Florida’s estuarine, sandy, and combination estuarine-sandy coastlines. Twenty-four new littoral camouflage patterns were created by using these custom-made templates. These camouflage patterns were then used to produce the 64x64-pixel camouflage swatches, the 128x128-pixel camouflage patterns, and the 256x256-pixel camouflage patterns training datasets. Each training dataset had three variations for Northwest Florida’s three types of shorelines. As a result, nine custom-made training datasets were produced to train generative models to output novel littoral camouflage patterns. These generative models included a variational autoencoder (VAE), a generative adversarial network (GAN), and a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The second research goal was to develop new camouflage pattern evaluation procedures. A novel camouflage assessment method (NCAM) was created. It overcame the CSI drawbacks by achieving a better representation of a camouflage design and a natural environment. The NCAMs for each novel camouflage pattern were sorted in ascending order. The most effective pattern had the lowest NCAM and a ranking of one. The least effective pattern had a NCAM of one and a ranking of 81. A new camouflage pattern rating system that uses a holistic approach for assessing camouflage patterns was then developed. It was based on NCAMs, runtimes, absence or presence of unusual features, and design appearances. This rating system could be adapted to incorporate other camouflage assessment methods to rank patterns. It has seven categories ranging from “best” to “worst”. Each novel camouflage pattern was assessed by using this rating system. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The impact of hyperparameters on pattern effectiveness was analyzed. The overall effectiveness of camouflage patterns, generative models, the impact of training dataset pixel size on pattern ratings, and the effect of training epochs on pattern appearances were also addressed.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>There were eight contributions for this investigation, and they were grouped into five categories. The first area was to develop a glossary of littoral terms that provided definitions and locations of Northwest Florida coastal features. It could be used for educational purposes and for other types of littoral research to include beach re-nourishment, wildlife biology, and ecological research. The second involved developing two types of custom-built datasets because they are unavailable in the public domain. The littoral images and camouflage training datasets were required for creating and evaluating new camouflage patterns. The third contribution involved creating digital camouflage templates to facilitate creating new patterns. These templates are also not available in the public domain. The fourth involved creating new littoral camouflage patterns by using two different procedures. The first was to insert extracted colors from the littoral images datasets into the digital templates. The second was to create novel camouflage patterns by training generative models on the custom-built camouflage training datasets. Currently, littoral camouflage patterns are unavailable for use by militaries. The fifth contribution area involved developing two camouflage pattern evaluation procedures: NCAM and camouflage pattern rating system. The NCAM overcomes CSI drawbacks to achieve a better representation of a camouflage pattern and an environment. The camouflage pattern rating system is a holistic approach developed to evaluate camouflage pattern effectiveness. It takes into account NCAMs, runtimes, design artifacts, and design appearances. This rating system could be adapted to incorporate other camouflage assessment methods, such as the combined NCAM-SSIM procedure. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study offers an overview of the landscape of LGBTQ+ leadership and initiatives at large public universities in the state of Florida. Through the recognition that LGBTQ+ leaders often have to navigate complex institutional, social, and political systems, Bronfenbrenner’s Ecological Systems Theory provided the theoretical framework for the study and served as a way to examine the relationships between the leaders and the varying institutional bodies they serve. Eight leaders from seven of Florida’s public universities were interviewed in this qualitative, exploratory study, and the study was guided by questions related to how leaders were supporting their LGBTQ+ populations and how LGBTQ+ initiatives were being designed to engage with students in virtual environments. The findings suggest that leaders support LGBTQ+ populations in three ways: through advocacy work, educational training and programming, and community building. Regarding how LGBTQ+ initiatives are being designed for virtual environments, the findings reveal that leaders develop strategic communications plans, leverage social media, and design and develop their programming for hybrid and online delivery. Because the findings highlight the value of partnerships as ways to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion work, the implications are presented for LGBTQ+ leaders, LGBTQ+ leaders and faculty, and LGBTQ+ leaders and instructional designers. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>I report the effects of aspartame on anxiety-like behavior, neurotransmitter signaling and gene expression in the amygdala, a brain region associated with the regulation of anxiety and fear responses. C57BL/6 mice consumed drinking water containing 0.015% or 0.03% aspartame, a dose equivalent of 8-15% of the FDA recommended maximum human daily intake, or plain drinking water. Robust anxiety-like behavior (evaluated using open field test and elevated zero maze) was observed in male and female mice consuming the aspartame-containing water. Diazepam, an allosteric modulator of the GABA-A receptor, alleviated the anxiety. RNA sequencing of the amygdala followed by KEGG biological pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes showed glutamatergic and GABAergic synapse pathways as significantly enriched. Quantitative PCR showed upregulation of mRNA for the glutamate NMDA receptor subunit 2D (Grin2d) and metabotropic receptor 4 (Grm4), and downregulation of the GABA-A receptor associated protein (Gabarap) mRNA. 	Thus, taken together, our diazepam and gene expression data show that aspartame consumption shifted the excitation-inhibition equilibrium in the amygdala toward excitation. Even more strikingly, the anxiety-like behavior, its response to diazepam, and changes in amygdala gene expression were transmitted to male and female offspring in two generations descending from the aspartame-exposed males. Extrapolation of the findings to humans suggests that aspartame consumption at doses below the FDA recommended maximum daily intake may produce neurobehavioral changes in aspartame-consuming individuals and their descendants. Thus, human population at risk of aspartame’s potential mental health effects may be larger than current expectations, which only include aspartame consuming individuals.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Adolescence is a period of increased risk-taking behaviors including the initiation of alcohol use, which appears mechanistically related to the brain’s reward system. Available evidence provides support for both hyposensitivity and hypersensitivity as mediators of substance or alcohol use escalation – calling for further research to better understand the role of reward systems in risk trajectories, utilizing effective indices of reward processing. The reward positivity (RewP) is a commonly utilized index of hedonic “liking,” an important aspect of reward activation. Existing studies with adults have provided evidence for reduced, enhanced, or intact RewP among samples with risk for, or histories of problem drinking or other harmful substance use. However, to date, no research has examined relations between youth alcohol use and RewP, although research on adolescents at risk for substance use, or currently using tobacco or cannabis, has not found differences in RewP relative to adolescent controls, outside of one past sex-specific finding in adolescent males. The current study measured the RewP within a binary-choice reward task in a large sample (N = 250) of adolescent females (Mage = 14.40) to evaluate its predictive association with self-reported drinking initiation and past-month drinking. Regression analyses showed that adolescents who had initiated drinking exhibited a smaller RewP—specifically, a smaller response to monetary gain feedback—compared to not-yet drinkers. There was no difference in RewP between past-month drinkers and non-drinkers. These findings provide evidence for the importance of limited capacity for hedonic “liking” as a risk factor for early initiation of drinking in adolescent females, while other patterns may underlie likelihood for proximal drinking escalation. Future studies should incorporate additional indices of reward activation, and mixed-sex samples with greater drinking variability to replicate current study findings and test for sex moderation of observed reward-response/drinking associations.   </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Protein function needs to get regulated in every organism, and mis-regulation of protein function can cause serious disease states. Regulation of protein function is essential for controlling and organizing many different cellular processes. It has been postulated that the emergence of a new regulatory mechanism often requires protein conformational heterogeneity. In another word, protein needs to have access to two or more different conformations. Although there are many studies performed on different polypeptides and the regulatory processes associated with them, there is little knowledge available regarding the evolutionary origins of new regulatory mechanisms. One example of such regulatory process is allosteric regulation. One example of allosteric regulation is the allosteric regulation of glucokinase by one of its substrate glucose. Glucokinase is the primary glucose sensor in human body and a key determinant of glucose homeostasis in vertebrates. Allosteric regulation of glucokinase is of substantial interest as glucokinase is a monomeric enzyme and has just one binding site for glucose. Mis-regulation of glucokinase activity causes diabetes and hyperinsulinemia. Glucokinase is an ideal system to investigate the evolutionary link between conformational heterogeneity and regulation because: glucokinase is regulated by several mechanisms that require access to multiple states, also, glucokinase is evolutionarily tractable. As such, understanding the evolutionary origins of glucokinase regulatory processes provides direct insight into the emergence of physiology and disease. The aim of this research is to understand how evolution, by the means of natural selection, altered protein sequence, structure and function to introduce a new regulatory mechanism. For this purpose, herein, I reconstructed ancestral glucokinase sequences, resurrected extinct proteins and performed biophysical analyses to illuminate the functional transitions that afford access to new glucokinase conformations. I used a variety of techniques such as kinetic assays, proteolysis, X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance experiments for the purpose of this study.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The growth of social media has created a new type of celebrity, referred to as social media influencers (SMI) (Appel, Grewal, Hadi, Stephen, 2020), and a new endorsement technique known as influencer marketing (Brown, Hayes, 2008). Influencer marketing is particularly dominant in the beauty and fashion industries (Driver, 2018).Despite the growth in the influencer marketing industry, the amount of academic research on social media influencers is insufficient (Taillon, Mueller, Kowalczyk, Jones, 2020). In addition, there are inconsistencies across the literature about the source factors’ outcomes. Finally, a significant majority of the research in the area of SMI, examined the effectiveness of SMIs in a broad context and not in a specific product category.
The main objective of this dissertation is to investigate the influence of source factors among social media fashion influencers (SMFIs), including perceived trustworthiness, expertise, physical attractiveness, perceived similarity, likability, and identification, on consumers’ attitudes toward SMFIs and consumers’ attitudes toward the product endorsed by SMFIs. Next, the impacts of consumers’ attitudes toward SMFIs, and attitudes toward the endorsed product, on consumers’ purchase intentions are explored. Additionally, the correlation between consumers’ attitudes toward SMFIs and their attitudes toward the product endorsed by SMFIs, and the correlation between consumers’ fashion involvement and their purchase intention are examined.
The results show that perceived trustworthiness, physical attractiveness, and likability have a significant and positive influence on consumers’ attitudes toward SMFIs. Additionally, perceived expertise and likability have a significant and positive influence on consumers’ attitudes toward the product endorsed by SMFIs. Also, it was found that consumers’ attitudes toward the product, perceived similarity, and identification have a significant and positive influence on consumers’ purchase intention. A significant and positive correlation between consumers’ attitudes toward SMFIs and consumers’ attitudes toward the endorsed product was found. Finally, the results show a significant and positive correlation between consumers’ involvement with fashion products and their purchase intentions.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The eastern Indian Ocean is dynamic and rich in mesoscale eddy activity, and this complex circulation has implications for biological properties. The Argo Basin, south of Java and northwest of Australia, is located in the tropical eastern Indian Ocean and is considered an oligotrophic region (i.e., low in chlorophyll and nutrient concentrations). Despite this, it is the only known spawning region for Southern bluefin Tuna. Generally, oligotrophic regions are nitrogen limited. However, the processes that supply nitrogen to the Argo Basin are not known. Here we investigated how much particulate organic matter (POM) is laterally advected and the role of this advected organic matter in supplying new nitrogen to the mixed layer of the Argo Basin using 14 years (2003 -2016) of remotely sensed data. Our results show that the average net primary productivity of phytoplankton in this offshore oligotrophic region is 98.5 Gg C d-1 and that lateral advection of particulate organic carbon (POC) transports 1.21 Gg C d-1 into the region. If we assume that the Argo Basin has an f-ratio (ratio of new production / net primary production) that is typical of oligotrophic regions (i.e., 10%) we find that lateral advection of organic matter supplies an annual average of 12% of the nitrogen supporting the ecosystem (assuming that bulk particulate matter has a similar C:N ratio to phytoplankton). This suggests that lateral advection is a quantitatively important but not dominant source of nitrogen supporting the phytoplankton at the base of the food chain. This region has its highest productivity during the austral winter (June to August) which may be due to the Southwest monsoon causing substantial mesoscale activity. Furthermore, we found that 65% of lateral advection of POC into the region is driven by mesoscale eddies and organic matter primarily enters our study region through the eastern boundary of our domain. Our results may help to inform predictions and models to simulate the responses of oligotrophic systems to future change.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Volunteer engagement is critical to achieving the mission of volunteer organizations (Boone et al., 2002). Fogarty et al. (2009) found that 4-H volunteers are a mediating factor in achieving positive youth development outcomes and are responsible for teaching at least 50% of the life skills youth gain from participation in the organization. For 4-H to consistently achieve positive youth development outcomes, volunteers must be prepared for their roles (Arnold, 2009). However, most 4-H volunteer education programs are offered sporadically (Smith et al., 2017) and tend to focus on fundamental skills (Serafino, 2001), rather than more complex skills volunteers need to create supportive environments for positive youth development outcomes to occur (Arnold et al., 2009). Volunteers often state that a lack of learning opportunities is the reason why they do not continue to serve as a volunteer (Fahey et al., 2003). Also, many volunteers face obstacles participating in formal training, particularly when it is only offered face-to-face in a physical location (Ouellette et al., 2014). 	To address these issues, Spink (2016) recommends integrating more opportunities for self-directed learning and on demand resources. Studies by Homan et al. (2020) and White et al. (2020) found that 4-H volunteers desired more opportunities for mentoring, networking, and access to communities of practice to build content-specific knowledge and skills. 4-H volunteers also want more opportunities for mentoring and online and virtual learning (Dillard, 2020; Hensley et al. 2020; Kok et al., 2020). Intentionally providing opportunities for volunteers to learn through informal learning may be a solution to address issues related to volunteer education. 
	The relationship between work &amp; informal learning is the strongest within the context of volunteering (Livingstone, 1999) but is the least understood (Duguid et al., 2013). While informal learning has been studied in the context of paid work, informal learning that occurs through volunteering is often considered passive (Cox, 2002), and is unplanned, unstructured, and ignored by organizations (Duguid et al., 2013; Livingstone &amp; Guile, 2012). As a result, a systematic framework for organizations to intentionally develop and support pathways for informal learning does not currently exist. The purpose of the current study was to explore how volunteers in the Florida 4-H Positive Youth Development program engage in informal learning to support their volunteer roles. The goal of the study is to develop a list of informal learning activities volunteers participate to design a conceptual framework to guide organizations in the development of informal learning activities for volunteers to select from and explore. Four research questions guided this study:
1.	What types of informal learning activities do Florida 4-H volunteers participate in to support their performance as a volunteer?
2.	How frequently do volunteers engage in these types of informal learning activities?
3.	Which informal learning activities do volunteers identify as most helpful to support their volunteer performance? 
4.	Why do Florida 4-H volunteers engage in informal learning?
This two-part study consisted of an online questionnaire and follow-up interviews with current Florida 4-H volunteers. Respondents to the survey included 237 adult volunteers of which 20 participated in semi-structured interviews. 
	The results from both survey and interview data indicated that volunteers frequently engage in a variety of informal learning activities. The top five activities volunteers did on a weekly basis included: searching the internet, reading newsletters, blogs, curriculum, and other print materials, collaborating with others on a joint task, setting personal goals, and using social media. When 4-H volunteers use informal learning, they want to learn about topics related to positive youth development, educational design and delivery, organization, 4-H program management, and interpersonal relationship skills. These topics are domains of learning Culp et al. (2007) found to be essential for volunteers to be successful. 
Volunteers shared the number one reason why they choose to participate in informal learning is because they want to improve their performance. This supports the motto of the organization, which is “to make the best better.” Volunteers also stated that they use informal learning because they have learning needs that are not currently being met by the organization and because it is more convenient and flexible for them than traditional didactic methods. Finally, volunteers said that informal learning aids in not only motivating youth but keeps them excited about the volunteer work they do for the organization. This study resulted in several implications for volunteer organizations, as well as a conceptual framework for organizations to guide intentional informal learning for volunteers.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The issue of non-degradable petroleum-based plastics waste is a global challenge that requires urgent attention due to its harmful impact on humans and the environment. To overcome this challenge, biomass-based materials have received great attention these days. Lignin is not only one of the important biomasses due to its abundance, low price, and rich aromatic group, but also an important material that can be used as a raw material to produce biodegradable polymers. However, lignin modification is not well understood or characterized due to its complex chemical structure, limiting the use of lignin. Especially, poorly defined excessive reaction sites of lignin cause uncontrolled crosslinking in lignin to make thermoset polymers. This dissertation presents novel methods to achieve the advanced biodegradable lignin-based polyesters with covalent bond via 1) precise and well-defined chemical modification of natural lignin and 2) controlling the crosslinking density of lignin. Then, by combining the methods of 1) and 2), we can develop 100 % biomass-based biodegradable polymer.
First, we developed a new and precisely defined synthetic protocol which integrates lignin and poly(ethylene brassylate) (PEB) to make a lignin-graft-PEB. The lignin was chemically modified by sebacic acid to introduce a carboxylic acid functionality. Abundant hydroxyl groups on lignin were used for its modification. A relatively unexplored and inexpensive castor oil-derived polymer, PEB was prepared by ring-opening polymerization of ethylene brassylate in the presence of a catalyst, 1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec-5-ene. The prepared PEB was graft copolymerization onto modified lignin through an acid anhydride bond. The new polymer shows optimal melting temperature (78 ℃) that enables an easy thermal process. Mechanical properties of the new lignin-graft-PEB can be changed by altering the molecular weight (Mn) of PEB and mass ratios of lignin and PEB. The highest modulus is 471.99 MPa, which is 3-folds higher than low-density polyethylene. However, blended polymer without covalent linkage shows poor mechanical properties (220.7 Mpa of young’s modulus) due to the microlevel phase separations within the polymer matrix.
Second, we developed a highly efficient crosslinking control method by using a capping agent, acetic acid. Acetic acid capped the hydroxyl group to reduce the number of excessive reaction sites in the lignin, and succinic acid is used to introduce carboxylic acid functionality. Using this method, we prepared succinic acid-modified lignin-graft-poly(ethylene glycol) with different amounts of a capping agent. The lignin-based polymer synthesis has two steps: 1) lignin modification with succinic acid and capping agent and 2) graft copolymerization of PEG-OH onto the modified lignin. Thermal properties of prepared succinic acid-modified lignin-graft-PEGs were investigated to study the relation between the amount of capping agent and crosslinking density. Lignin-graft-PEG showed a clear trend to lower Tm and Tg at lower crosslinking (large amount of capping agent). Tg of the lignin graft-PEG decreased from 2.6 °C to 27.5 °C by increasing the capping agent from 6 % to 59 %. The precise control of available reaction sites on lignin using a capping agent resulted in a convenient way to adjust the degree of crosslinking. 
Third, we have synthesized a fully biomass-based polyester, capped lignin-graft-castor oil. The lignin was chemically modified by succinic acid and capping agent, acetic acid. The other biomass of the copolymer was castor oil. The castor oil was used in its pristine form without any modification. These two biomasses are linked with covalent bonding through esterification in the presence of carbodiimide. This new method could be easily scalable in the industry due to its convenient synthesis procedure, fewer reaction step and moderate reaction conditions. The synthesized copolymer showed decent melting temperature and glass transition temperature to enable thermal processing. The mechanical properties of new capped lignin-graft-castor oil can be controlled by changing the crosslinking density and the mass ratio of capped lignin to castor oil. The highest modulus is 228.43 MPa, which is higher than that of low-density polyethylene (LDPE). In addition, a structure-property relationship of capped lignin-graft-castor oil was confirmed by controlling the crosslinking density and weight % of capped lignin and castor oil. 
Overall, this dissertation demonstrates novel synthetic methods for advanced biomass-based biodegradable polymer. Our new lignin modification methods would increase the value of lignin as a raw material of biodegradable polymers. These methods can significantly change polymer properties while improving mechanical properties and enabling thermal processing. In addition, the synthesized 100 % biomass-based biodegradable can be expected to have great advantages in terms of cost and mass production. The demonstrated approaches and synthesized lignin-based biodegradable polyester in the dissertation can be important discoveries in the global trend to replace petroleum-based non-degradable plastics with biodegradable polymers.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The focus of this thesis is to examine skeletal health indicators of prehistoric Native Americans populations from the Central Illinois River Valley from the early Woodland period into the Mississippian period. The effects of specific subsistence practices with the introduction of maize agriculture, site proximity to mound centers, and increasing population density during the Mississippian period has long been tied to an overall increase in the frequency of certain pathologies. Through an observation of pathological presence/absence and scoring of severity across multiple sites from St. Clair County, Green County, and Fulton County, I hypothesize that there will be a significant increase in all the observed pathologies during the Mississippian period in comparison to the Woodland period for all regions. Analysis includes the examination of periodontal disease, signs of anemia, signs of growth stresses, non-specific infections, trauma, and degenerative joint disease. My primary findings partially support my hypothesis of increased likelihood of pathologies related to health in the Mississippian period. The greatest significant differences between these two periods were found with the increase in trauma and DJD in the Mississippian. This trend is particularly visible when comparing site location. Green County (Schild site) and Fulton County sites carry by far the greatest percentage of trauma and arthritis (particularly in the lumbar vertebrae). The overall conclusion is therefore mixed. It seems that some pathologies increased in this region during the Mississippian, but they may be more related to interactions or perhaps conflict between mound centers in Central Illinois and Southern Illinois, rather than shifts in subsistence from the Woodland.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The problem of class imbalance has become frequent, and missing data also are often a predicament in the social sciences. In the literature, the two problems have been debated substantially and separately. Class imbalance has been shown to adversely impact the estimation of logistic regression coefficients. Also, the missing data problem has been demonstrated to yield bias in parameter estimation in various types of statistical analyses. This simulation study focuses on the context logistic regression and investigates how class imbalance interact with missing data to impact the estimation of the coefficients and test procedures such as the Wald and likelihood ratio tests. Three factors are considered in this simulation—(1) missing data mechanisms MCAR, MAR, MNAR, (2) sample sizes—small, 100; medium, 500; and large, 1000, (3) class imbalance ratios 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50%. The results demonstrate that the combination of class imbalance and missing data problems affects the performance of the logistic regression, particularly when the imbalance ratio is as low as 10% and the sample size is also low, and potential methods for the remedies are suggested.  </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>When we construct a Bayesian hierarchical model, we are required to specify a prior distribution. There are some considerations when specifying the prior distribution, such as prior misspecification, and this use of preliminary estimates. This dissertation proposes to constrain a Bayesian model on a ball centering at a preliminary estimate or the ball's complement (i.e., disc). This approach extends the constrained Bayesian model in Bradley and Zong (2021) to consider the ball or the disc in specific inferential settings. In Chpater 2, we are motivated to estimate the change in the distribution of housing sale prices in the Manhattan housing market during the COVID-19 pandemic with strict COVID-19 guidelines and social distancing policies using individual transaction and property data from Zillow (ZTRAX). To improve the precision of the Dirichlet process mixture model (DPM) for density estimation, we adopt a constrained Bayes approach incorporating the kernel density estimator (KDE). Specifically, this approach constrains the joint support of the data and parameters in the DPM on either a set centered around a KDE or the complement of this set. When the KDE is a reasonable (as measured by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic) preliminary estimator, we constrain the DPM to be close to the KDE and vice versa. We call our method the density-constrained Bayesian hierarchical model (D-CBHM). By doing so, we can simultaneously account for all sources of variability as well as incorporate preliminary information from the KDE. We demonstrate that the D-CBHM analytically (under reasonable conditions) and empirically outperforms the DPM in mean integrated squared error. We apply our method to our motivating dataset of Manhattan's home sales price and estimate how the COVID-19 pandemic changed the market in volume and distribution.
 In Chapter 3, we introduce the constrained Bayesian hierarchical model (CBM), which considers Bayesian models with both a noninformative and an informative prior distribution. Specifically, we constrain the joint support of the data and parameters in a noninformative Bayesian model on a ball centering at an informative posterior estimate, such as the posterior mean in the Bayesian model with an informative prior distribution or its complement. This approach incorporates prior sensitivity analysis by considering two different prior distributions. It also alleviates potential concerns related to prior misspecification but still uses the given prior information outside the Bayesian model whose support is constrained. We then prove that the constrained model outperforms the Bayesian model solely with the noninformative and the informative prior distributions in terms of mean squared error. In practice, the set which the Bayesian model is constrained on is determined based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic and the posterior expected mean squared error, and the Bayesian model whose support is constrained is determined based on the predictive accuracy measure such as Watanabe–Akaike information criterion. We show that the practical CBM empirically and generally outperforms the (unconstrained) Bayesian model. We apply the practical CBM to Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data to estimate the association between gene expressions and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Extant literature indicates that Chinese graduate students experience academic writing anxiety when writing with English as their second language (Cheng, 2014b; Ho, 2016; Huang, 2014; Liang &amp; Turner, 2021).  Writing anxiety exerts negative impacts on students’ engagement with writing (Daly &amp; Miller, 1975), has negative association with writing self-efficacy (Pajares &amp; Johnson, 1994) and the quality of writing (Daly, 1978), and negatively predicts self-regulated writing strategy use (Paul et al., 2021; Stewart et al., 2015; Wang &amp; Zhan, 2020). Therefore, it is important to further understand academic writing anxiety with English as a second language (L2) so that Chinese graduate students have successful learning experiences in the American educational setting. However, few theories account for language learning anxiety, including such skill-specific anxieties as writing anxiety. Besides, previous studies did not link the antecedents and consequences of writing anxiety together. To address these gaps, this dissertation study investigated the relationships among Chinese graduate students’ L2 academic writing mindsets (students’ beliefs about whether they can increase their academic writing competence or not), their perceived academic writing competence, academic writing anxiety, academic writing self-efficacy, self-regulated writing and students’ self-satisfaction with their own academic writing.  The participants (n=223) were Chinese international students enrolled in various graduate programs in American universities. All the data for this dissertation study were collected through an online survey questionnaire. A path analysis was conducted to investigate the relationships among the antecedents and consequences of Chinese graduate students’ academic writing anxiety. Results of data analysis showed that when students endorsed fixed mindset, they tended to have higher levels of writing anxiety, as well as lower levels of academic writing self-efficacy. On the contrary, when students had a stronger endorsement of growth mindset, they tended to have higher levels of academic writing self-efficacy. However, students’ growth mindset was not significantly associated with their levels of academic writing anxiety. Students’ perceived competence for academic writing had a significant moderation effect on the relationship between growth mindset and writing self-efficacy. When students perceived higher competence for academic writing, the relationship between growth mindset and writing self-efficacy became weaker. When students had lower levels of perceived competence, the relationship between growth mindset and writing self-efficacy was stronger. Both students’ perceived competence and their writing self-efficacy accounted for students’ use of self-regulated strategies. That meant, when students had higher perceived competence and/or higher writing self-efficacy, they tended to use self-regulated writing strategies more often. In turn, students’ use of self-regulated writing strategies, together with perceived competence, was positively associated with students’ self-satisfaction with their academic writing. 
The dissertation study had both theoretical and pedagogical implications. The study provided valuable information on mindsets, perceived competence, and writing anxiety, which is relevant for Chinese international graduate students, graduate students experiencing writing anxiety, professors, academic advisors, and writing center staff. The findings of the study underlined the importance of overcoming fixed mindset and cultivating growth mindset, as well as improving writing competence and using self-regulation. The present study can also help pave the path for future research on related topics.        </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Between the years of 1932 and 1945, modern Italian muralism, otherwise known as l’arte murale, made its debut in the Italian art world, bringing with it disputes and problems related to the discourse surrounding the endeavor, the materials that would make up these works, and the iconography and subject matter of the images. The muralists of modern Italy primarily depended on funding from the Partito Nazionale Fascista (National Fascist Party or PNF) to make public murals for schools, post offices, train stations, fascist administrative buildings, and temporary exhibition spaces, complicating their works and raising the stakes of the modern practice of muralism. This dissertation considers the understudied history of modern Italian muralism in the ventennio, or twenty years of fascism and its relationship to the building of the Italian fascist empire under Benito Mussolini. Focusing on such artists as Mario Sironi, Massimo Campigli, Gino Severini, and Enrico Prampolini, each of the four chapters largely considers the language used to describe modern Italian muralism by practitioners, architects, critics, and fascist bureaucrats. As a secondary goal of each of the four chapters makes claims about the iconography related to imperialism and the experiments in modern and ancient materials. By focusing on these aspects, this dissertation demonstrates how modern muralism shifts throughout the 1930s and 1940s in Italy and how those alterations relate to political, social, imperialistic, and artistic issues and debates. 
While the existing scholarship has paid abundant attention to the art of Italian fascist culture, there is a major gap in the literature regarding Italian muralism during the ventennio and its effect on Italian artists, viewers, administrators, and future trajectories of Italian art. According to some of the primary literature and the secondary scholarship, modern Italian muralism was seen as a regression in art, returning to a more traditional or conservative position at a time when European modernism and the avant-garde laid a foundation for radical experimentation and a reshaping of human existence. However, the work of the Italian muralists, and the discourse surrounding it, demonstrate a serious desire and initiative to explore the social, political, and visual effects of modern materials within their murals. While some of the modern Italian murals may superficially appear conventional or predictable, this dissertation proves otherwise.
Unlike mural practices occurring simultaneously in France, Germany, Mexico, the United States, and the Soviet Union, Italy’s modern muralism carried the weight of mural traditions that extend back to antiquity. Italy’s rich past is something that modern Italian muralists grappled with when creating their own murals under fascism. With experiments in fresco, mosaic, the plastica murale (plastic mural), and the fotomosaico (photomosaic), the modern Italian muralists transformed the tradition of Italian muralism into something unique and modern, and these examples are deserving of a rigorous analysis.

            <DISS_para>The focus of this study is the merger of the arts and business through the lens of African American entrepreneurs The culmination of business and the arts is unique for African American artists who face unique challenges pursuing entrepreneurial endeavors. For undergraduate and graduate students studying the arts, the benefit of such research is more knowledge of general business practices; for those studying business, this merger of disciplines provides exposure to the arts and aesthetics. Despite the emergence of arts entrepreneurship as a field, African American arts entrepreneurs remain under studied within the research. The purpose of this study is to identify factors that influence paths to entrepreneurial success for African Americans arts entrepreneurs. This qualitative research study explored and described the education, training, and career backgrounds of African American arts entrepreneurs, factors that advanced their entrepreneurial efforts, factors that impeded their efforts, and strategies they used to overcome barriers to success as entrepreneurs. I anticipate my study will advance the conversation on the uniqueness of the African American arts entrepreneurs. Exploring the entrepreneurial efforts of African Americans in the arts is critical to expanding knowledge about the commonalities and differences found in successful arts business ventures. I chose an exploratory qualitative approach in this study to aid in analyzing the data and establish a better understanding of success among African American arts entrepreneurs. I based the interview protocol on the overarching research question about the factors that influence the achievement of success of African American entrepreneurs in the arts, and the questions sought to unearth how the participants navigated such barriers.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This treatise presents Leoš Janáček’s Sonata for Violin and Piano and George Enescu’s Sonata for Violin and Piano No. 3, Op. 25 “dans le caractère populaire Roumain” with a focus on indigenous elements and vocal influences, in order to guide a violin-piano duo’s musical interpretation. Chapter One presents Janáček’s speech-melody theory and connects it to his use of interruptive motifs and rhythmic irregularities in the sonata. It also describes the vital role and influence of the cimbalom in Moravian indigenous music as well as Janáček’s replication of its textures throughout the piece. Chapter Two introduces musical elements of the Romani lăutari style and examines Enescu’s portrayal of “le caractère populaire Roumain” through the lenses of rhythmic complexity, elaborate violinistic ornamentation, and unique sound colors that imitate lăutari instruments. This treatise serves as a guide to help performing musicians craft an informed, artistic interpretation of these two sonatas, and offers suggestions for practice, rehearsal, and performance.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Changes in water balance variables such as runoff and evapotranspiration (ET) are essential in planning and management of land and water resources. Two major factors affecting these variables are climate and land use change. There is a need to investigate the combined effects of land use and climate change at local scales. Towards that end, the hydrological processes were modeled using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to investigate the impacts of climate and land use change in Southeast US (Makhtoumi, Li, Ibeanusi, &amp; Chen, 2020). We integrated land use based on the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) with future climate data (CMIP5) to study the combined effects on hydrological response of Upper Choctawhatchee Watershed (UCW.) Future rainfall and air temperature, for two time periods (2040-2069 and 2070-2099), were obtained using Global Climate Models to provide SWAT with the climatic forcing in order to project water balance variables. The simulation was carried out under two radiative forcing pathways of Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP6.0.) Our results indicate that increased imperviousness resulted from urbanization has more impact on runoff than that of projected changes in climate. Impacts on water balance variables (runoff, ET, discharge) differed seasonally. Results showed peak surface runoff experienced changes under both emission scenarios in June up to five times increase. Among the water balance variables, ET as the least dominant pathways for water loss, showed the modest changes with the largest decrease during fall and summer. Projections indicated more frequent extreme behavior regarding precipitation, peak surface runoff, water yield (WY) and ET, during midcentury. Discharge was estimated to increase through the year and the highest changes were expected during summer and fall with 186.3% increase in November under RCP6.0. Relying on rainfall for farming along with reduced agricultural land use (11.8%) and increased urban area (47%) and population growth, would likely make the water use efficiency critical.  In our second study, we focused on the combined impact of land use and climate change on soil erosion at local scales. Topsoil loss is a widespread environmental concern causing adverse impacts on natural and human systems. Severe weather accompanied with human activities can exacerbate this issue degrading soil health and consequently accelerating global and regional food insecurity and injustice. Erosion impairs soil physical and chemical properties such as infiltration rate, water holding capacity, loss of nutrients including soil carbon and nitrogen. Although, temporal properties of a rainfall event have meaningful implications for soil erosion, spatial heterogeneity of a rainfall contributes substantially and cannot be overlooked. Therefore, in the third chapter we investigated soil loss using SWAT in Northern Mississippi. First, we built a hydrological model and calibrated it for both flow and sediment discharge. Then we developed land use and climate scenarios. The land use scenarios include farming (soybean and corn) and grazing practices. The climate scenarios comprise of four different precipitation time series, S0 which no concentration is forced, while S1, S2, and S3 have 3%, 6%, and 9% concentration in top four rainy days, respectively. We coupled the land use and climate scenarios and evaluated a small watershed (Hickahala Creek Watershed) in response. We classified the subbasins into different classes of soil loss severity and then determined the hotspots for soil loss at subbasin scale. Our result suggests that the resolution of rainfall data is crucial in studying the soil loss. We found that pasture management by itself can manifold soil loss, and if accompanied with extreme rainfalls, soil loss accelerates impacting different subbasins each time. We found that spatial heterogeneity of extreme rainfalls (ERs) can be more substantial than land use in individual extreme rainfalls; however, over a year, soil moisture and type of the management practices (grazing and farming) could contribute more to soil loss. Soil loss can go as high as 350 (ton/ha/yr) under the ERs. Adding only the management practices can increase erosion 3600%. Under S1 parts of watershed yield more than 150 ton/ha/yr (extremely severe). Under S2 and S3 more soil loss hotspots emerge yielding approximately 200 ton/ha/yr. We found that in the hotspots, up to 10% increase in CI can increase annual soil loss up to 75%. Single ER can generate up to 35% of annual soil loss. Under one ER event hotspot subbasins can lose up to 160 ton/ha/day (subbasin 15). The results reveal that adding grazing and farming (S0) under one ER event can increase soil loss by 95%. 32% and 80% increase in rainfall amount in one ER event can increase soil loss by 94% and 285% respectively. Our results suggested the importance of site-specific managements to mitigate soil loss and all the consequences. It is essential to consider the varying sensitivity of subbasins for the sustainability of agricultural landscapes.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Historical, cultural, and religious buildings and monuments frequently play an important role in everyday life.  Depending on the type of monument, they can speak to ideas such as identity, religious affiliation, or cultural heritage.  Often, these monuments represent specific ideas, beliefs, or concepts.  As physical symbols of these ideas, they are uniquely vulnerable.  Where intangible concepts themselves cannot be physically attacked, material representations of them can.  In armed conflict, it is not uncommon for these sites to become subject to the effects of combat, either deliberately or accidentally.  Throughout the history of warfare, monuments have been protected, other times, they have been intentionally attacked, and other times they were given little extra consideration over the rest of the battlefield’s topography.  What are the consequences of these various actions?  What are the military consequences when a belligerent military destroys a historical, religious, or cultural monument belonging to either belligerent or an otherwise neutral party?  What impact does the destruction have at war’s tactical, operational, or strategic levels?  These are the main questions this dissertation answers.  To answer these questions, this dissertation examines three different examples of the destruction of monuments during armed conflict throughout history.  The case studies examined include the burning of the Second Temple in Jerusalem by the Romans in 70 CE, the burning of the White House and Capitol by the British in 1814, and the bombing of the Abbey of Monte Cassino by the Allies during the Second World War.  This dissertation concludes that the destruction of monuments during armed conflict has military consequences, but they are often not significant or overwhelmingly negative for the attacker, and where more significant consequences are identified, it is difficult to assess their role in motivating particular actions.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Parrotfishes are nominal herbivores whose grazing is considered an important top-down control on benthic coral reef communities, maintaining cropped reef substrates that are conducive to the settlement and recruitment of coral larvae. As such, parrotfishes are crucial to the maintenance of reef resilience and in facilitating the recovery of reefs to healthy coral-dominated states following disturbance. Parrotfish foraging and its top-down effects on benthic coral reef communities have received substantial attention in the literature, but there are still key knowledge gaps in our understanding of parrotfish foraging ecology. The effects of grazing on benthic reef communities likely depend on how parrotfishes are using space on the reef. In many parrotfish species, large males defend intraspecific territories that include harems of initial phase females. While the social and mating systems of parrotfishes have been described for multiple parrotfish species, the effect of territoriality on space use in parrotfishes remains understudied. Likewise, the influence of spatial interactions on competition and coexistence has not been considered. In Chapter 1, we provide a general introduction to parrotfish ecology, highlighting important gaps in our understanding of parrotfish foraging, social, and spatial ecology. In Chapter 2, we investigate the occurrence of coprophagy (i.e., fecal consumption), in five Caribbean parrotfish species in Bonaire, Caribbean Netherlands. We found that coprophagy occurred frequently in four of the five most common parrotfish species in Bonaire. The majority of the feces consumed by parrotfishes were produced by planktivorous reef fishes, primarily Chromis spp. We used estimates of the carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous content of Chromis spp. feces from the literature to estimate their relative contribution to parrotfish diets, and determined that the amount of carbon obtained from these feces is equivalent to ~27 % of the carbon intake from their preferred benthic foraging substrates despite representing &lt;5% of their total bites. As such, coprophagy represents an important component of parrotfish diets. Recent studies have also highlighted the importance of microautotrophs, including cyanobacteria, to parrotfish nutrition. Cyanobacteria, including mat-forming benthic cyanobacteria, have increased in abundance on coral reefs globally, including in Bonaire. In Chapter 3, we investigate the consumption of benthic cyanobacterial mats in five Caribbean parrotfish species in Bonaire. We found that benthic cyanobacterial mats were a preferred foraging target for multiple parrotfish species, providing direct evidence in support of the recently proposed hypothesis that cyanobacteria and other microscopic photoautotrophs are the primary nutritional resource for parrotfishes. In Chapter 4, we investigate the effect of social interactions on parrotfish space use using data from concurrent GPS tracking and behavioral observations of five Caribbean parrotfish species in Bonaire. We found species-specific differences in space use among parrotfishes and that terminal phase male home ranges corresponded to largely exclusive, fixed intraspecific territories that were readily defended from intraspecific intruders. In Chapter 5, we build upon this foundation to investigate the potential role of movement and space use in mediating parrotfish coexistence. We quantified spatial interactions between parrotfishes and found that territorial intraspecific males avoided one another by reducing the spatial overlap of their home ranges, presumably a response to strong intraspecific competition. In contrast, interspecific male home ranges overlapped significantly more, suggesting the potential for dynamic interactions in shared space. We investigated dynamic interactions between pairs of simultaneously tracked interspecific males of Sparisoma viride and Scarus vetula to determine whether they move jointly, independently, or avoided one another in shared areas. We found evidence of dynamic avoidance for interspecific males that shared the most space. Movement may, therefore, play a role in limiting interference competition between competing species, particularly when sharing space is unavoidable. In Chapter 6, we assess the presence of dear enemy effects in Sp. viride. Dear enemy effects, in which territory holders interact more aggressively with strangers than with familiar neighbors, may reduce the cost of territoriality by reducing the number of energetically costly and time-consuming contests with intruders. Consistent with the dear enemy phenomenon, we found that male stoplight parrotfish, Sp. viride, interact more aggressively with non-territorial floaters than with neighbors. Aggressive interactions with territory holders also appear to drive movement and space use patterns in non-territorial males, relegating them to the boundaries between territories. Territoriality can regulate animal populations by setting the upper limits on population densities and non-territorial floaters play an important role in buffering population changes. Additionally, the constrained movement and space use that we report in the previous 3 chapters may have important implications for the functional roles of parrotfishes on coral reefs. Constraints on movement and space use result in spatially constrained grazing by parrotfishes, and may drive spatial heterogeneity in the structure and composition of benthic coral reef communities. Finally, in Chapter 7, we broadly discuss the importance of studying movement and space use to elucidate the effects of climate change on reef fish communities, including a discussion of trophic feedbacks between benthic and fish communities and the potential effects of climate change on spatial interactions and coexistence in reef fishes. As climate change continues to alter the composition of benthic communities on coral reefs, reef fish space use, which is often related to resource abundance, will also change. Altered patterns of space use may influence spatial interactions and increase competition for reduced resources (e.g., space and food), thus influencing species interactions and the composition of reef fish communities. Reef fish movement and space use may also interact with changes in benthic communities following disturbance to alter recovery trajectories. As such, baseline studies of reef fish space use, and the importance of movement and space use in mediating community structure will be important for predicting and understanding the effects of climate change on coral reefs.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Whereas it is generally accepted that theory of mind and language are related constructs, the nature of the relation remains unclear. Past research has suggested that two related, but distinct, components of theory of mind are differentially related to language. The present study attempted to clarify the relation between theory of mind and language within the context of this two-component model of theory of mind. Data from a large sample of preschool children were analyzed by utilizing a cross-lagged panel model to investigate concurrent and longitudinal relations between both theory of mind components and oral language. Results contradicted the predictions of the two-component model, however, features of the analysis prevent strong conclusions from being made about the relation between each theory of mind component and language. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) is a vascular disease that affects over 8 million Americans.  PAD patients commonly have vascular dysfunction and difficulty walking due to pain in the legs during physical exertion. Walking therapy has been recommended to improve walking performance and attenuate disease progression, but this therapy remains underutilized in PAD patients. Nutritional supplementation also has the potential to improve vascular health and walking performance, but there are few trials that combine exercise therapy and supplementation for PAD patients.  Recent evidence indicates that muscle stretching via ankle dorsiflexion splints improves vascular health and walking performance in PAD, but it is unknown how this stretching intervention affects microvascular function.  Additionally, there is some evidence to suggest that supplementation with creatine monohydrate can improve microvascular function, but it is unknown if this can enhance the effects of stretching in PAD patients.  Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of 4 weeks of a splint-based passive muscle stretching protocol with and without 4 weeks of creatine monohydrate supplementation on microvascular function, walking performance, and subjective measures of walking performance in patients with PAD.  Methods: Thirteen patients with PAD (69.2 ± 8.8 years; female = 6) were randomized to either a stretching plus creatine (Stretch + Cr) group or a stretching plus placebo (Stretch + Pl) group.  Both groups wore an ankle dorsiflexion splint for 30 minutes per day, 5 days per week for 4 weeks.  The Stretch + Cr group consumed 20 grams of creatine per day for the initial 5 days of the intervention period and 5 grams per day for the remaining days.  The Stretch + Pl group consumed the same amounts of a cellulose powder during the intervention period.  Microvascular function was assessed during a vascular occlusion test to determine the occlusion slope, reperfusion slope, and area under the curve overshoot (AUCO).  Walking performance was assessed via a six-minute walk test (6MWT) in which total walk distance (TWD) and pain-free walk distance (PFWD) were determined.  Finally, 8 participants completed the validated Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) before and after the intervention to determine subjective measures of walking distance, speed, and stair climbing.  A two-way (group x time), repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the effect of creatine (group) and stretching (time) on these outcomes.  Significance was accepted at p &lt; 0.05. Results: There were no significant differences between any baseline measurements nor protocol adherence rates between the Stretch + Cr and Stretch + Pl groups.  Additionally, there was no group x time interactions for any measured variables.  Therefore, the data for the two groups were pooled to evaluate the effects of the passive splint stretching intervention on measured variables.   Following 4 weeks of stretching, there was a significant improvement in AUCO (Pre: 11.7  5.6 %; Post: 20.4  12.2 %; p = 0.050) and TWD (Pre: 392.8  76.5 m; Post: 415.0  71.9 m; p = 0.030).  Furthermore, the occlusion slope (Pre: -0.10  0.03 %/sec; Post: -0.13  0.07 %/sec; p = 0.074), reperfusion slope (Pre: 0.59  0.31 %/sec; Post: 0.70  0.40; p = 0.063), and PFWD (Pre: 321.3  107.1 m; Post: 342.0  95.0 m; p = 0.083) approached significance. Conclusions: Four weeks of stretching improved microvascular function in PAD patients; however, creatine supplementation did not enhance these effects.  This study confirms that stretching is an effective therapy for improving vascular function and walking performance in patients with PAD.  Future studies should investigate mechanisms involved in this intervention and if combination therapies enhance outcomes.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Current U.S. energy policy, which includes wind and solar incentives, favors the increased use of renewables for power generation.  Renewable energy incentives and falling technology costs support robust growth in renewable energy resources as shares of coal and nuclear power decrease.  It is projected by the U.S. Energy Information Agency that renewable generation will supply 44% of U.S. electricity by 2050.  For wind energy, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) defines four IEC Wind Classes – Class I (High Wind), Class II (Medium Wind), Class III (Low Wind), and Class IV (Very Low Wind).  Most utility-scale wind farms are constructed at Class II or higher sites where average annual wind speeds at hub height are 8.5 m/s or greater.  To expand wind power to states like Florida, which is typically third in the nation in overall electricity consumption, it will be necessary to develop wind power at an increasing number of low and very low wind sites.  One way this development can take place is by implementing new technologies.  The Department of Energy (DOE), in Enabling Wind Power Nationwide, states that “near-future turbines” – defined as conceptual wind turbines with rotor diameters of 124 m, turbine nameplate capacities of 1.8 MW, and hub heights of 140 m – have the potential to bring wind energy to all 50 states.  This research examined ten years of hourly wind speed data collected at Florida airports to determine temporal and spatial characteristics of the wind resource.  It was found that for low and very low wind regions with large numbers of calm or sub-threshold wind speed measurements, Weibull probability distribution functions tend to overestimate wind energy production.  Three characteristic histogram shapes were identified to improve estimates.  This information was used to determine the wind energy potential for near-future turbines and to develop a conceptual structural support system. In low and very low wind regions, reduced shear turbulence and wind thrust help to reduce fatigue damage on the turbine rotors, components, and support systems.  For locations like Florida, located in coastal regions of the Atlantic Hurricane Basin with an average of 12 named storms each year, these advantages are partially offset, as design is typically governed by load cases that include tropical cyclone winds.  For turbines supported on shallow circular or octagonal foundations, common in the industry, it is essential to predict the settlement and tilt of an eccentrically loaded foundation with a soil gap to ensure stability.  Numerical modeling was performed for foundation diameter-to-thickness ratios of 5, 10, 15, and 20 to verify a new solution procedure that uses existing elastic settlement equations with the equivalent bearing area definition found in Design Guide for Wind Turbines.  Differences in modeled and calculated settlements had an MSE of less than 0.15 for all cases.  Conservative estimates of differential settlement were found using a 35% increase factor.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Polyethylenes with functional groups placed at precise locations along the backbone serve as model systems for studying the effect of co-units on crystallization behavior of polymers. Good thermal stability and high crystallinity afforded by long methylene sequences between functional groups make these polymers attractive for potential future application as sustainable alternatives to commercial polyethylenes. This Dissertation provides a comprehensive study of the influence of acetal, carbonate, and ester functional groups on self-assembly, crystalline structure, and crystallization kinetics of these polyethylene-like materials with methylene spacer lengths ranging between 6 and 48. At a fixed functional group content, crystallization and melting temperatures increase with increasing functional group interaction strength (ester &gt; carbonate &gt; acetal) and decrease with increasing functional group content within each series. Polyesters and polycarbonates have an isomorphic, polyethylene-like unit cell, enabled by dipole-dipole interactions between functional groups of adjacent chains that serve to compensate for the enthalpic penalty introduced by the presence of functional groups in the crystals. In contrast, the relatively weaker interactions and the drive for gauche bonding near acetal groups in polyacetals leads to multiple crystalline polymorphic forms depending on the crystallization temperature. 
Although the polymers investigated herein maintain many characteristics of polyethylene, unique crystallization behaviors as a result of the functional groups, and furthermore their precise placement, are also observed, for instance unexpected minima in crystallization rate with increasing isothermal crystallization temperature. This distinctive feature of the crystallization behavior observed in polyacetals is driven by polymorphism, while in polyesters and polycarbonates, minima are attributed to quantized differences in lamellar thickness. Analyses presented in this Dissertation are relevant for discerning fundamentals of self-assembly that impact structure-property relationships of sustainable and recyclable polyethylene mimics.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The continual study of shock wave boundary layer interactions (SBLIs) is driven by their presenceon the internal and external surfaces of transonic, supersonic, and hypersonic flight vehicles. SBLIs
manifest in a myriad of practical high-speed flight scenarios, such as supersonic engine inlets,
launch vehicle booster separation, transonic wings, and aircraft-store interactions during carriage
and release. These interactions incite numerous consequences to the operation of high-speed vehicles
and their components. They cause highly unsteady mechanical-thermal loads that threaten the
aerostructural integrity, cause flow separation that increases drag, and induce pitching moments
causing undesirable changes to the vehicle trajectory. Current strategies to address the SBLI related
issues have led to flight envelope reduction and over-design of the aircraft components. Study of SBLIs
have been the focus of numerous experimental and computational investigations using canonical
geometries that simplify the complex real-flow configurations. Analysis of two-dimensional (2-D)
canonical SBLIs has laid a strong foundation on which advanced three-dimensional (3-D) interaction
studies have continued to build. However, the same cannot be said for axisymmetric SBLIs,
which have received little attention compared to their 2-D and 3-D counterparts.
The present work investigates the flowfield of an inviscid-viscous interaction between a planar
oblique shock wave, generated by an off-body wedge, and the turbulent boundary layer on an ogive
nose-cone cylinder (axisymmetric) body. Investigating SBLIs on curved surfaces is pertinent to the
evolution of high-speed flight, because they simulate real-flight bodies and interactions that many
traditional 2-D and 3-D configurations do not. Literature has yet to bridge the gap between 2-D,
3-D and axisymmetric SBLIs, as the few axisymmetric SBLI studies that do exist only offer a glance
at the flow topology and mean flow behavior with limited analysis. A comprehensive understanding
of axisymmetric SBLIs requires that a few core questions be answered.
1) Are the SBLI flow features on axisymmetric bodies the same or different from the well-studied
2-D/3-D canonical flows?
2) Are the scaling (spatial/temporal) parameters identified for 2-D or 3-D SBLI flows valid for
curved surface interactions?
3) How do key flow parameters, such as interaction strength, Mach number, and Reynolds number
affect the axisymmetric SBLI flow physics?
The present research was conducted at the Florida State University Polysonic Wind Tunnel
located at the Florida Center for Advanced Aero-Propulsion. Advanced flow diagnostics were carried
out with an aim to characterize the principal off-body flow features and on-surface interactions
from an incident-reflection shock wave on an ogive-nose cylinder body. Measurements involved
mean flow topology from oil-based paint and high-speed shadowgraph, time-averaged surface pressures
using an electronic pressure scanner (ESP), and pressure sensitive paint (PSP), and unsteady
pressures using fast-response Kulite pressure sensors. Flow conditions were established at various
Mach number (M∞ = 2–4) and wedge deflection angle (δ = 10◦ – 25◦) combinations at a constant
Reynolds number (Re ≈ 9.09x105). Body forces were also measured at a few selected conditions
using an internal six-component strain gauge balance.
Shadowgraph images revealed a diverse mean flowfield with several shock-based interactions.
At lower Mach numbers the separation shock was observed having an unsteady component as
it oscillated along the ϕ = 0◦ meridian. Oil flow visualizations showed that the surface flow is
windward symmetric and highly three-dimensional, as the flow topology varies significantly based
on the streamwise and azimuthal positioning. The number of separation lines present on the surface
is a result of the SBLI strength. Primary separation lines wrap nonlinearly around the model surface
independently of flow conditions, and secondary separation lines are decoupled in interactions with
small wedge angles. A region of vortices (VR) exists between the primary and secondary separation
lines. Results of the mean pressure distributions complimented by surface flow streamlines indicate
that the region of vortical flow is open-type and develops on the curved surface, similar to the
separation region seen in single blunt-fin SBLI flows. The VR grows non-linearly in size with the
smallest in length along the windward meridian (the side facing the shock generator).
A length-scale suitable for defining shock induced interactions for axisymmetric bodies still
remains unknown, but similarities between the axisymmetric windward plane flow and 2-D SBLI
show potential adaptation. Mean surface pressures from ESP and PSP match very well, provide
quantitative pressure maps, and support the flow features observed using flow visualization. Flow
separation on the surface is driven by pressure gradients caused by both the impingement of the
oblique shock and the curvature of the body. Unlike 2-D and 3-D SBLI the separation region is
only detected in the windward plane, as the nature of its three-dimensionality remains unclear.
Unsteady pressure measurements reveal that the SBLI features broadband pressure fluctuations
beneath the separation shock foot and flow reattachment regions. Pressure fluctuations indicate
that the flow is most energized near the separation shock foot and the isotropic node, and loses
energy nonlinearly with distance from the interaction regions. As with 2-D SBLI, the windward
flow is largely influenced by low frequency energy content. Both the distribution and magnitude of
flow energy are significantly affected by proximity to the SBLI region location and length scales.
Spectral analysis shows that although the wedge angle and Mach number influence the energy
magnitude in a single flow region, the energy distribution remains unchanged. It also shows that
the overall energy levels decrease at higher Mach numbers, and increase with the wedge angle.
This dissertation offers a significant contribution to the understanding of the underlying flow
physics associated with incident-reflection SBLI on an axisymmetric body. It has answered a few
fundamental questions, provided new insights into the introductory flow dynamics, and established
key parametric relationships. Although the continuation of this work remains challenging, the
use of high-fidelity experimental techniques, along with validated numerical tools, will expand the
understanding of 3-D flow complexities, and move towards future designs of high-speed flight control
mechanisms.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Mobility and access are the two essential criteria for evaluating any mode of transportation. A private vehicle comes at the top when we think about mobility and access. But 
an increase in the utilization of private vehicles has many drawbacks, such as an increase in 
traffic congestion, air pollution, fuel consumption, etc., which also affect public health. It is 
essential to provide an efficient public transportation system to minimize these effects, especially 
in urban areas. Bus transportation is one of the significant modes of transport with a good 
capacity compared to private vehicles, but there is a need to compromise for access. Bus 
transportation is an essential mode of transportation for students, faculty, and staff, especially to 
travel to, around, and from school and work. It is always necessary that buses reach the stop on 
time and service all the passengers waiting at the stop, considering peak hour demands and 
potential uncertainties in transportation time. To achieve such an objective, it is essential to 
improve the serviceability of the bus transportation network. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study focuses on improving the operations of the Florida State University (FSU) campus bus service, Seminole Express, for the ―INNOVATION‖ bus route in Tallahassee, 
Florida (USA). The ―INNOVATION‖ bus route service connects the main FSU campus with the 
FAMU-FSU College of Engineering and is heavily used by the FSU students. A simulation 
model is built using the FlexSim simulation software to emulate the operations of the 
―INNOVATION‖ bus route service to determine the required number of buses to be deployed. 
An excessive number of buses may increase the operational costs and idling time. In the 
meantime, an insufficient number of buses will cause significant waiting times at the bus stop, 
which are not desirable as some students may be late for their classes. The developed simulation 
model will assist with effectively planning the bus route connecting the main FSU campus with 
the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering by providing solutions with adequate waiting time and 
operational costs</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Research has shown that during this time of development, adolescents may encounter obstacles in navigating sexuality, identity, academics, and friendships that can exacerbate risk-taking behavior (WHO, 2018; WHO, 2011). Adolescents tend to participate in higher levels of risky behaviors (i.e., unprotected sex, substance use, and violence) compared to individuals over the age of 21 (Duell et al., 2018; Reniers et al., 2016). School and parental connectedness are significant protective factors for health, school success, and overall well-being (Hay et al., 2016).  Adolescents who feel a greater connection to their home and school communities are less likely to face damaging health outcomes (i.e., sexually transmitted infections [STI], drug abuse, death) connected to substance use, sexual risk, violence, and mental health (CDC, 2019a).  Therefor aim of the current study was to examine whether school and parental connectedness in a preadolescent population delays onset of risk behaviors (e.g., initiation of sexual intercourse, initiation of drug, alcohol and tobacco use).  The research was conducted using previously collected data from 1115 African American pre-adolescents (age 9-12 at study entry) and their primary caregivers, who were followed longitudinally for three years as part of the Parents Matter! project.  The study was conducted using structural equational modeling (SEM) and path analysis to answer the research following questions: (1) Is there an association between school connectedness and risk-taking behavior (i.e., risky sexual behavior and alcohol and drug use) among African American youth?, (2) Is there an association between parental connectedness and risk-taking behavior (i.e., risky sexual behavior and alcohol and drug use) among African American youth?, (3)Does school connectedness moderate the relationship between parental connectedness and risk-taking behaviors for African American preadolescents?, (4) Does gender moderate the relationship between parental connectedness and risk-taking behaviors for African American preadolescents?, and (5) Does SES moderate the relationship between parental connectedness and risk-taking behaviors for African American preadolescents? Each research question was examined from two perspectives: the perspective of the parent and the perspective of the preadolescent. 
Results from analyses indicated a significant association between school connectedness and risk-taking behaviors for both the preadolescent and parent models, although the correlation was in opposite directions (i.e., negative correlation for preadolescents, positive correlations for parents) (Research Question 1). The results also revealed a significant correlation between parental connectedness and risk-taking behavior (Research Question 2). Gender moderated a significant correlation between parental connectedness and risk-taking behavior according to parent reports, however the preadolescent model only indicated a significant correlation for females as it pertains to parental connectedness and risk-taking behavior in African American preadolescents (Research Question 4). SES moderated a significant relationship between parental connectedness and child sexual behavior in all three SES categories in the parent model and in the low SES category in the preadolescent model. The preadolescent model also a revealed significant correlation between parental connectedness and substance use in the Low and Moderate SES categories (Research Question5). Results  for both parent and preadolescent models yielded no significant correlation when school connectedness moderated the relationship between parental connectedness and risk-taking behavior (Research Question 3).  
The results of this study offer significant additions to the field of psychology, particularly within the treatment and study of risk-taking behavior reduction in African American preadolescents.  Limitations regarding sampling, measures, and data analyses were taken into consideration when analyzing the results and implications of the study. Implications associated with theory, future research, and clinical practice were taken into consideration.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Prior research has noted the unique interpersonal, affective, lifestyle, and antisocial factors associated with psychopathic personality traits (Hare, 1990; Cooke &amp; Michie, 2001; Hare, 2003; Hare, 2010; Skeem &amp; Cooke, 2010).  In line with these findings, life-course research has noted the link between psychopathic personality characteristics and life-course offending outcomes (Moffitt, Caspi, Harrington, &amp; Milne, 2002; Farrington, 2006; Hare, 2009; Moffitt et al., 2011; Beaver et al., 2014).  Considerably less research, however, has examined potential psychosocial factors that may moderate the associations between psychopathic personality characteristics and life-course offending outcomes. This dissertation will address these gaps in the literature by examining associations between psychopathic personality characteristics and offending outcomes, while controlling for potential psychosocial moderating factors. The results reveal that psychopathic personality characteristics are associated with offending outcomes. Additionally, the findings indicate that the relationship between psychopathic personality characteristics and offending outcomes is moderated by several psychosocial factors. The implications of these findings are discussed in reference to theory, policy implications, and future research.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>	In an era of increasing weather extremes, it is important to understand how best to encourage pro-environmental behaviors related to climate change risk mitigation. Protection Motivation Theory offers insight into the factors most relevant to addressing environmental threats. Experiential learning provides insight into how immersive technology may impact learning outcomes. Other factors are known to influence learning and behavior in this context, including the technology adopted to create and consume learning materials about climate change.	To explore the impact of system immersion, the current study relied on two distinct treatment groups, one relying on a laptop with a flat screen to consume the instructional media and one relying on a virtual reality headset to consume the instructional media. Neither treatment group showed significant improvements in the learning outcomes under investigation: knowledge recall of climate change risk mitigation behaviors or perception of learning effectiveness. The study results indicate consuming the media through a flat screen is effective for improving a learner’s threat and coping appraisal, though not effective for improving the intention to adopt risk mitigation behaviors. The VR headset did not appear effective at improving either of these behavior outcomes.
	The study results suggest 360° microlearning content is most effective for encouraging behavior changes when viewed on a flat screen. Yet small effect sizes and low statistical power indicate the results are not reliable and further research is needed to define the relationships and impacts of the factors under review in this study. Open science protocols, including consistent definitions, measures, and analysis tools, can ensure future research is comparable to the current study and the body of knowledge for immersive learning technologies is built on a solid foundation.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>At the end of World War I, why did Germany’s surface ship sailors embrace and spread the cause of moderate revolution, rather than embrace either a radical, Bolshevik style of revolution or fight the revolution altogether? War weariness, in the absence either of a tightly knit and anti-revolutionary view forged by frequent military action experienced by frontline U-boat crews, or the particular code of honor of the naval leadership, prompted sailors to pursue this course. The wartime experience starting in 1914 proved crucial to shaping the responses of naval personnel to revolution from the start of the sailor uprising in October and November 1918 through the survival of the new republic against the communist Spartacus uprising of 1919 and counterrevolutionary Kapp Putsch of 1920. Generally speaking, the surface sailors, in contrast to U-boat crews or naval leaders in the officer corps or high command, sought a moderate space for soldiers, workers, and sailors to have a voice through councils that supported reformist, electoral politics in a post-Kaiser republic. The surface sailors navigated a middle ground between weak communist forces and counterrevolutionaries who saw moderate and communist revolutionaries as people cut from the same cloth who had to be stopped by any means necessary.  </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Over the past few decades, numerical weather prediction (NWP) models (and by extension human forecasts) have evolved markedly due to better meteorological understanding, improved observations, data assimilation, physics parameterization, and increased model resolution (Simmons and Hollingsworth 2001, Elsberry 2013, Landsea and Cangialosi 2018). This includes operational modeling of tropical cyclones (TCs), which were poorly resolved in the mid-1990’s but are currently well-resolved in mesoscale models and even some global models. Despite these improvements, there are still cases of large model forecast error and ensemble disagreement (e.g. Sandy 2012, Joaquin 2015, Matthew 2016, Florence 2018). It is important to know if these model improvements are coincident with less frequent poor TC model forecasts over time. In other words, are large model forecast error events becoming less frequent as models have improved? Identification of recurring synoptic environments in which these poor model forecasts occur is also important not only from a meteorological understanding point of view, but also to aid the forecasters to identify in advance of such forecast meteorological setups.Accordingly, the focus of this study is to evaluate how the National Centers for Environmental Prediction’s (NCEP’s) Global Forecast System (GFS) and Global Ensemble Forecast System ensemble mean (GEFSM) have improved with respect to TC track forecasting over the past two decades, and quantify whether the frequency of truly poor forecasts (e.g. 90th percentile track error) has changed over that period of time. Using the National Hurricane Center’s (NHC’s) archived model run (advisory files) and verified data (best track files) for the years 2005 through 2020, track errors for the GFS and GEFSM were calculated and statistically analyzed. From those statistics, all forecasts with track error at or above the 90th percentile were identified and the climatology of those forecasts over the years was developed. A comparison between the GFS and GEFSM was also conducted to further evaluate the evolution of TC forecast error over time given the improvements to the GEFS have not been coincident with the GFS. Lastly, spatiotemporal patterns of both track error and synoptic-scale setups common to those cases of poor model performance were identified and subjectively evaluated. 
This analysis found there was no statistically significant trend in the frequency of these poor GFS track forecasts between 2005 and 2020. However, there was a statistically significant trend in the frequency of poor GEFSM track forecasts. Across the 16 seasons, when the monthly distribution of the worst 10% of track forecasts was normalized by the monthly distribution of all forecasts made (i.e., removing the seasonal cycle), there was not a particular month during which significantly more poor GFS or GEFSM track forecasts occurred. 
A comparison between the average track error of the GFS and GEFSM showed that on average there was smaller GFS mean track error through 72-hour forecasts. Beyond 78 hours, the GEFSM on average outperformed (had smaller track error) than the GFS. Geographically, both models produced poor forecasts for storms in the same month and general basin location. When analyzing the cases in which one of the models, rather than both, produced inaccurate track forecasts, it was found that a considerably large number of poor forecasts were made in the area between 20°N and 24.9°N, 65°W and 69.9°W by either one of the models, a region of the Atlantic basin in which many TCs recurve as the mean flow changes and vertical shear increases.
Finally, the synoptic environments in which these poor forecasts occurred were evaluated. Patterns in the orientations of the forecast and observed tracks in the 90th percentile of track error were analyzed and grouped into four categories: vertical ladder, horizontal ladder, funnel, and timing error. In addition, synoptic-scale features potentially related to these large error patterns, such as the subtropical high and the presence of other TCs, were analyzed.   </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The written record of music (the score) has an extremely important role in the development of music in its various forms of action in society, with the editor being the professional responsible for preparing the musical text to be published, to be made available to society, they are the bridge between the composer and the reader.This treatise aims the development of a guide to the guitarist editor based on the practices and standards of the philology area. Philology is the area of science that deals with the study of text, from its origin to its impact on society, the preparation of texts is one of the branches of philology, our objective is to adapt philological editing methods to the music area, comparing and taking advantage of the methods already used by music editors.

            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of Florida’s Best and Brightest Teacher Scholarship on the retention rates of “High-Quality” Teachers. In 2015, the state provided $44 million for recruitment and retention bonuses of $10,000. In subsequent years, the program was reduced in size of award until ultimately canceled in 2020. The program used teachers’ SAT or ACT scores (specifically if their score was above the 80th percentile) to determine if a teacher would qualify for the award. If they were not a new teacher, they would submit a combination of SAT/ACT scores and their principal’s evaluation. I use logistic regression to estimate the influence the policy had on the rates of retention. I do not address the effects on recruitment due to sample size limitations. Further, I estimate if the program was more influential based on the subjects that teachers were certified to teach and defined by Florida as critical shortage areas subjects. Finally, I report on the differential rates of retention as the size of the award varied after the decrease in award amount. The findings are that the teacher scholarship was related to an increase in retention for critical shortage area subject teachers who received the award, as well as the entire sample of educators who received the award. No effects were found for early career teachers. The policy implications are addressed, and future research avenues are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Mindsets have been gaining popularity recently in the field of second language acquisition (SLA). There have been studies exploring language mindsets in relation to emotions such as anxiety and fear of failure (e.g., Lou &amp; Noels, 2017), anxiety, rejection sensitivity, contact avoidance, and willingness to interact (e.g., Lou &amp; Noels, 2020a), language anxiety, use of language, and reported language proficiency (e.g., Lou &amp; Noels, 2020b), anxiety and confidence (e.g., Ozdemir &amp; Papi, 2021), and L2 grit (e.g., Khajavy, et al., 2020; Teimouri, et al., 2022). Although these studies help scholars to understand the relationship between mindsets and emotions, there is a gap in the literature of SLA in terms of language mindsets intervention. There are only a few studies implementing an intervention to change students’ language mindsets in the field of psychology (e.g., Lou &amp; Noels, 2016, 2020a). In order to fill in the gap of the lack of intervention studies in the field of SLA, the current study implemented a language mindset intervention with international graduate students to change their fixed language mindsets to growth language mindsets. For this purpose, 108 participants were recruited for Phase 1 of the study. Out of 108 participants, 61 of them were eligible to take part in Phase 2. However, 60 participants’ data were analyzed because 1 participant wanted to skip the writing part, which was part of the intervention and the manipulation check. Out of 60 participants, 57 of them were willing to participate in Phase 3. The results revealed that fixed language mindset predicted L2 speaking anxiety, whereas growth language mindset was a predictor of L2 enjoyment. There was a significant change in language speaking performance for the growth language mindset condition in terms of lexical and syntactic errors and fillers. The use of errors and fillers decreased in the growth language mindset condition. On the other hand, there was an increase in lexical diversity in the fixed language mindset condition. Theoretical and educational implications will be discussed.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This qualitative study explores a pedagogical approach that centered participants' epistemic authority to select the ways of knowing and focus for their practices of science. Guided by Black feminist theory, the program facilitators and participants engaged multiple cultural practices to (re)define science practices and (re)center participants’ intersectional identities within the praxis of a liberatory and loving pedagogy. Participants explored and challenged their initial ideas of science as the group collectively considered diverse ways of knowing and spent time in reflection around practices of inquiry that are not typically recognized as science. Then, to support the science identity development of participants, facilitators engaged participants in designing and enacting science inquiries to provide opportunities for science performance, recognition, and competence. Participants concluded the program with reflections on the experience and the tools they gained, including their perspectives on themselves as science people. Through the methodology of portraiture, participants and researcher together explored and organized three stories that attend to details within lived experiences, including actions, emotions, and thoughts. The portraits are organized around the themes of science identity, race, and gender and attend to the relational elements that position participants as knowledge holders and science people. This critical study may benefit others by showing how epistemic injustice in science education can be healed within learning contexts that attend to power and justice. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In groundwater modeling, the term “post audit” refers to a method of verifying simulated (predicted) data produced by a groundwater model against analogous measured data. According to Anderson et. al., (2015), evaluation of model performance includes two components: a “hard knowledge” evaluation which compares direct field measurements with simulated values; and a “soft knowledge” evaluation of the conceptual flow model. This two-pronged approach applies relevant concepts from the literature, site conditions, hydrogeological principles, and professional experience to comprehensively evaluate the suitability of model assumptions, parameters, and performance with respect to the hydrogeologic system, purpose of investigation, and available resources. If a model fails to achieve an acceptable history-match with measured data or applies unreasonable calibration parameters, the model must be modified or discarded (Anderson et. al., 2015). Of course, a universal standard of what may be considered “suitable” or “reasonable” in groundwater modeling is not possible, as any interpretations made to this effect inherently depend upon the hydrogeologist’s experience with the problem at hand. Therefore, any such interpretations must be substantiated by quality data, and include the caveat that human error may give rise to inherent or random bias in these interpretations.  In the interest of supporting environmental management efforts, the subject thesis investigation is a post audit of the Davis subregional groundwater flow model, which evaluates the accuracy of model-predicted discharge at Wakulla Spring from 2010 through 2018. This investigation is structured with the intent to resolve causal mechanisms of anomalous discharge trends at Wakulla Springs over time. Parameters compared for this evaluation were selected based on the model purpose and model calibration approach. These parameters include simulated and measured spring discharge at Wakulla Spring’s main vent, plus simulated and measured hydraulic heads from 4 wells close to Wakulla Springs from 2010 through 2018. The quantitative accuracy of model-predicted discharge and hydraulic head is evaluated by applying standard statistical methods in groundwater modeling. The Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient and the Root Mean Square Error for model “residuals” (measured values minus simulated values) describe error associated with model-predicted spring discharge and hydraulic head values, respectively. Model error statistics are considered with respect to the model purpose, design, and observed system behavior. Results of the post audit evaluation culminate in two main conclusions which support model updates to optimize utility and overall accuracy of the subregional model, rendering a robust tool in support of conservation and water resource planning near Wakulla Springs. 
Based on evaluation of post audit results and hydrologic data, it is proposed that recharge rate simulated simulated during stress periods 50 and 54 (corresponding to years 2010 and 2014) in the numerical model should be updated to reflect all sources of recharge in the groundwater contribution area. This update is suggested in accordance with observed changes in permitted wastewater discharges in the immediate recharge area for Wakulla Springs between 2010 and 2014. Additionally, the conceptual model of groundwater flow may benefit from an update that accounts for two mechanisms that are unique to hydrologic conditions of the study area. These mechanisms include anthropogenic drivers of system recharge, and conduit flows associated with karst lake dry down events during times of seasonal drought. 
These conclusions are significant because they optimize the potential for future application of this model to relevant management issues; offer a mechanistic understanding of anomalous flow trends observed in recent years at Wakulla Springs; and demonstrate the sensitivity of first magnitude karst springs to anthropogenic inputs.  </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The COVID-19 pandemic was a unique phenomenon that significantly impacted higher education. Programmatic grants were an important source of funding at community colleges during this unusual time, helping to provide vital resources and support services to institutions and their students. This study is one of the first of its kind to explore the utilization and impact of programmatic grants at Florida College System institutions during the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic between March 2020-August 2021. The data sources for this study are the directors of the grants offices of the colleges that make up the Florida College System. Using a survey method design, I investigated how Florida College System institutions utilized programmatic grant funding during the pandemic, the impact of this grant funding, and the potential sustainability of these grant programs. I found that Florida College System institutions are most likely to have used grant funds during the pandemic on Scholarships and Technology/Distance Learning Support. Most Florida College System institutions indicated they received a larger amount of programmatic grant funding during the COVID-19 pandemic as compared to before the pandemic. I also found that the most common impact of programmatic grants during the pandemic was the expansion of student support services. Federal and state governments were the most common sources of programmatic grant funding at Florida College System institutions during the 2020-2021 pandemic. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Laura Greenfield and Karen Rowen argue that in order to realize the change potential within tutor education, writing center directors must look critically at how we have been designing and executing our tutor education courses. This dissertation addresses the call to examine the additional factors on which tutor education can be structured or restructured and what ideologies about language, and specifically second-language use, inhibit writing center administrators ability to decouple tutor-training from the unidirectional monolinguistic ideals that have historically been at the center of writing instruction. As one site of both language instruction and writing support, writing centers are an optimal space to analyze the assumptions that administrators and tutors bring to working with multilingual students. The writing center tutor education course is often where tutors learn the tacit theories that tell them what is “right” or “normal” in the writing center. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>I followed Johanek’s (2000) lead in adopting an epistemologically mixed approach to this study. By “epistemologically mixed,” I mean it accounts for multiple ways of knowing. This study uses CDA as its methodological grounding because it takes into account the social act of knowing and enables a researcher to analyze linguistic and semiotic details in light of larger social and political or, in the case of my study, institutional contexts. Huckin et al. (2012) describes critical discourse analysis “as an interdisciplinary approach to textual study that aims to explicate abuses of power promoted by those texts, by analyzing linguistic/semiotic details in light of the larger social and political contexts in which those texts circulate” (p. 107). Because I examined the attitudes and expectations about second language writing through the use of interviews, it was essential that this research was grounded in a methodology that accounts for both the context and theory.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study has three key findings: (a) writing Center Administrators who had experience in either linguistics or TESOL took a more second language studies approach while those that had little or no formal preparation in TESOL or linguistics took a more translingual approach to working on language diversity; (b) when writing center administrators lacked expertise in expertise in the very areas that their L2/ESL/residential multilingual students need they have a tendency to hook onto the agendas that they can understand; and (c) one of the central reasons that writing center administrators are hesitant to train tutors to offer linguistic feedback is because they are afraid of being labeled as racist, or not anti-racist enough. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Ramos Mariachi Violin Method treatise is an overview of Books 1 and 2 of an original violin teaching method. These method books teach violin and Spanish language vocal technique through carefully paced mariachi and Spanish language children’s songs. Each song serves a pedagogical function and teaches incrementally paced violin skills such as bow strokes, left hand finger dexterity, sound quality, bow articulation, rhythm, and intonation. In addition to teaching violin pedagogy, the Ramos Mariachi Violin Method prepares the student to sing and perform violin on each song. Upon completing this method’s series of books, the violin student will have developed a solid foundation of violin skills that fosters the musicianship and technical proficiency that is essential to violin playing. In addition, these same students will learn to sing Spanish language mariachi songs, preparing them with the ensemble and vocal skills necessary to sing and play mariachi music with a full band. In this way, students can learn to play the violin, while simultaneously celebrating mariachi music and Mexican culture.     </DISS_para>

The primary topics that were discussed in this study were (a) cultural awareness, (b) stigmas of therapy within the African American community, and (c) historical realities vs. popular myths. The content analysis used 6 research questions with 10 African American music therapists in the Southeastern, Mid-Atlantic, and Southwestern regions. There were multiple variables found among the respondents related to the themes of these interviews. These issues are discussed and illustrated with examples drawn from the interview transcripts.  </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Compared to Islamic terrorism, right-wing domestic terrorism is relatively understudied, even though right-wing domestic terrorism claims more lives in the United States and the frequency of these incidents is increasing (Jones, 2018; Jones, Doxsee, &amp; Harrington, 2020). This study addressed the gap in knowledge of understanding how media outlets frame right-wing domestic terrorism in the initial days of coverage. Understanding how the media frames the issue of right-wing domestic terrorism is vital, as framing can influence how an audience comprehends an issue and what the possible solutions might be. To understand this media framing, this study employed a longitudinal qualitative and quantitative content analysis of right-wing domestic terrorism media framing in local and national newspapers. The use of these two methods allots both a micro and macro analysis and in turn a more well-rounded understanding of right-wing domestic terrorism media framing. The quantitative content analysis examined national and local newspaper coverage of right-wing domestic terrorism incidents and found several differences in framing between these outlets. The qualitative content analysis examined seven right-wing domestic terrorism incidents in national newspaper coverage and found twenty unique major frames. The frequency of use of these frames changed between incidents and a longitudinal trend of increasing frame usage was found. Differences in frame usage suggests that frames are competing for visibility and there is not one narrative utilized in a right-wing domestic terrorism context. This study represents the first large scale, multi-incident, analysis of right-wing domestic terrorism media framing and is a vital first step in understanding the media terrorism relationship within this context.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>	Information that changes is often recalled worse than information that does not change, such that memory interference is observed (Anderson &amp; Neely, 1996). However, studies using the A-B, A-D paradigm have revealed that when reminding occurs during the encoding of changed information and is recollected at test, it can result in memory facilitation, such that changed information is recalled better than control information that is only presented once (Wahlheim &amp; Jacoby, 2013). One possibility is that reminding allows for memory integration, which in turn produces the facilitation observed in prior work. Memory integration allows us to make sense of new information in our daily lives, and has significant implications for the field of education (Bauer, Esposito, &amp; Daly, 2020). Although reminding appears necessary for memory integration to occur, reminding alone does not appear sufficient. The aim of the present studies was to better understand the factors and mechanisms underpinning the relationship between reminding and integration. Although animacy status has appeared to be an important factor for integration in previous studies (Schreiner, Meiser, &amp; Bröder, 2022), Experiment 1 found that animate and inanimate cue words did not differ in reminding during encoding, reminding recollection at test, nor in evidence of integration. Experiment 2 suggested that measuring reminding through mental imagery reports better captured integration relative to asking a direct question about reminding, and provided a new method of investigating the relationship between reminding and integration. Experiments 3 and 4 found that reminding occurred in an open-loop paradigm, but critically, found that an increased rate of reminding in that paradigm did not predict increased evidence for memory integration, and provided mixed evidence for a correlation between event structure awareness and memory integration. Taken together, the results of these experiments deepen the current understanding of the human memory system by providing support for the notion that reminding is necessary but not sufficient for memory integration, and providing new methods for investigating reminding and integration that can be used in new paradigms.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study explores the project-based learning (PjbL) of middle school teachers by examining their instructional context and the project design and management strategies they used to implement PjbL. The significance of this study is to provide middle school teachers with greater perception, insight, and strategies about how the quality of their PjbL practice can be calibrated and improved. A purposeful sample of five middle school teachers across English Language Arts (ELA), mathematics, and career and technical education (CTE) courses participated.  The research questions guiding this study were:
Research Question 1. What are the contextual factors under which middle school teachers implement PjbL? 
Research Question 2. What design and management strategies do middle school teachers use to implement PjbL? 
The project design elements and teaching practices listed in the Gold Standard Project-based Learning model were used to describe each case. Evidence shows that all the elements and teaching practices listed in the Gold Standard Project-based Learning model appeared to some degree in each case. Three context-specific themes: curriculum, pedagogy, and structural, were also identified. 
Findings from this study contribute to the ongoing discussion of effective PjbL practice, illustrate the complexities of designing and managing PjbL, and can used to inform future research of PjbL.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Elementary school children with academic challenges are often provided special education services. These services are meant to support children in their academic goals, through either academic intervention (e.g., reading or math) or physical aids (e.g., extra test time, larger fonts). Being classified as eligible for receiving special education services has been shown to be associated with a child’s mental health. One potential outcome is higher levels of anxiety. Children worry about their academic disparity and about how they may be ostracized from their peers, given their label of requiring special education. All these factors could increase their risk for developing higher levels of anxiety. To explore associations of special education participation and anxiety in children, I used archival elementary grades follow up data from a larger intervention study conducted with children during preschool; the follow up outcome of interest is child anxiety symptoms as rated through parent report. The data were analyzed through three ANCOVAs to explore the relationship between special education classifications and anxiety levels. I found non-significant results between children receiving special education classifications of any kind on parent-reported anxiety levels. When I compared individual classifications clusters to no special education classifications, I found significant results between children who were classified as having a combination of physical and cognitive special education classifications on parent-reported anxiety levels. Lastly, I found non-significant results for the relation between the age children began receiving special education classifications and anxiety levels. All of this concludes in a complex picture of special education classifications on parent-reported anxiety levels. Further research is required to discover if special education classifications work as a protective factor or a risk factor for child anxiety levels. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Cells sense the mechanical properties of their environment through physical engagement and spreading, with high stiffness driving nuclear translocation of the mechanosensitive transcription factor YAP. Restriction of cell spread area or environmental stiffness both inhibit YAP activation and nuclear translocation.  The Arp2/3 complex plays a critical role in cell spreading, protrusion, and migration. While YAP activation has been closely linked to cellular spreading, the specific role of the Arp2/3 complex in force buildup and YAP activation is unclear. To assess the role of Arp2/3 in this process, we measured cell spreading, YAP nuclear translocation, force on the adhesion adaptor protein Talin (FRET tension sensor), and extracellular forces (traction force microscopy, TFM) in 3T3 cells with and without inhibition of Arp2/3. The results indicate that YAP activation still occurs with reduced cell spreading. Interestingly, while actin de-branching resulted in decreased force on talin on stiff glass surfaces, relatively little change in average traction stress was observed on the softer TFM substrates. While cell spreading is a driver of YAP nuclear translocation, this is likely through indirect effects.  Changes in cell spreading induced by Arp2/3 inhibition do not significantly perturb YAP activation.  Additionally, this work provides evidence that focal adhesion and cytoskeletal forces are less direct regulators of YAP activation than previously thought.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Academic innovation centers (AICs) are a new phenomenon that are being invested in by higher education institutions. As they are a new type of information center, Library and Information Science (LIS) researchers can revisit past LIS approaches in this new setting. Surveys of these centers have been investigated for their service offerings creating a nascent method of characterization. This LIS research explores this new research setting through the lens of the undergraduate student worker using narrative analysis methods. The library undergraduate worker has a limited depth of study within LIS research. This exploratory research repositions student workers’ agency to an elevated level for the understanding and development of academic innovation centers. These findings represent often silent voices of information center partnerships that bring added value to the higher education experience. This research highlights the developing perspective of undergraduate pre-professional leadership activities along with the theoretical basis of Constructionism Leadership.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Liquid helium-4 undergoes a phase transition below about 2.17 K where it is called the superfluid (He II). He II is a non-classical fluid which is one of the very few macroscopic manifestation of the quantum mechanics. He II entails several bizarre properties including an extremely low kinematic viscosity. Due to this, He II has been proposed as an exceptional working fluid for turbulence research. The primary goal of the current thesis is to design a pioneering experiments to investigate the possibility and potential non-classical behavior of a law of the wall scaling in turbulent He II pipe flow. Here we report assembling a 5-m long He II flow facility so-called Liquid Helium Flow Visualization Facility which can generate He II turbulent flows with Reynolds numbers ($Re$) larger than a million. Inside an optically-accessible square flow pipe of $2 \times 2$ cm$^2$ cross-section, we generate fully-turbulent He II forced flows using an automated bellows-linear actuator pump. We also report the incorporation of a quantitative flow visualization technique called molecular tagging velocimetry (MTV) using metastable triplet helium molecules as tracers. This visualization technique is based on a combination of a femtosecond laser-field ionization together with a 905-nm laser-induced fluorescence scheme to generate and illuminate the metastable helium molecules, respectively. We have designed and implemented a novel optical system to guide and satisfy the optical criteria for visualization of He II. Using this one-of-a-kind facility, we report the first quantitative flow visualization study of the law of the wall in He II turbulent pipe flow. We acquire the mean velocity profile near the wall region using a robust image processing algorithm, specifically developed for the type of images we acquire in our flow pipe and we compare it with the existing data in classical fluid research. Our data shows the existence of a logarithmic profile of ``the near-wall mean velocity profile in turbulent pipe flow (NVP) in He II". By fitting the velocity profile using the law of the wall formula, we determined the two fitting coefficients including the von K\'arm\'an coefficient $\kappa$ and the additive constant $B$ in He II. We also conducted a comprehensive uncertainty analysis of data to evaluate the associated error. It turns out $\kappa=0.160\pm 0.015$ and $\kappa=0.154\pm 0.010$, and $B=-23.2\pm 0.4$ and $B=-24.0\pm 0.4$ for $Re_D=1.01\times 10^6$ and $Re_D=1.21\times 10^6$, respectively. On the other hand, the values of these two constants in classical turbulent pipe flow are determined about $\kappa=(0.37-0.42)$ and $B=(4-6)$. This significant difference suggests that the non-classical properties of He II affects the velocity profile in extremely high $Re$ He II pipe flow. This deviation from classical turbulence is of great significance for future numerical research as well as engineering designs of the He II pipe systems.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Prospective memory, the ability to remember and carry out an intention in the future, is crucial for maintaining health, independence, and social connections. Wearable technologies, such as smartwatches, have the potential to serve as effective prospective memory aids, but little is known about how older adults, particularly those with cognitive impairment, might interact with such devices. This study aimed to 1) understand the types of challenges older adults with a diverse range of cognitive abilities experience when using a smartwatch, and 2) gain an initial understanding of the potential for smartwatches to serve as a prospective memory aid for this population. Participants included 27 older adults (age 60+) with normal cognitive functioning and those with cognitive impairment due to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), traumatic brain injury (TBI), or post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI). Participants were asked to wear a smartwatch and use its reminder notifications to remember to complete a daily automated telephone survey for 10 days. Half of the participants were first asked to use their usual memory strategies without the smartwatch to remember to complete the same daily survey for 10 days. Participants completed an initial interview consisting of demographic, neuropsychological, and technology acceptance measures, and a final interview consisting of usability measures. Participants gave relatively low usability ratings for the smartwatches overall and reported a variety of challenges. The smartwatches did not appear to significantly help or hurt participants’ abilities to remember to complete the daily survey. Participants’ perceptions of their memory were significantly associated with their perceived usefulness of the smartwatches, suggesting that perceived memory challenges may play an important role in the adoption of smartwatches. Results suggest that the smartwatches used in the present study may not be the best fit for providing prospective memory support and can inform the development of future efficacy tests and interventions involving smartwatches.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Sexual and gender minorities (i.e., gay men, lesbians, bisexuals, trans people) (SGMs) have experienced both social and legal progressive change over the last 50 years. However, this group still reports worse health outcomes and healthcare experiences, compared to heterosexuals (Fingerhut and Abdou 2017; Fredriksen-Goldsen et al. 2013). An innovative survey instrument that applies stereotype threat to the healthcare setting (e.g., healthcare stereotype threat, HCST) offers a new avenue to detail these disparities and uncover potential means of mitigation. Stereotype threat is the fear of confirming negative stereotypes about one’s social group (Steele and Aronson 1996). HCST expands the construct to also include the fear of being negatively judged, evaluated, or diagnosed because of one’s SGM status (Abdou and Fingerhut 2014). Work on HCST shows it has significant effects for sexual minorities’ well-being (Fingerhut et al. 2021) and variations exist across age (Abdou et al. 2016). However, previous work is limited in several aspects. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>First, it is unknown how and if HCST retains its significant adverse effect on well-being while considering more established health factors such as everyday discrimination and experiencing stigma. Second, the extant literature currently treats SGMs as a monolith by ignoring how HCST effects can differ across SGM groups and across birth cohorts. Third, there is currently no literature that details how HCST is associated with the well-being of trans people. Guided by previous literature, this dissertation investigates three main research questions to address these gaps: (1) How does the inclusion of discrimination and stigma influence HCST’s association on well-being?; (2) How does the effect of HCST on well-being vary across SGM groups?; (3) What moderating effects does birth cohort have on the association between HCST and well-being. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To explore these questions, I used two national probability datasets that I harmonized: Generations and Transpop. Both of these dataset are the first of their kind to have national probability samples focusing on SGM status. These data are also the first of their kind that capture representative groups of SGMs across three birth cohorts: young (18 to 27 years old), middle-aged (32 to 43 years old), and older (50-60 years old).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Results from Study #1 showed evidence that HCST is a unique health factor and that its effects significantly vary across SGM groups. Examining how HCST’s association performed with the inclusion of everyday discrimination and stigma shows that HCST retains a significant association on self-rated health and psychological distress, which supports that HCST is a unique, viable, and useful tool to understand health disparities SGMs experience. Second, Study #1 shows how trans people tended to report significantly worse outcomes when HCST was high compared to gay men reporting the same level. This result shows the importance of including trans people in future analyses and examining inter-group differences.  Results from Study #2 highlighted variations of HCST effects on well-being across birth cohorts and further highlighted a heightened plight trans people face. Standardized effects of HCST on self-rated health show worse effects for older lesbians and older bisexuals while the effect is similar for young and older gay men. Middle-aged trans people’s self-rated health suffered significantly more so than young trans people’s. HCST emerged to hold a more severe effect on the psychological distress of the older cohort as their distress were significantly higher than their younger counterparts, regardless of SGM group. This latter trend also emerged for trans people compared to gay men in the young and middle-age cohorts for self-rated health and for the young and older cohorts for psychological distress. In these cases, trans people reported worse outcomes than gay men when both groups were reporting the same level of HCST.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation contributes to scholarship in many ways such as using two nationally-probability samples of SGMs in the US, exploring differences within the SGM groups, and including transgender people. And, known to this author, the first cohort differences tests of HCST on well-being for SGMs. The dissertation breaks new ground also in testing how HCST as a measure performs compared to more established health factors, which highlights a new avenue in studying health disparities. Finally, these results have several implications for informing future work on health disparities, beyond SGMs, and with informing interventions and policy change to mitigate this process. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>	Sojourners, people who live outside their home countries, experience inevitable hardships when they separate from their home countries and live in new cultures. These hardships are collectively known as acculturative stress (Spradley &amp; Phillips, 1972). To deal with acculturative stress, some sojourners seek information and social support from other sojourners in online sojourner communities (Oh &amp; Butler, 2019; Ong &amp; Ward, 2005). Sojourners have different knowledge needs throughout their sojourns, but it is unclear much they learn from participating in online sojourner communities and how useful this information is (Yoon &amp; Chung, 2017). This study explores the information that sojourners need to adapt to life in their host countries during each stage of their sojourners and how effectively information they learn through participating in online sojourner communities.	Though some researchers have focused on how sojourners benefit from online sojourner community participation, other researchers have had concerns. Researchers have found that long-term, extensive contact with other sojourners from the same country, termed co-nationals, is associated with poor cultural adaptation to the host country (Kim, 2001; Lim &amp; Pham, 2016). In a meta-analysis of 76 studies about international students, Bender et al. (2019) found that “only support from mixed sources (i.e., not distinguishing between internationals, host, or co-nationals) is associated with a stronger effect of social support than support from co-nationals or fellow international students (compared with support from host sources)" (p. 827). Lim &amp; Pham (2016) argued that sojourners could become so invested in online sojourner communities and their families in their home country that they have no free time to explore the host country and its culture. However, another study suggested that long-term contact with co-nationals could benefit sojourners' cultural adaptation (Cao &amp; Zhang, 2012). This study explored the relationship between online sojourner community usage and cross-cultural adaptation. Additionally, it explored the benefits and drawbacks of participating in online sojourner communities.
	A convergent mixed methods research design using surveys and interviews guided this study. The surveys had qualitative questions, two quantitative psychological scales to assess cross-cultural adaptation, and one quantitative scale to assess Facebook usage. In keeping with Creswell &amp; Creswell (2018)’s research methods, the qualitative interviews provided depth and explanations for quantitative findings from the survey. 160 sojourners currently living in South Korea completed the survey. Eight participants participated in the qualitative interviews through Zoom to investigate what sojourners gain from participating in an online sojourner community. 
	This study found 25 common topics that sojourners must learn to adapt successfully to life in their host countries. As Yoon &amp; Chung (2017) found, these needs varied by their sojourning phases. During the settling stage, Korean language learning/translation and banking/finance/insurance are followed closely by Korean rules/regulations/law, healthcare, and employment/work-related issues. During the established stage, overall reported needs increased by 19%. Most needs remained steady or had modest increases between phases, with few exceptions. Needs like automotive service/repair, childcare, and housing, had large increases between phases. Only one need had a sizable decrease between phases; Korean language learning/translation declined by 10% between phases.
Participants reported the topics they learned about through participating in online sojourner communities. The most common topics they learned during their established phases were visa-related issues, Korean rules/regulations/law, employment/work-related issues, and groceries/dining. Participants also ranked the usefulness of the topics they learned about. The most valuable things they learned were employment/work-related issues, visa-related issues, childcare, groceries/dining, and Korean rules/regulations/law. Though childcare was a less common need, those with children found the information especially useful. Despite the information that sojourners exchange, there was no significant relationship between either of Demes &amp; Geeraert (2014)’s cross-cultural adaptation scales and Facebook Sojourner Community Intensity Scale, an adaptation of Ellison et al. (2007)’s Facebook Intensity Scale.
This study uncovered additional positives about participating in online sojourner communities. The communities provide socio-emotional support through fostering friendship, commiseration, and familial relationship support. Sojourners often organize and help foster offline events and can help sojourners establish connections to the host country. Sojourners generally regard the information in online sojourner communities as more timely, accurate, and accessible than official online sources. The communities also helped working sojourners with professional development and special lifestyle needs. 
	However, there are also considerable drawbacks to participating in online sojourner communities. Negativity is a constant problem in many communities, discouraging some sojourners from participating. Inactive communities were more prone to inaccurate and outdated information. Tempers can flare, and arguments can occur in some communities. Repetitive low-effort questions can be a source of annoyance for long-established sojourners.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The primary objective of this dissertation is to examine how attitudes towards immigration are affected by individuals beliefs about three actors: receiving-country governments, foreign aid donors, and immigration service contractors. I examine the impact political trust has on the willingness of individuals threatened by immigration to decide for greater restrictions on immigration, ﬁnding for an eﬀect that is conditional on which type of governmental actor is made salient to respondents. I also examine how the increasing presence of private contractors in the provision of immigration services in the U.S. impacts attitudes of the immigration regime’s legitimacy abroad. I ﬁnd that legitimacy is impacted by privatization but might depend on which type of functions are delegated to private actors. Finally, I look at the eﬀect of foreign aid on attitudes towards immigrants from donor countries and political support for increased immigration from donor countries. Using both observational and novel survey data, this collection of studies aims to provide the public opinion literature on immigration with a better understanding of how attitudes towards three major actors in immigration can inﬂuence subsequent policy and social attitudes.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Due to the large variance in the stochastic nature of evolution and DNA, it can be difficult to be sure that inferences that use genetical data are perfectly correct. However, as we incorporate more data into our analysis then the confidence of our inferences increases. I investigate the inclusion of 3 types of data that are typically ignored. The use of deletions and insertions in the maximum likelihood calculations of trees is investigated as well as using the quality scores in those same calculations. I show that including this data increases the probability of the true evolutionary tree being the same tree that a maximum likelihood method will infer. I also investigate the effects a geographically continuous population has on the genetical patterns and rates of fixation and timing of fixation, and how those rates compare to panmictic models, which ignore spatial structure. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Typically, Maximum likelihood techniques treat gaps in genetic data as unknown values. There have been a few attempts to build maximum likelihood techniques that include insertion and deletion processes, but these are usually very computationally expensive and infeasible in most cases. A Poisson Indel Process (PIP) has been developed, which reduces the theoretical computation of the likelihood calculations. I show how this method's computational cost can be decreased even further. I also show that it provides slightly more accurate inferences. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>All data gathering techniques introduce some sort of error. DNA sequencers quantify the confidence the program has in each nucleotide with a quality score. These quality scores represent the probability that the sequencer misclassified the nucleotide in question. Most Maximum likelihood techniques ignore these quality scores. At times when the scores are really low that data will be thrown out. I show how to incorporate these quality scores into a maximum likelihood calculation. This requires an adjustment to the traditional conversion of nucleotide data into numerical data into a more realistic biological and mathematical conversion. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Modelling the spatial structure populations are often constrained to has proved to be difficult. There are infinite types of structure that can be imposed by a landscape, each structure having a different effect on the dynamics of the population. I investigate how a continuous landscape with individuals how can disperse only a finite distance affects how quickly new alleles spread through the population. The spread of neutral alleles is shown to be independent of population density. The expected probability and time to fixation are examined and shown to be affect by both the size and shape of the geographical area and the population density.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The rate of spread for advantageous alleles is dependent on the population density, with diminishing returns as population density increases. The probability of fixation is only slightly dependent upon population density, it is mostly dependent upon selective advantage, but the expected time to fixation is heavily dependent on population density and geographical area.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Accurate chromosome segregation is vital to maintain genomic integrity. Chromosome missegregation, or aneuploidy, contributes to cancer development and conditions like down syndrome (Trisomy 21). Chromosomes are attached to microtubules during mitosis through centromere-localized kinetochores, and accurate chromosome segregation requires establishment of chromosome bipolar attachment. As a result of bipolar attachment, tension is generated across sister kinetochores. Failure in this process  activates the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) to prevent anaphase entry and allow for correction of attachments errors. In contrast, tension generation is believed to silence the SAC for anaphase onset. One key regulator of the SAC is the conserved chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), composed of Ipl1 kinase, Sli15, Bir1, and Nbl1 in budding yeast. The CPC localizes to the kinetochore/centromere before anaphase entry. Kinetochore protein Ndc80 is one Ipl1 substrate, and its phosphorylation destabilizes kinetochore-microtubule interaction to promote error correction. After anaphase onset, the CPC is removed from the kinetochore/centromere and relocates to the spindle, where it assists in spindle stability. Meanwhile, Ipl1-dependent Ndc80 phosphorylation is reversed, but the phosphatase responsible for this reversal is unknown. In budding yeast, the phosphatase Cdc14 becomes active after anaphase onset and dephosphorylates Fin1, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). Fin1 dephosphorylation allows kinetochore recruitment of Fin1-PP1. In this work, we show that kinetochore recruitment of Fin1-PP1 triggers the removal of the SAC proteins Bub1/Bub3. Furthermore, Fin1-PP1 partially dephosphorylates Ndc80, which promotes kinetochore dissociation of Bub1/Bub3. In addition, phospho-deficient ndc80 mutants causes viability loss in response to syntelic chromosome attachment, wherein sister kinetochores are attached by microtubules from the same spindle pole, indicating the importance of timely Fin1-PP1 kinetochore localization in checkpoint regulation.
Multiple mechanisms  regulate CPC kinetochore/centromere localization. A main driver for localization is Sli15 phosphorylation by both cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) and Ipl1 kinases. After anaphase onset, Sli15 is dephosphorylated, which triggers CPC translocation to anaphase spindle. Active Cdc14 reverses CDK-imposed Sli15 phosphorylation, but it is currently unclear which phosphatase reverses Ipl1-imposed Sli15 phosphorylation. Here we show that Fin1-PP1 partially reverses Sli15 phosphorylation. Interestingly, premature Fin1 kinetochore localization is sufficient to promote both CPC dissociation from the kinetochore/centromere in metaphase and CPC spindle association in anaphase. In addition, premature Fin1-kinetochore localization or phospho-deficient sli15 mutants result in SAC defects in response to tensionless attachments. These results indicate that Fin1-PP1 reverses Sli15 phosphorylation imposed by Ipl1 to promote CPC translocation in anaphase.
The tension checkpoint is a subset of the SAC that prevents anaphase onset in response to tensionless attachments. In response to tension defects, Ipl1 kinase phosphorylates the kinetochore protein Dam1 to prevent anaphae onset. Budding yeast Cin8 is a kinesin-5 motor protein, and its synthetic lethality with SAC mutants indicates the role of Cin8 in accurate chromosome attachment. To study the function of Cin8 in chromosome attachment, we constructed an auxin-inducible degron (AID) mutant, cin8-AID. With this conditional mutant, we show that cells lacking Cin8 arrest in metaphase due to unseparated spindle pole bodies. This metaphase arrest depends on the SAC as well as Dam1 phosphorylation by Ipl1 kinase. In cells expressing phospho-deficient dam1-3A, the metaphase arrest induced by Cin8 depletion is abolished, causing chromosome missegregation. These results support the conclusion that the cell cycle delay in cin8 mutants is a result of tensionless chromsome attachments.
Because of the critical role of CPC in chromosome bipolar attachment, its kinetochore/centromere localization must be tightly regulated during cell cycle. SUMOylation is a post-translational modification, wherein SUMO (Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier) proteins are covalently attached to other proteins. SUMOylation has been shown to promote protein subcellular localization through the interacteion between SUMO and SUMO-interacting motifs (SIMs). This interaction  facilitates formation of molecular condensates through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). On the other hand, formation of SUMO chains (polySUMOylation) can induce condensate disassembly by triggering a series downstream events, including ubiquitination by SUMO-dependent Ubiquitin ligases (STUbLs) and extraction by Cdc48 segregase. In mammalian cells, the CPC was shown to be enriched at kinetochores through LLPS. A recent work indicates that CPC components Bir1 is SUMOylated. One attractive idea is that CPC SUMOylation promotes it kinetochores localization, while polySUMOylation triggers CPC kinetochore delocalization for its translocation. In this work, we show that Bir1 phosphorylation is cell cycle regulated, and the absence of STUbL delays Bir1 dephosphorylation. Moreover, depletion of SUMO protease, Ulp2, increases Bir1 SUMOylation Interestingly, inducing polySUMOylation prevents proper CPC kinetochore localization in metaphase. These preliminary results support the idea that Bir1 SUMOylation may regulate Bir1 phosphorylation and CPC localization.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of isolated and confined spacecraft environments on astronauts' psychological well-being with the aim to develop innovative strategies to mitigate senses of stress and anxiety in spacecrafts. Specifically, the author identified the features of spacecraft interior environments that negatively or positively affected astronauts’ perceptions of the environment and stress levels, including the size of spacecraft, orientation and layout, color, and presence of portholes. Space travel has been a longtime aspiration of humans. In historical terms, we only recently started exploring outer frontiers of Earth and planning for a distinct possibility to travel to neighboring Mars. During long-term space travel, astronauts may experience high levels of stress and anxiety, which may affect their well-being, create tension between crew members, and complicate the completion of tasks, ultimately leading to mission failure. The most critical issues related to astronauts' psychological well-being are physical isolation, stresses working and living in a hostile environment where a simple mistake can result in severe injuries or death, necessity to share workspaces and living quarters with other crew members resulting in limited privacy and personal space, and fatigue due to packed schedules. Two theoretical frameworks discussed in Chapter 2 of this thesis identify the specific aspects of the physical environment and psychological climate aboard spacecraft needed to maintain astronauts’ well-being: the Self-Determination Theory (Goemaere et al., 2019; Ryan et al., 2014) and the framework for relating crew member performance measures to spacecraft design and operations (Fanchiang et al., 2020), referred to as the Crew Member Performance Framework in this research.The interior design of spacecraft environments is essential to support not only the lives of astronauts but to help them with successful performance of work-related tasks, activities, and communication, enable physical mobility, and provide a supportive environment for crew socialization, recreation, and rest. The data for this qualitative ethnographic study was gathered from three different sources: publicly accessible astronauts journals and books, spacecraft schematics, and photo and video materials. The research focused on the analysis of the interior environment of the International Space Station, which has been continually operating and hosting astronaut crews since November of 2000. The data was analyzed using DeDoose qualitative coding software to identify thirty-two emerging themes over five major categories that characterize spacecraft interior environments: microgravity, workday, psychological health, design features, and other issues. A close examination of these categories indicates that module functionality, safety details, together with size, wayfinding and orientation, comfort and privacy features, incorporation of portholes, and color are the characteristics of spacecraft interior environments that affect astronauts’ overall psychological well-being and stress levels most. In the programming phase, the researcher analyzed historic spacecraft schematics to determine the potentially most effective design solutions for the project portion of this thesis, the renovation of the International Space Station. These results can be utilized by spacecraft engineers, architects, and interior designers to serve the needs of astronauts by supporting their psychological well-being and enhancing their experience onboard spacecraft during long-term space travel.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>When compared to restudy, a practice test results in greater final test recall, a phenomenon known as the testing effect, and has been replicated across hundreds of experiments (Rowland, 2014; Adesope et al., 2017); however, consistent theoretical explanations for the benefits of testing remain elusive. I investigated the underlying assumptions for two prominent theories of the testing effect, the episodic context theory (Karpicke et al., 2014) and the dual memory model (Rickard &amp; Pan, 2018). Across four experiments (combined n = 426) I contrasted the predictions of the theories regarding the specificity of learning (Experiments 1 and 2), attempted to manipulate context updating as proposed by the episodic context theory in a restudy condition using instructions to retrieve the acquisition phase context during the practice phase (Experiment 3), and attempted to manipulate the number of memory traces the dual memory model proposes are created during the practice phase using pretesting (Experiment 4). Across these experiments I found no support for the episodic context theory assumption that context updating results in greater retrieval on a final test. In contrast, I found conflicting evidence for the dual memory model assumption that a second memory trace is created during a practice test. These experiments take an initial step toward behavioral tests of the core assumptions for two important models of the testing effect and reveal important directions for future research. Additionally, the results of Experiment 3 suggest a complex context change may be a potential boundary condition for the testing effect, which has important implications for education and learning.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to explore the ways graduate students’ interpretive lenses manifested in reflective storytelling of their collaborative object-based learning (OBL) experiences with Andean textiles in the John and Mary Carter Collection. This occurred in the context of visitor-centered exhibition (VCE) development. Adapted Feminist Thinking Systems (Love &amp; Villeneuve, 2017; Stephens, 2013) as an epistemological framework guided the development and implementation of this research project. The methodology of narrative inquiry (Clandinin, 2016; Clandinin and Connelly, 2000) recognized the complexity of student experiential stories as expressions of their unique voices. Five graduate students reflectively narrated their OBL and VCE experiences at Florida State University during a global pandemic. Student interpretive lenses during OBL activities showed the ways differences in their backgrounds and experiences contributed to their stories on the Andean textiles. The imaginative storytelling process provided scaffolding for participants to interpret novel OBL experiences with the textiles and generate creative ideas for VCE development. The dissonance between individual interpretive lenses and collaborative OBL influenced participant stories and the VCE narrative process. The VCE team members needed facilitative guidance with rationales on the relationships between object study, object stories, object research, and different types of interpretive narratives for the VCE plan. Collaborative OBL and VCE activities constituted paradoxical events. Students acknowledged the importance of collaboration for VCE planning and museums. Participant interpretive lenses of OBL activities with Andean textiles for collaborative VCE development contributed to embodied stories of experiential museum training as aesthetic life-story narratives for future experiences. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Early childhood traumatic experiences place children at-risk for social, emotional, and behavioral impairments that contribute to poor educational outcomes. There is an increasing awareness that children with early traumatic exposure may need supplemental supports for academic success. These supports may be presented in the form of individual-student or whole-school trauma-informed care models. Existing prevention models, such as Multi-Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS) or Trauma Informed Care (TIC), accommodate early screening of students’ skills and behaviors, however, there is a lack of consensus in the literature regarding how trauma is measured within school environments and at what age students should be screened for the effects of childhood trauma on their educational success. Using a dominance analysis and ROC Curve analysis, this dissertation examined the overall predictive validity of childhood trauma measurement to early literacy skills and the tradeoff in classification accuracy of the measurement of childhood trauma in the early identification of kindergarteners (n=145) engaging in virtual learning environments who are at-risk for poor early reading and language outcomes. Findings demonstrated that trauma was a significant predictor of reading outcomes but integrating student behaviors enhanced the classification accuracy of the traditional MTSS methods for identifying at-risk readers. Results from this study provided the first empirical link between trauma and reading outcomes in  kindergarteners in virtual learning environments.  Results can inform TIC and MTSS models of care and provide preliminary empirical support for Whole-Child  Learning Models.  </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Physical appearance concerns are a prominent feature of several psychiatric disorders including body dysmorphic disorder, eating disorders, and social anxiety disorder, and a growing body of research suggests that appearance concerns may have important utility as a transdiagnostic construct. However, self-report measures of this individual difference characteristic have been developed primarily within disorder-specific frameworks, in contrast with emerging dimensional models which seek to identify and investigate shared factors impacting systematic comorbidity. The lack of a psychometrically sound, transdiagnostic measure of appearance concerns constitutes a major limitation of ongoing work in this area that hinders the ability of researchers to integrate results across studies and samples. The aim of the current work was to develop and validate an efficient scale measure of physical appearance concerns for use in future studies investigating its role in different psychiatric conditions and their systematic comorbidity. We utilized item response theory and structural modeling methods to identify a subset of items from three widely used appearance-related scale measures with optimal measurement properties for indexing variations in general appearance concerns - resulting in a brief, nine-item General Appearance Concerns Scale (GACS). This new scale showed effective coverage of the general appearance concerns trait continuum, a unidimensional structure and excellent internal consistency, and evidence of criterion-related validity. Results support the GACS as an effective instrument for assessing symptoms within the domain of appearance concerns and a vehicle for pursuing systematic research on physical appearance concerns as a transdiagnostic construct.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Concepts like cultural relativism, tradition, and authenticity warrants a more critical examination in an age where much of the world’s population has adopted a digital lifestyle that is always online. As a cultural artifact, the internet has become integrated with human interaction and the cultural impact of its convenience has been taken for granted—the effect the internet and mobile telephony continues to have on blurring boundaries between cultural appropriation and cultural appreciation is tremendous and deserves more critical introspection, dialogue, and discourse among scholarship within the field of humanities. This dissertation uses the lens of online shakuhachi study to not only explores the boundaries between cultural appropriation and cultural appreciation but also to bring forth a much-needed dialogue about the meaning of terms such as cultural relativism and tradition in an era of hypermediated technoculture. The combination of interlocution, observation, interpretation, and participation has revealed that the ethnographic encounters of shakuhachi in the United States are mostly represented by “non-native” shakuhachi musicians. The transmission of the shakuhachi tradition, and other similar cultures that have non-native participants, are contending with a more complicated notion of the “crisis of representation”—lineages of different types of shakuhachi traditions are being transmitted by non-native shakuhachi musicians.The internet and other media devises play a significant role in how the narrative of shakuhachi history is told—a popular trope in the historiography of the instrument is that “the shakuhachi is an ancient instrument of Zen.” By drawing on my experiences studying shakuhachi with dai-shihan (大師範, grandmaster) Michael Chikuzen (竹禅)Gould, I deconstruct the history of the instrument in an effort to understand why shakuhachi is still characterized through romanticized notions of Buddhist thought and imagery.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Biomedial literature usually contains cutting edge research results on biomedical entities, in particular the relation between them, for example the interaction between two proteins. However, the ever-increasing volume in the literature makes it impossible to humanly annotate them all, thus automatic extraction of these relations from literature has become more important. In this dissertation, we discuss three projects related to extract relations in biomedical text, as well as another project on protein surface matching. In the first project on extracting relations, we process protein-protein relations from protein-protein interaction databases and build a sentence level relation model using distance learning. This method uses bags to group predictions of all sentences related to an entity pair into a prediction on the entity pair itself. We show our performance on our own dataset.
In the second project, we participated in the BioCreative VII challenge on text mining drug and chemical-protein interactions. For each sentence and entity pair in the sentence, we are asked to find the exact relationship type of the entity pair. We achieved 75% F1 score and placed the 8th out of 21 participants. 
In the last project, we participated in the LitCoin challenge. Here we focus on the the second part of the challenge, where the goal is to predict the exact relation type for biomedical entities of various types, including genes, diseases, cell lines, etc. We won the first place by achieving a 0.633 Jaccard score. 
In the protein surface matching project, we developed a fast program to calculate distances between protein surfaces using an algorithm that our group has published before.

            <DISS_para>The representation of Black women in senior leadership positions within higher education hovers at a dismal 5.8% (Wilder et al., 2013). Though Black women’s degree attainment has increased substantially in comparison to other racial groups (NCES, n.d.), they are not recruited and supported in these roles (Jackson &amp; Harris, 2007), especially in both Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Historically White Institutions. Consequently, the women who are successful in obtaining administrative and executive positions share experiences that illuminate a system still plagued with sexism and racism (Cooper, 2020). Using Black Feminist Thought, Intersectionality, and Misogynoir as frameworks, as well as a critical narrative inquiry, I explored the intersection of race and gender for Black women in senior-level leadership roles at HBCUs and HWIs. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Bioacoustics has long been a vital source of knowledge in the life sciences.  Bioacoustics provides us with an invaluable set of tools and insights to help us better understand how life interacts with one another and its environment.  Traditional bioacoustic techniques have all drawn heavily from Signal Processing, itself a subfield of Electrical Engineering.  Signal Processing techniques have allowed for unprecedented insight into the structure and makeup of these signals.  They have also allowed us to better understand their information content and time-varying structure.  However, much work remains to be done.  Much of the information encoded in the frequency-domain representations analyzed by most traditional methods are also encoded in the time-domain shape of the signal itself.  In this work, we present a new technique for analyzing bioacoustic signals using only the time-domain and the shapes of individual vocalization acts, called pulses.  This method provides a new, simpler way of comparing vocalizations across individuals and populations. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Ideal Standards Model suggests that individuals should demonstrate more romantic interest in a potential partner and be more satisfied with an existing partner to the extent that the partner possesses the traits they desire (termed ideal-partner consistency). Further, evolutionary perspectives on mating suggest that individuals should possess varying degrees of desire for three critical partner traits – attractiveness-vitality, status-resources, and warmth-trustworthiness. While ideal-partner consistency on these traits has predicted satisfaction with existing partners in prior work, findings for interest in potential partners have been more mixed. This dissertation proposes that findings have been mixed because the self-report measures used in most prior work have failed to capture individuals’ automatic, gut-level preferences. Accordingly, I examined the extent to which ideal-partner consistency using (1) self-reported preferences for attractiveness, status, and warmth in a partner and (2) automatic preferences for these traits in a partner captured using a new implicit measure uniquely predicted interest in potential partners during a speed-dating event and satisfaction with relationships formed after the event. Ideal-partner consistency for self-reported preferences did predict more interest in potential partners for men and more satisfaction with current partners for both men and women, though greater consistency predicted less interest for women. Further, ideal-partner consistency for automatic preferences predicted more interest in potential partners among individuals with a short-term mating orientation, but surprisingly, less interest among those with a long-term mating orientation. Lastly, consistency for self-reported preferences generally predicted outcomes more strongly than did consistency for automatic preferences. These findings join some prior work in demonstrating that some of the preferences individuals report predict both the partners they later pursue and their later satisfaction with those relationships. These findings also may suggest that individuals do not allow their gut-level associations with certain traits to strongly guide them toward partners with these traits, nor do these associations affect their later relationship satisfaction. However, future work may benefit from re-examining these associations using a revised implicit task.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Photon upconversion (UC), especially through the process of triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA), is capable of combining two photons into one higher energy photon which could be captured in applications such as photovoltaics, photocatalysis, optogenetics, imaging and sensing, and many others. TTA-UC systems rely on spin-triplet states donated from a sensitizer material, which is commonly either an organometallic molecule or a semiconductor nanocrystal confined in three dimensions, typically referred to as a quantum dot. This dissertation encompasses a different approach to triplet sensitization specifically applied to TTA-UC. Semiconductor nanocrystals with quantum confinement relaxed in either one or two dimensions have unique properties endowed by their shape, size, and anisotropic nature, making them viable candidates for triplet sensitization. Chapter 3 explores CdTe nanorods, materials with two dimensions of quantum confinement, as potential triplet sensitizer materials in a red-to-blue TTA-UC scheme. TTA-UC is successfully observed in this system with a UC efficiency better or comparable to similar nanocrystal sensitized systems. Chapter 4 investigates the use of CdSe nanoplatelets, which are only quantum confined in their thickness. Here, the nanoplatelets are compared directly to quantum dots. Comparing the results of the nanoplatelet and quantum dot sensitized systems results in an interplay between the incident power threshold required for efficient TTA-UC and the UC efficiency, attributed to stacking of the nanoplatelets, which was shown to inhibit the performance of the nanoplatelet sensitized system. In Chapter 5, bulk semiconductors are explored as potential triplet sensitizers, through the use of bulk metal halide perovskites, which rely on no quantum confinement, and sensitize the annihilator molecule through a free charge mechanism.  The performance of these systems is reliant on many factors, including the composition, fabrication method of the perovskite sensitizer, and the illumination time of the perovskite, which tunes its defect density. 
In summary, this dissertation looks beyond conventional semiconductor quantum dots as triplet sensitizer materials toward a new class of materials which include nanorods, nanoplatelets, and bulk semiconductors. In all cases, TTA-UC is successfully observed. However, the lasting relevance of these systems may rest on their ability to sensitize TTA-UC systems in the solid-state, which is a key development for their implementation into solid-state device applications such as photovoltaics. Bulk perovskite sensitized systems are already among the most efficient and useful solid-state triplet sensitizers, while nanorods and nanoplatelets could outperform existing solid-state nanocrystal sensitizers due to their improved exciton diffusion lengths upon self-assembly. These potential strategies and future developments toward improving TTA-UC are further discussed in Chapter 6, where we look toward the potentially bright future of TTA-UC, especially toward device-relevant applications.

            <DISS_para>This dissertation examined the relationship between student engagement in college and subsequent employment status and early career earnings in a public university. This study sought to understand whether or not student academic and social experiences in college are related to post-baccalaureate early career earnings. The literature review explored human and social capital theories, related student development theories, and the economics of education as it relates to the earnings premium of postsecondary education. The study analyzed student data and explored the relationship between student experiences in college and subsequent employment status and early career earnings. The overall engagement measure dramatically increased the likelihood a student was employed within 6 months of graduation and was also positively related to early career earnings. Of the student engagement subscales, leadership and campus involvement and community service and philanthropy increased the likelihood a student was employed within 6 months of graduation. The leadership and campus involvement measure was also positively related to early career earnings in the full model, as well as in many of the conditional models for different student subpopulations. The international and global learning measure and the research and academic endeavors measure both had a negative relationship with the natural log of wages in the overall model and in many of the conditional models, plausibly due to increased engagement of students who may have been more inclined to enter into public service, social services, or the non-profit sector. Regarding the moderating relationships, the results suggested that the research and academic endeavors measure was more important to early career earnings for males than females, while the overall engagement measure and the community service and philanthropy measure were less important for STEM majors compared to non-STEM majors.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Following the Second World War and through the end of the twentieth century, the Christian Reformed Church in North America experienced massive changes, beginning with unified institutional growth and a wave of new migration and ending with an internal struggle over the cultural changes occurring in North American culture. Rooted in Dutch migration, ethnicity, and Reformed theology, the denomination provides examples of how an established ethnic community adapted to new migrants, Christian youth adopted the cultural changes of the 1960s era, and a confessional religious community interacted with the rise of conservative white evangelicalism. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Part religious history and part ethnic history, this study attempts to merge the two historiographies to demonstrate how a community rooted in both religious faith and ethnic identity navigated the cultural and political landscape of the late twentieth century. Due to the binational character of the Christian Reformed Church, transcending the American/Canadian border, and the transnational nature of Dutch Reformed denominations during this period, this study engages with these changes outside of a strictly U.S. context.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Ultimately, I explore the development and meaning of community across time. Both the leaders and members of the Christian Reformed Church belonged to a specific community, one which plotted the direction of their lives and shaped their understanding of their local communities, their nation, and the broader world. I hope the reader will gain a sense of the world they created and developed and how it changed in relation to wider cultural transformations.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study examines the research and scholarship sharing and dissemination practices in an online environment among law school faculty. Guided by one of the most widely used technology usage and adoption models, Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), it investigates law school professors’ attitudes and perceptions toward self-archiving and subsequent adoption and usage behavior through a qualitative research design of semi-structured interviews.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The findings indicate that participants generally have very positive attitudes towards Open Access (OA) and are in favor of supporting self-archiving and OA practice despite lacking knowledge of the subject. The majority of the participants use the Social Science Research Network (SSRN) for self-archiving which appears to be an “industry standard” in legal academia. Other platforms the participants choose to self-archive include institutional repositories, ResearchGate, Academia.edu, personal websites, institutional websites, and research consortium websites. Research confirms the accuracy of UTAUT’s concepts for understanding motivation factors for self-archiving among law school faculty; the findings further identify additional emerging concepts and also barriers and concerns law professors have regarding OA and self-archiving.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study helps to fill the research gap and understand the self-archiving social phenomenon within an under-studied user group therefore supports libraries with improving current services, ensuring effective advocacy, and engaging potential initiatives regarding scholarly communication in the legal profession.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Formation of cold, dense waters south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) is one of the main drivers of the global overturning circulation, with major implications on the earth’s climate. A key region where the densest waters on earth are formed is the Ross Sea which is separated from the ACC by the Ross Gyre. The strength and variability of the Ross Gyre circulation impact the formation and export of dense water, and it is therefore important to understand its circulation and dynamics.  Observations in the Ross Gyre are limited because of its remote location and the severe weather conditions. Furthermore, the ice cover limits the application of remote sensing techniques. Quantitative estimates of the gyre’s strength are difficult to obtain from hydrographic observations alone due to the limited sampling and the relatively weak stratification. In this dissertation, we use a combination of observations and modeling studies to a) provide an estimate of the strength and variability of the Ross Gyre transport and b) investigate the relative contributions of the wind and buoyancy forcing, eddies, and the presence of ACC to the Ross Gyre circulation. We find that the mean transport of the Ross Gyre can be as high as ~45 Sv, about twice of the typical estimate ~20 Sv reported in the literature. Sensitivity experiments to wind and buoyancy forcing, nonlinear terms, and the ACC were performed with a regional configuration of the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM). The numerical experiments show that the Ross Gyre, and its variability, are primarily wind-driven. The ACC is responsible for part of the recirculation. Buoyancy and nonlinearity/eddy do not appear to play a major role in the gyre dynamics.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Active flow control can achieve substantial performance gains and meet the challenges of next-generation air vehicles and energy harvesting devices. The use of active flow control techniques with the deflecting flap or morphing surfaces has been shown to be a viable path to regulating the flow-induced vibration of the foil. However, due to the complex nature of flow over morphing surfaces, all physical phenomena are intertwined, which prevents a clear understanding of the underlying flow physics and, therefore, a successful design of a controlling action to optimally modify them. In this research, fluid-structure interaction systems are modeled with a high-fidelity tightly-coupled numerical scheme. Specifically, an embedded geometrical description is used to model and track the dynamics of a foil with an actively deflecting flap. Through various analysis tools, including a geometrically-weighted modal analysis technique, mode competitions are observed between flow-induced and geometry-induced mechanisms, and the morphing structure is proven to be capable of regulating the fluid-structure interacting behaviors. Furthermore, an advanced network is developed to extract the transient transition of different modes in the fluid-structure interaction systems. With all the knowledge acquired through the modal analysis, an active flow control framework with the model predictive control theory is built to modulate the flow-induced flutter using morphing surfaces. The geometrically weighted dynamic-relevant modes are used to build surrogate models to achieve rapid model-based active control of complex systems. The proposed technique can create a systematic framework to advise substantial improvements in the functionality of next-generation systems through detailed investigations of fluid-structure interactions and provide insights into the effects of control design changes on the physical phenomena that drive the dynamic performance of these systems.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The 26S proteasome is the largest and most complicated chambered protease known. It is responsible for regulated degradation of proteins within all eukaryotic cells, and is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis. Disruptions to proteasome assembly, composition, or function cause or exacerbate numerous human diseases, including cancers, neurodegenerative disorders, and a family of autoimmune disorders. The proteasome is comprised of two major subcomplexes: the regulatory particle (RP) and the core particle (CP). Each serves distinct functions in degradation of substrate. The RP contains a ring of six AAA+ ATPase subunits that mechanically unfold substrate and translocate it into the proteolytic chamber of the CP, which houses the proteolytic active sites. The ATPase subunits are absolutely essential to proteasome function, as they served as both gatekeepers and guides for the diverse population of protein substrates that proteasomes must degrade to maintain proteostasis in a complex and crowded cellular environment. The unstructured C-termini of most proteasomal ATPase subunits dock into pockets in the surface of the barrel-shaped CP, tethering the RP to the CP and regulating substrate access to the proteolytic core. Furthermore, flexible pore-1 loops extend from each Rpt subunit into the central channel of the ATPase ring. These pore loops grip substrates and, via ATP-fueled movements, mechanically unfold and translocate them through the ATPase ring’s pore and into the CP for destruction. Given the exceptional size and complexity of the proteasome, the unstructured pore-1 loops and C-termini of the ATPase subunits exert disproportionally large impacts on its structure and function. Although some rudimentary analyses of their individual contributions have been performed, the myriad of ways in which they contribute to proteasome physiology remain very poorly understood. In this thesis, I describe my analyses of these key functional elements, which have challenged some aspects of the current model of substrate translocation by the proteasome, and have serendipitously revealed a potential quality control mechanism that disassembles proteasomes with compromised RP-CP interfaces. I discuss these findings in the context of our current understanding of proteasome function and quality control, and provide perspectives on new hypotheses and questions arising from my work.  </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study examined the transgenerational relationship between the prevalence of maternal childhood traumas for justice-involved adolescent mothers and her baby’s social and emotional risk by the age of 24 months. Two separate variables for the mother’s childhood trauma were used. The first of these variables came from the mother’s self-reported completion of the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) Questionnaire. The second variable on the mother’s experiences of early adversity came from the same ACEs Questionnaire being completed by home visitors who worked with the mother/baby dyad scoring the questionnaire on the teen mother based on information that was shared by the teen and reviewing the teen’s records. Guided by the Ecobiodevelopmental Framework, the current study included epigenetic concepts in social science research to acknowledge the growing body of evidence that documents the complexity of contributing factors to infant social and emotional risk that go beyond the child’s significant relationships, environment, and community. The results indicated that the teen mother’s self-reported ACE score was not a significant predictor of the child’s social and emotional risk. The home visitor calculated ACE score, however, was a significant predictor of the child’s social and emotional risk. The gender of the child was also a significant predictor when controlling for the home visitor’s ACE score with boys being more likely to score at risk on the ASQ:SE.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Variable selection methods have become an important and growing problem in Bayesian analysis. The literature on Bayesian variable selection methods tends to be applied to a single response- type, and more typically, a continuous response-type, where it is assumed that the data is Gaus- sian/symmetric. In this dissertation, we develop a novel global-local shrinkage prior in non- symmetric settings and multiple response-types settings by combining the perspectives of global- local shrinkage and the conjugate multivaraite distribution.
In Chapter 2, we focus on the problem of variable selection when the data is possibly non- symmetric continuous-valued. We propose modeling continuous-valued data and the coefficient vector with the multivariate logit-beta (MLB) distribution. To perform variable selection in a Bayesian context we make use of shrinkage global-local priors to enforce sparsity. Specifically, they can be defined as a Gaussian scale mixture of a global shrinkage parameter and a local shrinkage parameter for a regression coefficient. We provide a technical discussion that illustrates that our use of the multivariate logit-beta distribution under a P ́olya-Gamma augmentation scheme has an explicit connection to a well-known global-local shrinkage method (i.e., the horseshoe prior) and extends it to possibly non-symmetric data. Moreover, our method can be implemented using an efficient block Gibbs sampler. Evidence of improvements in terms of mean squared error and variable selection as compared to the standard implementation of the horseshoe prior for skewed data settings is provided in simulated and real data examples.
In Chapter 3, we direct our attention to the canonical variable selection problem in multiple response-types settings, where the observed dataset consists of multiple response-types (e.g., con- tinuous, count-valued, Bernoulli trials, etc.). We propose the same global-local shrinkage prior in Chapter 2 but for multiple response-types datasets. The implementation of our Bayesian variable selection method to such data types is straightforward given the fact that the multivariate logit-beta prior is the conjugate prior for several members from the natural exponential family of distributions, which leads to the binomial/beta and negative binomial/beta hierarchical models. Our proposed model not just allows the estimation and selection of independent regression coefficients, but also those of shared regression coefficients across-response-types, which can be used to explicitly model dependence in spatial and time-series settings. An efficient block Gibbs sampler is developed, which is found to be effective in obtaining accurate estimates and variable selection results in simulation studies and an analysis of public health and financial costs from natural disasters in the U.S.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Low-level wind shear (LLWS) is one of the most common aviation hazards in both clear and bad weather conditions. Low-level wind shear is dangerous for landing or taking off activities because it can cause the aircraft to overshoot or undershoot. The short spatial and temporal scale of the occurrence of low-level wind shears and the lack of understanding of its characteristics cause the wind shear warnings can not to be carried out optimally. Therefore, this study aims to determine the characteristics of low-level wind shear that occurs in the Bali region, especially at Ngurah Rai International Airport. This study mainly uses two years of observational data from wind profilers to determine when LLWS occurs based on reports from pilots and wind shear warnings. This data will then also be used to calculate the value of the bulk Richardson number (Rb), which will be used to determine the condition of atmospheric stability during the LLWS. Additional data in the form of weather radar data and ERA5 will also be used to identify weather phenomena that can affect LLWS events. The results showed that LLWS in the Bali region most often occurred from morning to noon and in clear weather conditions. Moreover, the leading cause of LLWS is due to the inversion layer. The blocking of momentum transfer by the inversion layer usually causes LLWS to form at a threshold value of -0.25&lt;Rb&lt;0.1. Changes in the value of Rb and the formation of an inversion layer affect the location of the occurrence of LLWS, where most occur above the inversion layer or above the layer with a value of Rb&lt;0.1. The calculation of the skill score shows a good result for the POD value of 0.7, FAR 0.27, CSI 0.55, and ETS 0.43, which indicates that LLWS can mostly occur if it is followed by a decrease in Rb in the threshold value range for four minutes and a change in wind direction and speed of 5 kt for ten minutes.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>a heavenly steed, soaring across the skies is a two-movement work for orchestra. The title derives from the Chinese idiom. Chinese people use this idiom to describe a bold, imaginative, unconstrained style. This work intends to create an elevated and cohesive atmosphere connecting two superficially unrelated objects: sky lanterns as a symbol of fortune and the Forbidden City, a palace complex located in Peking (Beijing).The first movement is inspired by a story during the Three Kingdoms period (from 220 to 280 AD). A military strategist of one of the three kingdoms, Zhuge Liang (also known as Zhuge Kongming), invented the sky lantern. When the other Kingdom's army surrounded him in a town, he made sky lanterns to transmit messages to manage an escape from the siege, and he succeeded. Since then, the sky lantern has symbolized hope for success and fortune. Thus, this movement intends to deliver a prayer for hope. It begins with a slow-growing motive decorated by the ostinato in the high register to create a serene atmosphere. The middle section takes inspiration from Igor Stravinsky's "Infernal Dance" from “Firebird”, while reimagining it as if this music is written for a video game by featuring repetitive motives and limited polyphony. The driving and relentless section proceeds with the off-beat melodies and disturbs the previous tranquil section. Increased rhythmic pulses and an intense and dramatic atmosphere aims to throw the audience in a place as if a mighty force traps them. Along with the ascending stepwise motive truncated at the end of the middle section, the beginning slow-growing motive returns. The coda depicts sky lanterns flaming while flying to the sky.
The second movement is about the Forbidden City. The Yongle emperor of the Ming Dynasty built this marvelous architecture. Since then, the emperors of all dynasties have lived in it. It gives people a sense of mystery and inaccessibility. This movement begins quickly with a short piano introduction accompanied by strings and woodwinds. After a dialogue among woodwind instruments, the main theme is presented in tutti. Influenced by the theme of the film music “The Last Emperor” composed by Ryuichi Sakamoto, the main theme of this movement features a four-note motif with pitches drawn from the pentatonic scale. This motif develops through variations of pitch and rhythmic durations. This movement also fused the features of film music, as it presents various moods through different distinctive musical characters. For example, the middle section uses the extensive virtuosic runs in woodwind parts interrupted by swells creating a sense of exhaustion; in contrast, a slow and lyrical dialogue between clarinet and piano relaxes the tensions between two climaxes, whereas the biggest climax (mm. 125-145) resembles a culmination of a soundtrack from an epic film. This movement aims to make the audience feel the magnificence of the Forbidden City.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>There is much research on music preferences, responses to music, and music therapy using client-preferred music. Not as much research exists about the effects of music therapists’ preferred music, specifically their disliked music. The purpose of this study was to investigate music therapy students’ perceptions about their experiences with their disliked music and their opinions about using their disliked music in music therapy. A survey was sent out via email and social media, with a total of 20 undergraduate music therapy students responding. It included questions about having disliked music, listening frequency for disliked music, reactions to disliked music, preparation and use of disliked music in music therapy, and disliked music’s effect on relationships with clients. The survey consisted of 21 questions in total. In general, disliked music was listened to relatively infrequently, and participants perceived disliked music to produce negative emotional responses. Both similarities and differences were found between results for slightly disliked music and results for strongly disliked music. A notable difference was that most (n=9) music therapy students thought they should use slightly disliked music in music therapy but most (n=10) were unsure about using strongly disliked music. Two other differences between slightly and strongly disliked music were related to reactions to the music and the predicted effect on the relationship with clients. In light of the perceived negative effects of disliked music and other results from this study, music therapy students may benefit from discussion about possible responses they may have to disliked music and using disliked music in music therapy, including strategies that may facilitate its use.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a leading monogenetic cause of intellectual disability and autism. It is caused by transcriptional silencing of the FMR1 gene and the resultant loss of its product, Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). Individuals with FXS display prominent sensory dysfunction including acoustic hyperactivity and compromised hearing in noise, which emerge at young ages. Animal studies have revealed maladaptive developmental events caused by the absence of FMRP, including delays in axonal and synaptic development as well as alterations in experience-dependent neuronal plasticity. These cellular abnormalities may underlie sensory processing deficits in FXS but show high regional- and time-specificity. Thus, whether and how individual developmental events contribute to the emergence and progress of circuit alterations are largely unknown. In addition, the precise sites of FMRP action in regulating these cellular and circuit pathophysiology remain elusive.In this dissertation, we dissected the role of FMRP in synaptic tonotopic development, afferent regulation of neuronal dynamics during developmental critical periods, and the association with the emergence of auditory processing problems by focusing on the auditory brainstem circuit using mouse and chicken as model organisms. In Chapter 2, we characterized the developmental distributions of key presynaptic neurotransmitter-releasing machinery in the mouse developing medial nucleus of the trapezoid body, a major auditory nucleus receiving excitatory inputs from the cochlear nucleus and serving as an inhibitory station for further processing.  We identified novel tonotopic gradients of selective presynaptic proteins in immature auditory synapses in the first postnatal week, which gradually flattened before the onset of hearing (around postnatal day 12-14). In Fmr1 (human FMR1 homolog) knockout (KO) mice, a mouse model of FXS, progress to achieve the mature-like organization was selectively altered in some presynaptic proteins. These results provide a potential mechanism that may contribute to tonotopic differentiation of neurotransmission in the auditory system during normal and abnormal development. In Chapter 3, we examined how afferent deprivation affects the cellular FMRP dynamics and the association with neuronal reorganizations in the chicken cochlear nucleus, an auditory nucleus receiving afferent inputs from the cochlea. We observed rapid aggregation of FMRP immunoreactivity into large granular structures in a subset of neurons following afferent deprivation, and the persistent FMRP aggregation was associated with neuronal cell death in these neurons. In the surviving neurons, FMRP level was correlated with multiple types of neuronal responses and synaptic rearrangements, suggesting a potential role of FMRP in afferent-regulated neuronal dynamics. In Chapter 4, we investigated how loss of FMRP affects the afferent regulation of neuronal dynamics within a critical period in the mouse ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN), identified the relationship between the closure of the critical period and the onset of auditory experience, and determined a peripheral site of FMRP in regulating these events. We found that a critical period for VCN neuronal loss in response to deafferentation was preserved in Fmr1 KO mice, and within this critical period, the degree of neuronal loss was unchanged. However, the closure of the critical period for neuronal cell death was delayed and temporally coincidental with reduced hearing sensitivity in the absence of FMRP. Furthermore, selective deletion of FMRP expression in spiral ganglion neurons recapitulated the delay in VCN critical period closure, similar to Fmr1 KO mice. This study identified a novel involvement of cochlear FMRP in shaping the temporal features of neuronal critical periods in the brain, and highlighted a peripheral mechanism of neurodevelopmental pathogenesis.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Meta-analysis is a widely used tool to combine research findings from multiple studies in many disciplines. In this thesis we develop novel methods to deal with two critical issues in systematic reviews and meta-analyses, such as assessing and testing between-study inconsistency and time-lag bias. The first part of this thesis concentrates on addressing the inconsistency between different studies' results. Such inconsistency could arise due to several factors, such as heterogeneity in baseline characteristics of individual studies' populations, different methods applied by research teams, and outlying effects of a few studies. In the current literature, the Q and I^2 statistics are commonly used to test for and quantify the between-study heterogeneity, respectively, but they are not powerful in many cases, particularly when the number of studies is small. This article propose alternative Q-like statistics for assessing inconsistency. We also propose a hybrid test to utilize the information and strength of all tests, and it is found to have relatively high power across multiple settings. We use simulated and real data to evaluate the performance of tests.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The second part of the thesis focuses on addressing the time-lag bias of studies. Time-lag bias occurs when studies with positive results are more likely to publish earlier than non-significant findings. The current literature uses the regression-based model to test the time-lag bias, but it is not powerful if the relationship between effect sizes and published time is not linear. This article proposes alternative measures and tests for assessing time-lag bias. Similar to the first part, We also propose a hybrid test to utilize the information and strength of all tests, and it is found to have relatively high power across multiple settings. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Facial expression recognition (FER) is a promising but challenging area of computer vision (CV).Many researchers have devoted significant resources to exploring FER in recent years, but an
impediment remains: classifiers perform well on fine-resolution images but have difficulty recog-
nizing in-the-wild human emotional states. In order to address the issue mentioned above, we
introduced some novel designs and implemented them in neural networks. More specifically, we
utilized an asymmetric pyramidal network (APNet) and employed multi-scale kernels instead of
identical-size kernels. In addition, square kernels were replaced by square, horizontal, and vertical
convolutions. This structure can increase the description ability of convolutional neural networks
(CNN)and transfer multi-scale features between different layers. Grouped convolution was adopted
as well. It reduces the training time and improves the model’s performance. Additionally, when
training CNN, we applied gradient centralization to stochastic gradient descent with momentum
(SGDMGC), which centralizes gradients to have zero mean and makes the training process more
efficient and stable. Furthermore, the learnable preprocessor is placed before feeding initial images
into the classification network. This structure generates images for a better recognition performance
than high visual quality ones.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To verify the effectiveness of the proposed design, we used four of the most popular in-the-wildemotion datasets, FER-2013, FER+, RAF-DB, and SFEW, for our experiments. The results of our
experiment and comparisons with state-of-the-art (SOTA) designs from others demonstrate that
APNet with SGDMGC outperforms most of methods with a single model and even has comparable
performance to methods with multiple models. By conducting an ablation study on our model, we
found that removing any proposed technique or techniques would lead to performance degradation.
The results thus prove that each design has boosted the performance of the proposed model on
FER tasks. Next, simulation results from APNet with SGDMGC combined with the learnable
preprocessors are displayed as well. This combination has a competitive performance compared
with other SOTA model fusion methods.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Psychosis may arise from an altered modulation of the mesolimbic dopamine system. However, the source of upstream disturbance and the underlying neural circuitry remain unknown. It is generally agreed that genetic susceptibility contribute to the development of psychotic disorders. Among identified risk genes, several encodes multiple members of the 14-3-3 family of proteins. Previously, by transgenically expressing an isoform-independent 14-3-3 peptide inhibitor (difopein), we reported that 14-3-3 functional knockout mice exhibit psychomotor behavior and increased dopamine content levels in their striatum, both corresponding to human psychosis. To identify the key brain regions involved in the top-down control of specific schizophrenia-associated behaviors, we utilized an adeno-associated virus mediated difopein expression approach and found that region-specific inhibition of 14-3-3 proteins in the dorsal hippocampus CA1 (dCA1) alone is sufficient to induce psychosis-like behaviors in mice, including a novelty-induced hyperlocomotive activity associated with an increased neuronal activation in the hippocampus.While hippocampal hyperactivity is implicated in psychosis by both human and animal studies, whether it induces hyperdopaminergic state and the underlying neural circuitry remain elusive. Here, we further showed that 14-3-3 dysfunction in the dCA1 over-activates ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopaminergic neurons, and such over-activation is necessary in eliciting psychomotor behavior in mice. We demonstrated that such hippocampal dysregulation of the VTA during psychomotor behavior is dependent on an over-activation of the lateral septum (LS), given that inhibition of the LS attenuates over-activation of dopaminergic neurons and psychomotor behavior induced by 14-3-3 inhibition in the dCA1. Moreover, 14-3-3 inhibition-induced neuronal activations within the dCA1-LS-VTA pathway and psychomotor behavior can be reproduced by direct chemogenetic activation of LS-projecting dCA1 neurons. Collectively, these results suggest that 14-3-3 dysfunction in the dCA1 results in hippocampal hyperactivation which leads to psychomotor behavior via a dCA1-LS-VTA pathway.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In many biomedical studies, multiple sourced data with varied features are observed on the same subjects. Examples include longitudinal markers measured along with a time-to-event outcome of interest and multiset data with varied dimensions. To extract the association structure from the multi-sourced data poses great challenges. We present two Bayesian frameworks utilizing latent variables in order to provide solutions for these two specific data scenarios. For modeling longitudinal markers measured along with a time-to-event outcome, we develop a fully Bayesian joint longitudinal-survival model that uses a latent class structure to facilitate discovery of subgroups exhibiting distinct behavior, and our formulation incorporates estimation of the number of subgroups and offers enhanced flexibility with a subgroup-specific piecewise linear log baseline hazard. For modeling multiset data with varied dimensions, we propose a Bayesian framework that uses latent factors to decompose data into four conceptual parts: joint structure induced by the latent factors shared across all the sets, partial association structure induced by the latent factors shared by the associated subsets of the multiset data, individual structure induced by latent factors unique to each set, and noise. Our method enables flexible selection of latent factors and discovery of association structure as well as variable selection in the joint structure (and, if desired, in the partial association structure). For both methods, we show the ability and the performance by simulation, and use real data for demonstration.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Many music therapists provide school-based services of various forms throughout the country. Music therapy is eligible for inclusion in IEPs as a related service, but there has been little to no research into the rate at which music therapists are involved with IEP procedures. IEP teams must include a special educator, general educator, the student’s parent(s) or guardian(s), a school district representative, a school psychologist, and any related service that the student receives. How often do music therapists communicate and collaborate with these IEP team members? The researcher developed a 44-question survey to address these inquiries and distributed it to all MT-BCs who consented to receive research invitations. A total of 209 responses were included in analysis. Respondents practiced in all seven regions of the country and worked in a variety of school settings. Respondents had access to their students’ IEP information 82.8% of the time, and of those that had access to IEP information, 81.5% were satisfied with their level of IEP involvement. Most respondents communicated with IEP stakeholders on an as needed basis, reflecting the individuality and variability of needs that each student has. Limitations, implications for practice, and suggestions for future research are included.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Loop unrolling is a compiler optimization that can improve the performance of applications without explicit intervention from programmers. In this study, we analyze how traditional loop unrolling techniques attempt to improve performance, and we propose new unrolling strategies that can unroll a greater number of loops than what is usually possible. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We perform loop unrolling using our assembly optimizer, which analyzes and optimizes code at the assembly level instead of at the compiler level. This gives us a different perspective of the code than what a typical compiler would have, as we do not concern ourselves with the source code or an intermediate language. We are free to make modifications at the instruction level, which allows us to optimize large sections of code that might otherwise be impossible to work on.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The optimizer collects statistics on the loops it unrolls, some of which are shown in our Results section. We ran our optimizer's unrolling algorithms on the SPEC 06 benchmark suite, and present both the statistics it generated as well as performance results from three different simulators. While performance gains are highly dependent on the application being optimized, we have shown it is possible to achieve considerable improvements by the use of loop unrolling.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>There are widespread concerns about disparities in educational attainment in the United States. Unfortunately African American, Hispanic, Native American, and low-income Broward County Public Schools high school students participate in College Bound Type Programs at lower rates than students of other races and ethnicities. Many of these students are missing out on the significant advantages associated with college pathway programs such as higher post-secondary enrollment, persistence, and graduation rates. This quantitative outcomes study examined the associations with post-secondary enrollment of participating in College Bound Type Programs for Black and Hispanic Broward County Public Schools students who attended high schools in low-income communities. 3,620 students who entered ninth grade in 2013 were studied through graduation. Univariate, bivariate, and logistic regression analysis were utilized. Participation in College Bound Type Programs were found to be positively associated with post-secondary enrollment and 4-year college post-secondary enrollment respectively. These results highlight the positive outcomes associated with College Bound Type Program participation for this population. Policy makers and educators are urged to work together to start preparing parents and students as early as elementary school in preparation for College Bound Type Programs in high school.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>There has been an increased interest in trauma-informed care practices in Florida to support children and families across the state who are currently dealing with trauma effects (Florida Department of Children and Families [DCF], 2019). My study sought to understand better the multiple experiences of child care center directors implementing trauma informed care practices after completing the Department's approved TICD course. The trauma-informed care 40-hour course for center directors was launched in 2019 and has been completed by more than 850 child care center directors throughout the state of Florida. I conducted a qualitative multi-site case study using the implementation model. As for sampling, I used a two-tier sampling structure: convenience and critical-case. I conducted one-on-one remote in-depth interviews with 11 child care directors in Miami-Dade County currently implementing trauma-informed care practices. The analytic approach was based on Creswell's Spiral, allowing me to review data multiple times while processing (Creswell, 2013). 
Overall, directors shared their willingness to assist at-risk children and families in their serving area by helping children cope with their ACEs. The findings are here presented by research question as follows: TICP strategies, directors’ challenges, and children behavior. As a result of the study, several recommendations were made to the Florida Department of Children and Families, Child Care Policy Administration, child care practitioners implementing trauma-informed care, and future researchers of this problem of practice.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>We study the asymptotics of various short-range interactions, namely, minimal Riesz $s$-energy, maximal Riesz $s$-polarization, best packing, and best covering, on sets satisfying minimal smoothness assumptions. In particular, we present the proof of the Poppy-Seed Bagel Theorem for polarization and covering on $(\mathcal{H}_d,d)$-rectifiable subsets of Euclidean space with like Hausdorff measure and Minkowski content. This represents the sealing of a gap in the generality of results that existed between energy and polarization. In practice, we verify the short-range properties of polarization and covering to deduce the first order asymptotic formulas for these quantities, depending in a universal fashion upon $\mathcal{H}_d(A)$. We simultaneously use the short range properties to deduce weak* uniformity of optima in the large configuration limit. Our results are sharp in the following sense: for sets lacking one of the regularity assumptions mentioned above, asymptotics do not depend on $\mathcal{H}_d(A)$ in the same way as stated there. \par The manuscript contains several of our results concerning asymptotics of short-range interactions on metrically separated self-similar fractals. Our primary result is the convergence of hyper-singular polarization on independent fractals. We further detail the proofs of convergence of minimal $s$-energy on lattice fractals along explicit subsequences, and the general non-existence of asymptotics for packing and covering on these sets. Taken with results of Lalley, the negative results provide a characterization of convergence for packing and covering on a given self-similar fractal in terms of the algebraic relationship between its contraction ratios. From the negative results, we also derive non-existence of asymptotics for energy and polarization, for sufficiently large parameter. 
\par Finally, we discuss some open problems concerning short-range interactions. We draw upon results of Falconer, Gatzouras, and Lapidus to conjecture about the universality of asymptotic formulas for packing and covering on some Minkowski measurable subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ with non-integer Minkowski dimension $d\in(0,1).$ Then, we view the Riesz $s$-energy of $N$-point configurations as a function of $N$ points in Euclidean space, and propose a rigorous study of the dynamics of gradient descent as a means of producing \textit{local} minima of Riesz $s$-energy on spheres. This leads us to conjecture that "bad" starting configurations make up a negligible proportion of all configurations with respect to $N$-fold surface measure. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The unique size-dependent optical and physical properties of inorganic nanocrystals such as those made of metals and semiconductors have generated an enormous interest in exploiting them to develop a variety of applications. Due to their unique features, they have also been integrated into a variety of applications, including biological sensing, imaging, optoelectronic devices, and as fluorescent probes in biology. Growth of these materials using either hydrophilic or hydrophobic conditions yields nanocolloids that are not readily compatible with biological systems, due to either the hydrophobic nature of the ligands or the labile properties of the coatings. The main focus of this dissertation is to design and synthesis a series of molecular scale and multidentate N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC)-based ligands and apply them for the surface functionalization various inorganic nanocrystals and render them water soluble. We also summarize coordination interactions of NHC moieties with the gold surfaces to get better understanding about nature of NHC-Au bond.	In Chapter 1, we summarize some of the basic optical and physical properties of inorganic nanomaterials including, quantum dots (QDs), gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), and gold nanoclusters (AuNCs). We briefly describe the history of growth strategies for preparing high quality QDs, AuNPs, and AuNCs. We then provide an overview of the surface functionalization methods to assemble colloidally stable and biocompatible nanoparticles followed by introducing the N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC)-based ligands as a novel metal anchoring group and their application in modern surface chemistry.
	In Chapter 2, we will focus on the synthesis of hydrophobic oleylamine-coated gold nanoparticles (OLA-AuNPs) and the surface coordination with N-Heterocyclic Carbenes (NHCs) relying on ligand substitution strategy. We detail the synthesis and characterization of three distinct water-compatible NHC-based ligands: an amine-modified small molecule, a monomeric NHC appended with a short poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) block, and a modified poly(isobutylene-alt-maleic anhydride), PIMA, that simultaneously presents multiple NHC groups and several short PEG chains. We find that rapid competitive ligation onto the AuNPs (often requiring several minutes of mixing) takes place regardless of the exact structure of the ligand. Furthermore, the long-term colloidal stability of the NHC-stabilized AuNPs have been tested after phase transfer to water, a highly challenging chemical venue for such groups due to their moisture sensitive nature. Our experimental data show that the multidentate NHC polymer coating exhibits the highest affinity to AuNPs, which manifests in long-term colloidal stability in buffer media, absence of any aggregation or degradation build up for at least one year of storage. In addition, the NHC-polymer-coated AuNPs exhibit long term resistance to competition from reducing small molecules such as dithiothreitol, DTT.
	In Chapter 3, we introduce a top-down etching strategy using poly (ethylene glycol)-appended-NHC (PEG-NHC) ligands to promote surface digestion of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). We find that under long term incubation conditions using excess molar ratios of PEG-NHC ligands, with respect to AuNPs, progressive etching of Au surfaces takes place. This progressively alters the plasmon absorption features, yielding the formation of NHC-Au complexes. This top-down etching method has provided us insights about the nature and strength of coordination interactions of NHC groups with Au surfaces; these interactions are inherent controlled by the σ-donating nature (soft Lewis base) of NHC which match the soft acidic nature of Au surfaces, resulting in very strong coordination interactions and binding. We use UV-vis absorption measurements to monitor the transformation process, where loss of plasmonic features of AuNPs with time takes place. We further characterize the digestion kinetics by extracting a characteristic time which is found to depend among others on the ligand to AuNP molar excess. We then combine these data with 2-D 1H, 13C NMR spectroscopy, matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI), and transmission electron microscopy measurements to identify the structure and chemical nature of the resulting NHC-PEG-Au complexes.
	In Chapter 4, we describe the formation of fluorescent blue emitting ultrasmall gold nanoclusters (Au NCs), following the digestion process described in Chapter 3 above, achieved under thermal treatment. This route offers an elegant way to produce stable and homogeneously dispersed AuNCs. Specifically, we show that heating of Au-NHC complexes triggers the formation of ultra-small gold nanoclusters that are fluorescent in the blue region of the optical spectrum upon UV excitation. Here, the starting non-fluorescent NHC-Au(I) complexes undergo aurophilic interactions (as is the tendency for gold(I) compounds) and form blue fluorescent small size nanoclusters. We carry out a thorough characterization of the nanoclusters using analytical techniques such as UV-vis absorption, fluorescence spectroscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Among others, we find that these nanoclusters show the excitation maximum at 380 nm and the emission maximum at 460 nm. Transmission electron microscopic analysis shows that most of these particles are &lt;1 nm.
In Chapter 5, we provide a summary of the work assembled in this dissertation focusing on coordination interactions of N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC)-based ligands with the inorganic nanocrystals, along with the future research directions that expand on the ligation of NHC ligands with other transition metal cores including iron, silver, and platinum nanoparticles and their potential applications.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>	Many studies have been conducted examining musicians’ injuries and their prevention; however, most of this research focuses on the advanced pianist.  Pedagogues and researchers agree that the early stages of piano study are crucial for developing proper habits regarding piano technique, and many believe that poor piano technique can be a factor in playing-related injury.  An examination of piano teachers’ perceptions and practices regarding beginner-level technique and injury prevention is necessary in order to further investigate and understand the causes and solutions to this medical phenomenon.	The purpose of this mixed methods study was to investigate current perspectives and perceptions of pre-college piano teachers regarding teaching technique to the beginner-level student and the relationship those perspectives have with injury prevention.  Several factors were examined including the extent these teachers’ strategies reflected existing research concerning injury prevention and technique.  Influences such as method books or prior education were also assessed to determine the root source of pedagogical choices. 
The researcher created a questionnaire that was distributed to pre-college piano teachers from across the United States.  A total of 216 participants responded to the survey.  The respondents answered questions regarding (I) demographic information; (II) teaching technique perspectives and practices; (III) method book information; and (IV) teaching injury prevention perspectives and practices.  Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected.
Results suggested that many teachers do believe the relationship between beginner-level technique instruction and injury prevention exists; however, the emphasis each participant places on certain techniques varies across demographic groups.  When teachers were divided into groups according to their preferred method books, the order in which they introduced technical skills to students varied.   Emphasis on various skills also differed when participants were organized into groups according to their personal experiences with playing-related musculoskeletal disorders.  Other demographic groups such as the primary age group taught seemed to have little bearing on the responses.  According to a pair of Pearson Correlation Coefficients, weak positive relationships were found to exist between the participants’ awareness of injury prevention and their education level and between their awareness and their amount of teaching experience.  
A series of open-ended questions allowed for the participating teachers to describe their teaching philosophies and strategies in their own words.  Many commented positively on the importance of teaching technique while others detailed tactics they used in teaching students.  Some described strategies they used at various stages of learning.  A few respondents even reported having no specific philosophies regarding the subject matter. 
These responses were also compared to existing research literature concerning piano technique.  Many mentioned strategies that have been shown to benefit students in the injury prevention area include slow practice, warming up, and teaching students to avoid tension in their playing apparatus.  While some stated that they often delay serious technical study until later in the student’s playing career, many comments were made about prioritizing technique in order to prevent playing issues which many researchers have concluded as best practice for piano teachers. 
The prevalence of body awareness and technique methodology training was also surveyed.  A majority (54.41%) of participants reported they had received some sort of training although that education varied from attending a local music teachers workshop to being certified in popular methods such as Alexander Technique or the Taubman Approach.  Those who indicated more specific and detailed training often provided meticulous responses concerning their teaching philosophies. 
The researcher recommends for all beginner-level piano teachers to prioritize healthy piano technique with their students including using the parents of young students as a helpful resource to aid in the child’s development.  Teachers who feel inadequately prepared to aid students in this area should seek further education through workshops, books, conferences, and other opportunities to better equip themselves for teaching.  This study provides the basis for more research to be conducted on beginner-level piano technique in order to assist in the prevention of future injuries and to promote healthy and fulfilling piano playing.

            <DISS_para>Online instructors utilize instructional strategies to mitigate challenges that arise from transactional distance. These strategies can also facilitate establishing instructor social presence and identity, which is a common concern in online learning contexts. Effective online course introductions provide an opportunity for instructors to introduce themselves to online learners and model effective self-disclosures early in the course. Introductions help online learners know more about their course instructors and help them have a sense of what kind of an instructor they will be engaging in learning interactions with.Although course introductions are common first-day-of-the-class activities, there is limited empirical research on what students like to know about their instructors at the start of a course. Furthermore, previous studies demonstrate inconsistent findings regarding student perceptions of and preferences for the timing and type of instructor self-disclosures that are appropriate in an educational context.
This exploratory study uses survey design to examine undergraduate and graduate students’ perceptions of and preferences for online instructor course introductions. Participants were recruited from a university’s research pool. The data set included 110 responses that were analyzed using descriptive statistics and content analysis. Findings show that it is important for online learners to know about their instructors, preferably their professional qualifications. When the instructor feels like a real person, students feel like they learn more. Most students turn to multiple different sources to learn more about their instructors even before a class begins. Reading the instructor’s course introduction is the most common approach to learning more about the instructor, while looking up the instructor on social media is the least common approach.
Aligned with knowing more about the instructor’s professional qualifications, students find instructor self-disclosures about professional qualifications (e.g., course information, prior professional experience, college experiences, prior education, and hobbies) more appropriate than personal life details (e.g., personal opinions, relationship information, religious affiliation, socio-economic status, political affiliations, and financial information). Course information related disclosures had the highest approval ratings, while financial information had the least.
Most students like to know what their online instructors look and sound like. Sharing instructor photos and videos as part of online course introductions had high approval ratings. Participants prefer instructor photo as a professional photo or headshot more than an informal photo or snapshot and a selfie. Moreover, instructor photos related to profession had the highest approval ratings in terms of types of photos that an instructor can add as part of course introduction, followed by pets, travel, family, and food. Introduction videos should be shot in the instructor’s office, followed by in a classroom, in their home, and outdoors.
When asked how they perceive an online instructor based on a course introduction with no self-disclosure and with prior professional experiences and hobbies self-disclosures, students perceive the latter as more friendly, approachable, interested in their learning, and interested in the class. Moreover, they reported higher ratings of willingness to email the instructor and visit the instructor in office hour. This finding suggests that appropriate self-disclosures early at the start of a course might help instructors reduce tensions around transactional distance and help them be perceived as real, and increase student willingness to interact with their instructors.
The findings of this study challenge instructional practices in which instructors self-disclose personal and vulnerable information early in the course and personal information in general. Overall, this exploratory study provide additional insights to the literature on social presence and identity as well as instructor self-disclosure in online learning contexts. Limitations were presented and implications for theory, research, and practice were discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study aimed to address the state of data driven decision practices within the Division of Student Affairs at South County College. Framed by an exploratory qualitative case study, this project conducted semi-structured interviews of directors of student affairs and a document analysis of annual reports of the seven departments that constitute the Division. This exploratory case study set out to investigate how the departments within the Division define data, the practices and use of data, and the challenges that faced when managing data. The results from this study reported that participants defined data by the source’s name, platform’s name or simply the name of the office from where they retrieve the data. Participants also highlighted the important role data plays in their department’s ability to identify and attend to students’ needs. This approach connects with the findings on how student affairs personnel use data, the use of data to make improvement in their services and operations offered to students, and to inform their supervisors, leadership, and the college community about their departments’ accomplishments and advances of their goals. When addressing participants’ challenges on managing data, access to data is the major challenge emphasized by participants. This challenge of accessibility to data is described in two ways: more data access for staff and colleagues; and more communication about data availability. In addition, availability of data training is another challenge identified by participants. When talking about what type of training or data literacy is needed, their perception varies upon their experience and contact with data. Accordingly, this study proposes a series of recommendations to support continuous improvement of data practices within the Division of Student Affairs. These recommendations are: enhance data processes and procedures for data access, expand data literacy training, and improve communication and collaboration among the different colleges’ stakeholders. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this document is to examine contemporary performance practice of the maracas and how application of specific techniques can prove beneficial to standard orchestral and modern art music forms. There is little extant pedagogy in the field, therefore awareness of recent trends (emphasis on world music in the classical percussion curriculum) will hopefully cultivate new options and ideas concerning interpretation of western notation and performance practice.  	It is important to understand the instruments themselves—the construction and physics to be sure, but also production and practice. Maracas come in many different forms, so it is essential to illuminate options including mass production versus those made by hand. 
	Perhaps more importantly, a brief overview of traditional Venezuelan music is necessary to connect culture with performance practice. Several genres of Venezuelan music will be discussed as well as the instruments specific to those genres. 
	And finally, this document will provide guidance regarding adaptation of current notation and their application to significant works including maracas.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This treatise aims to explore the evolution of pre-screening audition requirements for college music programs and demonstrate best practices for producing professional pre-screening audition recordings for graduate school, competitions, and music festivals. By learning and applying professional audio-video recording skills, students can learn to record their pre-screening recordings for various platforms, providing opportunities for education and performance while emphasizing entrepreneurship and advancement.While all remote audition recordings require video (and audio), the guidelines and technical requirements surrounding the submission process are evolving annually. As students plan and prepare multiple lists of audition repertoire, the importance of the actual recording process is often overlooked. Post-pandemic technological advances in media (specifically audio/video and file transfer/shared media platforms) have provided numerous opportunities to simultaneously capture HD video and high-resolution audio.
The first part of this document focuses on university music programs and their pre-screening audition requirements. Chapters 2 and 3 introduce basic audio and video terminology, gear, and recording fundamentals. Chapter 4 features in-depth explanations of how the materials learned in chapters 2 and 3 can be applied to capture pre-screening recordings at the highest level. Chapter 5 contains guiding wisdom and thoughts offered by the author to college music students interested in learning audio-video recording, including starting a recording business, how to find work, and the variety of opportunities available to college music students interested in taking up recording as an additional source of income and/or potential career path. Finally, Part Two contains supplemental advanced audio and video terminology for those interested in further study.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The primary objective of this dissertation is to scrutinize knowledge production. We recognize the work produced and shared by feminist geographers such as Donna Haraway and Gillian Rose that have asserted systemic biases in how knowledge is produced and reproduced. This work, like others before, will push beyond the ‘vantage point of master subject’ (Haraway 1988) and engage a variety of participants and research methodologies to answer our research questions. In doing so, this dissertation aims to add a mixed methods approach to the growing body of literature to probe the partiality of knowledge (Nightingale 2003). This dissertation utilizes multiple methodologies to conduct research to demonstrate the importance of recognizing the multitude of knowledge sources when conducting research and aims to amplify situated and local knowledge, particularly from the Global South. To date, there remain significant barriers for underrepresented perspectives and voices to reach academia and the published literature (Hedding and Breetzke 2021), for which this dissertation hopes to improve.Malaria remains the world’s deadliest vector-borne disease, resulting in over 200 million human cases and more than 400,000 deaths annually. While some progress has been made in combating malaria, Sumba Island, Indonesia has lagged much of the rest of Indonesia and the region in lowering malaria infections. Chapters 2-3 survey communities of East Sumba Island, Indonesia to understand knowledge, attitudes, and practices of mosquito control and malaria prevention.
Chapter 2 employs a qualitative approach to investigate knowledge, attitudes, and practices surrounding mosquito control and prevention methods in East Sumba Regency, Indonesia. While malaria is under control in much of Indonesia, transmission in Sumba Island remains high, with an incidence as high as 500 cases per 1000 people per year in some areas. This chapter explores the use of insecticide treated nets (ITNs), traditional Sumbanese mosquito control methods, as well as the role of community-based health workers (kaders) and integrated health service posts (posyandu), to combat malaria. Focus group discussions (n = 7) and key informant interviews (n = 14) were conducted with religious leaders, health workers, and women’s group leaders and were stratified by urban/rural location and malaria incidence. Results indicate that environmental conditions, such as high temperatures, were deterrents to regular use. Furthermore, our results suggest that community-embedded health workers, kaders, and health service posts, posyandu, play an important role in information dissemination related to mosquitoes and mosquito-borne diseases as well as the distribution and use of ITNs.
Chapter 3 aims to investigate local knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to mosquito control and malaria prevention in East Sumba Island, Indonesia through a cross-sectional household survey (n = 757) informed by previously collected qualitative data found in Chapter 2. The cross-sectional household surveys were conducted across six study sites in East Sumba Regency, Indonesia in urban and rural areas with both high and low malaria incidence. Logistic/multinomial regressions examined sociodemographic relationships to themes found within the household surveys. Further, this study utilizes and expands the traditional Health Belief Model to understand mosquito control and malaria prevention behaviors, particularly as they are impacted by gender, socioeconomics, and geographic location. This study uncovered survey respondents’ attitudes, perceptions, and acceptance of the novel spatial repellent use (n = 719) with 95% of study participants expressing a likelihood of using spatial repellent. This demonstrated early buy-in to novel techniques to control mosquitoes. Additionally, results from this study include the influence of risk perception on a willingness to take actions to control mosquitoes to prevent malaria such as clearing tall grass and/or brush, eliminating mosquito breeding habitats, willingness to sell or deliver mosquito control products, and a willingness to educate the community about such measures.
Chapter 4 investigates the role of films used as a key component for World Geography (GEA 1000), an undergraduate course that completes a university-wide cross-cultural studies requirement. Utilizing films, particularly those sourced from underrepresented regions, introduced students to local and situated knowledges outside their typical perspectives and lived experiences. The course was taught remotely during a six-week Summer session in 2020 during the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic. The films used cover a wide range of topics such as poverty, war, climate change, migration, and other key subjects. Upon watching the films, students were then instructed to take a short assessment to evaluate their comprehension of the film content. At the completion of the course, students expressed (through course evaluations) that this format helped contextualize geographic themes and world events as well as served as a learning tool in addition to more traditional methods.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study is to highlight word painting and motivic material in Paul Hindemith’s Das Marienleben. Throughout history, these devices have been compositional techniques used by many composers. This treatise will be helpful in interpreting Hindemith’s Das Marienleben and approaching the music from an experimental view. The life of Mary is shrouded in mystery; the Bible says little about her before she is visited by Gabriel or after Jesus ascends to heaven. Rilke uses poetic license to fill out the unknown details of Mary’s life and Hindemith interprets the poetry by creating a dynamic song cycle that starts with Mary’s birth and concludes with her own ascension into heaven. This study includes figures with highlighted motives, discussion of significant moments within the music, and scriptural passages and poetry that introduce each song. Readers will also find a complete IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) transcription, a glossary of terminology, and a translated edition of Hindemith’s opening remarks on the cycle. The last scholarly writings about Das Marienleben were published over twenty years ago and this treatise aims to bring a new perspective in approaching his music.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This thesis explores the musical, metaphorical, and metaphysical symbolism of the lyre as a term, as an image, and as a physical instrument in fourteenth through sixteenth centuries Italy, analyzing evidence to argue that it acted as a sonic icon. The term sonic icon refers to the visual and sonic importance of this instrument held by scholars, musicians, and artists during this period. This can be seen through multivalences surrounding the lyre as a term, image, or stringed instrument of many types, as a mythical and philosophical symbol, and as a tool for musical performances, including those which involved healing and connections to esoteric practices. The lyre’s importance was re-emphasized through an “early music” revival during this time period where humanist scholars attempted the application and synthesis of their understanding of music in Greek and Roman antiquity with contemporary performances. The present study includes a brief introduction to the lyre and musical practices of antiquity followed by considerations of performance practice, esoteric beliefs, as well as visual and sonic symbolic representations of the instrument. In doing so, I will argue that humanists were engaging in a mimetic relationship with this instrument as an abstract concept in their attempts to re-sound this music, providing an additional lens through which one can view the presence of antiquity in the Italian Renaissance. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Flashcards are with us from our very earliest learning experiences. As infants, we learn to speak words from flashcard pictures. As toddlers, we are introduced to vocabulary concepts and thinking skills with flashcards. In early learning experiences we learn facts, languages, associations, even social skills. Flashcards remain highly prevalent in higher education, especially medical education, vocabulary, language learning, as well as mathematics and psychology. Learners at the highest levels augment their knowledge with flashcards. What actually makes these learning tools so ubiquitous and, ultimately, effective?Two major components of how flashcards work are the testing effect and spaced repetition. The purpose of this quasi-experimental study is to understand the relationship between these elements and flashcard use, particularly in an athletic setting. Athletic coaches spend a considerable amount of time teaching basic factual information (lower level) to their athletes. As a result, less time is spent on higher-level learning such as applying and analyzing. A secondary purpose of this study is to determine if flashcards can effectively be used to help athletes demonstrate higher-level application principles.
To accomplish this, this study will introduce an asynchronous, digital flashcard app as an intervention tool for high school American football coaching. The app will track usage data and results, which will be used to determine if there is any effect on student exam scores. Ultimately, it is hoped that the results offer new tools and approaches to athletic coaching pedagogy.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Trauma events have been documented throughout the continuum of life, and there continues to be a need among helping professionals to work with those who experience trauma. The field of music therapy has experienced a gap in scholarship and education, surrounding trauma work in areas such as mental health, medical health, physical health, and social health. Trauma symptomatology is unpredictable in how it manifests within each individual, making it difficult to treat. Additionally, trauma responses contain much cross-diagnosis symptomatology. Some music therapists strive to provide services to those with trauma symptoms; however, trauma-focused education and training is still growing within the field. This research sought to identify trauma-focused information and clinical insights to assist music therapists who work with survivors of trauma. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To address the gap in the music therapy literature, a mixed-methods approach was used, along with an extensive review of the current literature related to trauma was completed. Resources during this review were included both within the music therapy umbrella, as well as those that fell within other helping professions, such as social work, psychology, education, and medicine. The literature identified a myriad of situations and events in which trauma responses have occurred. Many of these scenarios coincide in areas of work in which music therapy thrives. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Subsequently, music therapists who have worked with survivors of trauma or trauma symptomatology were interviewed on their perceptions of music therapy work within the field of trauma (N = 10). Participant interview responses were then incorporated into common thematic material that emerged among the literature and between participants. Results showed a lack of knowledge and prior trainings in the trauma-focused area that was remedied by individuals seeking additional degrees outside the field and/or additional training through continuing education. Respondents reported both personal and non-personal connections to the area of therapy. Respondents’ therapeutic approaches, goals, and music therapy interventions were also documented. Finally, personal perceptions and changes of therapists resulting from providing services in this area were discussed.  </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The purpose of this thesis was to examine the intergenerational relationships that can be formed between music therapy students (n=2) and older adults residing in an assisted living facility (n=12). Additionally, this study aimed to identify if there are any changes in the perceptions of older adults and music therapy students’ perceptions of one another and to assess if there were any benefits of intergenerational relationships on the mental health and well-being of older adults residing in an assisted living facility. Specifically, this study explored if there was a difference in the 1) quality of life and well-being of older adults, 2) perceptions of opposing generations (college students and older adults who live in an Assisted Living Facility), 3) self-reported depression levels of older adults, and 4) self-reported anxiety levels of older adults after engaging in intergenerational relationships through music. This study used a mixed-methods design through 4 different survey measures and anecdotal interviews. Results indicated that there were improvements in all measures, although not statistically significant. Further results and implications are discussed within the paper. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Florida, in the southeast US, is vulnerable to heatwaves due to its unique geolocation, exacerbated by both high temperature and humidity. To better understand the future impact on heatwave events over Florida we first conduct a retrospective analysis of these heat wave events in the current century using atmospheric reanalysis dataset (ERA5) as a verification dataset to verify two decades of simulations from a relatively high-resolution coupled ocean-atmosphere (RSM-ROMS) and atmosphere (RSM) only regional models. The analysis investigates the length, intensity, and characteristic kinematic and thermodynamic features of heatwave events over Florida between 1986-2005. After ascertaining the fidelity of the models from this retrospective analysis we proceeded to examine the future projection of the heatwave events for the decades of 2041-2060. The future projections are presented only for RSM since the differences from RSM-ROMS for the isolated heatwave events was found to be insignificant for the current and the future periods. We found the projected change of earlier first and later last dates of future heatwave events are associated with a projected increase in the mean surface temperature, a reduction of surface humidity, and a westward dislocation of the North Atlantic Subtropical High. Similarly, we also find that the frequency of the one, two, three, four, and five day heatwave events increase in the mid-21st century relative to the late-20th century period.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study addresses preservice teachers’ self-efficacy in understanding culturally responsive pedagogy (CRP) and their readiness to teach in CLD classrooms. This study analyzed preservice teachers' beliefs in CRP and the challenges or barriers that implementation may present. Also, the research examined preservice teachers' self-efficacy about entering the teaching field. The nation's growing diversity requires that educators address their biases and have confidence in delivering instruction to meet the needs of today's culturally and linguistically diverse student population. The achievement gap between Black and Brown students of color and White students has been well documented, and it is essential to close the gap that is only growing post-pandemic.
With the intense racial climate of late, the implications for addressing culturally responsive pedagogy have never been more important as its essence is being attacked and “banned” across the nation. This study looks to further the conversation on the readiness of educators to teach in our nation’s and specifically the state of Florida’s CLD schools with instructional equity at the core and determine what more teacher education programs may need to do to address this need.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>South African guitarist and composer David Hewitt (1947-2001) left the classical guitar repertoire a collection of works that reflect his experiences and inspirations from western traditions of guitar along with his fascinations with Zulu maskanda music. The resulting compositions constitute a body of work that is utterly unique and dramatically underrepresented in the classical guitar repertoire today. The purpose of this treatise is to offer a hearty introduction to the classical guitarist David Hewitt and his innovative overlap of seemingly polarized worlds of guitar practice. Exploring Hewitt’s training through western and classical idioms with his collaborative and creative maturation into native South African musics will offer an appropriate foundation from which to familiarize guitarists seeking to diversify their repertoire. Ambitious results of this document will awaken a resonance with David Hewitt’s story among guitarists globally, recognizing not the polarity of his perspective but the overwhelming similarities of his experiences and influences to a modern classical guitarist’s viewpoint. Uncovering Hewitt’s works resting in relative obscurity will enrich concert programs for an instrument whose lean repertoire will benefit from an addition of melodic and imaginative African-born compositions from a composer unavailable to exhibit them himself.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Microscopic nuclear shell model calculations have been advancing in capability over the last 40years. Florida State University’s experimental nuclear structure group has participated in this
advancement with the introduction of the FSU interaction in 2019. To provide new data and test
out the theoretical predictions of the FSU interaction the excited, high spin structure of two nuclei
are studied. The first, 37Ar, was studied using high resolution gamma spectroscopy following fusion
evaporation compound reaction. This data was from an experiment at Argonne National Lab in
2017 with GRETINA (Gamma-Ray Energy Tracking In-beam Nuclear Array). Results presented
herein show excellent agreement with nuclear states calculated with the FSU interaction. Several
gamma transitions and levels not published before the start of the analysis are pointed out along
with the next member of the yrast band.
The second nucleus, 29Si, was studied using a direct reaction, 27Al(α, d)29Si. Of particular
interest for this dissertation the (α, d) reaction was first studied by a group at Berkeley lab, who
showed it selectively populates particular states [1]. Importantly the most strongly populated
state by (α, d) is also the yrast fully aligned state of particular interest for comparison to the
FSU interaction. Deuteron spectra of 27Al(α, d)29Si is presented up to the deuteron separation
energy. Results of spectroscopic factor calculations are presented for deuteron cluster formation.
A candidate peak for the fully aligned state is found at 13.7 MeV.
Results from the study of both nuclei are presented in comparison to the FSU interaction.
Agreement is found between FSU interaction and both nuclei for states along and near the yrast
band. The fully aligned state in 29Si shows slight disagreement with the FSU interaction in absolute
value, but on a relative basis the agreement is consistent with previous results from other nuclei
lower in excitation energy, like 37Ar</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Internships are considered "high-impact practices" offering students transformative opportunities to develop new skills and professional identities while immersed in workplace culture. They have also been pinpointed as key to improving student success and employment within science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. However, much of what is known about internships has centered around the experiences of adolescents pursuing traditional academic paths, despite the presence of many nontraditional adult degree-seekers in higher education. As the STEM pipeline gives way to a "pathways" approach and an evolving high-tech economy demands increasing flexibility and worker mobility, stakeholders must consider the impact of age on the internship experience from entry to exit. This exploratory dissertation in practice does this by identifying common challenges encountered by adults pursuing internships and examining ways in which their life course trajectories and structural internship features interplay to create them. Data gathered through semi-structured interviews of 13 adult undergraduates pursuing STEM careers and interning with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is approached through a life course theoretical lens in conjunction with the Internship Process Model developed by Hora et al. (2020a). Thematic analysis reveals common patterns in the experiences of adults throughout the internship process which fall into the overarching categories of challenging logistics, social marginalization, and a deficient recognition of work history. Based on these findings, recommendations are offered to develop a NASA Internship Program which is more accessible and inclusive for an increasingly age-diverse student population. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Finger rings are some of the earliest European artifacts brought to the Americas. Columbus is recorded giving them to the Taíno Indians during his early explorations in the 1490s (Las Casas 1965:288). In addition to this, they are the second-most frequently appearing jewelry item at Spanish colonial sites, to beads (Deagan 2002:122). However, almost no research has been published on finger rings from Spanish Florida. There is a plethora of studies about French Jesuit rings, but finger rings at seventeenth century Spanish Mission sites existed in a much different context. This thesis aims to investigate the significance and meaning of finger rings in mission life at three sites from La Florida: Santa Catalina de Guale (9LI274), San Pedro y San Pablo de Patale (8LE152), and San Luis de Talimali (8LE4). Each site’s assemblage of finger rings differed drastically and reflected the individual societies of the missions. To answer my question, I use a methodology by Harris (2017) that investigates the desirability of an object from different perspectives. The methodology includes five principles by which objects are valued: material properties, expense and exclusivity, sensory appeal, object biography, and fungibility. This methodology combined with an understanding of the context of the finger rings allows me to evaluate the significance of the finger rings at each mission site.
The results of this analysis are that finger rings were significant because they could be used as amulets, objects with supernatural properties, or as adornment that displayed an individual’s status. This thesis provides a foundation for future research on finger rings at Spanish colonial sites and offers insight on cultural identity and continuity at Spanish Missions in La Florida.

            <DISS_para>Working in behavioral health, one sees many different people, function levels, and mental illness. Many patients appear to struggle with identifying emotion. In many groups, emotion has been discussed and there has been many times where different group members have had vastly different answers when asked about emotion in relation to a song or lyrics. The purpose of this study was conducted to investigate the potential usefulness of YouTube videos as a music therapy aid to teach emotion identification through music. A YouTube search was conducted on February 2, 2023, using the search term “music emotion identification.” The first 50 videos at or under an 11-minute runtime were preliminarily screened, and two duplicates were removed. This resulted in 48 videos that were processed to determine if they met inclusion criteria. Of the 48 possible videos for inclusion, 12 met the criteria to be included. Data were extracted from these videos; these data included audience, video format, and a brief summary. Of the 12 videos that met inclusion criteria, most were targeted towards children, contained emotion identification content, and had education as a main theme. Half of the videos meeting inclusion criteria paired music with visual aspects of the video and half used music as background for the video content. Videos that mentioned music therapy were flagged and were revisited to determine whether or not music therapy was present such as a live demonstration or in-depth discussion. Future research could include creating an experiment using these videos to determine if they are effective in improving emotion identification skills. Other considerations include determining if emotion identification skill affects a person’s ability to recognize and control their emotions.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Mindfulness research is growing as educators and practitioners place emphasis on social emotional learning (SEL). Evidence supports mindfulness benefits are both physical and mental to include lowering blood pressure, decreased anxiety, increased executive functioning, and increased ability to pay attention. While the benefits of mindfulness practice are being explored and researched more than ever before, most studies use adults and don’t focus on minority populations. Of studies that have focussed on youth, few use elementary children and even fewer have focused on minority youth for their target population. This study explores the effectiveness and implementation of a mindfulness intervention created intentionally for elementary students attending an urban title I school. In an aim to empower students and make the content for culturally relevant and responsive, I used Patricia Young’s (2009b) ID-TABLET and John Keller’s (1987a) ARCS model as theoretical frameworks to develop and implement an e-book entitled Finding BLISS that taught key concepts of mindfulness and allowed for mindfulness practice. Finding BLISS incorporated characters, voices, and scenarios familiar with the target audience, urban youth, while introducing them to mindfulness as a helpful practice to cope with stress. I used both qualitative and quantitative analysis to determine participant satisfaction and the overall impact of Finding BLISS via the Child Adolescent Mindfulness Measure (CAMM), Instructional Materials Motivational Survey (IMMS), knowledge of mindfulness questionnaire, and focus groups. Data analysis showed a significant difference between pre to post measures on knowledge of mindfulness but no change in actual levels of participant mindfulness. Data also indicated participants were satisfied with the intervention, thought it was relevant, and made recommendations to better capture and sustain their attention.   </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>One of the canonical models in market microstructure has been the Kyle-Back models. The popularity and importance of these models have stemmed from the fact that it helps us obtain liquidity characteristics of the market in equilibrium. It also gives an insight into the price impact which arises from the interaction among the various market participants.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this dissertation, we mainly study the continuous time Kyle-Back models in the presence of a risk-averse informed trader. In the first part, we consider the case where there is only one stock in the market. In addition to this, the risk-averse insider has an exponential type utility, and the belief of the market maker on the distribution of the price at the final time is allowed to be non-Gaussian. We show that the problem of the existence of equilibrium in Kyle's continuous time insider trading model can be solved by considering a forward-backward system coupled via an optimal transport type constraint at maturity. The forward component is a stochastic differential equation representing an endogenously determined state variable and the backward component is a quasilinear parabolic equation representing the pricing function. We also study the properties of the equilibrium obtained for a  small enough risk aversion parameter. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the second part, we extend the theory into the multi-dimension setup.  Like in the first part, we still have one risk-averse informed trader, but now we allow the market participants to trade in multiple stocks. We show the existence of equilibrium even when the belief of the market maker is non-Gaussian. The equilibrium is constructed by considering a Fokker-Planck equation and a system of partial differential equations that are coupled with an optimal transport type constraint at maturity. We also study the properties of the equilibrium that we established.</DISS_para>

      <DISS_content>
         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Symphonic Poems is a collection of two movements Arcadian Flair (06:30) and The Wing of a Lark (8:30) written for wind ensemble. For inspiration, I looked to notable composers John Corigliano, John Mackey, Adam Schoenberg, and Joseph Schwantner. Inspired by the sounds of video games, Arcadian Flair is meant to represent the childhood wonder of a video arcade. Post-minimalist in style, the work incorporates fun, exciting textures, and grooving bass lines reminiscent of many video game soundtracks. Arcadian Flair is comprised of 3 main sections: 2 sections drawing on similar motives followed by a coda. The harmonic structure was systematically constructed through chaining together diatonic pentachords. These pentachords were ordered to create the sharp chromatic modulations between tonal centers of the first two sections. The coda features a chromatic sequence alternating suspended chords with inverted major triads while a slow melody provides contrast to the rapid texture that brings the movement to a climatic close. 
The Wing of a Lark is inspired by a simple 6 note motive [C-B-C-G-G-E] borrowed from a good friend of mine Jaron Brown. This motive is interwoven into most musical aspects of the movement. The motive itself serves as a melody and is fragmented into various ostinato. The intervallic content informed much of the harmonic nature by incorporating the half-step as sudden harmonic shifts and fifths as quintal harmony. The movement is comprised of many short contrasting sections that form a loose narrative of a bird in flight. Larks are birds that sound like they are singing while in flight, thus much of the melodic content is short &amp; fragmented, has a wide range, or comprises of fast rhythms as a bird call might. Over the course of the movement one can hear a rise and fall, often occurring at different rates, meant to depict how a bird may fly in the various air streams in the sky.

            <DISS_para>Classical musicians perform in a domain where success and failure hinges on the opinions of others. Thus, the value of perfection in pursuit of high performance is commonly ingrained in musicians early in their training. Much of the quantitative research on perfectionism focuses on outcomes, but qualitative investigations can help to advance understanding of the experiences of different types of perfectionists in competitive settings (Gotwals &amp; Spencer-Cavaliere, 2014; Hill et al., 2015; Howle &amp; Eklund, 2017; Mallison-Howard et al., 2018; Sellars et al., 2016; Stoeber, 2011). Therefore, the primary purpose of this study was to further understand the experiences of perfectionism by exploring collegiate classical musicians’ perceptions, sources, and consequences of perfectionism. The secondary purpose was to develop a model that can be applied to understand both Mixed Perfectionists’ and Pure-Personal Standards Perfectionists’ experiences. Self-identified Mixed Perfectionists and Pure-Personal Standards Perfectionists (n=12) from a collegiate saxophone studio were interviewed for this study. Participants also completed a demographics assessment and the Sport-Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale-2 (Gotwols &amp; Dunn, 2009). A grounded theory approach was used to guide data analysis and propose the “Dynamics of the Experiences of Perfectionism Model” (Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998). The category labeled perceptions was identified as the core phenomenon of the model, meaning that the entire experience of perfectionism hinges on the performer’s perceptions. Several factors were found to play a role in participants’ experiences of perfectionism. These factors included early experiences, personal standards, concerns over mistakes, perceptions of self, perceptions of the environment, perceptions of the director and peers, definitions of effective performance, preparation, appraisals, perceptions of the audience, attributions, and emotional and behavioral consequences. The proposed model explains how these factors build off each other and layer in a way that illustrates the development of perfectionism and perfectionistic tendencies over time. Results are discussed in relationship to the previous literature along with highlighting applications for music program directors and faculty, musicians, and potential intervention points for mental performance consultants.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The main purpose of this treatise is to draw attention to András Hamary’s piano music. This is done through careful analysis of his two major piano works containing extra-musical inspirations, Jelek and Der Kleine Prinz. Formal, harmonic, motivic, and gestural analyses are employed as they relate to the narrative in the music. The extra-musical inspirations and references are also examined in terms of how much they drive the music’s texture and form. Lastly, the pedagogical merits of the works and their significance in the canon of piano literature are discussed. An in-depth look at both works’ technical and musical challenges are addressed with some recommended approaches and solutions that aim to help pianists who would like to tackle Hamary’s music. Looking into both works not only reveals the creativity in Hamary’s compositional language but also sheds new light on possible perceptions of different structures and narrative that exist in music. This treatise paves the way for future performers and researchers to know and to understand Hamary’s dynamic compositions. I genuinely hope that the music of Hamary will become better known to performers, teachers, and scholars.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This study takes a look at the many effects having an incarcerated household member has on students during the school day. In order to gain a better understanding of these effects, twelve middle school teachers were interviewed about their experiences with these students. According to the teachers interviewed the study found the following.Students often have lower academic performance, more behavior problems, and parents who are simply overwhelmed by their situation. Teachers stated they have not had enough training provided to help them support their students in this situation. Additionally, they felt the school counselors are overwhelmed and there are not enough mental health supports for students in the building. 
Based on these findings I concluded that teachers would like to see more training to teach them how to deal with student trauma, more mental health professionals in the school building, more extracurricular activities that provide the opportunity for mentorship, and a list of community resources that they can share with families who might need extra help.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>       The rate at which teacher turnover is taking place in Hawai'i is a concern for many administrators and staff members in K-12 schools because of the negative impact it is having throughout the schools.  Hawai'i ranks first in the country for teacher turnover rate.  According to the Learning Policy Institute, 4.9% of teachers in Hawai’i are uncertified, which is nearly double the national average (2.6%).  In the 2018-2019 school year, Hawai’i experienced 1,029 vacant teaching positions out of approx. 13,000. It is estimated that more than 60,000 students are taught by an under-qualified teacher every year in Hawai’i (Walker, 2020).	The Hawai’i Teacher Induction Program has been implemented with the intent to increase student achievement along with retaining beginning teachers by offering them instructional support.  All beginning teachers, in the Hawai’i State Department of Education, are required to participate in a three-year induction program.  Beginning teachers are provided with intensive mentorship for the first two years, and a third year of less intensive mentorship, along with an option to participate in professional learning communities and attend outings to help get acclimated and familiar with the Hawaiian culture.  However, very little is known about how beginning teachers perceive the induction program or what components beginning teachers find most and least beneficial.   
	Through this qualitative, exploratory, case study, semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted to explore how beginning elementary school teachers experience and perceive the Hawaii Teacher Induction Program in the Laulima Complex. Purposive sampling was used to identify potential participants.  Nine teachers, across four elementary schools throughout the Laulima Complex on Maui, were interviewed.  Thematic analysis yielded the following findings: beginning teachers from the mainland experience feelings of isolation, teaching is more stressful than expected, the Educator Effectiveness System is challenging and overwhelming, mentoring was the only component experienced by all beginning teachers, availability of mentors differed from school to school, mentors provided professional and emotional support, the decision to stay in teaching was based more on individual factors rather than experiences with the Hawai’i Teacher Induction Program, and many beginning teachers felt mentoring was one factor to consider when making a decision to stay in education.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Despite the promise of equal education opportunities for all students in the nation, the achievement/opportunity gap between English language learners (ELLs) and their non-ELLs peers persists. Time, effort, and resources of all kids have been invested in educational reforms to improve these students’ outcomes without success (Darling-Hammond, 2007; Lopez &amp; Iribarren, 2014; Polat et al., 2016; Soland &amp; Sandilos, 2020). This outcome is also mirrored at a public middle school in Valley County (pseudonym) in Florida. Through semi-structured in-depth interviews and classroom observations, this single-case, qualitative study sought to explore teachers’ understandings of the second language acquisition process, what they perceive as best practices, and what they perceive as the most pressing challenges when working with ELLs. Through a thematic approach, nine themes emerged which revealed that participants have a limited repertoire of ESOL strategies and a limited knowledge base of second language learning. Several misconceptions were evident regarding the way ELLs advance their second language and what educators consider barriers to ELLs' academic attainment. This may be the result of the non-participatory role teachers in this study have in ESOL Professional Developments (PDs). Their view of these trainings as ineffective and unpractical may have decreased their motivation to participate. Therefore, the school and district should provide teachers with coaching and meaningful PDs opportunities to help them develop the set of skills needed to better serve this student population.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this thesis, we develop and study two distinct problems in the field of nonlinear waves. The first part of the thesis is connected to the development of a computational algorithm that preserves underlying structure of the simulated initial boundary value problem in the form of multiple global conservation laws or dissipation rate equations.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>\begin{itemize}\item The time-dependent spectral renormalization (TDSR) method was introduced by Cole and Musslimani as a viable method to numerically solve initial boundary value problems. An important and novel aspect of the TDSR scheme is its ability to incorporate physics in the form of conservation laws or dissipation rate equations. However, the method was restricted to enforce the conservation or dissipation rate of just one quantity. The present work significantly extends the computational features of the algorithm with the (i) incorporation of multiple conservation laws and/or dissipation rate equations, (ii) ability to enforce versatile boundary conditions, and (iii) higher-order time integration strategies. The TDSR method is applied on several prototypical evolution equations of physical significance. Examples include the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV), multi-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) and the Allen-Cahn equations. The work was published in Nonlinearity \cite{chandramouli2022time}.
\end{itemize}
The second half of the thesis identifies a broad class of novel, \textit{non-centered} Riemann problems in optical media with externally imposed gain and loss distributions. Thereafter, we shed light on some unique features that arise from step-like distributions in such spatially inhomogeneous media. Our work thus is an important contribution to the field of non-Hermitian dispersive hydrodynamics.
\begin{itemize}
\item Dispersive hydrodynamics, the study of nonlinear dispersive wave dynamics in fluid-like media, is an active research area that combines mathematical analysis with computational and laboratory experiments. To date, most of the research in this area has been focused on wave phenomena in (i) bulk media, in which case the underlying governing equations are of constant coefficients type, or (ii) inhomogeneous environments, where now the evolution equations contain, for example, a real-valued external potential. In the latter case, the presence of inhomogeneity (in general) hinders the formulation of a Riemann problem due to the lack of plane wave-type solutions of constant intensity (or density). However such waves can exist in non-Hermitian media, as was demonstrated for the nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation with a Wadati-type complex external potential. Inspired by the above-mentioned discussions, in this paper, the notion of non-Hermitian dispersive hydrodynamics and its associated non-Hermitian Riemann problems are introduced. Starting from the defocusing (repulsive) NLS equation in the presence of generic smooth complex external potentials, a new set of hydrodynamic-like equations are obtained. They differ from their classical counterparts (without an external potential), by the presence of additional source terms that alter the density and momentum equations. When restricted to a class of Wadati-type complex potentials, this new non-Hermitian hydrodynamic system admits constant intensity/density solutions. This in turn, allows one to formulate an exact centered (or non-centered) Riemann problem involving a step-like initial condition that connects two exact constant density states.
A broad class of non-Hermitian potentials that lead to modulationally stable constant intensity states are identified. These results are subsequently used to numerically solve the associated non-Hermitian Riemann problem for various initial conditions. Due to the lack of translation symmetry, the resulting long-time dynamics show a strong dependence on the location of the step relative to the gain-loss distribution. This is in sharp contrast to the classical NLS Riemann problem (in the absence of potential), where the dynamics are generally independent of the step location. This fact leads to {a diverse array of} wave pattern dynamics that are otherwise absent. In particular, various novel gain-loss generated near-field features are observed, which in turn drive the optical flows in the far-field. {These far-field non-Hermitian counter-flows could be comprised of various rich nonlinear wave phenomena, including DSW-DSW, DSW-rarefaction, and soliton-DSW interactions. A manuscript containing the results has been submitted to Nonlinearity \cite{chandramouli2023nonHermitian}.}

            <DISS_para>Conceptual knowledge about suicide represents a potential necessary cause for experiencing suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Although some indirect evidence for this view exists, this hypothesis has not yet been directly tested. The objective of the current effort was to take steps toward this end. Using a within-subject design, we tested the effects of a semantic satiation protocol targeting the word “suicide” on the subsequent perceptual judgment of suicide-relevant pictures. We also examined the specificity of this satiation effect by exploring the effects on related concepts of “accident” and “murder.” The sample included 104 undergraduate students. On each trial, participants were asked to repeat aloud one of the three words (i.e., “accident,” “murder,” or “suicide”) either three times (prime condition) or 30 times (satiation condition) and decide whether a subsequent picture matched with the word or not. We performed two-way repeated-measures analyses of variance to compare the differences in response latency and accuracy across conditions and trial types. Results indicated that satiation of the word “suicide” slowed accurate categorization of pictures depicting suicide, murder, or accident, and satiation of the words “murder” and “accident” delayed participants’ response latencies on suicide-relevant pictures. Taken together, findings support the hypothesis that semantic satiation can render the suicide concept temporarily less accessible, thereby providing preliminary evidence for the potential causal necessity of conceptual knowledge in perceiving suicidality. Limitations, implications, and future directions of this work are also discussed. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>High-purity niobium is the material of choice for making superconducting radio-frequency cavities for the modern particle accelerator. While making the cavities from the Nb sheet, it goes through a series of processes including chemical and thermal treatments. These treatments affect the microstructural as well as magnetic properties of niobium. In order to optimize the efficiency of Nb cavities, various treatments have been explored. During the last decade, surface modification through impurity diffusion has been extensively explored and found that the quality factor of Nb cavities can be enhanced by impurity diffusion to the niobium surface. The surface treatments that are found to enhance the quality factor include high-temperature nitrogen doping, low-temperature nitrogen infusion, and most recently mid-temperature furnace baking. Even though these treatments have been shown to improve cavity performance, the fundamental understanding of the phenomenon is very limited, and each treatment has its own drawbacks. During the operation of Nb cavities, the oscillating electromagnetic field penetrates the Nb surface only to the 40-200 nm depth. Hence, the cavity performance is dependent largely on the condition of this layer. Thus, a detailed understanding of the effect of different treatments on the Nb surface is essential.Cutting a Nb cavity for the characterization of its surface after different treatments is economically not viable and the characterizing tools are also limited for the cut-out samples. Based on the characterization techniques, the requirements for sample shape and size vary, for example, microscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, ellipsometry etc. require flat samples whereas magnetization measurements are best made using cylindrical samples. Hence, using a coupon sample characterization turns out to be a cost-effective way of probing the effect of different processing steps. In this thesis, I have used surface-characterizing tools such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and magnetization to explore the effect of some of the recent cavity treatments on the microstructure, chemistry, and magnetic properties of high purity Nb surface. The goal is to construct a coupon-based methodology to explore the effect of different processing treatments.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>	Choral concerts incorporating theatrical elements have become a trend in the United States and internationally. However, there is little academic literature written about staged choral performances and how choral directors can visualize and physicalize choral works. The purpose of this study is to provide choral conductors a sequential process for creating a staging concept and implementing it in rehearsals with the help of a blocking script. The following research questions have guided the study: (1) What are the components of the conductor’s preparation before creating a staging concept of a choral masterpiece? (2) How do these components contribute to creating a staging concept? (3) How does one transform a concept into a document that increases rehearsal effectiveness? (4) What is the sequence of events in a rehearsal process?</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	In April 2022, I was fortunate to be involved in a Bach St. John Passion project in Germany as a stage director. Although it was a fully-staged production, this adventure taught me that there is a potential to transform this work into a semi-staged production, which leads to a smaller budget and opens up opportunities for community choirs and college choirs to experience the beauty of choral theatre. This approach is universal to any choral works, from short octavo music to full-scale masterpieces.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The study first identifies various components in a choral piece, such as the libretto, the performing forces, and the musical architecture, that can contribute to creating a staging concept, which can be the stage director’s interpretation of space and time that the story takes place, the (re)characterization of the roles, or the distinctive emphasis of the plot. The objective of such concept is to bring relatability to the modern audience through reflection of the story. This study then adopts the prompt-book methodology and transforms the staging concept into a blocking script, which serves as a solid guideline when working with the performers and increases effectiveness in staging rehearsals. To conclude, this study suggests the sequence of events in the rehearsal process, so conductors will understand how to approach staging a choral piece from a practical perspective. Recommendations for further study are also listed for conductors who aspire to produce staged choral performances regularly.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>2D and 3D images form the bulk of object data. 3D configurations are extracted from digital camera images, and the surface of the scene pictured is physically reconstructed up to a similarity, via 3D printing. The virtual reconstructions are examined and analyzed using projective shapes. In particular two sample tests for equality of 3D projective shapes of spacial configurations is tested using the concept of projective quaternion. The oriented projective shape of a configuration is represented as a point on a product of spheres, via the new concept of oriented projective coordinates relative to an oriented projective frame. A two sample test statistic for comparing extrinsic means of matched pairs of oriented projective shapes is introduced here. The large sample distribution of this statistic shows that the mean oriented projective shape of matched configurations on the face of a politician menacing the World peace, from his recent media pictures does not match the corresponding projective shape from his earlier days in power. Half space depth has been introduced by Tukey in the context of multivariate analysis, a concept that was later expanded to other types of data depth, such as spherical depth, introduced by Elmore for numerical data. In this thesis, we define extrinsic spherical depth for random objects on embedded manifolds. The sample extrinsic spherical depth is a consistent estimator of the spherical depth. We illustrate sample data depth with simulated data on spheres.</DISS_para>

      <DISS_content>
         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Researchers and scientists regularly work on solving complex real-worldproblems in medical science, environmental science, astrophysics, etc.,
to achieve mission-critical research goals through scientific campaigns.
These campaigns are nowadays materialized by workflows of applications
executing on high-performance computing (HPC), replacing an age-old
monolithic application-based strategy. Moreover, the current data-driven
research trend mandates the emergence of data-intensive HPC applications.
These applications need to manage high volume and velocity of data transfer
and consist of tasks that need inter- or intra-application flows of
data to execute successfully. While handling data volume and velocity
is an established field, managing dataflow is a new area requiring careful research.
Effective dataflow management has to address many HPC I/O issues.
For instance, dataflow in an HPC workflow creates dependencies among the
tasks and causes resource contention on shared storage systems,
thus limiting the aggregated I/O bandwidth achieved by the workflow.
Besides, inefficient dataflow management causes unnecessary data movement
that can further limit performance.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Leadership HPC systems are typically equipped with a deep storage hierarchyof node-local ram disks, burst buffers, global parallel file systems (PFS),
etc. The appropriate usage of this powerful HPC storage stack can overcome
the data management issues in HPC workflows.
This storage stack can be optimal by employing effective
dataflow management strategies.
Most of the state-of-the-art techniques optimize data placement
after the task scheduling process. These methods perform data management
as an aftereffect of task scheduling and can cause unnecessary data movement
and limit I/O bandwidth.
Our research demonstrates that overcoming these I/O performance limitations is
possible by co-scheduling tasks and data to computation and storage resources.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Developing a practically usable task-data co-scheduling framework for optimizingI/O performance of the dataflow of an HPC workflow has to deal with four types
of challenges.
Firstly, this maneuver demands a holistic knowledge of the infrastructure
of the HPC system that runs the workflow. More precisely, we must establish
a methodology to understand the HPC storage stack used by the dataflow in a
workflow. For a thorough understanding, we need to evaluate the performance
of its different components, then present the relationships of the components
in an understandable format for the optimization framework.
Secondly, we need to understand the data dependencies in a workflow. At a higher
granularity, we need to analyze the dataflow and extract the producer-consumer
relationships among the applications of the workflow. We eventually have to
find the tasks involved in each application and devise a strategy to represent
the task-data relationships in the dataflow.
Thirdly, we have to deal with the challenges of leveraging the above system
and dataflow-specific information in a feasible task-data co-scheduling scheme.
In detail, a task-data co-scheduling optimization policy has to assign the tasks
to computation resources and the data instances to storage systems such that the
I/O performance of a dataflow can be optimized. This optimization is a combination
of two NP-hard general assignment problems. Due to exponential time complexity,
finding the solutions to these problems can be impossible in practice.
Hence, in the first step, we need to develop a polynomial time algorithm to
achieve theoretical feasibility.
Finally, although a polynomial time co-scheduling strategy is sufficient for
a static and offline scheduling framework, developing an online task-data
co-scheduler for dynamic dataflow has to incorporate a faster optimization
model that can run in a pipeline with workflow execution. In particular,
we have to come up with an algorithm to approximate the co-scheduling
scheme via a faster linear time greedy approach and adapt the policies
as the dataflow behaviors change or we discover unknown areas in the dataflow
during execution.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation investigates the techniques to optimize aggregated I/O bandwidthin HPC workflows by addressing the challenges mentioned above in the course of four
systematic studies. This research work is the consequence of these four studies
to gradually converge the outcome towards an online task-data co-scheduling framework
for complex HPC workflows. The studies start with a deep understanding of the
components of the HPC storage stack, and we then focus on extracting and representing
the dataflow information. Using these dataflow and storage stack information
extraction and representation mechanisms, we first design and develop an offline
static task-data co-scheduling framework. Our work finally culminates toward developing
an online task-data co-scheduler that runs with workflow execution and dynamically
adjust scheduling policies. More precisely, we perform the following studies.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Firstly, we perform a holistic performanceevaluation case study on BeeGFS, an emerging PFS. We explore the architectural and
system features of BeeGFS and run an experimental evaluation using
cutting-edge I/O and metadata benchmarks. Therefore, we develop a framework of
benchmarks and tools for systematically evaluating file-based HPC storage systems.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Secondly, we start with characterizing the deep learning (DL) training I/O,and gradually broaden our I/O behavior exploration toward I/O workload with more complex
data dependencies. Consequently, we develop Wemul, an emulation framework
for better analysis of I/O and construction of benchmarks for evaluating I/O optimization
strategies.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Thirdly, we introduce DFMan, a graph-based static dataflow managementand optimization framework for maximizing I/O bandwidth by leveraging the powerful
storage stack on HPC systems to manage data sharing optimally among the tasks in
the workflows.
Particularly, we devise a graph-based optimization algorithm
that can leverage an intuitive graph representation of dataflow-
and system-related information, and automatically carry out
close to optimal co-scheduling of tasks and data placement.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Finally, we design and develop GDCFlow, a fast and online task-dataco-scheduling framework for HPC dataflow optimization.
More precisely, we design a novel Split-Apply/Update-Combine-Emit (SAUCE)
strategy to employ a greedy task-data co-scheduling algorithm to find
approximately near-optimal scheduling policies that have magnitude times lower
time cost and pipeline optimization with workflow execution to hide most of the
scheduling cost. According to our thorough experimentation, we found
that DFMan performs comparably to manually tuned optimal scheduling
policies for HPC workflows and GDCFlow's greedy approximation delivers
close to the performance of DFMan's globally optimized schemes, but
with much lower scheduling time overhead.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation considers several topics in the philosophy of action. After the introduction, which is the first chapter, the second chapter argues in favor of a causal approach to reasons-explanations by considering what I call ex-post-facto reasons-explanations—that is, reasons-explanations that cite attitudes that are formed after the completion of the action in question. The third chapter argues that free-will libertarianism can meet the explanation objection understood in terms of contrastive explanation in at least some cases. The fourth chapter defends what I call the asymmetry thesis—the claim that we can intend at will in a way that we cannot believe at will—against Pamela Hieronymi. The fifth chapter distinguishes between two forms of akrasia and argues that this distinction makes a difference to how we answer the question of whether epistemic akrasia is possible. The sixth chapter explains how we can avoid what I call the dilemma problem—that is, the problem of explaining how agents in a subjective dilemma are not necessarily akratic. The seventh chapter does three things: it brings the distinction between the two forms of akrasia previously mentioned to bear on the akrasia problem for the Guise of the Good Thesis, it explains how this response to the akrasia problem provides a way of responding to objections to a unified account of practical and theoretical reason that are based on alleged dissimilarities between practical and theoretical reason, and it considers a novel constitutivist approach to action that is suggested by my response to the akrasia problem. The overall idea that emerges from my dissertation is that we need to include self-determination in the story of action in addition to reasons and causes. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Clinical practice rotations are essential to students learning the art and science of respiratory therapy. It is common for students to rely upon working professionals or preceptors to practice skills introduced on campus during classroom and laboratory courses; therefore, the student and preceptor relationship can influence the learning experience. This exploratory case study aimed to understand how students’ sense of belonging, using Kern’s (2013) proxies for belongingness, feelings, behaviors, and cognitions, was experienced by the inaugural cohort at the University of North Carolina Wilmington. Eight of 15 students participated in an interview conducted by two peers as proxies to answer the following research questions: (1) How do respiratory therapy students experience belongingness during clinical practice rotations? and (2) How does respiratory therapy students’ sense of belonging influence learning experiences during clinical practice rotations? I reviewed transcribed data from recorded interviews using Otter.ai software. Data were then coded using a priori codes aligned with the research questions and descriptive codes sorted into categorical themes. Participants were provided an analytic memo to review the data and analysis for feedback to add clarity. Six of 15 students in the cohort responded to a general belongingness survey to triangulate the collected data for analysis. Participants described how the relationship between the student and preceptor shaped their sense of belonging. The preceptor influenced students’ sense of belonging and their learning experiences during clinical practice rotations. In the preceptor role, belongingness can make the “experience 100 times better” or make students feel like outsiders. Teaching hospitals and programs should evaluate the resources, education, and training available to preceptors to support clinical practice. By focusing on students’ sense of belonging, teaching hospitals and respiratory therapy programs can gain an understanding of the educational needs of students, including minoritized students entering the respiratory therapy profession.  </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This document is divided into two parts. The first part of the paper discusses two sets of twentieth-century piano pieces by Claude Debussy: Estampes (1903) and Images I (1901−1905). The second part focuses on how three female Korean composers used traditional Korean folk songs as the basis for several solo piano pieces: “Curious Cuckoo” (2016), “Popping Chestnuts” (2016), “A Sweet Breeze” (2020), “Balloonflower Waltz in Wonderland” (2019), “What are you doing, Mr. Fox?” (2020) by Heeyoung Yang, Folksong Revisited (2005) by Jean Ahn, and Three Studies of Korean Folk Tunes (2010), and “The Phantom of Arirang” (2020) by Misook Kim. Two artistic movements − impressionism and symbolism − were very popular when Debussy composed Estampes and Images I during his middle period. Although Debussy rejected the use of the term impressionism to describe his music, there are several impressionistic elements in his music. Debussy preferred that his works be associated with symbolism, and he was inspired by several symbolist poets. Both movements contributed to the rich imagery present in both sets of piano compositions. 
In Estampes, Debussy creates a musical journey that spans nearly half the world. It begins in East Asia, moves to Spain, and then returns to his home country, France. Images I has more abstract aspects in terms of design and inspiration. The first part of this document discusses the harmonic language and the wealth of imagery found in these two works by Debussy. 
The second part of the paper highlights piano arrangements by three active contemporary female Korean composers. This part shows how Yang, Ahn, and Kim established their own distinctive compositional features through their use of Korean folk music. This document also describes traditional Korean music genres.

            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to identify the teacher behaviors, rehearsal activities, and targets of instruction which characterize a successful marching band program. Effective teaching characteristics were collected from related literature and used to construct a survey of 79 variables, teacher behaviors (n = 26), rehearsal activities (n = 28), and targets of instruction (n = 25).  The survey was distributed, and 54 marching band directors responded. Participants were asked to rank their top seven characteristic from each category. The resulting rank order was used to construct a second survey deriving from the top characteristics of each category. The second survey was distributed, and 55 marching band directors responded. Participants were asked to rate the seven top characteristics from each category of effective teaching characteristics based on a 7-point Likert Like Scale. Results identified the top teacher behavior as, building culture and student relationships, the top rehearsal activity as, repetition, and the top target of instruction as, tone/quality production. Statistical analysis revealed teacher behaviors and targets of instruction to be rated significantly higher (p = 0.05) than rehearsal activities. Furthermore, a significant difference in the perceived importance of building culture and relationships, and error detection, was found between novice and experienced teachers (p = 0.05). Detailed analysis of remaining results and implications will be discussed in this study. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>	Non-tropical marine miniature supercells are storms that occur in the southeastern United States and over large bodies of water, such as the Gulf of Mexico. Those that form offshore of the Florida Panhandle prompt many special marine warnings and, if they make landfall, may also require tornado warnings. They exhibit characteristics of both miniature supercells found in tropical cyclones (TCs) and midlatitude supercells. The marine supercells within this study consist of storms with 40-dBZ lengths &lt; 20 km (“miniature”) and &gt; 20 km (“low-topped”), with all having average lifetime echo tops &lt; 30 kft.	Utilizing WSR-88D radar data, this study finds that non-TC marine miniature supercells exhibit weak mesocyclones in terms of rotational velocity, are small in diameter, and have values of vertical vorticity comparable to their larger counterparts in the Midwest. Likewise, their mesocyclones are comparable to those in TC-rainbands, particularly in terms of depth, strength, and horizontal size. Echo tops of the non-tropical marine miniature supercells also are found to be similar to TC-rainband miniature supercell heights. “Miniature” supercells within the study dataset exhibit statistically significant linear relationships between echo tops and 40-dBZ contour length and between mesocyclone depth and 40-dBZ length. Uncovering these relationships may help forecasters locate small mesocyclones in miniature marine supercells, or infer mesocyclones located below radar beam level.
	Results show that non-tropical marine miniature supercells occur in a range of different environments. However, average environmental characteristics taken from the Rapid Update Cycle (RUC) and Rapid Refresh (RAP) show similarities to both midlatitude and TC-miniature supercells. Thermodynamic instability (CAPE) is relatable between the midlatitude, TC-miniature, and non-TC marine supercells. 0-6 km shear is greater in non-tropical storms than those found in TCs, with values greater than 20 m s−1. However, lower-level tropospheric vertical wind shear and SRH values are much greater in TC supercells than in non-tropical miniature marine supercells. Tornadic storms within the study dataset exhibit lower values of significant tornado parameters (STPs) and supercell composite parameters (SCP) compared to TC-rainband tornadic supercells, but their values still indicate environments capable of producing right-moving supercells with tornadoes.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Trainer perceptions of computer self-efficacy, technology usefulness, and ease of use affect their ability to deliver hybrid training programs. Certain industries have training requirements mandated by government regulatory agencies. The ability to meet these requirements is critical to protecting public safety and ensuring business continuity. The purpose of this study was to explore if relationships exist between trainers’ perceptions and their ability to meet training mandates. Survey responses from 137 trainers provided insight into these relationships. Interviews were also conducted with 12 trainers to identify and explore other potential moderating factors. Analysis results demonstrated no relationship between perceptions of computer self-efficacy and training completion timeliness. Perceptions of technology ease of use and usefulness demonstrated a minor effect on training completion timeliness. Additional moderating factors were identified which provide deeper insight into training compliance and present opportunities for further research. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation provides an overview of firearms legislation in the United States and evaluates the effectiveness of the Engaging in Lethal Means Safety (ELMS) suicide prevention program. ELMS trains mental health first responders on engaging clients in discussions of means safety. Pre/post/1-month follow-up assessments measured knowledge of lethal means, confidence, and comfort in screening for lethal means, and future intentions to counsel on means safety. All constructs increased significantly at posttest. Confidence was sustained at posttest. Comfort and intent to counsel levels decreased at follow-up but not to pre-training levels. Booster sessions are recommended to further sustain overall effects. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>While modern medicine has made enormous strides in improving patient care, treatment outcomes, and overall quality of life. It has become increasingly more clear that collaborative and highly interdisciplinary research is necessary to continue to develop, test, and design new treatment regimens to improve future outcomes. This body of work is an example of how collaborative, interdisciplinary efforts merge to build mathematical models that can represent many biological systems for future prediction or treatment regimen experimentation. We will discuss the underlying biological background for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) as well as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and what patient groups are mainly affected, respectively. Then, using ordinary differential equations (ODEs) we present separate, mechanistic mathematical models of the TNBC tumor microenvironment (Chapter 2) and of the CD4$^+$ T-cell life cycle in its response to HIV infection (Chapter 3). We present the mechanisms behind calibration and validation of our mechanistic ODE model of TNBC that can give further insight to future treatment regimens (i.e. sequencing, dosing, and timing). We further explore both mechanistic models, TNBC and HIV, through parameter sensitivity analysis to better understand the role each parameter plays both within the model itself as well as within the biological system. We discuss that all presented methods are extremely vital in better understanding and mathematically representing the specific units of the underlying biological systems. This understanding and representation is a first step at building mathematical models that can represent entire biological systems, rather than specific units. Once an entire biological system is represented, collaborative and interdisciplinary medicine will be able to bridge the gap between mechanistic mathematical models and future treatment regimens to ultimately improve treatment options and overall care, but ultimately improve a patient's quality of life.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>	In a technology-driven society, computing devices are being used more in the field of education. Across the nation and around the world, computing devices are advancing and making its way into classrooms. In 2013, Hamilton Charter School (pseudonym) in Northeast Florida started a computing technology adoption by implementing Chromebooks into the teachers’ daily instruction. Studies find benefits to utilizing technology in the classroom and point to the importance of professional development for teachers. This qualitative case study explores the experiences of twelve educators from Hamilton Charter School and how they describe using computer devices in the classroom and the learning opportunities and support they receive about using the devices. The study finds that the educators are using their devices for differentiated learning during center rotations. The teachers do not describe any training on the Chromebook devices and experienced very few learning opportunities for the digital programs the school uses. Based on the conceptual framework used to help with understanding the quality of training the teachers were provided, the educators were not participating in quality training for implementing computing devices. The findings also present that the some of the teachers found their administrators support for incorporating computing devices in the classroom to be satisfactory while others did not.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Mixture models for clustering and regressions and discriminant analysis are the cornerstones of multivariate statistics and supervised/unsupervised learning research. The structure of data has become increasingly complex in many modern applications including but not limited to computational biology, recommendation systems and text/image analysis. Therefore, it is of great interest to develop methodologies and algorithms for mixture models and discriminant analysis that target the challenges arising from such complex data. In this dissertation, I address three types of challenging supervised and unsupervised topics with novel methodologies and algorithms: (1) tensor data simultaneous clustering and multiway dimension reduction; (2) high-dimensional heterogeneous data in mixture linear regression; (3) multivariate and multi-label response classification in high dimensions. The three chapters are elaborated as follows.	
In the form of multi-dimensional arrays, tensor data have become increasingly prevalent in modern scientific studies and biomedical applications such as computational biology, brain imaging analysis, and process monitoring system. These data are intrinsically heterogeneous with complex dependencies and structure. Therefore, ad-hoc dimension reduction methods on tensor data may lack statistical efficiency and can obscure essential findings. Model-based clustering is a cornerstone of multivariate statistics and unsupervised learning; however, existing methods and algorithms are not designed for tensor-variate samples. In the first chapter, we propose a Tensor Envelope Mixture Model (TEMM) for simultaneous clustering and multiway dimension reduction of tensor data. TEMM incorporates tensor-structure-preserving dimension reduction into mixture modeling and drastically reduces the number of free parameters and estimative variability. An EM-type algorithm is developed to obtain likelihood-based estimators of the cluster means and covariances, which are jointly parameterized and constrained onto a series of lower-dimensional subspaces known as the tensor envelopes. We demonstrate the encouraging empirical performance of the proposed method in extensive simulation studies and a real data application in comparison with existing vector and tensor clustering methods.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the second chapter, we consider the problem of finite mixture of linear regressions (MLR) for high-dimensional heterogeneous data where the sample size is much smaller than the number of random variables, which is widely used in many modern applications such as biological science, genetics and engineering. In order to capture the common sparse structure in large heterogeneous data, traditional high-dimensional EM algorithm can be computational intractable thus fail to produce meaningful estimation results. We propose a fast group-penalized EM algorithm (FGEM) for high-dimensional MLR that estimates the regression coefficients from a group sparsity perspective and is computationally efficient and less sensitive to initialization. The statistical property of the proposed algorithm is established without requiring sample-splitting that allows the predictor dimension grows exponentially with the sample size. We demonstrate the encouraging performance of FGEM in numerical studies in comparison with traditional high-dimensional EM algorithms.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The problem of classifying multiple categorical responses is pervasive in modern machine learning and statistics, with diverse applications in fields such as bioinformatics and image classification. The third chapter investigates linear discriminant analysis (LDA) with high-dimensional predictors and multiple multi-class responses. Specifically, we examine two different classification scenarios under the bivariate LDA model: joint classification of the two responses and conditional classification of one response while observing the other. To achieve optimal classification rules for both scenarios, we introduce two novel tensor formulations of the discriminant coefficients and corresponding penalties. For joint classification, we propose an overlapping group lasso penalty and a blockwise coordinate descent algorithm to efficiently compute joint tensor discriminant coefficients. For conditional classification, we utilize an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm to compute tensor discriminant coefficients under new constraints. We extend our method and algorithms to general multivariate responses. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our approach through simulation studies and real data examples.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>While some research exists around the leadership development processes of undergraduate women (Rupert, 2019; Shetty, 2020; Torres, 2019), little exploration has explored the leadership capacity and efficacy development of college women. Dugan and Komives (2007) found that college women scored higher than their male peers on their leadership capacity levels, but undergraduate women scored lower on their leadership efficacy levels than men. This means that women have the skills, traits, and experiences to make them successful in the leadership process, but do not believe in their ability to succeed as a leader. Dugan (2017) notes that low leadership self-efficacy inhibits participation in the leadership process. For these reasons, this study explored the leadership capacity and efficacy development of undergraduate women. Using narrative inquiry as methodology, the study looked to address both how undergraduate women develop their leadership capacity and efficacy and explore how factors and practices shape undergraduate women’s perception of their leadership capacity and efficacy development. This study used the culturally relevant leadership learning model (Beatty &amp; Guthrie, 2021; Bertrand Jones et al., 2016; Guthrie et al., 2017) and the cycle of socialization (Harro, 2013) as conceptual frameworks. A sample of eleven undergraduate women who self-identified as leaders and had taken a leadership studies course participated in the study. Data for the study was collected from participants through a screening tool, a written narrative, and a semi-structured interview. Based on the themes of the study, undergraduate women’s leadership capacity development is influenced through access to leadership opportunities, engagement in the leadership process, observing the leadership process of others, and through socialized traits around gender and leadership. Factors that influenced leadership efficacy development for participants included enacting the leadership process themselves, the environments in which they were leading, observing the leadership of others, messages they received about their ability to lead, and their relationship to other people who encouraged (or discouraged) them as leaders. A discussion of the findings was explored, including the connections to the conceptual framework. Implications for future research and practice were also presented, including recommendations for practice from the study participants.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>A device that can be used to attenuate noise generated in an engine nacelle of an aircraft is an acoustic liner. A conventional single degree of freedom (SDOF) acoustic liner is comprised of a perforated face sheet, honeycomb cells, and a rigid backing. The attenuation characteristics of an SDOF liner are a function of its dimensions and the fluid properties of the medium. In other words, the device is passive and provides a constant impedance boundary condition on the nacelle walls. However, noise generated by an aircraft is a function of the phase of flight it is in. To maximize attenuation over the entire duration of the flight, it would be advantageous if the liner could change its attenuation capabilities based on the flight phase.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation presents the development of a dielectric elastomer acoustic liner (DEAL), a device which can modify its acoustic properties. The DEAL is comprised of a standard SDOF liner with its cavity depth split by a compliant dielectric elastomer (DE). A dielectric elastomer is a smart material capable of changing shape. When a DE is maintained in tension and subjected to an electric field, it can produce large strains resulting in a decrease in stiffness and resonance frequency. When a DE is coupled with an acoustic liner, actuating the DE effectively modifies the resonance frequency of the entire liner. The design of a DEAL would be aided with a model to choose the best dimensions and DE material properties.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A lumped element model (LEM) of a dielectric elastomer is verified and validated. We assume the elastomer behaves as a membrane because it is very thin and cannot support a bending moment. Therefore, we derive the LEM from the damped wave equation. We validate the model by experimentally measuring the normal velocity on the membrane surface using a laser doppler vibrometer while subjecting the membrane to a low frequency, sinusoidal pressure loading. The results prove the membrane assumption is accurate because the mode shape derived aligns with the mode shape measured. Using the relationship between pressure loading and volume displacement as a function of static deflection, the LEM is created. The resonance frequency is a function of material properties, dimensions and stress where the stress is a function of the applied voltage. Decrease of the membrane resonance when subjected to an electric field is measured and compared to predictions, with a maximum difference of 2.3\% at 5 kV. The results validate the LEM of the dielectric elastomer membrane, allowing integration into an acoustic liner model to predict the acoustic impedance of a DEAL.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The modeling, design, and optimization of a DEAL is then performed. A lumped element model of an embedded dielectric elastomer acoustic liner is derived and validated in a normal incidence impedance tube and is subsequently used to optimize its performance. The optimization cost functions include (1) maximization of the absorption coefficient over a targeted frequency range, 400 – 1600 Hz, and (2) maximization of the change in the fundamental resonance frequency of the liner when the membrane is activated. Good agreement between measured and predicted absorption is observed. Tuning of the resonant frequency requires us to numerically solve for resonance using the imaginary part of the impedance, since an analytical expression for resonance could not be derived due to coupling between the acoustics of the liner and the vibrations of the DE membrane. Nonetheless, resonant frequency shifts predicted with the lumped element model compare favorably to those measured with the activated liner sample, with a shift of over 200 Hz. For the DE membrane tested here, the total weight added by the membrane for 1 million cells is 4.5 kg, a small weight addition for a relatively thin liner with low frequency attenuation. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study sought to explore the experiences of teachers during Covid-19, their sense of morale, and the supports that were influential to that sense of morale. Three research questions were explored to better understand how teachers experienced teaching during Covid-19: (1) How do middle school teachers describe the experience of teaching during Covid-19?, (2) How do middle school teachers perceive their sense of morale during the Covid-19 pandemic?, and (3) What supports do these teachers describe as influential for their sense of morale? I conducted an exploratory, qualitative, single case study using semi-structured interviews of five participants selected in a purposeful sample. It was found that teachers experienced a number of challenges from March 2020 through May 2021 including ineffective communication and a lack of training, purchasing technology and materials out of pocket, a loss of control through technological difficulties and student disengagement. From August 2021 through May 2022 teachers experienced challenging student behaviors, loss of learning and social skills in students, and a significant learning loss in economically disadvantaged students which exacerbated inequity. An analysis of these five teachers’ experiences and feelings during Covid-19 indicates that their sense of morale was fluid. All five participants had times when their state of morale could best be described as low; however, all five participants also had times when their state of morale could best be described as having mixed levels of morale. The positive influences on their state of morale varied by participant. Four of the five cited support from coworkers as a positive influence on morale. Another cited the relationships with their students and their love of teaching as positive influences. Another cited working from home as her safety needs were being met. Two of the participants cited student behaviors during the hybrid year. One of the two that cited student behaviors focused on the lack of negative student behavior. The other participant explained she had increased student engagement and smaller class sizes. The negative influences on their sense of morale included technological difficulties for all the participants at some point during hybrid learning or remote teaching, student disengagement, and lack of communication. All five also discussed the negative influence on their sense of morale from student behaviors once all students returned to in-person instruction. Another negative influence on three participants was a reduced sense of safety on campus when all students returned.
Finally, teachers value both instructional and social-emotional support from their colleagues more than administrative support. Based on these findings, five recommendations are offered. First, it is recommended that districts plan for effective communication for a future crisis. Second, it is important to address student behaviors after a school closure due to a crisis ending to ensure learning is not interrupted. Third, it is essential to provide teachers with the technology needed to perform their jobs in remote and hybrid teaching. Fourth, the disproportionate learning opportunities for economically disadvantaged students need to be addressed by providing access to needed technology and online connectivity and communication with parents during remote learning and allocating additional resources to support their learning when they return to school. Finally, teacher collaboration should be promoted, and teacher leaders must be recognized and rewarded for their efforts to support their colleagues.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This treatise explores the flute methodology of Alberto Almarza, the Associate Professor of Flute at Carnegie Mellon University. This project provides his biography, philosophy of music and teaching, approach to practice, flute fundamentals, musicianship and artistry. The foundation of this project consisted of thirty-two transcribed flute lessons and two interviews with Almarza. This methodology takes a psychological, research-based approach to teaching, using anatomical descriptions in his explanations that equip students with the history behind the rules in the musical styles, as well as concrete tips to further develop their musicianship skills. Furthermore, he creates clear rules called “Guiding Principles” that extrapolate to all forms of music. This methodology develops students’ critical thinking skills, self-awareness, and provides them with a logical and efficient way of approaching music and practice. This is the first document that organizes this invaluable methodology; it serves as a guide in the flute community, specifically for flute students, pedagogues, and musicians at the advanced and professional levels. This resource is anticipated to be used as the foundation for a future practice book for flutists.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to evaluate and describe how a realistic and evidence-based simulation training on clinical skills impacts nursing students' proficiency, self-assessment of proficiency, confidence, enjoyment, and anxiety. The study explored the impacts this simulation training program had on FSU's nursing students enrolled in 2nd and 3rd semesters. A total of 170 nursing students participated in this study. Different modalities of simulation equipment (task trainers and high fidelity mannikins) were utilized to achieve the learning objectives of each skill taught during this training. The design of this skills training follows the Simulation Design standard of best practice by INACSL (Watts et al., 2021). Questionnaires with Likert scale and open-text responses were used to collect data on the students’ self-reported proficiency, confidence, enjoyment, and anxiety. Achievement of skill proficiency was measured by faculty using checklists for each skill taught. I served as both the researcher and the designer of the boot camp skills course.The results of this study indicated that most nursing students who participated in the simulation training achieved proficiency in the clinical skills taught. Results also revealed that self-reported proficiency, confidence, and enjoyment significantly increased for all skills taught in the training program. However, the findings did not reveal a statistically significant difference between the pre and post-simulation means for self-reported anxiety. 
Introducing a simulation boot camp for skills practice before students start clinical rotations seems like a good adjunct that supplements clinical practice. Students enjoyed the training, receiving feedback, and practicing in a simulated environment resembling reality. However, it remains to be seen whether the skills learned in this boot camp transfer into real-world practice. More research is needed to evaluate the transferability of skills acquired through simulation into clinical practice.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of staccato and legato conducting gestures on perceptions of note duration. I also investigated how the effects of conductor gesture might differ for participants with and without conductor training. In addition, I explored whether participants believed that watching the conductor influenced their ratings of note duration.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The participants (N = 173) for this study were collegiate musicians who observed four brief video recordings of a conductor demonstrating short and long gestures synchronized with audio recordings of a wind ensemble performing short and long notes. All possible pairings were used for audiovisual stimuli, including two congruent (i.e., short conducting gestures with short performance audio and long conducting gestures with long performance audio) and two incongruent stimuli (i.e., short conducting gestures with long performance audio and long conducting gestures with short performance audio). Participants were randomly assigned to one of four unique presentation orders. After observing each recording, participants rated the overall note duration of the excerpt by manipulating a slider anchored by 1 (extremely short) and 101 (extremely long). The numeric values were not visible to participants, and the slider was positioned in the center prior to the participants’ rating. After viewing and responding to the four recordings, participants were asked if they believed that watching the conductor influenced their ratings of note duration. They also answered a free-response question where they explained their answer.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Results indicated a significant main effect for performance audio (h2p = .823) and conducting gestures (h2p = .264) for participants’ ratings of note duration. There was also a significant three-way interaction between conducting gesture, performance audio, and presentation order, F(3, 169) = 16.505, p &lt; .001, h2p = .227. Participants rated the note duration of congruent audiovisual recordings as expected, with staccato notes being rated shortest in duration and legato notes being rated longest in duration. Participants’ ratings of the incongruent audiovisual recordings, however, highlighted the fact that their ratings of note duration were not independent of the visual gestures displayed by the conductor. More specifically, short performance audio excerpts were rated as longer when paired with long conducting gestures than with short conducting gestures, and long performance audio excerpts were rated as shorter when paired with short conducting gestures than with long conducting gestures. Further, participants’ ratings indicated that the influence of visual conducting gestures on ratings of note duration were similar between both conditions—staccato and legato.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In response to the question “Did watching the conductor influence your perception of note duration?” significantly more participants reported yes (n = 79) or no (n = 69) over “I am not sure” (n = 25, p &lt; .001). Participants’ free responses to the question “Please explain your answer” helped to contextualize these findings. The coding categories for the open-ended question were (a) awareness, (b) audio priority, (c) visual priority, (d) interaction, (e) conducting gesture, and (f) other. The overall percentage of coded responses that mentioned visual (19.94%; visual priority and conducting gesture categories combined) or auditory (20.60%; audio priority) elements occurred with similar frequency. In the interaction category (14.29%), many participants explicitly commented on the influence of visual conducting gestures on their perceptions of audible note duration with comments such as “the longer motions did stretch out the notes somewhat, or rather it felt that way.” The awareness category (34.22%) highlighted participants’ sensitivity to observing the incongruent audiovisual stimuli.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The influence of visual conducting gestures on ratings of note duration were similar between musicians with and without prior conductor training, and those similarities were consistent across all audiovisual pairings. However, prior conducting experience did seem to influence musicians’ opinions regarding the visual role of the conductor when rating ensemble note duration. Specifically, a greater percentage of participants with conductor training reported that the conductor did not influence their ratings of note duration as compared to untrained conductors. Therefore, it seems that participants’ perceptions of note duration were inconsistent with their actual ratings of note duration. Conducting training might have increased participants’ confidence in explicitly rating the sound of an ensemble, despite the fact that participants’ actual ratings of note duration demonstrated a significant influence based on visual conducting gestures. The findings from this study add to the body of literature on audiovisual sensory interactions and perceptions of conductors. Implications for music educators and suggestions for future research are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Online course quality is a prominent issue due to the increasing number of online programs and courses offered by institutions of higher education. To ensure the best student outcomes, it is necessary to implement effective systemic support for quality assurance in online learning. Providing faculty with the environmental supports required to design their courses using quality standards may ensure better outcomes for students. Similarly, if best practices are not well-supported, not only will student outcomes suffer, but so will the reputation of online learning. As complex ecosystems with limited resources, colleges that are developing online programs and courses should know what environmental factors are effective for improving faculty adoption of quality standards. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Quality MattersTM  (QM) is a quality assurance process for online learning comprising a rubric, training, and peer review. Research by QM established the effectiveness of the QM standards when implemented in online courses. Other research suggested that there may be a gap in implementation after training. Although faculty training to design courses around quality standards is intended to ensure the best outcomes for students, faculty often do not demonstrate the adoption of those standards. While QM focuses on three areas of quality improvement to improve the knowledge and skills of faculty, Gilbert’s (2007) Behavior Engineering Model predicts that other factors have an influence on actual performance. As institutions of higher education invest in faculty professional development to improve course quality, additional institutional resources may also be required to support faculty to implement what they have learned. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study explored effective strategies for supporting quality assurance practices that encourage the adoption of QM criteria into online courses at state colleges in Florida. Three research questions guided this study: </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>1. What environmental supports are colleges in the Florida Quality Matters Consortium (FLQMC) providing to APPQMR-trained faculty to facilitate the adoption of QM criteria in their online courses?  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>2. What are the perceptions of faculty who have received APPQMR training about how effectively their QM program supports adoption of QM criteria? </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>3. What are the perceptions of college QMC about how effectively their program supports adoption of QM criteria by faculty who have received APPQMR training? </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para> A sequential, mixed-method multi-case research design was used to collect descriptive statistics and qualitative data to gather information about what environmental supports Florida College System colleges provide to faculty to facilitate the adoption of QM criteria in their online courses. To develop a more complete understanding of the primary research question, an explanatory two-part mixed-methods study collected both qualitative and quantitative data to describe college supports and explore the perceptions of QM coordinators and online teaching faculty. The study included: (1) document analysis and (2) structured interviews with selected participants via Zoom. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study utilized the BEM (Gilbert, 2007) to identify environmental supports and established the use of the BEM to study environmental support in implementations of online course quality initiatives. Further, the Cause Analysis Worksheet (Chevalier, 2008) was utilized to operationalize the three categories of environmental supports as they relate to QM implementation. The categories of environmental support of the BEM were identified through document analysis and interviews with faculty and QMC at six colleges of varying sizes and length of membership in the Florida Quality Matters Consortium. Additionally, the study explored the perceptions of both faculty and QMC about how effectively their QM program supports adoption of QM criteria.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Effective strategies for supporting quality assurance practices that encourage the adoption of QM criteria into online courses at state colleges in Florida were identified in all three categories: information, resources, and incentives. Findings suggest colleges implementing their own programs should provide faculty time to implement QM standards in their online courses and assistance with design and development. To efficiently allocate resources that effect change, colleges that are developing quality assurance programs for online learning can focus on these effective systemic supports to bridge the gap from training to adoption. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of entrainment on performance quality and socialization of wind band instrumentalists in a trio setting.  Specifically, (1) what effect does movement have on performance quality? (2) What effect does movement have on interpersonal likability? and (3) What effect does movement have on interpersonal affiliation?
The phenomenon of entrainment has been under investigation by researchers for years but has lately grown in popularity over the past two decades. The concept of entrainment refers to the process of synchronization between two or more repetitive rhythmic onsets. Entrainment is observable between inanimate objects or human behaviors and includes either a symmetrical or asymmetrical relationship. In music when a performer synchronizes their performance to the speed of a metronome, it is considered asymmetrical entrainment as only one party can adjust to the other. A duet setting features symmetrical entrainment as both parties mutually adjust their performance to match or imitate each other. The synchronization between performers, and from performer to conductor are very common in a musical setting and are often intended to influence desirable performance outcomes. However, this entrainment has been found to influence humans in more areas than just musical performance.
Social behaviors have been identified to entrain between people over time, such as speech patterns and mannerisms. These behaviors are often nonconsciously imitated or mimicked between individuals and commonly lead to prosocial behaviors such as feelings of empathy, likability, and affiliation. In a musical setting, performers constantly mimic and imitate each other; not only through musical interpretations, but often through expressive movement. Through a wholistic point of view, it can be concluded that musicians in an ensemble setting achieve optimal performance through entrainment to the conductor’s instructions and the mutual negotiations with their performers. 
To investigate entrainment in an instrumental setting, participants (N = 30) were randomly assigned to trios and recorded a short etude. The control and entrainment group recorded the etude twice, where the control condition refrained from movement, but the entrainment group received a movement intervention prior to their second recording. While listening back to their performances, the participants answered questions regarding their likability and affiliation for their fellow performers. Free response opportunities allowed the performers to elaborate on the factors that contributed to their answers. The recordings were then distributed to expert adjudicators who graded the recordings for performance quality. 
Results indicated minimal growth in performance quality between recordings, but significant growth was found in likability and affiliation from both conditions. This finding highlighted the potential for positive social outcomes with and without the presence of movement. The incorporation of movement in this study was not found to have a significant influence on performance quality or interpersonal likability, but movement was found to have a significant influence on performer affiliation. As musicians must approach music performance from a collaborative perspective, the finding of movement’s significant influence on affiliation indicated that performers feel heightened levels of interpersonal association and connectedness when moving together during performance. The free response questions regarding the factors that influenced their responses commonly pointed to performance quality as contributing factor to their feelings of interpersonal likability and affiliation. 
Overall conclusions indicated that movement has a positive influence on likability and a significant influence on affiliation. While movement was not found to influence performance quality, the unintentional finding of this study indicated how important performance quality was to the participants when they considered the factors that contributed to socialization. It is hopeful that this study can spark additional entrainment research in the ensemble setting, in addition to fostering pedagogical techniques for increased incorporation of movement in contemporary music education. Further results and implications are discussed in the paper.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Key to the study of evolutionary biology is understanding the process through which new species form and are maintained. Reinforcement, the process through which prezygotic isolation between species is enhanced upon secondary contact due to low hybrid fitness, is considered by many to be the final stage in the speciation process. One common consequence of this process is a pattern of reproductive character displacement between two closely related species wherein the traits of individuals living in sympatry (co-occurring with other species) are more different than the traits of individuals from allopatric populations (not occurring with other species). Many examples of this pattern and process are documented in natural populations, but there is still a lot to learn about this process. The goal of my dissertation is to enhance our understanding of reinforcement, which is fundamental to the development and maintenance of new species. Anuran amphibians (frogs and toads) are an ideal system for studying this topic because male advertisement calls and female preferences for these calls are an important reproductive isolating mechanism that is easily measured. Additionally, male calls vary with temperature and female preferences also adjust to allow them to continue to recognize and locate males. However, it is unknown whether temperature during breeding affects the level of reproductive isolation between taxa, thereby contributing to completion of speciation, or conversely, the collapse of species boundaries. In my dissertation, I have integrated ecological, genomic, and behavioral data to investigate processes of speciation at multiple scales in North American chorus frogs (Pseudacris). 
At the broad scale, I used a large genomic dataset collected across the central United States to determine species boundaries and what factors attribute to maintenance of these boundaries. In this region, four putative species of chorus frogs (Pseudacris triseriata, P. feriarum, P. maculata, and P. fouquettei) have overlapping ranges, but the taxonomy of this group is complicated owing to similar morphologies and behaviors. I identified five lineages across this region following large geographic boundaries—such as rivers, elevation, and glacial boundaries—and found that each species pair diverges behaviorally, ecologically, or both. Additionally, I identified two hybrid zones between P. maculata and P. triseriata with evidence of behavioral divergence.
I then narrowed focus into on a single hybrid zone at two timepoints to determine how hybrid zones change over time and whether genetic clines match phenotypic clines in reproductive behaviors. For this chapter, I focused on a narrow region in the Southeastern United States where the upland chorus frog (P. feriarum) experiences costly hybridization with the southern chorus frog (P. nigrita), resulting in the reinforcement of male signals and female preferences in sympatry. I found that character displacement in male advertisement calls—such that P. feriarum produce faster calls in sympatry compared to allopatry—has become more pronounced where populations that formerly had an intermediate phenotype now display the allopatric phenotype. Additionally, the transition between the sympatric and allopatric phenotypes has shifted southward—farther into sympatry.
Finally, I focused solely on two populations of P. feriarum—allopatry and sympatry—to determine whether environmental temperature affects reproductive isolation. Males from the population that co-occurs with P. nigrita have more variation in how their calls vary with temperature. Additionally, despite the two species having more similar advertisement calls at cold temperatures compared to warm temperatures, females from the population that co-occurs with P. nigrita can still distinguish between the two species. However, they take twice as long to make a decision, which has important implications for the rate of hybridization as environmental conditions change. Together, these findings help us to understand what factors are important in processes of speciation and emphasize the importance of considering variable factors, such as environmental temperature.
In conclusion, my research provides valuable insights into processes of speciation at multiple scales in North American trilling chorus frogs (Pseudacris). I show that both ecological and behavioral divergence play a role in maintaining boundaries at the coarse scale. I then provide evidence for hybrid zone movement and steepening in a reinforcement contact zone between P. feriarum and P. nigrita. Finally, by investigating the role of temperature in reproductive behaviors, I show that sympatry in P. feriarum has increased plasticity of male advertisement call relative to allopatry and that temperature does not affect species discrimination for sympatric female P. feriarum, though it may affect hybridization rates due to differences in sound localization ability at warm versus cold temperatures. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study aims to understand the experiences of Black Chief Diversity Officers (CDOs) at Predominantly White Institutions (PWIs) during the anti-Critical Race Theory (CRT) movement. My research focuses on how CDOs experience racism at PWIs, how it influences CDOs’ implementation of organizational change, and how the anti-CRT movement affects CDOs' ability to perform in their role. In this research, I will employ a Critical Race Theory theoretical framework for the study that will guide my use of counterstory methods.  Using counterstory, I will conduct semi-structured individual interviews with ten CDOs at PWIs in states with anti-CRT laws. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Previous research has indicated that the experiences of Black CDOs at PWIs is an understudied topic. Findings from my pilot study suggest CDOs deal with White supremacy, tokenism, and feelings of having to work twice as hard as their fellow senior-level professionals to be seen as an effective leader by the greater campus community. Learning about how Black CDOs address racism and the anti-CRT movement represents a significant knowledge gap in the present literature regarding the daily experiences of Black CDOs. This study will be an important contribution to the existing literature to inform current and future CDOs and other higher education professionals about racism in higher education.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>ABSTRACT</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>NCAA Division I collegiate student-athletes in the US compete at the highest college level. These high-level academic and sport-related demands can create perfectionistic tendencies. Prior literature shows that perfectionistic concerns are positively related to athlete burnout while perfectionistic strivings are negatively related. For the prevention of athlete burnout, physical and psychological rest has been recommended. However, there is no previous study that explored the relationship between perfectionism and psychological rest. Therefore, the present study aims to contribute to the existing literature in two ways. First, the relationship between perfectionism and athlete burnout in D-I collegiate athletes was explored. Second, the relationship between perfectionism and psychological rest was explored in these athletes. A sample of 295 D-I, female, team sport athletes participated. Athletes completed online questionnaires comprised of the Competitive Orientations Scale (Sport MPS-2), The Athlete Burnout Questionnaire (ABQ), and the Wakeful Resting Experiences Questionnaire. Four subsamples were identified from the scores on these measures: a pure evaluative concerns perfectionism group (n = 11), a mixed perfectionism group (n = 28), a non-perfectionism group (n = 23), and a pure personal standards perfectionism group (n = 18). Hypothesis 1 stated that burnout scores would be highest in the pure evaluative concerns perfectionism (ECP) group, second highest in the mixed perfectionism group, third highest in the non-perfectionism group, and lowest in the pure personal standards perfectionism (PSP) group. Hypothesis 2 stated that psychological resting experience scores would be highest in the pure PSP group, second highest in the non-perfectionism group, third highest in the mixed perfectionism group, and lowest in the pure ECP group. Two separate One-Way ANOVA tests were performed to test the hypotheses. Hypotheses were partially supported. The results showed that athletes with pure ECP and mixed perfectionism had significantly higher levels of athlete burnout compared to athletes with non-perfectionism and pure PSP. Moreover, athletes with non-perfectionism reported significantly greater recent engagement in psychological resting experiences compared to athletes with mixed perfectionism. This study contributes to the literature by furthering the research on perfectionism and burnout and being a pioneer in research on the relationship between perfectionism and psychological rest.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Percussion is a music knowledge used extensively in clinical music therapy, with an average use frequency of 61% of all music therapy sessions and an average use duration of 43% of total session time (Evans, 2022).  Despite high reliance on it as a therapeutic tool, there are major deficits in the pedagogical approach to percussion training across the field of music therapy. Evans (2022) found that the majority of music therapy students received percussion training from non-music therapists (79%), and from non-percussionists (55%).  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this treatise is threefold: to serve as a pedagogical tool to teach the competent percussion skills to be an effective music therapist; to provide information on common diagnoses found within the most served music therapy populations and examine the literature on the use of percussion activities for specific therapeutic goals; and to provide transfer of information from research to specific percussion-based clinical applications in music therapy by client area. Such in-depth focus on percussion performance combined with evidence-based clinical applications for specific populations is designed to improve music therapy services received by clients.keywords: percussion, music therapy, clinical application, technique, population</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to understand the professional and personal experiences of female-identifying elementary music specialists within higher education. Specifically, this study sought to understand: (1) How do personal changes such as marriage and parenthood affect personal and professional lives, goals, and career trajectories for these elementary specialists? Six female-identifying academics were interviewed about their professional and personal lives, with particular emphasis on their experiences as women, their choice to have children, and the professional and personal relationships that compose the rich tapestries of the many responsibilities and roles that they must navigate. Five major themes emerged from the data: (1) finding a place of belonging within music education, (2) extrinsic and intrinsic support systems, (3) finding fulfillment in academic and personal life, (4) navigating multiple roles in higher education, and (5) compounding factors on professional and personal wellbeing. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>In response to the most recent adoption of both the Carl D. Perkins Act (Perkins) and the CAPE Act, Brevard Public Schools (BPS) was required to implement work-based learning in all secondary Career and Technology Education (CTE) programs to ensure they receive federal funding. This qualitative case study explored the experiences of eight BPS secondary CTE teachers regarding the process of finding internship placement for their students since the inception of the district’s work-based learning initiative for CTE programs since the inception of the program during the 2021-2022 school year as required by Perkins and Cape. Data was collected in two stages: first by conducting initial interviews with one to two teachers and second, by conducting two focus groups splitting all participants into two groups of four. Participants were BPS secondary CTE teachers whose students either participated in work-based learning programs or wanted to participate but were unfortunately unable to find internship placement during the 2021-2022 or 2022-2023 school year. Work-based learning internships were not new to all BPS secondary CTE programs.  Data showed that some programs had continuously offered internships options to students since 2014.  While this was the case for some, this was not the case for the majority of the participants involved in this study. Based upon the data collected, the overall understanding perceived from participants is that secondary CTE programs within BPS are not what they initially were intended to be.  The typical BPS secondary CTE student is using CTE classes to make themselves stand out to colleges instead of using them as a future career path enabling them to forgo a post-secondary education.  Students are using internships to show work experience to colleges, instead of using them as a career source upon graduating high school.  Understanding this evolution is integral to understanding the success of a work-based learning internship program.
This study highlights the importance of teacher buy in when it comes to implementing new programs.  The BPS secondary CTE programs with the highest amount of teacher buy in, tended to have a larger success rate with obtaining internship placement as those teachers had formed a working relationship with local businesses. Having a strong relationship with local business, ensured that when obstacles presented themselves while students were attempting to obtain internship placement, that the local businesses were willing to work with teacher to find a solution that would ensure internship placement for their students. 
Internships need to form a bridge between BPS secondary CTE students and their post-secondary academic goals.  To accomplish this, BPS needs to start a dialogue between BPS secondary CTE teachers, local businesses, and local post-secondary institutions to identify their needs and the needs of the students.  Starting this dialogue would also help with some of the frustrations over what participants viewed as a lack of support, clarity, consistency, and unnecessary work added to their already overfull plate. The addition of a Lead CTE Teacher position, would also alleviate some of the extra pressure participants felt when it came to meeting the needs of their students as interns.   
The valuable data that was collected from the participants, provided ample information used to outline recommendations for stakeholders that would allow the work-based learning internship program to continue to grow.  This study can also serve to inform others within the larger educational landscape as CAPE and Perkins are both national initiatives providing the largest amount of funding to CTE programs.

            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study is twofold. The first goal is to bring more awareness to the Cuban guitarist and professor Isaac Nicola and his legacy, particularly his work as a pedagogue. The second goal is to provide insight into different aspects of his method, such as its context, objectives, influences, repertoire, and technical and musical characteristics. This research presents an analysis of selected pieces from Nicola’s method, their technical challenges, and the Cuban musical elements present in the music. It also discusses specific features of classical guitar technique linked to the method and renowned Cuban performers. This treatise will be a valuable reference to those studying the Cuban school for guitar, its repertoire, and its influential figures.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Newark, New Jersey’s drinking water lead crisis is the latest in a series of lead crises in Black majority cities with harmful effects on public health. Understanding of these crises and their causes can benefit from contextualizing them in geographic theory on creative extraction. Theory enables us to highlight why water quality rules under the Safe Drinking Water Act contributed to the harm, and why government struggled to address the crisis. Interviews with community members, city officials, water professionals, and state and federal regulators show that members of the community took on roles typically occupied by regulators to demand a response. The study has implications for future community environmental justice struggles as well as drinking water regulations and allocation of federal resources. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation is composed of three essays on the topic of externalities in experimental commonpool resources and anti-commons environments. Due to weak property rights and weak formal
institutions, common pool resources can face externalities imposed by stakeholders’ over-usage of
nature or arise from disamenities imposed by a particular agent’s actions. These essays advance
the field of economics by exploring the behaviors and environmental factors that benefit or harm
shared resources and how both formal and informal institutions of property rights can prevent
externalities from arising.
In chapter 1, I develop a game theoretic model in which a resource pool has a common pool and
public good aspect in its usage, such as hunting (consumption) and wildlife conservation. I then
implement a laboratory experiment to evaluate how spillovers between the two related resource
accounts affect consumption and conservation behaviors. The Nash prediction suggests payoff
maximizing agents will increase spending on both consumption and conservation until both are
equivalent when resource spillovers are present. Results from laboratory experiments are consistent
with this hypothesis. As a policy intervention, I introduced and later revoked a common pool
licensing policy based on U.S. hunting and fishing licensing. Under the same theoretical framework,
removing a common pool licensing policy would increase welfare for all resource stakeholders.
Contrary to this, experimental evidence indicates no overall change in welfare. After removing the
restrictive licensing policy, the increase in the quantity of agents consuming from the commons is
offset by a per-subject reduction in the amount of common pool investment.
Chapter 2 explores two common pool environments, one in which the resource’s destructive
tipping point has a known distribution (risk) and one in which an objective probability cannot
be calculated (ambiguity). The relevant theory predicts that any increase in uncertainty, whether
that be from risk or ambiguity, will induce greater rates of resource consumption. Experimental
tests of heightened ambiguity are of interest, as we see resource consumption and deterioration
in the field be heavily influenced by ambiguous effects, such as climate change. Experiments in
this study examining threshold CPR games under risk replicate the same positive risk effects on
consumption found in the prior literature. Most importantly, I find new evidence in the lab that
supports the notion that increasing the degree of environmental ambiguity by introducing imprecise information further increases consumption in the commons when second-order stochastic dominance
of distributions is controlled for in the analysis.
The final chapter of this dissertation produces an experimental market for land with environmental
factors that mimic the segregation and gentrification of a neighborhood. Residential
segregation by categories, such as income and ethnicity, is prevalent in the United States. Concurrently,
experimental methods have been used in the literature on property to investigate questions
regarding land acquisition. This stream of literature is combined with a laboratory experiment
to investigate a neighborhood where a new “neighbor” purchases parcels with attendant negative
externalities for the initial residents. With a simple excess demand model as a guide, this chapter
aims to understand these negative externalities and the associated dynamics that lead to sorting
in the absence of exclusionary institutions. The results from laboratory testing suggest a failure
of the basic excess demand model to predict land acquisition. This failure results from significant
transaction costs between residents and an externality imposing ”neighbor.” In purchasing new
land units, initial residents frequently created informal institutions to impose bargaining costs on
the new ”neighbor.” When communication between landowners is removed, the neighbor still faces
information costs as take-it-or-leave-it offers are left as the only means of price searching.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>               Despite legislation being consistently passed to support post-secondary outcomes for students with disabilities, year after year since the completion of The National Longitudinal Transition Studies, national employment statistics continually demonstrate that implementation of intentions is wanting. A large percentage —50-60%— of adults with visual impairments (VI) remain under-or unemployed (Bell &amp; Silverman, 2018; McDonnall &amp; Sui, 2019; Yang &amp; Tan, 2022). A lack of meaningful employment creates barriers to self-sufficiency, which can reduce overall quality of life. In 1996, Hatlen conceptualized the expanded core curriculum (ECC), which is comprised of nine essential areas in which students with visual impairments may require direct instruction to grow into independent adults living an enviable life. One of the ECC areas is self-determination. Self-determination instruction can support and lead to positive post-secondary outcomes for students with disabilities. In 2007, the Council for Expectational Children (CEC) added the ECC as a competency area for all teachers of students with visual impairments (TVIs) to be trained and proficient in (Spungin et al., 2007). The only study examining TVIs’ understanding and instructional practices regarding self-determination was conducted by Agran, Hong, and Blankenship in 2007. To build on their findings, the primary objectives of this study were to explore whether the passage of time and expected changes in teacher preparation have influenced teachers’ understanding of self-determination and their instructional practices of self-determination.
	       The TVI survey study on self-determination by Agran and colleagues (2007) served as the foundation upon which the current study was built. Construction of the instrument used Wehmeyer and colleagues’ (2000) survey instrument and Agran et al.’s results. The survey covered the main topics of both previous surveys and expanded on them. Using content expert reviews, some questions were revised to suit current trends and needs. The survey was distributed and administered electronically in May 2022 and concluded in June 2022. 
	       The study sought to illuminate (1) the level of familiarity of TVIs with self-determination by measuring their level of understanding, exploring how they define self-determination, and examining the channels they learn about self-determination, (2) how much importance TVIs place on self-determination, and (3) how TVIs support its development in their students. The survey also collected some demographic data for the responding teachers and the students they serve to support well-developed answers to the research questions proposed.
Results demonstrated that a majority (79.44%) of TVIs hold a master’s degree and teach a heterogenous population across a variety of geographical and instructional settings. Most (69.72%) stated that they had heard of the importance of self-determination at the time of the survey. However, they were less likely (53.05%) to have been taught the specifics of self-determination instruction. It appears that, when warranted by age and/or need of their students, TVIs (35.56%) do provide some instruction related to self-determination skills. To obtain richer data than a multiple-choice question can provide, TVIs were asked to define self-determination. The definitions provided by these 360 practicing TVIs showed that most have at least some levels of the familiarity and understanding of this essential ECC area. However, most TVIs do not claim to be intentionally embedding instruction of the seven component skill areas that support students’ self-determination development that were identified by Wehmeyer in 1997.
                 The findings of this survey underscored that, despite TVIs holding advanced degrees and being familiar with self-determination, many are still developing their proficiency in teaching self-determination. Therefore, I propose that university teacher preparation programs analyze their course offerings to raise self-determination awareness among pre-service teachers. Additionally, TVIs (73.05%) indicated that they gather information and learn from attending conferences, webinars, or workshops. Hence, in order to encourage current TVIs’ to incorporate self-determination instruction in their practice, creation of appropriate and useful professional development opportunities would be valuable. Collaboration with organizational leaders in the field, such as those associated with CEC or the American Printing House for the Blind, could provide opportunities to bridge the relevant practitioner knowledge gaps identified in this study.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Modeling the cell membrane is important for understanding many biological processes. Important physical properties of the cell membrane include its ability to move small molecules into and out of the cell through the lipid bilayer and a variety of surface proteins (semipermeable, multicomponent membrane), and its ability to bind to proteins outside of the membrane (adhesive membrane). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Vesicles have been used as a proxy to study the dynamics of cell membranes in physical and computational experiments. A vesicle is an enclosed deformable membrane that is filled with and submerged in a viscous fluid. Vesicle models and experiments have demonstrated that membranes display rich dynamics when they are subjected to different types of physical processes. I use a two-dimensional vesicle to represent the lipid bilayer structure of cells, such as red blood cells. In this work, I will discuss the computational methods I use to model semipermeable and multicomponent vesicles. Given the variety of applications of microfluidic devices in cell biology, I study the effects of semipermeability and multicomponent membranes on vesicle dynamics under strongly confined small--scale flows. My work considers two formulations for the vesicle dynamics, each using a different time stepping method. I provide a collection of results, some that are published, and compare them to physical experiments when available. Future work is outlined, including simulations of semipermeable, multicomponent membranes and cellular adhesion molecules (CAMs).</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Is inclusion in the arts just a myth? Research has shown there are few peer reviewed journal articles and books published about inclusive programs in community art centers for adults with disabilities. This qualitative single case study critically reviewed the inclusive programs offered at a Midwestern community visual art center. During the literature review, this author discovered a Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts VSA report identifying specific priority areas to advance inclusion in the artsleading to this study’s research question: What does inclusive community arts education look like in practice for a selected arts center? This overarching concern was followed by several supporting questions; How can the arts promote inclusive learning opportunities? How does an informal creative arts center establish and promote inclusive programs for people with disabilities? How do members (instructors/facilitators) of a selected community arts education center perceive inclusive practices?The conceptual framework of this inquiry was constructed by researching the medical, social, and affirmative disability models associated with the foundations of disability studies. A resulting review of related literature focused on the historical background of the intersection of disability studies with art education, notable people in the field, and the potential power the arts have in building cultural bridges and a sense of belonging. This literature review revealed that most research addressing the intersection of art education with disability studies focuses on children from five through eighteen years old within K-12 educational settings. Therefore, additional exploration is needed to bridge the gap on research about adults with disabilities making art in inclusive community centers.
Research methods included interviewing, observing, and qualitative case study analysis. Additionally, the author enriched the data with thick and rich autoethnographic passages describing experiences with inclusion, inclusionism, disability, and identity from a parent’s, educator’s, and introspective viewpoint. After selecting Visionaries and Voices (V+V) in Cincinnati as the case study site, the researcher spent 12 days making field observations in the fall and winter of 2021-2022. During that time, the researcher conducted nine semi-structured in-person interviews exploring the staff’s opinions about inclusion and programming, plus revealing new emergent topics. The research findings took an emic approach that involves telling the story from participants’ perspectives, in addition to the researcher’s own insider’s view as a mother and experienced art educator devoted to disability studies. Quality and rigor were built into this research through triangulation, member checking, and other methods increasing the trustworthiness, credibility, and dependability of the study.
The findings and analysis of this case study revealed V+V is a warm, family like atmosphere with friendships based on mutual respect. Analysis revealed commonalities in staff member’s perceptions toward inclusion. V+V has two well-established and successful inclusionary programs. Established in 2009, Double Vision is a collaborative art making program which culminates in an annual live auction fundraiser. The Teaching Artist Program provides a unique comprehensive instructional and leadership curriculum that supports artists with disabilities in public speaking and teaching art in the community. Staff members expressed the need for the improvement of physical accessibility in the V+V environment and updating the van currently used to transport the artists. Like most 501(c)(3) nonprofit art organizations, funding is an issue for V+V. This art studio receives limited funding, primarily from SSDI and Medicare. V+V is modeled after Creative Growth, a progressive art studio created by F. Ludins-Katz and E. Katz. Today, V+V appears to be a leader in the progressive art studio movement. They collaborate with other progressive studios and galleries worldwide, participate in symposiums, and have emerged as a valuable resource for those interested in starting a like-minded art studio space.
There are four recommendations based on the findings of this study.
(a) Inclusive art programs should use the Universal Design for Learning table as a guide to routinely assess accessibility, program effectiveness, and artists’ comfort levels. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>(b) The findings of this study suggest the need for additional staff positions, either paid or volunteer, full or part-time, updated training and clarification of work duties. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>(c) Inclusive art programs should offer art career instruction and guidance to their participating artists.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>(d) Inclusive art programs should offer workshops on inclusivity and collaborative artmaking methods to the surrounding community. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This research inquiry concluded that art not disability is the foundation for studios for people with disabilities. There are too few inclusive community art centers in the United States. It is possible that inclusive community art education programs could serve as a natural pathway to foster society’s viewpoint of people with disabilities as successful contributing members of society. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This thesis traces transnational performances of race, ethnicity, nationality, political belonging, and sexuality—as well as issues of labor and fetishization invoked by some of these identities—as a way to think about satiating or satisfying certain desires of belonging. Through a robust investigation of the affective in-between, this thesis theorizes how intersectional minoritarian identities might be performed successfully in order to thrive in a nation-state dominated by majoritarian identities. Using Anne Anlin Cheng’s theorization of racialized grief as a starting point, Chapter One addresses the position of the Asian immigrant in the United States, socioeconomically and culturally on their own as well as politically in relation to the white American and the Black American. Chapter Two tracks the transnational and non-linear scopes of learning to perform queerness, brownness, and political belonging, emphasizing the conflicting, perpetuating, and renewing components that comprise performances of identities, and prompting a theorization of the affective in-between as “nowhere nation.” According to this theory, intersectional and transnational identities might coexist together against the societal default, but the performance of one identity must necessarily fail in order for the performance of another identity to succeed. Chapter Three focuses on the performative potential of affect, leading to the theorization of another affective in-between, “saudesh,” which encompasses the complexities of embodying an event as intergenerational and transnational affect. Chapter Four provides a series of examples detailing how the minoritarian migrant works and fails to gain equitable access to the capitalist Western institution, thus addressing the complication of labor in understanding the in-between. Desire remains the driving force at every step of the investigation.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Writing a string quartet has always been on my compositional bucket list. While the first multi-movement composition I ever wrote was a string quartet in the freshman year of my undergraduate degree, I thought it would be fitting to write another one as the final piece of my master’s degree. My first string quartet adhered strictly to traditional forms, utilized harmony and counterpoint consistent with what I had begun to learn in theory, and was heavily influenced by some of my favorite romantic-era composers. My second string quartet uses similar compositional techniques to my first, but updates them with everything I have learned from my classes and lessons at both schools and all of the new music I have become more exposed to. This piece uses traditional forms, but I take much more liberty with how I treat the themes and recurring sections, rather than the strict framework I used before. My harmonic language has drastically changed since then as well; although I consider my music to be more on the tonal side of the spectrum, I use unconventional ways to achieve that tonality through modal and synthetic scales, as well as inverting and transposing atonal sets in ways similar to dominant-tonic motion. My inspiration is no longer romantic-era composers, but for this piece, I listened to a lot of Bartok’s string quartets, which especially influenced the first movement, Ligeti’s piano etudes, and even some progressive rock, which influenced the final movement.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The first movement begins with a short, somber melody played by the viola that will serve as the connecting motif between each movement. From this melody, centered around G, I construct a large canon which ultimately forms a substantial introduction before the first movement truly begins. The intro theme, as well as the fiery allegro and sultry secondary theme, are used in traditional sonata form for the entirety of the movement. The second movement is a scherzo and trio featuring varying ostinatos in different time signatures before a warm cello melody is introduced. First, the second violin begins in what feels like 2/4, before the first violin enters in 6/8. The viola then enters in 3/4 before the cello melody enters in 3/4 as well, finally solidifying the time signature. The rest of the movement plays with these different beat emphases, mixing and matching them so they don’t quite line up all the time.	The third movement is a short, heartfelt love letter to my instrument, the viola. Beginning with chords that somewhat resemble a progression that perhaps Vaughan Williams would write, they are blurred by clusters, and later, techniques such as sul ponticello. It is not until the very end of the movement after the folk-sounding melody, where we hear the chord progression finally unveiled in the lower strings. The final movement is meant to be fast, groovy, and fun for the performers. It is in a sort-of sonata rondo form featuring two highly contrasting themes, with a development section that fragments themes from previous movements, rather than material from this one. It ends triumphantly on a G major chord which completes our harmonic journey from the con dolore theme in the first movement.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Human activity recognition is a technology field that automatically detects a person's movements and actions. The primary objective is identifying an individual's activities through various means such as cameras, motion sensors, and time analysis. Automated recognition of human behavior is crucial in numerous ambient intelligence applications, including health monitoring applications, smart homes, and emergency services; this is because human activity contains important contextual information that can help systems achieve contextual awareness. For example, identifying human activity can assist with functional diagnosis and assessing health outcomes. Not to mention, it is a crucial indicator of participation, quality of life, and lifestyle.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This thesis aims to enhance the existing system, MultiSense, which is a wearable-free fall detection system designed for indoor settings and individual usage. It employs multiple sensors to gather and process sensory information to detect human activities straightforwardly and reliably. The MultiSense system has undergone three improvements in this research to enhance its overall efficiency and extend its capabilities in detecting various human activities.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The first enhancement involves substituting the RF-based motion sensor with a more user-friendly and efficient sensor, as RF-based sensors are complicated to install and require specialized knowledge. The second improvement comprises designing a model that enables the system to distinguish between sounds originating from a person and those from a person's recording, ensuring the reliability of audio-based applications. The last enhancement introduces a seismic sensor-based footstep detection system, which provides valuable insights into human behavior and enhances various systems and applications.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Protecting individuals' private information while still allowing modelers to draw inferences from confidential data sets is a concern of many data producers. Differential privacy is a framework that enables statistical analyses while controlling the potential leakage of private information. Prior work has focused on proposing differentially private statistical methods for various types of confidential data. However, almost no existing work has focused on the analysis of compositional data. We investigate differentially private approaches for analyzing compositional data using parametric models and non-parametric models. For parametric analysis, we use the Dirichlet distribution as the statistical model. We consider several methods, including frequentist and Bayesian procedures, along with computational strategies. For non-parametric inference, we use a mixture of Dirichlet distributions and approaches derived from Multivariate Bernstein Polynomials as statistical models. We consider several Bayesian methods along with computational strategies. We assess the approaches' performance using simulated data and illustrate their usefulness by applying them to data from the 2019 American Time Use Survey. Finally, we discuss avenues for future work.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Trailer Treasure is a collection of original short stories and flash fiction pieces centered around the perspectives of working-class women and girls. My unifying approach to craft which I utilize throughout the collection is T.S. Eliot’s theory of objective correlative. In his craft theory book The Sacred Wood, Eliot defines objective correlative as “a set of objects, a situation, a chain of events which shall be the formula of that particular emotion; such that when the external facts… are given, the emotion is immediately evoked” (100).  Therefore, a character’s interactions with objects in the story reveal the character’s emotional state of being and emotional development throughout the course of the story. This indirect representation of emotion through concrete objects is more emotionally affective for readers than stating a character’s emotions outright in abstract language. Although Eliot’s theory is originally intended for application to poetry, I argue that objective correlative is as useful a craft approach when writing fiction. Character is revealed and developed through characters’ interactions with objects, and an object can stand in for an emotion as effectively in fiction as it can in poetry. Furthermore, the use of objects in fiction can serve as a satisfying conceit around which to structure a story, and an object that is introduced early on in a story can be recalled toward the story’s end to create a satisfying sense of “rhyming action,” a term coined by the writer Charles Baxter in his craft book Burning Down the House: Essays on Fiction, which refers to a return to an earlier dramatic image toward a story’s denouement in order to provide a sense of recognition and narrative closure for the reader.
In the crafting of flash fiction, especially, the theoretical approach of objective correlative is useful. A flash piece does not span as much time as a full-length story, and when writing flash, the author is challenged with restraints to both story time and discourse time. To quickly define and distinguish, “Story [time] refers to the actual chronology of events in a narrative; discourse [time] refers to the manipulation of that story [time] in the presentation of the narrative” (Felluga). Works of flash fiction require both more exclusive selection of chronological events and scenes to include in the story, and less space on the page/a lesser word count within which to convey those events. To overcome these restraints on time, a flash piece can be structured around an objective correlative. This technique is usefully borrowed from poetry, as the form of flash fiction is close to poetry.

            <DISS_para>With the introduction of various forms of multimedia on concert stages, it is prudent for music conductors to develop a framework of procedures, techniques, and philosophies when incorporating outside audio-visual components into their programs. The purpose of this dissertation is to provide a guide for music ensemble directors on conducting with multimedia in live performances. Firstly, by presenting the historical context, educational benefits, and aesthetic considerations of music performances involving multimedia. Secondly, by defining the procedures, techniques, and technologies that conductors can utilize to achieve artistic success when working with multimedia elements. In preparation for this dissertation, the author presented a lecture recital as a case study on three categories of multimedia that conductors may encounter in live performances: independent, synchronous, and interactive. An analysis of each category is discussed, including relevant musical examples from the recital and summaries with applications for music directors to consider. This document is designed to serve as a practical and artistic resource for conductors who wish to incorporate multimedia elements into their musical performances.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This research study examined the experiences of Black and Latino/a pre-service teachers who are enrolled in a Bachelors/Masters Teacher Preparation Program at a Southeastern University. Students within this study described their experiences in courses, how they navigated their clinical field experiences, and how their CTs utilized culturally responsive mentoring practices. The findings of this study suggest that students felt othered by peers and CTs, and they have a shallow understanding of culturally responsive teaching due to the inadequate information they received in their courses and in their clinical field experiences on this topic.  Moreover, findings about their clinical field experiences highlight the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic, their appreciation for the hands-on experience they received, connections made with students and staff who share similar ethnic identities, and positive relationships with their CT.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Written as the culmination of my studies at Florida State University, my first chamber symphony is an account of personal journey of learning to live out of love rather than fear. Written as a sequel of sorts to my saxophone octet dealing with the wake of my father’s suicide, my chamber symphony takes the previous focus of simply processing grief and transforms it from a story of survival to one of actualization and recovery. The twenty-four-minute work serves not only as the pinnacle of my compositional output thus far, but as a deeply reflective and meditative study into my mental health over the last two years.The musical material of the piece is a deep study into polytonality – to be specific, just how different varying concepts of polytonality can be. These explorations are presented in a spectrum across the four movements, starting with a tense, atonal polychord approach before arriving at lush, jazz-influenced slash chords to end the work. The crux of the work is the metaphorical analog between healing from grief and the transformation of representative musical materials. These two interwoven concepts are crucial to the theoretical and programmatic structure of the entire work.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this quantitative study was to examine the relationships among personal characteristics (i.e., age, race, marital status, education level, and years of teaching experience), work environment characteristics (i.e., pay, benefits, type of program, age group of children, and class size), job satisfaction, and turnover intention of preschool teachers work in licensed child care centers in Florida. This study also examined the extent to which job satisfaction had a mediating effect on the relationship between personal characteristics, work environment characteristics, and turnover intention. A cross-sectional web survey was developed and administered to a proportionate stratified random sample of 275 preschool teachers in Florida. The data collected included teachers’ demographic and work environment information, Job Satisfaction Survey (JSS; Spector, 1994), and the Turnover Intention Scale (TIS-6; Roodt, 2004). The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc comparison tests, independent samples t-test, chi-square test of independence, hierarchical multiple regression, and mediation analysis using Baron and Kenny (1986) approach. The results of this study found that more than one-fourth of preschool teachers (27.6%) were considering leaving their job. Chi-square test indicated that for teachers in the age group of 25 – 34 and 35 – 44 years old, being single, and dissatisfied with their job were associated with turnover intention. The results of hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that job satisfaction was the most significant predictor of turnover intention when controlling for personal and work environment characteristics (adjusted R2 = .48, F = 168.33, p &lt; .05). While the variance accounting for turnover intention was small, work environment characteristics significantly predicted turnover intention when controlling for personal characteristics (adjusted R2 = .10, F = 1.96, p &lt; .05). However, personal characteristics showed no predictive power for turnover intention. In addition, mediation effects of job satisfaction were only found in the relationship between type of program and turnover intention, and class size and turnover intention. 
The findings of this study contribute to the literature by providing empirical evidence concerning the relationships among personal characteristics, work environment characteristics, job satisfaction, and turnover intention that have been underexamined in the field of early childhood education. It is important to understand how these factors are related to each other in order to retain preschool teachers in the field, which in turn can contribute to maintaining and improving the quality of early childhood education. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to explore student veterans’ educational paths that guided them to maximize their military education assistance by saving their GI Bill for graduate education. The research questions for this study were: 1) How do student veterans’ motivation to join the military guide their educational paths from high school through a graduate degree? 2) How do student veterans learn about and use military education assistance to move them towards their goals to obtain advanced degrees? 3) How do student veterans use resources to make decisions towards their goals to obtain advanced degrees? Schlossberg’s Transition Theory provided the theoretical background and a starting point for this grounded theory study. It aided in explaining environmental and social aspects of student veterans’ transition in higher education and in conceptualizing the motivations and experiences of service members that lead them to learn about, and strategize, how to use military education assistance for their higher education goals. Results of this study provided insights for the development of future resources and programs as well as to the individuals creating and providing top quality support services, particularly in-service, to this student population. By learning more about the experiences that led student veterans to graduate education post military, and the resources along their educational path, both the military and higher education institutions can provide timely support to prepare student veterans for maximizing their educational opportunities before, during, and after military service. This research also filled gaps in information available and the messages being communicated to student veterans during critical points within the military and higher education.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this thesis, I explore the systemic nature of content circulation and community interaction on TikTok as it relates to the Black church. TikTok is a social media app that allows users to create short-form videos and attach pre-recorded sounds to them. The thesis focuses on the role of TikTok sounds in content circulation amongst Black American users, specifically the function of trends on the app and the memeification of specific sound bites. I argue that the circulation of cultural information within an online system via memeification is evocative of how members of the Black church perceive their spiritual engagement as embedded in Black Americans’ cultural lexicon and memory. The thesis also discusses how TikTok is a medium for Black Americans to evoke memory to further conceptualize the Black church in the 21st century and how gospel music becomes an agent of this evocation. The discussion of the cultural and spiritual practices of Black Americans is further enriched by comparing this phenomenon to how Black gospel music has functioned in the physical Black church. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Failure to complete is an unfortunately common occurrence in the nation’s community colleges, and research demonstrates that not completing a credential is associated with negative student outcomes. In response to these issues, the Guided Pathways institutional redesign reform movement has spread rapidly across the United States over the past several years. To support state systems and leaders in catalyzing this impactful, yet challenging, institutional reform work, this study explores the statewide context in which colleges are engaging in Guided Pathways reform. By examining the relationship between state-level policy levers and postsecondary governance structures and college adoption of Guided Pathways reform, this study will provide valuable information to state systems looking to serve as trailblazers in Guided Pathways implementation, particularly in terms of policy advocacy and the potential impact of their higher education governance structure on student success reforms. Findings indicate that states with performance-based funding policies are more likely to house colleges implementing Guided Pathways. Similarly, a state having a more decentralized, system-based higher education governance structure is a positive predictor for institutional Guided Pathways adoption. State attainment goal policies were not found to be significantly related to Guided Pathways adoption. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Deep learning models have shown remarkable performance across various applications. However, their resilience to hardware faults, particularly the loss of neurons, is a critical aspect that needs to be addressed. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for improving the resilience of deep learning models. Through a carefully designed experiment, we evaluate the impact of neuron loss on these models in order to cultivate a deeper understanding of deep learning models' resilience and to identify methods for enhancing their reliability in the face of neuronal loss. This is done by investigating a new technique that focuses on pruning the most important neurons and then retraining the model to distribute the work among all the neurons. This technique along with dropout demonstrates great results that significantly enhanced resilience after neuron loss. This research bears significant importance, as deep learning models are increasingly applied across a wide range of domains, including computer vision, self-driving cars, and robotics. To ensure the dependability and stability of these systems, it is crucial to acknowledge their limitations and potential vulnerabilities, and to devise ways to strengthen their resilience. By examining the resilience of deep learning models concerning neuronal loss, we can gain valuable insights that will inform the design of more reliable artificial neural networks for real-world applications.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study sought to identify the characteristics associated with high performance among people who serve as volunteer board members for nonprofit organizations. The aim is that these characteristics could then be available for potential inclusion in an instrument that can assist in identifying and recruiting high-performing board members.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Among volunteers, those who serve as members of nonprofit boards hold a unique place. Although their role is like other volunteer positions in that it is uncompensated, their responsibilities – which frequently include hiring and firing the chief executive – effectively put them at the pinnacle of organization’s leadership structure. And yet, as is often the case with volunteer roles, the quality of nonprofit board members’ performance is highly variable. This puts nonprofit organizations at risk, as the performance of the organization as a whole is dependent in large part upon the performance of the governing body.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	This study engaged 29 current volunteer board members from six Florida nonprofits and used a repertory grid technique to elicit the set of characteristics that they associate with high, average, and low performance. Those characteristics were then classified and analyzed to determine which were most strongly associated with high performance.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	This research identified three characteristics that hold promise to help those responsible for recruiting volunteer nonprofit board members. These included 1) Commitment/ Dedication/ Energy/ Engagement/ Enthusiasm/ Passion to or for the Board/ Organization/ Mission/ Cause, 2) Active Attendance, Engagement, and Participation at Board and Committee Meetings, and 3) Fundraising (giving and getting) / Willing &amp; Able to Make Personal Donations / Selfless / Contribute.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Almost from its inception, music has accompanied film. Initially, music helped move the storyline forward since films were originally silent. However, even with the advent of “talkies,” or films recorded with actors’ voices, music played an important role in the success of motion pictures by providing an essential backdrop to the action. Interestingly, the use of film to accompany classical music performances has not been ubiquitous. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Classical music performance has evolved throughout history to combine music with other art forms such as dance, lighting, narration, and film; however, most classical performance remains the same–a purely aural tradition. Many professional musicians believe that adding other art forms to music can elevate performances and make them more relatable to audiences. However, they are unsure how to pair music and multimedia. This treatise presents the relevance and application of multimedia, specifically video, in classical music performances.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A questionnaire was conducted for musicians with varying levels of education and different principal instruments to determine how musicians currently perform with video. The questionnaire indicated that out of the fifty-nine participants, 66.10 percent had performed with video. Furthermore, out of the twenty participants who claimed they had not performed with video, 80 percent expressed interest in performing with video if given a chance. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Because very few pre-existing films pair neatly with any given piece of music, performers need to be able to create their films to match the music they are performing. After brief explanations of ways one can derive meaning from music and the various types of films, this treatise provides a method for determining video content for any given piece of music. Afterward, the Method is applied to three works for flute and electronics: 50 Fish: for flute and electronic soundscape (2020) by Egbert Jan Louwerse (b. 1975), Lipstick: for amplified flute/alto flute and soundtrack (1998) by Jacob Ter Veldhuis (b. 1951) and Rekindle: for flute and soundtrack (2009) by Michel Van der Aa (b. 1970). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The future implications of this research include applying the method to create films for more classical compositions, shifting the focus from primarily contemporary music to all genres and styles of music, and future collaborations with composers to create multimedia performances starting from the inception of composition. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Epistemic beliefs, epistemic cognitions, and self-regulation processes have a significant role in students’ learning. Through this study, I investigated the role of mechanical engineering students’ epistemic beliefs and epistemic cognitions involved in self-regulation processes while working on tasks with different difficulty levels. In this study, I used a qualitative instrumental-case research method. I used interviews and think-aloud to answer the research questions.The study was conducted in the Spring of 2022. Purposeful sampling was used to recruit fifteen undergraduate mechanical engineering students enrolled in the senior design class at the joint Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University (FAMU) and Florida State University (FSU) College of Engineering. The interviews explored engineering students’ epistemic beliefs before starting to work on the tasks. On the other hand, think-aloud captured their epistemic cognitions and self-regulation processes while working on tasks of different levels of difficulty (i.e., simple and complicated).
The data analysis revealed that mechanical engineering students have an absolutist epistemic belief system that values certainty and objectivity in knowledge. The study indicates that these beliefs do not hinder students’ productivity or effectiveness. Instead, they allow students to focus on solving problems and achieving their goals with less work and time. Also, the study found that epistemic cognitions influenced how students approached tasks and the goals they set for themselves during the task definition and planning phases. Furthermore, epistemic cognitions influenced how students judged the quality of their work during the evaluation phase. The impact of epistemic cognitions were less influential during the strategy use phase. The results suggest that participants’ epistemic beliefs and cognitions may be impacted by how they learned and studied in the past. Findings particularly suggest that participants were rewarded for solving problems quickly and efficiently.
 Identifying these constructs in the context of engineering helped show how engineering students approached engineering tasks and provided important implications for facilitating students’ learning and engagement in engineering education. If we want students to think more creatively, we need to reward and teach them in different ways than what is traditionally used. We need to reward students for how they solve problems, not just for obtaining correct solutions quickly. This means recognizing creative thinking and problem-solving and rewarding these skills. It also means teaching students in ways that value mistakes and to see mistakes as learning opportunities.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Students come to college with expectations that their experiences will help them secure a career after graduation (Eagan et al., 2016; Stolzenberg et al., 2020). Institutions offer work-integrated learning (WIL) experiences, which directly connect students’ coursework to future careers (Cooper et al., 2010). Extant literature provides an abundance of evidence supporting a positive relationship between WIL and student success, including employment outcomes (i.e., Bist et al., 2020; Coker et al., 2017; Huber, 2010; Jackson &amp; Bridgstock, 2021; Pascarella &amp; Terenzini, 2005; Wyonch, 2020). While the overarching literature supports the relationship between WIL and employment outcomes, some studies have emphasized the possible equity effects WIL activities can provide to traditionally underserved populations such as first-generation students and those who identify as underrepresented racial minorities (URM) (Finley &amp; McNair, 2013; Wyonch, 2020). Using the quasi-experimental approach of inverse probability weighted regression adjustment (IPWRA) in the current study, I examined the presence of a relationship between WIL and employment outcomes at a large public research institution in the southeastern United States (n = 5,417). In addition to an overall relationship, I examine possible moderating effects of first-generation or URM status on the relationship between WIL and employment outcomes. The findings of this study show a significant negative relationship between participating in WIL and securing a job offer as well as a significant interaction between WIL and URM status. As WIL activities are widely offered at postsecondary institutions across the United States, the results of this study hold both practical and policy implications for students, faculty and staff, institutions, and funding agencies.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The theme of abuse, often sexual abuse, of imprisoned women in Russian literature can be observed throughout literary history, yet is rarely the focus of the work in question.  When comparing literary depictions of the imprisonment of female characters, and nonfictional accounts of Russian women, the scope and frequency of the abuse of prosecuted women becomes clear.  Narratives of imprisoned women from Leo Tolstoy’s novel Resurrection (1899) to Guzel Yakhina’s novel Zuleikha Opens Her Eyes (2015) contain similar themes.  Younger generations of Russian authors are still commenting on the same suffering of female prisoners raised over 100 years ago.  My thesis will explore the depiction of imprisoned women in fictional as well as nonfictional works as it has evolved through Russian literary history.  I will analyze Leo Tolstoy’s Resurrection (1899), Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn’s The Gulag Archipelago (1973), Varlam Shalamov’s Kolyma Stories (1970-76), Evgenia Ginzburg’s memoirs Journey into the Whirlwind (1967) and Within the Whirlwind (1979), and Guzel Yakhina’s Zuleikha Opens Her Eyes (2015).  A significant portion of my analysis will focus on the abuse, often sexual, of women imprisoned in the Soviet Gulag under Stalin.  The issue of psychological trauma of imprisoned women under the Stalinist regime needs further investigation.  To stop the violence in modern Russian and Western societies we have to be aware of the atrocities  and crimes against women in the last century. I investigate the overlooked accounts of women incarcerated under Stalin, and analyze the sexual abuses specifically inflicted upon female prisoners that were prevalent in camp life.  I will examine how Soviet women, proclaimed by the Communist ideology equal to men and protected by the Soviet society, were treated and sexually abused within the Soviet prison system.  Furthermore, analysis of pre-Soviet imprisoned women and continuation of the theme by contemporary Russian authors outlines the history of suffering and abuse still being talked about today.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to descriptively analyze the salaries of music therapists from 2012-2021, and compare salaries of related helping professions in the year 2021.  Research questions included 1) How do music therapists’ salaries compare to other related helping professions by state in the year 2021? and 2) How have music therapists’ salaries changed between 2012 and 2021? Data were collected using the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics’ online database and yearly Workforce Analyses published from the American Music Therapy Association (AMTA). Results indicated that music therapists’ salaries have increased in the past nine years, with a difference of $9,577 from 2012 to 2021, however, the increase has not been consistent from year-to-year. The reported overall average of music therapists’ salaries in the year 2021 (M = $58,973) was higher than that of recreational therapists (M = $53,900), but lower than the other related professions: occupational therapists (M = $89,470), middle school special educators (M = $68,860), healthcare social workers (M = $62,310), and registered nurses (M = $82,750). According to data from 2012-2021, annual wages show the most variance when compared by years served or degree earned. Data indicated that music therapists tend to see an increase in salary based on years in the profession and by level of degree earned. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>When the two sexes maximize their fitness in different ways, a sexual conflict emerges, in which traits favored in one sex are not favored in the other (Parker 1979, Arnqvist and Rowe 2005). Under interlocus sexual conflict, a type of sexual conflict involving alleles at separate loci (Rowe et al. 2018), one sex evolves traits that improve its reproductive success at the expense of the other. In turn, this generates selection on the other sex to resist the effects of these traits. The outcome is thought to be an evolutionary arms race between the two sexes known as sexually antagonistic coevolution (SAC) (Parker 1979). Most studies on SAC rely on phenotypic data alone, thus compelling genomic evidence for how SAC evolves is lacking (Rowe et al. 2018). Moreover, there is a historical disparity in research focus: much more attention has been paid to the genetic mechanisms underlying male trait evolution than female trait evolution (Ah-King et al. 2014; Orr et al. 2020). To establish the importance of female evolution for driving SAC, we implemented a combination of phenotypic and genetic approaches to address the gaps in our knowledge of female evolution within SAC using a model organism that exhibits extensive sexual conflict, Drosophila melanogaster. Male D. melanogaster have evolved proteins in the seminal fluid (SFPs) that increase their own fitness (Ravi Ram and Wolfner 2007b; Hollis et al. 2016) but decrease the lifespan (Chapman et al. 1995) and fecundity (Wigby and Chapman 2005) of their female partners. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We first measured the variation in male harm through both lifespan and fecundity among 61 different inbred lines from the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP). This allowed us to identify low- and high-harm lines for later assays of female resistance. We found that males from the different inbred lines did, in fact, vary in their degree of harm to their female partners through both lifespan and fecundity, supporting the results of prior studies (Friberg 2005; Lew and Rice 2005; Filice and Long 2016). Hereafter, we focused on harm through fecundity, as fitness is ultimately determined by reproductive success. We then quantified the variation in female resistance to fecundity-based harm among 139 different inbred lines from the DGRP by mating females from each line to high-harm and low-harm males identified in the male-harm assays. By comparing the fecundity values of females of a given line who were mated to high-harm males to females of the same line who were mated to low-harm males, we obtained a measure of resistance with the expectation that more resistant lines would show little difference in fecundity between the two treatments (Lew et al. 2006). We found the lines did vary in their degree of female resistance, supporting the few prior studies on this topic (Linder and Rice 2005; Lew et al. 2006). The results also supported the validity of the male harm assays, as most lines assessed for female resistance showed higher fecundity values when mated to the low-harm males than when mated to the high-harm males.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Using the lifespan and fecundity data from the male harm assays and the fecundity data from the female resistance assays, we performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for the three variables using the DGRP’s GWAS pipeline. We were not able to identify variants associated with any of the three variables after correcting for multiple comparisons but were able to for all three under less strict significance thresholds (α = 1 x 10-5). There were 12, 6, and 17 annotated variants associated with lifespan-based male harm, fecundity-based male harm, and female resistance, respectively, that had a p-value less than 1 x 10-5. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Finally, we used the GAL4/UAS system and RNA interference to knockdown the expression and assess the effects of two of the top variants associated with fecundity-based male harm and the 11 top variants associated with female resistance. We found that knocking down ed reduced male harm. Of the female resistance genes we examined, the knockdowns of Pif1B and CG15373 positively affected female resistance, implying they normally reduce female resistance when expressed. Furthermore, the knockdowns of bun, Sh, and CngA decreased female resistance, indicating they normally function to increase female resistance when expressed. These results support some of our findings from our GWAS and provide candidates for further research.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In conclusion, this work provides evidence of sexually antagonistic genetic variation in both male-induced harm and female resistance to male harm, supporting the idea of sexually antagonistic coevolution, and provides insight into the underlying genetic architecture and molecular functions involved in fecundity-based harm and female resistance in our study system. It also addresses a long-standing gap in our knowledge of the female side of sexual conflict and reproductive biology (Orr and Hayssen 2020; Orr et al. 2020; Wigby et al. 2020). </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Bryan Site (8LE6256) is believed to be the location of a 17th-century Spanish Mission site located in Leon County, Florida. The site was discovered by landowner Dana Bryan and archaeologists from the State of Florida and Florida State University. Bryan's personal collection of artifacts and notes from the site form the basis of the research being conducted by Dr. Tanya Peres of Florida State University, as well as for my thesis. The thesis aims to investigate the relationship between archaeologists and private collectors/landowners and the benefits and consequences of their collaboration. This project will also provide insight into the behavior and mindset of landowners through the perspective of Dana Bryan and promote the conservation of the archaeological record by examining the interactions and exchanges of ideas between professional archaeologists and collectors. Legal and ethical considerations are involved in this research as it interacts with a private landowner.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study examines the visual design processes and strategies used by graphic design experts and non-design college students when applying visual design principles to compose an infographic. The focus is on the visual design stage, often reported as challenging for adult and young students (e.g., Fragou &amp; Papadopoulou, 2020; O'Mahony et al., 2019). The goal is to identify differences in the strategies utilized to produce higher and lower-quality infographics scored across 17 design criteria.This study employs a collective case study design, in which participants were asked to create an appealing and readable infographic and think aloud as they performed the task. Each participant was presented with identical ready-to-use text, icons, and shapes on a given topic and used the design tool to complete the task. The participants consisted of 5 graphic design experts recruited through snowball sampling and 5 non-design college students recruited through typical sampling. All sessions were recorded and transcribed for data analysis.
Results revealed six visual design processes: (1) create structure and grid, (2) establish visual hierarchy, (3) define visual rules, (4) replicate visual rules, (5) test and adjust, and (6) validate and revise. Also, high-rated infographics were produced using a more systematic design process, starting with working on the structure and grid and establishing a visual hierarchy, and moving on to define and replicate visual rules, followed by testing and adjustments, and validation. Moreover, the study identified many design strategies from the comparative analysis between high and low-performers, such as: (1) using a breadth-first approach by laying out the elements over a grid and working on visual hierarchy before working on details, (2) placing related content near each other and less related content spaced apart to spatially organize and structure the content, (3) using up to two font styles and opting for legible fonts over decorative fonts, (4) testing various colors, fonts, and graphics while preserving the overall structure and hierarchy, and (5) stepping back to validate the overall design and making final adjustments based on the optical weight. These target processes and strategies were encapsulated into a five-stage Infographic Visual Design Model.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Overview and Problem of Practice	The evaluation of student learning in higher education is of interest to many stakeholders including students, faculty, higher education administrators, employers, governmental entities, and accreditors.  Despite this interest, many institutions struggle to successfully facilitate the process of evaluating student learning. The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) is one of seven regional accreditors in the U.S. whose member institutions are required to demonstrate their compliance with the standards of SACSCOC at regular intervals. One of these standards relates to the evaluation of student learning and reads, “The institution identifies expected outcomes, assesses the extent to which it achieves these outcomes, and provides evidence of seeking improvement based on analysis of the results in student learning outcomes for each of its educational programs.”  The problem of practice (PoP) central to this dissertation in practice (DiP) is that member institutions consistently struggle to demonstrate their compliance with this standard at the time of the off-site decennial review.  The SACSCOC reaffirmation classes of 2017, 2018, and 2019, saw non-compliance rates with this standard of 60%, 59%, and 61%, respectively.
Purpose, Study Design, and Research Questions
The purpose of this DiP is to identify and analyze approaches used by SACSCOC member institutions seeking to demonstrate their compliance with the assessment standard. Within the context of an exploratory model, I conducted a document analysis of a sample of ten SACSCOC member institutions’ narratives in order to understand how they sought to demonstrate their compliance with the assessment standard.  I developed the following four research questions to address the PoP.
i. What approaches do institutions take to define goals for student learning?
ii.  What guidelines do institutions put in place to navigate assessment activities?
iii. How do institutions report using the data collected in the assessment process to drive improvements?
iv. What evidence do institutions provide that demonstrates assessment is part of the institution’s culture, and not an exercise done strictly for accreditation purposes?
Findings
	Each research question yielded major findings which will be summarized here.  Regarding research question 1, I found that one way all ten of the sampled institutions organize their assessment work is to create an institution-wide schedule of assessment that delineates key activities and deadlines.   The major finding related to research question 2 is that there is significant variation both across and within institutions with respect to the specific instruments (e.g., written exams, surveys) used when conducting assessment.  A primary finding related to research question 3 is that institutions commonly adjust academic supports (e.g., embedded tutoring) in response to data collected in the assessment process.  Regarding research question 4, I found that all ten institutions incorporate assessment into its operations in ways that are not strictly for compliance purposes (e.g., listing learning outcomes in the catalog).
Implications
	The present study fills a gap in the literature by helping to describe the approaches institutions use to facilitate the assessment of student learning within the context of an accreditation review.  The findings also deviate from existing literature in two critical ways.  First, none of the sampled institutions reported using a pre/post assessment as identified by Shavelson (2010).  Second, unlike the CAOs in Kuh and colleagues’ research (2014), major changes reported by the sampled institutions related to changes in academic supports (e.g., embedded tutoring).  
Recommendations
	I have developed recommendations for both practitioners and researchers based on the findings of this study.  For practitioners, my primary recommendations are to work toward a) developing a predictable schedule of assessment within their institutions, b) ensuring faculty are an integral part of the assessment process, and c) working with internal and external stakeholders to integrate assessment into the fabric of the institution.  Thinking of future directions for research, the present study could be built upon by gaining access to institutions’ compliance status, as determined by SACSCOC in order to evaluate the effectiveness of their assessment approaches.  The current study provides a description of approaches used by institutions who are attempting to demonstrate their compliance with the assessment standard, but it is not able to speak to the resulting determination of compliance by SACSCOC.  Another potential direction for future research involves examining the gains in student learning measured by the assessment process.  While the present study is unable to address those gains, it may be possible to do so by obtaining the supporting documentation that accompanies the narratives and/or conducting interviews with institutional personnel.

            <DISS_para>This dissertation explores Black teachers’ childhood schooling-, collegiate-, and professional experiences to understand teachers’ ideologies, identity, and pedagogical practices. This research was prompted by current, widely disparate views on the notion of teaching critical race theory in public schools. The present study employs a qualitative narrative inquiry approach to the data collection process involving seven Black teachers in North Florida. The study applies multiple theoretical perspectives approaches that integrate Black Teacher Identity Development, Critical Race Theory, and Culturally Responsive Pedagogies as perceived in teachers’ stories. The findings of this study suggest that Black teachers rely on their Black identities to inform their pedagogical practices and liberating spaces to engage in critical, vulnerable dialogue with each other. Teachers discussed their perception of the racialized education reform policies and its impact on the public image of teachers. In addition, teachers believed that the policy challenged their professionalism, ethics, and Black identity. In sharing their stories, Black teachers reclaimed their narrative to dispel the dominant narrative that suggests teachers are incapable of objectivity. This study provides practical actions school leaders can take to support teachers and highlight the work that is being done at their school. The findings have implications for the critical analysis of racialized, exclusionary policies that contribute to the marginalization of people of color. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of the Dissertation in Practice was to explore the experiences and perceptions of a group of middle school teachers and administrators that were implementing a Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) program.  The setting for this case study was an urban, Title I middle school located in Florida.  Interviews were conducted with both teacher and administrator participants regarding their experiences implementing this program and their perceptions about its effectiveness.  Analysis of the data captured from these interviews led to the development of themes for the two groups.  Training, competing initiatives and lack of time, the importance of leadership, effectiveness is dependent on the individual, and obstacles to effectiveness were developed for the teachers.  The two themes developed for the administrators: consistency is key and teachers limit the program.  Implications for the program will be discussed, as will a set of recommendations based on the findings. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This work explored the modification of interstitial sites in lanthanide intermetallics grown from metal flux synthesis. Hydrocarbons and fluorocarbons were used as sources of carbon and either hydrogen or fluorine and were reacted with other reactants in Ln/T fluxes. Fluorine interstitial sites were identified by single crystal X-ray diffraction while hydride sites were identified with neutron diffraction. Anthracene was previously used as a hydride source in the flux growth of La15(FeC6)4H and Ce4B2C2H2.4. Fluorinated analogs were targeted by using decafluorobiphenyl (C12F10) as a reactant, which acts as both a carbon and fluorine source. This mild fluorinating technique enables the isolation of an intermetallic product containing fluoride interstitials, as opposed to forming ionic metal fluorides. La15(FeC6)4F2 was grown as large crystals by reacting iron in a La/Ni eutectic flux in the presence of C12F10. The compound adopts a structure in the hexagonal crystal system with space group P6 ̅ which features FeC6 units composed of a central iron atom coordinated by three ethylenide units in a trigonal planar configuration. The structure is related to the previously reported La15(FeC6)4H, but with fluoride fully occupying the interstitial hydride positions, which induces partial occupancies and site splitting disorder in the adjacent layers of lanthanide ions.
Decafluorobiphenyl and anthracene were reacted with boron in a melt comprised of cerium and copper, yielding crystals of Ce4B2C2F0.14H2.26, a fluorinated analog of previously reported Ce4B2C2H2.42. The siting and occupancies of the fluoride and hydride interstitials were confirmed using both single crystal X-ray and neutron diffraction. The fluoride mixes with hydride in an octahedral interstitial site surrounded by cerium cations; additional hydride ions occupy tetrahedral sites. Magnetic susceptibility shows a change from canted antiferromagnetic ordering reported for the hydride to paramagnetic behavior upon fluorine substitution.
New stuffed lanthanide borocarbides were grown from reactions in lanthanide-rich eutectic melts, exploring the use of C14H10 (anthracene) and C12F10 (decafluorobiphenyl) as sources of interstitial hydride and fluoride ions. Ln3BC2Xn (Ln = La, Ce, Pr; X = H, F) are analogs of the orthorhombic Ca3C3Cl2 structure type, featuring borocarbide units in place of the allenylide anions and small anions (X = H and F) in place of the chloride anions, partially occupying octahedral and tetrahedral interstitial sites surrounded by lanthanide cations. Single crystal neutron diffraction data for La3BC2H1.69 confirm hydrogen is present in both interstitial sites, with site-splitting in the octahedral site. Magnetic studies indicate that La3BC2H1.69 is a superconductor with a Tc at around 3 K. Pr3BC2Hx shows antiferromagnetic behavior below 55 K while Pr3BC2F0.54 is paramagnetic.
New lanthanum borocarbide chlorides were grown from La/Fe flux. La3BC2Cl1.01 crystallizes in space group Cmcm and has the same structure as La3BC2H1.69, with chlorine substituting into the hydride sites. Chlorine is located in an octahedral site and a tetrahedral site with occupancies of 85(6)% and 17(8)% respectively. Reactions with higher chloride content yield La3BC2Cl2 which has the La3BC2Br2 structure in Pnma; this structure has larger coordination environments for the chloride ions, allowing full occupancy. Density of state calculations show La3BC2Cl1.01 is metallic and the Fermi level falls in a stabilizing pseudogap. La3BC2Cl2 is a semiconductor with a bandgap of 0.1eV.
Reactions of anthracene in Ln/T eutectic mixtures (Ln = La, Yb; T = Ni, Cu) have produced crystals of new complex lanthanide carbide hydride phases. The thermal decomposition of anthracene provides a source of both carbon and hydrogen. LaCHx forms in space group Pnma with unit cell parameters a = 7.2736(4) b = 3.7218(2) c = 13.0727(7) Å; Yb2CHx forms in space group P321 with unit cell parameters a = 3.5659(4) and c = 5.8000(8) Å. LaCHx contains an empty tetrahedral site that closely matches the size of the hydride site in LaH2. Yb2CHx contains two empty interstitial sites that may be filled with hydrogen. DOS calculations show that filling the tetrahedral site in LaCHx with hydrogen increases metallic behavior, while adding hydrogen into the two sites in Yb2CHx progressively lower the number of states at the Fermi level.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Cancer cachexia is primarily characterized by significant bodyweight loss and skeletal muscle atrophy, resulting from reduced rates of protein synthesis and increased rates of protein breakdown, which are further exacerbated by continued use of alcohol.  While chemotherapy treatment without tumor presence has been shown to induce cachexia, its influence on protein balance and atrophy when alcohol use is continued during cancer treatment has yet to be described.   The purpose of Aim 1 was to determine the influence of chemotherapy on skeletal muscle protein synthetic and degradative pathways during alcohol-enhanced cancer cachexia.   Mice consumed a liquid diet with those in the alcohol group receiving 20% alcohol (EtOH) kcal/day. After approximately 7-weeks, tumor-bearing mice were inoculated subcutaneously with C26-colon cancer cells, and 5-days thereafter chemotherapy-treated mice were administered a drug combination of 5-flurouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) twice weekly until sacrifice.  Chemotherapy prevented cancer-induced muscle atrophy of various limb muscles within non-alcohol mice, however, chronic alcohol use prevented the preservation capacity of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy did not differentially alter markers of protein synthesis within either dietary group, as the presence of alcohol appears to predominate the reductions observed. All tumor-bearing mice experienced reductions in puromycin incorporation, and while expression was reduced further in EtOH consuming mice, no beneficial effect of chemotherapy was present. In tumor bearing mice, molecular markers of protein synthetic pathways were unchanged in EtOH-naïve mice compared to non-cancer control, however, chronic alcohol exacerbated the decrease in phosphorylation of Akt kinase (Akt)Thr308, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1)Ser65, 70 kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (p70S6K1)Thr389, and ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6)Ser240/244.   These deficits were unaffected and not recovered by chemotherapy treatment within both dietary groups.  Markers of protein degradation were more sensitive to chemotherapy treatment within non-alcohol groups, in which the reduction of Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1(ULK1)Ser555 and increase in AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK)Thr172 induced by cancer were normalized; however, these restorative effects of chemotherapy were prevented by chronic alcohol use.  Furthermore, alcohol augmented the expression of microtube-associated proteins A1/1B light chain 3B (LC3B II/) ratio, and reduction in ULK1Ser757 and p62 compared to non-alcohol cancer mice, while chemotherapy normalized sequestosome-1 (p62) and LC3B II/I in both treatment groups regardless of alcohol treatment.  Chemotherapy normalized cancer-induced increases in ubiquitination, and gene expression of muscle-ring finger protein-1 (Murf1) and muscle atrophy F-box (Mafbx) within both non-alcohol and alcohol-treated groups.  These findings illustrate that alcohol prevents the ability of chemotherapy to minimize or delay skeletal muscle atrophy in combination with EtOH-induced accentuation of disruptions in markers of protein synthesis and degradation, that remained largely unperturbed by chemotherapy treatment in alcohol naïve mice. 	Inflammation is a hallmark feature of cancer as body tissues as well as tumor tissues produce and receive proinflammatory cytokines leading to increased activities of the pathways involved in their downstream signaling pathways. Previous work has shown that tumor cells which secrete continual tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) worsen cachexia compared to non-secreting tumors 9.  Furthermore, systemic markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are frequently associated with reduced skeletal muscle index, produced by body composition analysis via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), dual x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and computed tomography (CT) cancer patients10. Therefore, Aim 2 determined the effects of chemotherapy on inflammatory-mediators during alcohol-enhanced cachexia.  In the current experiment, chemotherapy did not differentially alter protein expression of various inflammatory pathways within either dietary group, however, it was able to normalize certain cancer or alcohol-induced changes in the expression of proteins involved in inflammation.  Phosphorylation of signaling transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)Tyr705, which can be activated by IL-6, was enhanced within all tumor-bearing groups, and was exacerbated by alcohol, whereas suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), nuclear factor kappa B (NFkB)Ser536, forkhead box protein 1 (FOXO1a)Ser256, and suppressor of Mothers against Decapentaplegic (Smad2)Ser465/467/Smad3Ser423/425, were unaffected by either dietary treatment.  However, corresponding to the cancer-driven increase in STAT3Tyr705 was an increase in circulating IL-6 expression in all tumor-bearing groups, except for Chemo.  Interestingly, Smad3Ser423/425 was increased only by EtOH, while chemotherapy effectively prevented these changes.  A main effect of chemotherapy was present for both circulating IFN-γ and TNF-α, where these cytokines were elevated by chemotherapy regardless of alcohol consumption. Altogether, the ability of chemotherapy to prevent or delay alterations in inflammatory-related proteins does not appear to be affected by chronic alcohol.
	Skeletal muscle force characteristics are reduced by both cancer and alcohol use; therefore, the purpose of Aim 3 was to define whether chemotherapy preserves skeletal muscle force production impaired during alcohol-enhanced cancer cachexia.  In a separate cohort of mice, the identical experimental protocol mentioned above was implemented, however, prior to sacrifice, mice performed in situ skeletal muscle contraction of the triceps surae complex of the lower limb. Tetanic force, twitch maximum, rate of contraction and half relaxation were unaffected by chemotherapy within either dietary treatment, however, all cancer mice experienced an increase in half relaxation time of the triceps surae.  Chemotherapy effectively prevented the loss of force during muscular fatigue induced by cancer only within non-alcohol treated mice, indicating that alcohol use prevented these beneficial effects.  Furthermore, alcohol increased fatigue within non-chemotherapy treated groups. While force recovery at 5- and 10-minutes post-fatigue was not affected by chemotherapy within either group; recovered force was decreased in alcohol-treated mice compared to non-alcohol. Together, alcohol use reduced force produced during fatigue within non-chemotherapy treated mice. While chemotherapy did not affect tetanic force or twitch characteristics of the triceps surae, in either control or alcohol groups compared to both non-alcohol control and all other tumor-bearing groups, it attenuated fatigue through the preservation of force only within non-alcohol consuming mice. This effect was diminished by alcohol use throughout cancer development, because the alcohol negated the effects of chemotherapy. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Accurately decoding emotional facial expressions is necessary for effective human interaction. But person-level features, particularly race, affects the speed and accuracy of which people process certain facial information. Specifically, one line of work indicates that group-level associations impact expression categorization, such that people are faster at categorizing angry Black versus White faces and happy White versus Black faces. Alternatively, there is also evidence that ingroup classification impacts expression categorization, such that people are better at recognizing expressions on own- versus other-race faces. The present research explores these ideas by testing whether race and racial categorization impact expression categorization in three studies. Study 1 is a replication and extension of previous work in which I control for facial features to examine whether skin tone impacts expression categorization. In Study 2, I use skin and feature morphed faces to explore whether expression categorization advantages weaken as the face becomes more racially ambiguous. In Study 3, I control for skin tone to examine whether facial features and racial categorization impact expression categorization. The results indicate that both group-level expression advantages (i.e., Black-angry, White-happy) and an ingroup advantage based on actual race impact expression categorization.  </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Drug discovery has been known as a long, expensive, and risky process of identifying developing and discovering novel treatments with desired pharmaceutical effect to diseases. Despite advances in computer-aided virtual screening, developing one drug can still take anywhere from 10 to 15 years involving intensive collaboration among scientists, physicians and medical experts and cost billions of dollars to release a new drug to market. Protein-ligand docking plays a fundamental role in drug discovery. Traditional algorithms in searching the binding location and binding pose are extremely expensive and time-consuming. Deep learning-based protein-ligand binding models have achieved many remarkable progresses in the past few years. We designed an atom-atom distance based deep learning model with self-attention mechanism integrated. A preliminary study on Cu2+ and SO42- was firstly conducted and followed by a comprehensive ablation study to detail the contribution of each component of the proposed model, and then we extend it to a larger dataset containing various length of ligands. Results demonstrate that our proposed deep learning architecture achieves promising results comparing to the previous research. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This thesis investigates the songwriting practice and lived experience of a 35-year-old, transgender female musical artist and humanities professor named Mary (pseudonym) through the theoretical lenses of intersectionality and neurodiversity. To my knowledge, this is the first ethnomusicological study exclusively focused on the interaction of songwriting and personhood in a study of an autistic singer-songwriter. I additionally explore how the communicative mode established between Mary and me during this project reveals the methodological value of using the artist’s songs as a starting point for ethnographic engagement. In particular, it demonstrates how this process generated improvised questions in real time that sparked the sharing of meaningful insights and stories on Mary’s part. I then use this methodological model as a template to encourage ethnomusicologists to critically reconsider human communication and interaction within the framework of neurodiversity as culturally informed activities, individualized modes of behavior and habit, and determinants that influence the ways we understand the lives of other people, notwithstanding how “other” might be conceptualized in any given framework.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para> Sequence data are extensively studied in numerous domains, such as time series forecasting, audio analysis,Natural Language Processing (NLP), Etc. However, the observed sequences show highly non-stationarity and long-term dependence in real-world applications. Also, the noise term makes the task of modeling and analyzing the underlying generating process more difficult. Digging into the characters of sequence data, either the bias or the specific pattern (e.g., cycle, trend, dependency) needs to be extracted and analyzed. Therefore, statisticians put forward the traditional time series models, such as ARIMA- and GARCH-type models. Also, advanced models that capture the dynamics of sequence called dynamic time warping (DTW), stochastic processing methods such as the Gaussian process and hidden Markov model, and some machine learning models like Random Forest (RF), CNN, and RNN are widely generated
for long-range sequence data study given the powerful calculation performance.
In this dissertation, we propose another type of model that is originally derived from models other than the traditional sequence data analysis. We propose the Bag of Feature (BoF) type model, originally proposed to build histogram representations based on the
extracted features from images. Later, it was shown that the BoF model could also efficiently tackle and process large amounts of complex and high-dimensional sequence data such as video and audio records. BoF
model contains three major steps: 1) feature extraction step. 2) the dictionary learning step. 3) the aggregation step.
To improve the learning efficiency of the BoF model, we put forward a neural network generalization for the BoF called the Neural Bag of Feature (NBoF) model. Like its predecessor, NBoF can generate a fixed-size histogram vector from variable-size inputs. The NBoF model shares the same framework as its predecessor, which contains a quantization layer constructed with radial basis function and a recurrent accumulation layer. The Neural BoF approach can adjust the input weights and the centers of the RBF neurons and optimize the feature extractor. The NBoF model exhibits a good improvement compared to its unsupervised predecessor. However, in the aggregation step, a fixed-size histogram is calculated simply by averaging all the quantized features, which limits the process of aggregation and dictionary learning to fully take advantage of other data-driven approaches when handling the long-term sequence data. Therefore, a weighing mechanism for the NBoF model on the accumulation layer will help. Specifically, we propose a Bayesian attention module that treats the attention weights as latent random variables. This dissertation introduces a global (soft) data-dependent prior distribution for regularization. The prior can construct a simplex constrained attention posterior distribution via normalizing a reparameterizable
distribution (e.g., Gamma distribution, Log-Normal distribution), making the training process differentiable and
simple to optimize. Based on the variational inference, the Bayesian attention-based model provides an analytic form that can be applied directly to the NBoF model or any other encoder-decoder system. To investigate the model performance of the proposed BAMNBoF model, we
implement the BAMNBoF model on the human behavior analysis dataset (Bar Crawl data), the taxonomical sound resources sequence (UrbanSound 8K) dataset, and also the financial time series classification (FI 2010 data and one simulated high-frequency trading data) and then compare it with NBoF-type models, Attention Neural Bag of Feature (ANBoF) model and also other unsupervised classifiers (random forest, MLP) and supervised neural networks (CNN, LSTM, GRU) with cross-validation schemes.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>During my childhood, my family owned a small convenience store that served members of our community. However, our family business had to close because of customers who failed to pay. I find that small businesses tend to be more susceptible to unexpected internal and external forces than their larger counterparts. Small businesses constitute the economy’s lifeblood, but they obviously need more help and support than large companies. I am thus interested in researching the funding-related and operational difficulties that small retailers and startups face and especially what I can do to help them survive these challenges.My first dissertation research focuses on how crowdfunding platforms can help protect economically struggling entrepreneurs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Crowdfunding is a new technology platform providing access to two parties: entrepreneurs and SMEs who launch campaigns to collect money and funders who visit the platform and decide whether to support the project. Despite only being around since 2009, crowdfunding has become a popular entrepreneurship financing option and is catching up to traditional financing channels like venture capital. I propose that such a fast-growing online technology platform offers a vital financing resource for financially constrained entrepreneurs during the pandemic. My empirical analysis results confirm my proposition that the number of funders, the size of their contributions, and their total investment amounts all increased with the increased severity of COVID-19, challenging the existing belief that a crisis has a negative effect on entrepreneurship financing. I further examine that one plausible reason for funders’ increasing investment demand is altruism-- funders are more willing to support and help entrepreneurs to bring their projects to life when they are struggling financially due to COVID-19. This result is consistent with current findings about the altruistic nature of funders noted in the literature. However, on the supply side, entrepreneurs have reduced their project-launching activities despite more financing opportunities on the demand side. I therefore urge entrepreneurs to launch new ventures to tap into crowdfunding resources. 
My second dissertation paper focuses on consumers’ response to a product failure: product returns. Many retailers treat product returns as an evil because returns hurt their bottom line. However, researchers have pointed out recently that a return serves as another customer touchpoint to enhance consumer relationships. A superior return experience can turn angry, frustrated customers into happy ones so that they increase their purchases in the future. While existing research focuses on the overall effect of returns on future consumer purchases, I question whether this effect applies to all returns. I classify consumer returns based on the reason for the return—the wrong size, not liking the item, disappointment with the quality, and other reasons. Then I examine how the reason for the return impacts future consumer purchases. My regression results suggest that only sizing returns increase the likelihood of consumer repurchases. In contrast, items returned because the consumer doesn’t like the product decrease consumer repurchases and returns based on quality concerns do not significantly affect consumer repurchases. I explain my results based on the attribution theory: customers return reasons influence how they blame a seller and then how they respond. For example, sizing returns, at least partially, can be self-ascribed to consumers because consumers’ body dimensions— height, chest size, waist size, and so on—vary significantly, and so designing a product to fit everyone can be challenging. Due to self- attribution, customers tend to have a lower initial dissatisfaction caused by a return event, which a redress process (i.e., a good return experience) can easily recover. Our paper contributes to consumer return literature by addressing the rarity of return-reason-related research. We also provide important managerial insights to improve retailers' return service recovery practices and customer value evaluation using return reason data.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) mark the beginning and the end of stellar evolution. They are one of the most powerful cosmological probes in our universe thanks to their high intrinsic luminosities and standardizable properties. In the 1990s, the observation of SNe Ia led to the discovery of the accelerating cosmic expansion that was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2011. Despite decades of advancements, the exact details of progenitor systems (i.e. what exploded), explosion mechanisms (i.e., how they exploded), and evolution effect (i.e. are the nearby population the same as those in the early universe?) are still not fully understood yet.  With more advanced observation surveys forthcoming in the near future, such as those on board the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, the systematic uncertainties of SNe Ia observations will continue to dominate the error budget of their distance measurements. This dissertation is motivated to improve the precision of SN~Ia cosmology by understanding the physics and diversity and SNe Ia, as well as improving the astronomical tools needed for cosmological purposes. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Photometric and spectroscopic observational studies of the first homogenous sample of the peculiar 03fg-like SNe Ia obtained by the Carnegie Supernovae Project (CSP) are conducted to investigate the physics of SNe Ia. 03fg-like events are usually more luminous than the normal SNe Ia and exhibit peculiar light-curve shapes in the redder filters, such as the weak or missing secondary maxima and the delayed peak time in iYJH bands. Spectroscopically, 03fg-like SN Ia show peculiar features in both optical and near-infrared (NIR) regions, such as the stronger C, slower Si, and the lack of the H-band break. One of the most extreme objects within this subgroup, ASASSN-15hy, is used for the case study of an envelope model that could potentially explain all 03fg-like SNe~Ia. It is found that a core degenerate scenario, an explosion of a degenerate white dwarf core inside a nondegenerate envelope, with a transition from deflagration to detonation can explain the observed peculiar properties. In the case of ASASSN-15hy, the low metallicity of the progenitor is a key aspect of the model explanation. In fact, a low-metallicity host environment is a shared preference among these 03fg-like SNe~Ia. Such host environment is more common in the early universe, which brings up the concern that 03fg-like SNe~Ia may be a problem for high-redshift SN~Ia cosmology due to detection bias and potential evolution preference. Therefore, more detailed observational and theoretical studies of these events are strongly recommended.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Another main focus of this dissertation is on the development of a new NIR spectral template of SNe Ia that captures the feature variations that are correlated with the light-curve shapes. Compared to optical observations, NIR observations of SN Ia are less sensitive to dust and have more uniform peak luminosities, which are beneficial for cosmological purposes. A spectral template is usually needed to fit the light curves of SNe Ia accurately in order to estimate the distance. However, the NIR part of the existing spectral templates lacks an accurate description of the intrinsic spectral variations. Using the largest and most homogeneous collection of NIR spectra of SNe Ia to date collected by CSP-II, we are able to explore the NIR spectral diversity of SNe Ia and build a new NIR spectra template. Principal component analysis and Gaussian process regression are used for the template construction, which reduces data dimensionality and models the parameter dependence, respectively.  Using the new template reduces the systematic uncertainties in K-corrections by ~90% compared to those from the Hsiao template. Furthermore, this template can serve as the baseline spectral energy distribution for various light-curve fitters and can identify peculiar spectral features that might point to compelling physics. The NIR spectra data and template presented in this work will substantially improve future SN Ia cosmological experiments, for both nearby and distant samples.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This treatise explores the interpretive decisions that can be made through different methods of musical analysis. Specifically, this study focuses on Carl Maria von Weber’s Grand Duo Concertant Op. 48 for clarinet and piano. The primary focus is not to suggest an ideal interpretation, but rather show how different analytical methods can lead to different interpretations of the same music with supporting reasoning.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The methods of  analysis used were formal analysis (drawing from the work of Willia m Caplin, James Hepokoski and Warren Darcy, and Douglass Green), performance analysis (from Karen McLaughlin Large), narrative analysis (drawing from the methods described by Robert Hatten and Byron Almén), and concatenationism (from Jerrold Levinson). When contextualized with historic accounts of Weber’s focus for composition, general musical styles of the early nineteenth century, and the development for how analysis informs interpretation and performance, this study offers options for how to approach different components of the Grand Duo along with how those interpretive choices could translate to live performance or change the approach the performers take to realize those moments in performance. Naturally, the level of subjectivity in an individual’s performance considerations has to be navigated in a study of this nature, therefore, the suggestions made accommodate for that in showing the interpretive options that the chosen methods of analysis can reach rather than ignoring the subjective element of musical performance and offering an ideal guide to performance based on analysis.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized how we interact with technology by enabling numerous devices to communicate and autonomously perform tasks in various settings such as homes, enterprises, and smart cities. However, this rapid expansion has also introduced significant security threats due to inherent vulnerabilities, diverse device types, and the vast number of IoT devices. This dissertation addresses critical challenges in IoT security by focusing on network traffic characteristics, IoT device identification, and compromised IoT device detection in smart networks. We perform an extensive analysis of network traffic behaviors for both IoT and non-IoT devices, devise a novel approach for device classification based on network traffic behaviors, profile IoT device behavior, and implement a method for detecting compromised IoT devices in smart environments. Our machine-learning-based IoT device identification approach, iotID, achieves a balanced accuracy score above 99% in identifying deployed IoT devices. Furthermore, we introduce a novel approach for detecting compromised IoT devices, iotADAS, using Deep Autoencoders and the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) method. Our research contributes to the creation of more secure and reliable IoT ecosystems by providing an effective solution for detecting compromised IoT devices in smart network environments.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Sources for musical composition can come when you least expect it. Such is the case for "Crystal Bridges". Each of the movements that make up this piece are based on a piece of art that I observed at the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas. I was captivated by many of the pieces of art, but especially by the three that I selected to constitute this piece. The first movement, “Lunar Rendezvous-Circle of Flowers”, is based on Alma Thomas's work of art by the same name. Her piece was inspired by the idea of what her garden might look like from the moon. She uses abstraction and vivid colors to portray her response to technological advances and her own passion. I took the playful and elegant nature of a garden and juxtaposed that idea against the vastness and broadness of space. This movement starts in Alma Thomas's garden, then "zooms-out" to see her garden from space. The piece then zooms back into her garden, giving the movement a variation of an arch form.
The second movement, “Sierra Nevada Morning”, is based on Albert Bierstadt's painting of the same name. In his painting, Bierstadt keenly reinforces the theme of romanticism by focusing on both mild and powerful elements of nature, emotion, imagination, and the untainted beauty of the West. What captured my attention most about the painting was Bierstadt's use of luminism and depth. The painting features a calm pond with deer, while stretching up to the skies with bright clouds and mountains towering in the background. I reflect the idea of luminism by using metallic percussion instruments such as the vibraphone, crotales, and glockenspiel to create a "shimmering" effect. The piece itself unfolds from quiet woodwind oscillations that build into expansive, chordal hits, paralleling the growth from the pond to the towering mountains and clouds that can be found in Bierstadt's painting.
Lastly, “Cerulean”, the third movement, is based on Carmen Herrera's abstract painting of the same name. This piece takes the listener through some of the perceptions of the painting as observed by various patrons at the museum. Some of the words that I used as inspiration during my compositional process were "bold", "sharp", "valorous", "persistent", "vivid", "soaring", and "light". These were all words that came up in discussion with patrons at the museum. Abstract art is meant to encourage imagination and multiple perspectives, which I represent in this concluding movement.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>It is well documented that with a growing demographic mismatch between a largely white teaching force and an increasingly diverse student body, teacher-student relationships are often impacted by a lack of educator understanding around the effects of racism on students’ lives and educational systems. The utilization of anti-racist pedagogy, which emphasizes the examination of historical and political contexts and the cultivation of critical analysis of individual and systemic structures, presents a suitable approach of introducing and delving into the issue of racial equity in education. This study explores the ways in which practicing teachers in a Title I school navigate conversations about race and react to strategies and activities in an introductory professional learning in-service using the Courageous Conversations framework developed by Glen Singleton. This paper indicates a need for continued, ongoing professional development to move teachers toward an anti-racist mindset and create the context necessary for educators to understand systemic racism and its effects within the educational system.  </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In December 2019, a strain of pneumonia named SARS-CoV-2, or Coronavirus Disease 2019 (more commonly known as COVID-19), expeditiously spread worldwide, causing a global pandemic. Though the COVID-19 response in the United States has primarily concentrated on controlling the virus's transmission and reducing deaths, this pandemic has caused a secondary crisis of psychological suffering. The psychological health of frontline healthcare workers and other health workers is often ignored or goes unnoticed (Maunder, 2004; Kang et al., 2020; Robertson et al., 2004; Xiang et al., 2020); however, the mental and emotional vulnerability of healthcare workers was identified as a critical issue during the pandemic (Holmes et al., 2020). A qualitative study was performed using grounded analysis to (1) determine the types of trauma experienced by nurses responding to the COVID-19 pandemic and (2) identify factors that positively and/or negatively contributed to the subsequent mental and emotional health of nurses responding during the COVID-19 pandemic. From July to September 2022, interview data were collected from 19 nurses working in designated COVID-19 units or intensive care units between March 2020 and March 2022 in three hospitals in West Palm Beach, Broward, and Miami-Dade counties in Florida. Based on the data collected, five themes were identified:
Theme #1: Nurses Experienced Mental and Emotional Trauma During the COVID-19 Pandemic
Theme #2: Nurses Felt Ill-Equipped During the COVID-19 Pandemic
Theme #3: Nurses Felt Undervalued During the COVID-19 Pandemic
Theme #4: Factors That Contributed to Mental and Emotional Trauma in Nurses
Theme #5: Factors That Safeguarded Nurses From Mental and Emotional Trauma
Recommendations were provided for organizational-level interventions to mitigate adverse mental and emotional effects and promote the healthy well-being of frontline healthcare workers.
Keywords: COVID-19, healthcare workers, nurses, mental health, emotional health, trauma

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to analyze the challenges faced by novice music educators during their collegiate education and early in-service years as professional educators. The specific research questions that guided this study included: (a) What are some common problematic themes experienced between novice music educators as they navigated the early years of teaching? (b) How prepared did participants feel when transitioning to the professional field, and what factors of their preservice education were most/least valued during the transition? (c) What skills or values (musical or non-musical) did participants contribute any of their self- proclaimed success to as a music educator? Additional research questions later asked during two interviews included: (d) What impact did the participants’ mentor teachers have on their identities as novice music educators, specifically if their mentor teachers did not teach music? (e) What are three strongly held beliefs or teaching strategies participants felt were absolutely vital to transitioning to the professional field? (f) What have participants done to make their experiences as music educators more fulfilling, especially when dealing with COVID-19 restrictions and regulations? A literature review was completed to further explore this study’s rationales and framework. The literature review outlined the issues that past and current pre-service educators and novice in-service educators have encountered during their collegiate educations and professional careers. In addition to these issues, the review of literature also defined and gave examples of the effects of teacher attrition and turnover. Specifically, the issues that have most heavily impacted early-career attrition and turnover were discussed. Additionally, novice music educators and their pre-service experiences were especially highlighted and discussed. Data from this study were collected from a web based survey that was distributed through convenience and snowball sampling and through the Florida Music Education Association’s (FMEA) online mail-out. Due to the nature of these distribution strategies, a completion percentage was not calculated. Moreover, over the total number of participants that began the web based survey (N = 107), only approximately seventy-eight participants completed it in its entirety. Additionally, two interviews were completed to add a qualitative and exploratory perspective on the issues faced by pre-service students and novice in-service professionals. Data from the web based survey suggested that many issues such as poor administrative support, unruly student behavior, overwhelming professional duties, and other problematic themes cited in past literature are still pressing issues within the professional field. Additionally, almost half (47.78%) of the participants felt only somewhat prepared to enter the professional field and about a third (32.22%) of the participants were unsure if they were or felt they were not prepared to enter the professional field. Moreover, 60% of the participants cited they were concerned with how well they were performing their duties during their novice years of teaching, with 21% of the participants claiming they would likely leave the professional field before their fifth year of teaching. Fortunately, the participants had a lot of advice to offer in terms of coping strategies for success, both personally and successfully, as music educators. The interview portions, though short, offered valuable insights into the minds of two young music educators. While some of professional beliefs may differ slightly, the impact of their non-music teacher mentor during their early-career and identity development was the same. Non-music mentor teachers, though respected, do not hold the same value as seasoned music teachers do to young music educators. COVID-19 did not greatly impact either of these participants classrooms or day-to-day job duties.Overall, the issues faced by pre-service and in-service music educators seemed to have not changed drastically over the past several decades of modernization in the United States. While this thesis hoped to expand on past research and emphasize the troubles of the past and present, more should be done to alleviate the problems too many teachers face across the country. Otherwise, the current trends suggest that the staggering percentage of teachers already leaving the field may continue to rise, leaving even more vacancies in schools across the United States. Further results and implications are discussed within the paper.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>J.S. Bach’s Sonatas and Partitas for Solo Violin (BWV 1001-1006) are considered some of the most important solos for violin in the repertoire. Bach overcame compositional and technical feats with his solos, writing complex, polyphonic music for a single solo instrument. These pieces are used both on the performance stage and in the private lessons studio, as they demand extreme musical and technical virtuosity that challenge even the most experienced violinists. However, the pieces’ benefits are universal to all musicians, regardless of instrument. For trombonists, transcriptions of these sonatas and partitas would add new repertoire to the repository of transcriptions and present unique challenges.	This document details the basic methodology used to create performance editions of Bach’s sonatas and partitas for the tenor, bass, and alto trombones. The transcription process also elicits several concerns for transcribing string music for the trombone, for the violin can play multiple notes simultaneously while the trombone can only play a single note at a time. These concerns are addressed with various examples of solutions regarding the treatment of multiple stops and baroque ornaments. Additional details are included in the performance editions, such as tempi markings, practice suggestions, and listening recommendations, to facilitate authentic, well-informed performances of Bach’s sonatas and partitas.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to investigate several factors related to student leadership in high school marching bands. Specifically, the study investigated the process marching band directors used to select student leaders, what qualities marching band directors searched for in student leaders, what type of leadership training marching band directors provided for their students, and whether there was a difference in the responses between directors of competitive marching bands and non-competitive marching bands. Participants (N = 47) for this study were high school marching band directors in the southeastern United States who completed a web-based survey using Qualtrics.Participants most frequently used interviews (n = 39, 83.0%) and auditions (n = 33, 70.2%) in their student leader selection process. Most participants (n = 40, 85.1%) stated that they looked for different qualities in the students they chose to be drum majors versus those they chose to fill other leadership roles (e.g., section leaders). For drum majors, most participants prioritized natural leaders, dependable people, good musicians, and basic conducting skills. For other leadership positions, participants valued dependable people, good musicians, and people with leadership personalities. Most participants (n = 42, 89.4%) provided leadership training to their students, and discussion-based activities were the main type of training activities. There were no statistically significant differences in the responses of competitive marching band directors and non-competitive marching band directors. Results of this study provide a descriptive profile of marching band directors’ selection processes for student leaders. Implications of these findings and suggestions for future research are discussed.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Employees engage in informal learning to solve a workplace problem and to gain knowledge at the time the need arises without waiting to attend a scheduled training session (Jacobs &amp; Park, 2009; Livingstone, 1999; Schugurensky, 2000; Schürmann &amp; Beausaert, 2016)￼ The definition employed in this study is the self-guided pursuit of knowledge, as an intentional (explicit) behavior, when the employee is cognizant of the learning while it is taking place. The organization of study was a municipal (government) utility organization in the southeast United States with combination of onsite and remote office staff, and skilled field/plant workers. The purpose of the study was to examine employees’ informal learning behaviors (ILBs) and tools that support their job performance, and to explain why they used those informal learning strategies and tools for their job performance. 172 employees completed a questionnaire reporting on their frequency of use of the following ILBs: talking with others, observing others, searching the internet, using job aids, using social media, reviewing policies and procedures, manuals, or standards, participating in coaching/mentoring, using shared materials, resources, and knowledge, using resources from professional organizations, and engaging in trial and error. Interviews with 10 employees representing both office and field employees, explained why employees engaged in ILBs and tools at work.  Employees responded to the survey and the findings revealed that nine out of the ten strategies were currently being used by 70% or more of the respondents. Results also show that five out of the eight informal learning tools listed on the questionnaire were being used by 70% or more of the respondents. While office and field workers ILBs and tools usage results were similar, their explanations of their specific work context revealed some important points for the organization to consider.  Workers in the field could benefit from access to organizational information and applications on their mobile device because the nature of field work required them to learn on-the-go.  Other unique work environments, such as remote office workers, depended on reliable access to collaboration tools and videoconferencing. The findings can help this organization and others provide a work environment that encourages ILBs and supports their employees’ job performance by providing necessary resources and tools for informal learning.  </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>En esta disertación propongo que los movimientos de protesta social que han estado presentes desde la independencia argentina parten de la desigualdad social y son parte esencial de las reivindicaciones para lograr el bienestar general. Así, existen evidencias históricas de que estos movimientos han logrado reformas sociales a favor del espacio subalterno en Argentina, como, por ejemplo, la ley del trabajo de 1905 o la creación de distintos centros educativos, como la Universidad Arturo Jauretche en 2009. La motivación de mi tesis está dirigida a llenar el vacío en la investigación sobre los orígenes del movimiento de protesta, su complejidad, sus procesos dinámicos y sus logros. Mi aporte, a este trabajo, es la examinación del discurso del movimiento en dos ámbitos: el acto de protesta pública, y a través de productos culturales como la literatura, la propaganda en imágenes gráficas estáticas, el cine y otros. El marco temporal en este trabajo incluye los tiempos de la Revolución de Mayo de 1810 hasta el presente. Mi análisis ahonda en los orígenes, intenciones y prácticas de la protesta y promoción ideológica, que apuntan a lograr soluciones políticas. Al recorrer este estudio he observado la línea que conecta las distintas expresiones de protesta, desde la época de Rosas, pasando por la generación del 37, los inmigrantes, el peronismo, los movimientos armados, y otros grupos subalternos, hasta la presentación de los piqueteros. Para relacionar la genealogía de este trabajo con la lucha discursiva, entendida como la confrontación entre dos o más discursos, para convencer al individuo de adoptar una posición política, utilicé ideas de teóricos como Michel Foucault, Louis Althusser, Stuart Hall, Othón Téllez, Ana Lucia Magrini y Antonio Gramsci, entre otros, sobre el origen de los productos culturales, la comunicación narrativa, el discurso y la hegemonía cultural presentes a lo largo de los capítulos.Los capítulos 1 y 2 demuestran cómo el gobierno de Rosas promovió la violencia, la persecución, la tortura y la muerte, y cómo tras la caída de Rosas aumentó la explotación de la clase obrera por parte del poder hegemónico. Además, exploro críticamente cómo llegó Perón al poder en 1946, que fue una gran victoria de la lucha obrera demostrada en los beneficios obtenidos. Asimismo, esta unidad examina por qué surgieron movimientos armados que realizaron protestas contra el espacio hegemónico.
En los capítulos 3 y 4, investigo cómo, desde 1983 hasta la actualidad, se iniciaron los piquetes contra las empresas de capital extranjero, al tiempo que se creaban instituciones educativas para fortalecer el control ideológico desde el Estado. También destaco cómo diversas expresiones culturales potenciaron la efectividad de las acciones piqueteras, como armas antisistémicas. Finalmente, las observaciones y análisis críticos realizados en los capítulos anteriores han revelado ciertas situaciones y prácticas que no permiten el avance de la democracia en Argentina. Debido a esta carencia, los grupos subalternos aparecen para pelear, a través de la protesta, por el acceso al poder de decisión del país. La evidencia fehaciente de la efectividad de estas acciones de protesta está resultando en una mayor justicia social para los grupos excluidos de la base política.

            <DISS_para>In this dissertation, I propose that the social protest movements that have been present since Argentine independence stem from social inequality and are an essential part of claims to achieve general welfare. So, there is historical evidence that these movements have achieved social reforms in favor of the subaltern space in Argentina, such as, for example, the labor law of 1905 or the creation of different educational centers, such as the Arturo Jauretche University in 2009. The motivation of my dissertation is aimed at filling the gap in research regarding the origins of the protest movement, its complexity, its dynamic processes, and its achievements. My contribution, to this work, is the examination of the discourse of the movement in two areas: the act of public protest, and through cultural products such as literature, propaganda in graphic static images, cinema, and others. The time frame in this work includes the times of the May Revolution of 1810 to the present. My analysis delves into the origins, intentions, and practices of protest and ideological promotion, which aim to achieve political solutions. When going through this study, I have observed the line that connects the different expressions of protest, from the time of Rosas, through the generation of 37, immigrants, Peronism, armed movements, and other subaltern groups, until the presentation of the piqueteros. To relate the genealogy of this work with the discursive struggle, understood as the confrontation between two or more discourses, to convince the individual to adopt a political position, I used ideas from theorists such as Michel Foucault, Louis Althusser, Stuart Hall, Othón Téllez, Ana Lucia Magrini, and Antonio Gramsci among others concerning the origin of cultural products, narrative communication, discourse, and cultural hegemony present through the chapters. Chapters 1 and 2 demonstrate how the Rosas government promoted violence, persecution, torture, and death, and how after the fall of Rosas the exploitation of the working class by the hegemonic power increased. Furthermore, I critically explore how Perón came to power in 1946, which was a great victory for the workers' struggle demonstrated in the benefits obtained. Also, this unit examines why armed movements arose, which carried out protests against the hegemonic space. 
In chapters 3 and 4, I investigate how, from 1983 to the present, the pickets against foreign capital companies began, while educational institutions were created to strengthen ideological control from the State. I also highlight how a variety of cultural expressions strengthened the effectiveness of piquetero actions, as anti-systemic weapons. Finally, the observations and critical analyzes carried out in the previous chapters have revealed certain situations and practices that do not allow the advancement of democracy in Argentina. Due to this lack, subaltern groups appear to battle, through protest, for access to the decision-making power of the country. Reliable evidence of the effectiveness of these protest actions is resulting in greater social justice for groups excluded from the political base.

            <DISS_para>The researcher focused on beginning teachers in Career and Education Technical high schools. Great proportions of new teachers exit the profession, and thus the aim of this study is to understand the school-related conditions that cause teacher burnout for new teachers entering the field in this school context. This project is a qualitative case study. For the case study, 11 participants were recruited to share their experiences as a beginning teacher. In order to be considered a beginning teacher, the participants must have had between zero to five years of teaching experience. The semi-structured interviews took place via Microsoft Teams Meeting. From the interviews, the researcher found that seven out of 11 beginning teachers in this study expressed a high or medium level of burnout. These teachers expressed at least one of the three symptoms associated with burnout—emotional exhaustion, depersonalization or reduced personal accomplishment. All of the teachers with burnout described excessive workload as a major school condition contributing to burnout. Three teachers with a high level of burnout identified students’ classroom behaviors to be the major condition contributing to burnout, but excessive workload was still a contributing condition in their experience. Each beginning teacher with either a high, or medium level of burnout did not perceive their administration’s support as a tool that reduces stress. As a matter of fact, in each case, the beginning teachers had a low connectedness with their principal. Four teachers with a medium level of burnout preferred a colleague to be their first point of support over an administrator. One of the four recommendations from this study is to identify beginning teachers who are struggling with classroom management and assign either an academic coach, support staff, or peer teacher to assist the teacher with improvement, development, and burnout.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Legend of Zelda is a popular videogame series developed by Nintendo. It is based in the genre of medieval fantasy, specifically sword and sorcery. However, in modern popular culture, the medieval fantasy genre rarely has any attachment to the actual Middle Ages, Zelda is no different. Instead, the Zelda series exists as a post-modern medievalism. A post-modern medievalism, for the purposes of this study, is a work of popular culture that fans recognize as “medieval” in modernity but has no intended connection to the real medieval past. Instead, they focus on an attachment to other works of medieval fantasy, especially Tolkien, to fit into modern perceptions of the medieval genre. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This work explores games within the Legend of Zelda series, using music as a case study. This case study on music further extends into the fandom associated with the series. Many fans engage with the series’ music both within and outside the context of the virtual world that these games create. It is my contention that the games themselves create an atmosphere of post-modern medieval fantasy through their graphics, music, and in-game features that gesture towards the genre. Some of these features are swords, shields, castles, and magic. Fans are also invested in the music of the series, one of the key ways that the games build their medieval atmosphere alongside their graphics and imagery. Often, they will continue to listen to the official musical tracks of the games as a way to figuratively  return to their childhood, a nostalgic undertaking. However, the musical cues found in newer entries to the series pay homage to earlier titles while also allowing fans to escape into a fantasy atmosphere. Breath of the Wild is an exceptionally successful title, focusing on ambient sounds that allow a player to fully immerse themselves into the natural surroundings that compose the majority of the game’s virtual landscape. However, these ambient sounds are often broken by music associated with the rampaging, destructive technology that players must combat to save the kingdom.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Beyond the games, fans also engage in their own reorchestrations of official tracks. In some instances, these reorchestrations are performed in costume and posted online for other fans to see. My argument here also incorporates the success of this genre of fan performance, and how both the actors and actresses within these works are able to bring that virtual, pseudo medieval world into our own natural world. Fans respond positively to both the theming of these videos and to the reimagining of tracks from the games of their childhood. These performances, and their positive reception amongst fans, add a sense of realism to the otherwise imaginary environments created in this sword and sorcery series of videogames.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Arctic is warming at a rate twice that of other global ecosystems and changing climate conditions in the Arctic are mobilizing long frozen permafrost stores of organic carbon. In regions of extensive ground ice, thawing permafrost can cause land subsidence, and the creation of thermokarst features. The Peel Plateau, Northwest Territories, Canada has extensive thermokarst features exposing early Holocene age paleo-thaw layers and Pleistocene age glaciogenic material deposited by the Laurentide Ice Sheet. This study aimed to see if unique permafrost thermokarst inputs could be readily observed in streams across six diverse thermokarst features via optical and ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry. Samples from within thermokarst slump features, and downstream of thermokarst inputs exhibited higher dissolved organic carbon concentrations and lower aromaticity as evidenced by optical parameters (e.g. declining SUVA254, increasing S275-295) and FT-ICR MS metrics (e.g. lower AImod and nominal oxidation state of carbon) versus upstream of thermokarst inputs. Increases in the relative abundances of assigned heteroatomic molecular formulae (e.g. CHON, CHOS, CHONS) were also greater within and downstream of thermokarst features. The unique molecular formulae present in permafrost thermokarst inputs were determined (n=1,844) and subsequently tracked downstream. These permafrost marker formulae were enriched in aliphatics and H/C as well as heteroatoms and exhibited low aromaticity. A portion of the unique molecular signatures persisted downstream, highlighting the potential to not only assess thermokarst inputs but also to follow these inputs and their fate downstream throughout the aquatic network. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this thesis, I argue that the Unitarian Universalist Church of Tallahassee (UUCT) creates and uses music and multimedia to create spaces of acceptance, care, and inclusion for LGBTQ+ and BIPOC members as stated in their goal to be a “Beloved Community.”   In this Beloved Community, the church has voiced its desire to create a safe and welcome space for those in disenfranchised minority groups, namely LGBTQ+ and BIPOC members. This study features analysis and examination from my nearly yearlong ethnographic research during a particular window of UUCT’s history between their re-opening after COVID-19 and the re-opening of their choir program. Along with ethnography, I use concepts and theories from Queer studies, Black studies, psychology, sociology, and musicology. Core to this study is Nathan Myrick’s “care ethics,” which underscores the meaning and influence on music in congregational worship. I use care ethics to explain the happenings on music performed in services at UUCT, as well as multimedia that is used to support UUCT’s political and inclusive goals. In this I expand Myrick’s care ethics to multimedia as well as denominations outside of Christianity. I also explore the highly nuanced and multifaceted nature of UUCT’s congregation, reflecting upon the tensions that lie under the surface of a mainly White and older community who wish to be “all-inclusive and welcoming.” In conclusion, sections of writing, photographs, and video are included to give space for my conversation partners own voices.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Despite the prevalence of mourning rituals across cultures and time, not much work focusing on the visual-material practices has been done within the field of rhetorical studies, which, up until the 1970s, focused almost entirely on the discursive. This limited scope overlooks the importance of nondiscursive expressions of sorrow. This thesis sheds light on the underserved visual-material mourning rhetorics through analysis of three different mourning photographs from the Victorian era: a daguerreotype, an ambrotype, and a silver gelatin print. The research questions guiding this inquiry include the following: first, how did photography operate as a visual expression of grief in the Victorian era, and second, how did photography function as a material expression of grief? In addressing these questions, this research uncovered the varied ways the photographs functioned rhetorically during the Victorian Era in the United States to assuage pain through visual and material strategies.  To begin, one photograph relied on visually eulogizing the deceased’s character through phrenological and physiognomic display; another invited the viewer into doubly perceiving a child in his final portrait as both alive and dead; and, finally, a third evoked Christian iconography of angels and the Madonna to portray the deceased as peacefully existing in heaven. Each palliated grief through specific configurations of image content.  Second, insights derived from an analysis of the photographs’ materiality included the unique way the mirror-like surface of a daguerreotype  reflects a mourner’s likeness alongside the image of their loved one while the small size of the photograph promoted mobile use; the ambrotype featured the haptic sensation that accompanies holding a physical object that represents a deceased loved one and thus fostered the ability  to pick up or set down the memory and pain associated with it; the silver gelatin print from 1910 crafted a familial and communal memory by emphasizing display of the departed, a materiality informed by  the universal trauma and mass death experienced in the American Civil War. Finally, the study uncovered the inextricable link between the visual and material in mourning rhetorics, illuminating the difficulty of separating the visual elements from the material elements when analyzing these photographic objects. The visual and the material features of these photographs inform and are informed by one another, providing important context, and increasing the impact of both elements.  If the two were divorced, a deceased woman would be without her name or relationship to the mourner, information provided by the note pinned to the padded case housing her photograph; a mother would be unable to hold her child’s photograph in her hands while studying a face she would otherwise never be able to look upon again; and a visually stunning image showcasing a child’s celestial journey might be overlooked as just a pretty picture of individual sorrow. Ultimately, this study illuminated the immense influence of visual-material rhetorics of mourning in the Victorian era in the United States, highlighting the importance of such rhetorics to the discipline and thus the need to expand study beyond the three images featured in this work. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Kyle-Back model for insider trading describes how insiders behave in the presence of access to privileged information. We introduce stochastic liquidity into the Kyle-Back model, allowing for times of high and low volatility like in real markets and construct and prove an equilibrium in this environment. The key insight of this work is that in the equilibrium, the price is set not based on order flow directly, but an adjusted version of such which weights trades based on the liquidity at the time of transaction. The work is extension of \cite{CDF}, which considered and answered the same extension but only in the special case of a normally distributed final asset price. We find in particular with a log-normal price distribution that the log-return up to maturity at is Gaussian for any given scenario of noise-trading volatility even though the price process itself has stochastic volatility.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Despite the growing number of international schools around the globe, little is done to support the highly mobile Third Culture Kid (TCK) populations in these schools.  While experiencing exciting lives, TCKs have difficulty developing their individual identities and sense of belonging in communities.  Problems surrounding identity and belonging can lead to depression, restlessness, and an inability to make decisions in TCKs ( Lijadi &amp; Van Schalkwyk, 2017; Nette, 2017; Polluck &amp; Van Reken, 2017).  TCKs are often withdrawn in international schools because they are dealing with loss every time they move (Fail et al. 2004). While previous research has studied adult TCKs, these issues surrounding identity occur in the elementary years.  TCKs, currently are mostly the minority in international schools due to increased interest in Western Education in host countries.  This sometimes leads to the further isolation of TCKs in schools.  This current trend is reflected in the Taiwan international school where I conducted my research.  In this qualitative study, I used interviews with and observations of international educators who had the ability to provide observations of their TCK students.  I explored how TCKs develop their sense of identity and belonging in international classrooms as well as observable traits of TCKs in the international school community.  A thematic analysis generated six themes: Multiple Influences Create Confusion Concerning Personal Identity; Family Identity Outweighs Individual Identity; Family Adaptability Affects Student Adaptability; Mature and Adaptable; Outgoing Yet Comfortable Being Independent. TCKs are unaware of how much their multiple moves have on their sense of home and identity.  As a result of the different cultural influences, they are unsure of where “home” is.  This issue is further exacerbated by different parent nationalities, minority races, and gender. Identity for elementary TCKs is usually represented superficially by sports teams, colleges, and food.  However, participants believed this was because of family preferences rather than ones from individual students. Participants also explored the fact that a TCKs comfortability in the classroom is directly related to the family’s ability to adapt to their new community.  Some families have more supports than others due to the parent’s jobs, while some are left to navigate their new community on their own.  Participants believe that TCKs are comfortable navigating new situations and have a better developed global perspective than their monoculture peers.  This causes TCKs to often be more mature than their peers and leads them to seek out validation and acceptance from adults.  Participants also observed that TCKs are outgoing and can work with any of their peers.  While they are personable, they tend to stay removed from their peers and often prefer individual activities.  Participants perceive this to be a result of having to leave friends behind in the past or taking their time to figure out a new school culture.  </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>     Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major public health challenge and the leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Atherosclerosis, a primary underlying cause of CVD, results from oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, and excess low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) accumulation. Dietary patterns with regular fruit and vegetable consumption are associated with multiple health advantages, including cardiovascular benefits. Foods high in phytonutrients and fiber have been associated with improving chronic inflammation, vascular function, and circulating cholesterol levels. Prunes (dried plums, Prunus domestica L.) are a nutritious food with bioactive components such as polyphenolic compounds and soluble fiber, which are associated with improved cardiovascular health.      The purpose of this study was to investigate the cardioprotective effects of prune supplementation and determine the extent to which daily consumption influences blood lipids, oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, and vascular function in aging men. Sixty-two healthy men aged 55 to 80 years old, with moderate bone loss, were included in the parent study. Participants were randomized into one of three treatment groups: 100g/day prune, 50g/day prune, or control (no prunes) and consumed a daily multivitamin containing 450mg calcium and 800 IU vitamin D3. Data were collected at baseline, 3-month, and 6-month timepoints and included fasting blood draw, anthropometrics, 3-day food log, physical activity questionnaire, and DXA scan preformed to measure bone mineral density. Data and blood samples from 56 participants were included in the current study, per protocol. Serum samples were analyzed for lipid concentrations including total cholesterol (TC), low and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c, VLDL-c), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), and TC-HDL ratio. Plasma samples were analyzed for lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH), a biomarker of oxidative stress, and proinflammatory biomarkers high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α).
	With 6 months of daily prune consumption, no significant changes were observed in TC, LDL-c, non-HDL-c, or TC-HDL ratio. Significant increases were observed for HDL-c from 3-month to 6-month timepoints (P=0.015), in all groups. Both VLDL-c and TG increased significantly (P=0.003) with 50g prune dose at 6 months, compared to baseline. No significant changes in CRP or TNF-α were observed. LOOH levels significantly improved with 50g dose at 3 months and 100g dose at 6 months, each compared to baseline. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was improved at 3 months, compared to baseline, in all groups; however, no significant improvements were seen in SBP with either 50g or 100g prune dose. Findings from this study suggest that daily consumption of 50g to 100g of prunes for a period of 6 months does not significantly influence cardiovascular risk factors in healthy aging men, compared to control.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Intervertebral disc degeneration involves breakdown of the discs of the spine due to genetics, ageing or faulty mechanical loading. As part of the progression of the disease, nucleus 
pulposus cells lose their phenotypic characteristics, inducing inflammation and extracellular 
matrix alterations. Disc homeostasis is critical for normal disc function and understanding the 
mechanisms of homeostasis will aid in the development of new approaches for the treatment of 
degenerative discs. This homeostasis is controlled by resident cells, which sense and respond to 
mechanical cues that influence tissue remodeling and maintenance. Fibronectin is one extracellular 
matrix molecule that has been shown to be upregulated in disc degeneration and plays an important 
role in the progression of a variety of fibrotic diseases. Fragments of fibronectin have also long 
been associated with both osteoarthritis and disc degeneration. Thus, fibronectin is a potential 
regulator of disc degeneration, and potential target for treating disc degeneration at the cellular and 
molecular level. The goal of this work was to test the effects of fibronectin on disc cell phenotype, 
mechanosensing, and inflammatory signaling. We identify that fibronectin increases the activation 
of cellular contractility, the mechanosensitive transcription factor YAP, and the inflammatory 
transcription factor NF-κB. This results in decreased production and expression of proteoglycans, 
which are required to maintain healthy disc function. Understanding the role of fibronectin, and 
its potential as a therapeutic target, could provide new approaches for preventing or reversing disc 
degeneration.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This dissertation investigated teachers’ perception and use of culturally relevant teaching by exploring how teachers define and incorporate it into their classrooms. Many researchers in education have explored the benefits of using culturally relevant teaching within the classroom to enhance student learning. Researchers have found that the greatest impact on student academic success happens when teachers activate and utilize a student's shallow and deep levels of culture. However, not much research has been done regarding how teachers perceive and incorporate culturally relevant teaching within their classrooms. This work contributes to the literature on culturally relevant pedagogy by exploring teachers’ views and uses of culturally relevant teaching within their own classrooms. Data comes from in-depth interviews with eight elementary teachers serving in schools with high populations of historically marginalized groups of students. Transcripts of teacher interviews were analyzed using two coding cycles in which a priori coding and open coding took place.
The findings reveal that teachers have a positive view and strong understanding of being culturally relevant educators. Teachers saw culturally relevant teaching as a best practice to be implemented within their classroom that has many benefits to its use with students. Teachers expressed their desire to receive additional training centered around culturally relevant teaching.
The findings also showed that when teachers spoke on how culturally relevant teaching is implemented within their classrooms, they did so by expressing how they activate students' shallow and deep levels of culture. Teachers stressed the importance of building safe environments and relationships with students by employing culturally relevant teaching to learn about student beliefs, home life, and culture. Very few examples of culturally relevant teaching are mentioned at the surface level of culture. Most mentions, in fact, that were surface-level culture were only in the process of saying that culturally relevant teaching is much deeper than holidays, music, and appearance.

            <DISS_para>The $\eta \pi$ decay channel is one of the ``golden channels'' to search for the $\pi_1$ and other spin-exotic mesons. These exotic states show up as odd partial waves in the decay of the $\eta\pi$ system. Searching for this resonance requires a detailed understanding of the nearby $a_2(1320)$ meson and necessitates a characterization of the double Reggeon exchange process that can mimic exotic signatures. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The first measurement of the differential photoproduction cross section, $d\sigma/dt$, of the $a_2(1320)$ meson at photon beam energies of $8.2-8.8$\,GeV and in the four-momentum transfer range of 0.1 to 1.0\,GeV$^2$ is performed. A full partial wave analysis is performed in the $\eta\pi^0$ invariant mass region around 1.3\,GeV$/c^2$ using amplitudes that depend on the polarization of the incoming photon beam, which allows us to separate the contributions of natural and unnatural parity exchange to the differential cross section. The partial wave analysis suggests that the $a_2(1320)$ is produced predominantly through natural exchange with total cross-section [WAITING FOR RESULT] over the measured interval.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Additionally, an analysis will be presented of the $\gamma p \to \eta \pi^0 p$ reaction beyond the resonance region, ($M(\eta\pi) &gt; 1.6$~GeV). As input for the development of models to describe polarized photoproduction in this mass range at GlueX energies, we measure the $\Sigma$ beam asymmetry for individual $\eta$ and $\pi$ mesons for the above reaction, $\Sigma_\eta$ and $\Sigma_\pi$, as functions of several kinematic variables. These results suggest that baryon production can contribute significantly to the asymmetries. A comparison is made to measurements from $\gamma p \to \eta \pi^-\Delta^{++}$.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This qualitative exploratory case study examines how low-income, Black boys, who are eligible for accelerated curricular courses at Amos P. Godby High School, decide to pursue or to not pursue accelerated coursework. The research considers what role school climate and academic self-efficacy play in that decision-making process. While there is research that examines how academic self-efficacy is associated with academic performance for Black boys, and studies that investigate the effects of the teacher-student interaction on the performance levels of Black students, there is very little research that investigates how school personnel, parental figures, and the students’ belief in their ability connect to the decision-making process from the perspective of course-eligible, low-income Black boys.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this paper was to examine the qualities of effective string orchestra teachers. The research questions for this study were (1) What are undergraduate music students’ perceptions of the demonstrated qualities and behaviors of string orchestra teachers? (2) Is there a significant difference in perceptions of demonstrated qualities and behaviors between males and females? (3) Is there a significant difference in perceptions of demonstrated qualities and behaviors between music education and non-music education majors?Before commencing the study, a review of literature was completed as a foundation. The review of literature highlights qualities and behaviors of effective teachers, perceptions of qualities of effective teachers, music-specific qualities of effective music teachers, as well as problems in string music education and music education overall. After a need for the study was established via this literature review, the present study began. A Qualtrics survey was sent out via convenience and snowball sampling to music education and non-music education music major undergraduate students. Due to the nature of this distribution method, a return rate could not be calculated. They had to rate the degree to which they observed nineteen specific qualities of effective teaching in five different video episodes.
Results from the web-based survey suggested that undergraduate music students can identify and evaluate traits of effective music teachers. No significant differences were found between ratings of non-music education students and music education students, suggesting that teacher training is not required to be able to perceive effective teaching qualities. However, some significant differences were found between ratings of males and females. The qualities for which there were significant differences included: 1) maintains a pleasant affect; 2) demonstrates knowledge of subject matter; 3) gives clear directions, 4) motivates students well, 5) manages
student behaviors, and 6) maintains a high energy level. In each of these cases, the female ratings on average were higher than the male ratings.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This study aims to examine the impact of AI on advanced manufacturing (AM) workforce. Recent progress in AI technology is at the core of AM as AI includes different technologies that will lead to the digitization of factories. While AI promises to revolutionize the field AM, little is known about how ready the AM workforce may be to make best use of AI and how best AM technicians can be readied for a career that is infused with AI. Therefore, in this research, not only I explored the AM workforce’s readiness, as expressed though industry competencies, to use AI, but also examined the areas in which AI will affect the AM workforce’s competencies, skills, and knowledge.This research applied sequential explanatory mixed-method study in which quantitative data results are considered in a qualitative phase. First, I collected and analyzed the quantitative data using natural language processing (NLP). I applied NLP to extract and compare noun, verbs, and verb-noun pairs in AI patents and the Advanced Manufacturing Competency Model.
The second, qualitative, phase builds on the first, quantitative phase, and the two phases are connected in the intermediate stage in the study. For qualitative phase, expert panel review was done by conducting focus group interview.
My study found that while the AI patents and the Advanced Manufacturing Competency Model do not completely topically overlap, they do reflect each other in some of the key areas such as data, device, information, and system. Also, AI technology has the potential to perform certain activities related to identify, process, and control in the field of AM industry.
Moreover, AI technology functions overlap with a significant proportion of, academic competencies, workplace competencies, and industry competencies, with 76%, 70%, and 93% respectively. The results of this study suggest the potential for AI to perform competencies in various domains does not necessarily mean that AI will replace, enhance, or collaborate with humans. The integration of AI in these domains will require careful consideration of the roles of
both AI and human workers to optimize process efficiency and quality. The study also has implications for research, practice (Library and Information Science Curriculum), and industry.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The objective of this treatise is to outline principles of organ pedagogy for a self-taught organist like myself. This treatise discusses two pedagogical approaches and techniques, by two prominent organists and organ pedagogues, John Stainer (1840-1901) and David Sanger (1947-2010). Through this study I examine the values of particular pedagogical approaches while also noting the challenges that a self-taught organist faced historically and in our own time. I grew up in the church as a choir boy and I have always been fascinated by the sound of the organ. I began learning the piano in high school and soon after start exploring the organ. I attended organ recitals and performances to observe and learn from experienced organists and with dedication, patience, and persistence I gradually improve my skills and became a confident organist. The first chapter outlines the history of learning the organ with a published tutor, but without a teacher. It is clear that this was common practice in the nineteenth century because the instructions within the most successful text, John Stainer’s, The Organ (1877), suggest that no additional tutelage was provided or necessarily needed.
In the second chapter, I examine the Sanger method and the repertoire associated with it in comparison with the Stainer method and discuss what remained the same in organ study across more than a century and what was removed, altered, or presented anew in Sanger’s method.
The third chapter discusses the Three Impromptus for Organ of Samuel Coleridge-Taylor from the perspective of studying the pieces as a self-taught organist. Through this study I reflect on the publications of Stainer and Sanger and note the decisions that have to be taken and the skills that need to be understood and mastered in order to perform them successfully.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation examines the ways mythology, folklore, and regional heritage were mobilized to resist or protest the French Revolution. I argue that folklore and local heritage played a significant role in the way French citizens experienced and processed the Revolution. Examining counterrevolutionary legends and folkloric figures facilitates insight into the diversity and complexity of ideology that existed within the counterrevolution. The research begins with analysis of the Bourbon monarchy. So integral to the counterrevolution, the Bourbons were transformed into pseudo-folk heroes and mythical entities all their own from the outbreak of Revolution and during the Restoration.  While many counterrevolutionaries lamented the losses caused by the Revolution, new and region-defining traditions grew out of the discontent. Case studies from Besançon and the Vendée demonstrate that local culture and heritage greatly influenced counterrevolutionary expression, at times reinventing old traditions, and at others creating something entirely fresh. In Besançon, the celebration the nativity became a medium for counterrevolutionary grievances; it was a fusion of local heritage, national politics, and religious observance. The nativity, or la crèche, proved to be meddlesome for revolutionary authorities and manifested repeatedly in Besançon throughout the 1790s across mediums. In the Vendée, folkloric figures rose from the ashes of the wars of the 1790s; the legends and symbols from the Vendée war persisted, fueling industry and heritage tourism. This research traces the creation and evolution of folklore of the civil war in the Vendée. “Tales of the Counterrevolution” concludes with the bombastic example of Puy du Fou, a curious adventure park in the Vendée that has brought age-old impassioned debates over the past centerstage. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Yearly, millions of children are diagnosed with mental health conditions. However, as the need for age-appropriate interventions and mental health services increases, the amount of available and accessible resources for families has failed to meet the growing demand. This study evaluated an intervention program developed to help address this deficit and provide children and their caregivers with a developmentally appropriate intervention targeted at improving well-being over time. A Friend in Me: A Self-Compassion Training for Children and their Caregivers is based on the trademark Mindful Self-Compassion program developed by Kristin Neff, Ph.D., and Christopher K. Germer, Ph.D., but focuses on children in middle childhood, ages 7 to 12. Until now, there has been little research on the impact of self-compassion training with children in this age group. However, preliminary evidence from research on adolescents suggests that intervention programs that include mindfulness and self-compassion have a significant positive impact on long-term prevention of adverse child outcomes and on children’s abilities to regulate and speak about their emotions. The present study utilized a mixed-methods embedded design where quantitative data were collected and analyzed at two time points, pre-test and post-test and qualitative data were collected and analyzed once following the completion of the Friend in Me intervention. This design was implemented to gather a deeper understanding of participants’ perspectives on program feasibility and acceptability, and to help examine the intervention outcomes shown in the quantitative data collection. Quantitative results indicated statistically significant increases in children’s levels of self-compassion and in positive parent reports of parent-child relationship quality; all other variables did not show statistically significant results from pre to post-test. Additionally, attendance and retention data were analyzed. Findings indicated that the Friend in Me intervention was a feasible and acceptable training program for children in middle childhood and their caregivers. Qualitative results also highlighted five themes for feasibility and acceptability, 1) training need, 2) favorite elements of the training, 3) enhanced understanding of the concepts, 4) self-compassion implemented in daily life, and 5) suggestions for change. Qualitative results also found two overarching themes representing participant’s experiences which were defined as 1) mutual learning and 2) increased positive perceptions of parent-child relationship quality. Quantitative and qualitative results were analyzed together to generate deeper insights to inform future studies more fully. Feasibility studies are a crucial step in determining whether a larger more controlled intervention study to test for efficacy is justified. Additionally, feasibility studies help refine the research design and intervention protocol. Findings from the current feasibility study indicated promising results that the Friend in Me intervention should be further explored in a larger controlled study to gain more information on how this intervention compares to basic mindfulness training and other social-emotional learning intervention programs. Moreover, the study results ultimately highlighted a resource available to children and their caregivers who may be struggling to find available and accessible help when it comes to managing and learning more about mental health in this age group. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Canine distemper virus (CDV), similar to the human measles virus, is an extremely contagious virus that can cause outbreaks in dense canine populations. Previous models showed an outbreak of CDV in animal shelters can prevent or reduce outbreaks by euthanizing animals at a high rate and testing the population frequently. This dissertation was motivated by previous models to show that quarantining dogs, implementing a foster system, distancing, and euthanizing, when necessary, can also reduce outbreaks in animal shelters. The spread of CDV  was modeled by a system of ordinary differential equations through susceptible adults, susceptible juveniles, vaccinated, exposed, infected, quarantined, and recovered classes. Our model focuses on various optimal control strategies to prevent disease spread.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Exploring the relationship between undergraduate students and student services practitioners is nuanced. By using Twitter as a platform, tool, and community, this dissertation explored this relationship. Previous research has indicated that social media and higher education have been explored broadly, however, relationships between two groups of users—specifically undergraduate students and student services practitioners—on one platform (such as Twitter) has not been significantly explored. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to examine undergraduate students and student services practitioners’ relationship through Twitter. Utilizing case study as a qualitative research design, the study explored undergraduate students and student services practitioners from four institutions and the data was analyzed by within-case and cross-case analysis. Chapter 1 introduced the study and set the foundation for Twitter. Chapter 2 provided an overview of the literature and introduced the conceptual framework. Chapter 3 described the methodology. Chapter 4 presented an overview of each case as an institution and an update on Twitter. Chapters 5 – 8 detailed the findings within each case while Chapter 9 highlighted cross-case findings. Chapter 10 discussed the findings, made connections back to the previous literature, reimagined the framework, addressed limitations, and provided recommendations. The study narrowed the scope of a large meta concept and added to what we know about Twitter and its unique idiosyncrasies, how student services practitioners use Twitter, and how students perceive their usage. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Rising income inequality, generally defined as the unequal dispersion of income between individuals or households, has been labeled one of the grandest challenges of our time and among the most pernicious threats to society. It has been linked to numerous institutional degradations, negative community externalities, and adverse individual outcomes. However, little-to-no research examines the potential psychological effects of income inequality on entrepreneurs, including how contextual variables shape these effects and impact entrepreneurs’ propensities to launch new ventures.This dissertation addresses these gaps utilizing econometric, psychometric, and experimental methodologies in the following three ways. First, because local determinants of startup formation are becoming an increasingly important area of focus among entrepreneurship scholars, I examine the effects of income inequality and household median income levels on startup formation in U.S. counties. Second, using a nationally representative sample of nascent entrepreneurs in the U.S., I investigate the individual-level constructs that help to explain how or why income inequality influences individual-level entrepreneurial beliefs, actions, and results. I argue that economic inequality likely influences entrepreneurial expectancy (beliefs), entrepreneurial actions, and startup formation, but also suggest that these effects likely depend on the entrepreneurs’ household income. Third, I probe another individual variable that might influence how entrepreneurs perceive and react to income inequality. Specifically, entrepreneurs vary in their social comparison orientation, which refers to their propensities to evaluate themselves in relation to others. The final essay uses an experimental methodology to examine the combined influences of income inequality, household income, and social comparison orientation on entrepreneurs’ expectancy beliefs.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>RE-Ba2Cu3O7−δ (REBCO, RE = rare earth) coated conductors are a promising conductor for the future of high field magnets, next generation electric machines, and power transmission. Over the years manufacturing improvements have led to a strong, ready to wind conductor capable of maintaining high current densities in magnetic fields exceeding 25 T. However, manufacturing can still produce lengthwise variations in the critical current, Ic, sometimes producing significant drops in Ic. Conductor operation can exacerbate these flaws and introduce new defects leading to performance degradation. Ensuring conductor robustness and reliability is fundamental in ensuring long term performance of magnets and electric machines. One way to mitigate the impact of these defects is by using superconducting cables instead of single conductors. Superconducting cables enable current sharing, providing alternative current pathways and allowing the current to bypass Ic dropouts, minimizing the risk of superconductor burnout.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Conductor on Round Core (CORC®) cables are comprised of multiple layers of helically wound REBCO tapes, resulting in a highly flexible cable. However, this might lead to a high contact resistance, Rc, as the contact between tapes is limited to discrete crossovers, which can have a significant impact on current sharing and current distribution in CORC® cables. Special CORC® cables were manufactured to investigate the impact of different winding parameters on Rc¬. Variations included winding with different lubricants, winding from pre-tinned tapes, and a short heat treatment to melt the solder. Rc was measured for both straight samples and samples bent to a 10 cm diameter. A large variation in Rc was observed for the straight samples ranging from 1 to over 1000 µΩ·cm2, depending on winding parameters. The control cables, representing a typical CORC® cable, produced the largest Rc. Bending the cables to a 10 cm diameter reduced the coefficient of variation by up to 80%. Rc was 3 orders of magnitude smaller in the cables wound from tinned tapes. A heat treatment to melt the solder produced only a small reduction in Rc. In the control cable the measured Rc corresponds to a current transfer length on the order of tens of centimeters compared to a few millimeters in the soldered cable. Microscopy revealed a hooked substrate at the edge of the tapes preventing good contact between tape layers. In the tinned cable, the solder fills in any asperities in the tape surface, creating a much more uniform contact between tapes. Cross sectional images showed only a few regions of good contact in the control cable compared to near perfect contact in the cable wound from tinned tapes.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Special two tape CORC® cables, one tape per layer, were constructed to examine how Rc impacts current redistribution around local defects. Three different cables, each containing a 100% Ic drop halfway along its length, were measured: Cu cable (wound from regular REBCO tapes), PbSn cable (wound from tinned tapes), and a soldered cable (the PbSn cable following a heat treatment to melt the solder). The ends of each cable were unwound and shunt resistors measured the current into and out of each tape. An array of z-axis Hall sensors, which could be positioned at any location along the length of the cable, monitored changes in the self-field due to current redistribution. A clear shift in Hall polarity occurs at the defect location, with Hall sensors producing a positive voltage upstream of the defect and a negative voltage downstream of the defect. As the current transfers around the defect a normal zone is initiated in the “good” tape. In the Cu and PbSn cables, voltage taps reveal that the normal zone is confined to the “good” tape, while the “bad” tape remains superconducting. The decreased Rc in the soldered cable promotes better current sharing, resulting in the normal zone spreading in both tapes. A stable normal zone can persist even at currents above Ic and depending on Rc, a severe Ic drop can cause significant power dissipation, 590 mW at 60 A in the Cu cable. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Similar measurement techniques were employed to investigate the impact of current sharing on cables that permit current transfer around Ic drops to cables with insulation between tape layers, disabling current sharing. The onset of current sharing is marked by a change in slope of the Hall sensors which increases in magnitude near the defect. The presence of a single defect can impact current distribution up to 35 cm away. In general no slope change is observed in the insulated cables. However, near one of the defects a small slope change was observed. Cable deconstruction revealed a severe burn that melted insulation and permitted some localized current transfer in that region. The onset of a quench is marked by a jump in the Hall voltages. During a quench, Hall sensors revealed a 4 cm region of active current redistribution near the defect. Cable performance depends both on the number of defects, and the ability to redistribute current around those defects.  Increasing the number of defects from 1 to 2 decreases cable Ic by 50 A. Adding insulation between the layers, preventing current sharing around a single defect, had nearly the same effect as doubling the number of defects. Additionally, the insulated cables were never driven above Ic, yet the temperature near the defect was hot enough to melt the insulation. Whereas the other cables were quench dozens of times with no noticeable degradation. These experiments have demonstrated that Rc can have a significant impact on power dissipation and that current sharing is essential for robust cable performance. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The study presents insight into the self-efficacy of students scoring below proficiency on their state-mandated assessments when participating in various teaching pedagogies. Self-efficacy is often lacking among students scoring below proficiency due to burnout or a lack of desire to excel from not engaging in academic success (Usher et al., 2019). With the rising emphasis on academic achievement scores, educational systems are shifting to a procedural-based structure to accommodate this focus. The two teaching methodologies explored in this study were procedural and conceptual-based learning. The teacher-led procedural instructional style often utilizes worksheets, independent assignments, or textbooks. Conceptual-based learning anchors on student-led instruction that is collaborative, apply real-world scenarios and is exploratory. The research began with identifying the participants of students who were not proficient on their third and fourth-grade state-mandated assessments and did not qualify for special education services. Three data sources provided a holistic perspective of these students: classroom observations, interviews, and reflective writings. Data collections were conducted sequentially to ensure discussion did not sway the participants' classroom behavior. The results displayed those students had vastly different self-efficacy when participating in procedural and conceptual lessons. All three data sources supported the students’ self-efficacy when participating the conceptual-based learning. The small sample size and the COVID-19 pandemic could limit the design. These results hope to bring awareness to educational stakeholders of the students’ self-efficacy and strategies to enhance academic performance. Future research may investigate the self-efficacy differences between students who score proficient and those that do not.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the United States saw drastic shifts in the life of the nation, particularly with reforms centered on and affected by women. This project asserts that throughout this period, women in particular used the image of the angel of the house as the impetus to step out of the home, first into society and later into the political sphere, and so transformed maternity into a political identity. Each chapter explores a distinct iteration of this identity and examines theatrical depictions of each to determine how maternal identity shifts as the ends for which it is leveraged change. Chapter one examines what I have identified as the salvific mother, an iteration of maternal identity which came about as progressive reform surrounding the issue of poverty swept the nation. Within this identity, women leveraged the nineteenth-century notion that mothers were the moral center of the home to argue that they could also be the moral center of the nation. Chapter two explores the iteration of the maternal feminist, an identity that formed as women pushed to formalize their role as moral center of the nation in the voting booth. Chapter three then turns to the warrior mother identity, which saw Black female dramatists deploying the notion of mothers as the moral center of the nation for the dual purposes of asserting Black humanity and dignity in front of white audiences and forging African American identity. Each of these distinct ways of construing and constructing maternity reveals the fact that motherhood is an important aspect of women’s studies and that our understanding of American history is incomplete without an understanding of the evolution of maternity.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation examines the work of three white, male, liberal singer/songwriters during the Donald J. Trump administration period: Colin Meloy (lead singer and songwriter of The Decemberists), Chris Thile (lead singer and songwriter of Punch Brothers), and Sufjan Stevens through analyses of their 2015 albums and the music which they released while Trump was President. Each of these artists has progressive musical and political ideas, which are largely supported by their audiences. I focus especially on the studio albums each musician released in 2015, the year which directly preceded the 2016 Presidential Election, and the studio albums which they released during Trump’s presidency (2017-2021). In 2015, The Decemberists released What a Terrible World, What a Beautiful World, the Punch Brothers released The Phosphorescent Blues, and Sufjan Stevens released Carrie &amp; Lowell. The studio albums I focus on from the Trump period include I’ll Be Your Girl (2018) by The Decemberists, All Ashore (2018) by Punch Brothers, and The Ascension (2020) by Sufjan Stevens.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The shift in their studio albums from 2015 into the Trump administration period was ideological – a move from observing the nostalgic past to plunging into the crisis of the present – but it was also sonic. I argue that these musicians functioned in a similar way to the flâneurs Charles Baudelaire introduced as a concept in nineteenth-century Paris; these are men who move freely between actual physical places and figurative discourse spaces due to their privilege and education, but at the same time occupy a liminal position in these settings. When Meloy, Thile, and Stevens released albums in 2015, they already occupied a position of influence in the lives of their admirers, yet, at the advent of the Trump era, they had to reassess what their music stood for and how clear a position they should take in modern discourse surrounding politics. Ultimately, each singer/songwriter addressed their political concerns during the Trump administration, but moved on to other projects somewhat quickly after the political protest albums were completed. The mobility with which each musician transitioned to new projects after such politically engaged songwriting reveals his privilege and freedom in society, a concept which can be applied to many other songwriters within and beyond Meloy, Thile, and Stevens’ circles during the same time period.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Although the United States had a rich musical culture prior to the 19th century, the first permanent symphony orchestras were not formed until the mid-1800’s when an influx of German immigrants prompted the establishment of ensembles and festivals in cities across the country. Concurrently, the United States shifted from individual entrepreneurialism to corporate ideals. World War I further impacted the sound of American orchestras as repertoire shifted from largely Austro-German to French, Russian, and American compositions. Additionally, technological advancements such as the radio and television increased the symphony orchestra’s popularity. These same advancements brought about new genres of music, and in the 1970s, the symphony orchestra’s popularity saw a decline. Today, orchestras can still be found throughout the United States, with larger ensembles in more densely populated areas such as Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Los Angeles. Musicians are typically appointed to these orchestras through a lengthy audition process. Prior to any demonstration of skill, candidates are often required to submit materials such as a resume, references, or even a prescreen recording. Only after the submissions are reviewed will a musician be invited to the live audition. Larger orchestras will often use multiple rounds of playing, sometimes over several days, to reduce the plentiful number of applicants. Many auditions are also blind or screened, meaning the panel of judges are unable to see the players in an effort to reduce biases or favoritism towards different genders, minorities, or person.
When the day of the audition begins, each musician is asked to play a series of short excerpts from a predetermined list distributed prior to the audition, which consists of sections from famous symphonies, solos, and/or chamber works. Musicians will spend weeks, if not months, preparing hours of repertoire for a 10 or 15 minutes time slot in front of the judges. 
Every oboist studies a list of “standard excerpts” which consists of those pieces most often found on auditions lists. However, there is little to no research regarding the origin of these lists. In the forward to his book, Orchestra Excerpts for Oboe, John Ferrillo discusses his experiences as an auditionee, taking 23 orchestral auditions before being offered a job. Although not discussed outright, it is safe to assume he compiled this list based on his plethora of experiences. There is, however, no literature regarding exactly how orchestras compile these lists of excerpts, yet many of them contain the same materials. 
Furthermore, auditions today will often specify the solo work as Mozart’s Oboe Concerto in C Major, K. 314. This concerto, while most-likely written in 1777, was lost for almost 150 years. It was only discovered in 1920 by Bernhard Paumgartner, who then published a version in 1948 based on the discovered manuscript.  This indicates that there is over a century worth of oboists in professional orchestra positions who never played the Mozart concerto.
This modern system developed as a result of different social, political, and economic conditions. The purpose of this project is to identify the development of audition repertoire, etiquette, and protocols through a variety of sources, including previous audition announcements, historic and current news articles, interviews, and publications, to formulate a coherent idea of how auditions worked prior to the modern 21st century system. It is meant to be a valuable resource for undergraduates or those entering the audition circuit by identifying  standard procedures and how they are effected by current events.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This project focuses on two Haitian narratives that risk being forgotten and consigned to oblivion. Both occurred during the rise to power of François Duvalier, specifically in the confusion of the 1957 Provisional Governments and their aftermath. The first narrative concerns the massacre of Daniel Fignolé’s supporters in the slums of Port-au-Prince immediately after his forced removal from the Provisional Presidency, which effectively ousted him from the upcoming presidential elections. Among the poorest Haitian constituencies, the Fignolistes saw their hopes for a democratic voice and distributive justice disappear. They were brutally and permanently eliminated by Duvalier partisans in the army within two days after Fignolé’s involuntary exile. I analyze the deceptive narratives that were circulated to media outlets across the world when the massacre took place. Thus, although there were many accounts of what had happened, these accounts were largely inaccurate and ignored. The second narrative left almost no trace in the public sphere. Yvonne Hakim Rimpel, a Haitian journalist of Lebanese background, challenged the fraudulent conditions surrounding Duvalier’s election, and was the first female victim of Duvalier’s vanguard. Sexually assaulted by his hooded cagoulards before the ‘Tonton Macoutes’ militia was created, Rimpel was forced to disavow that her rapists were connected to the Duvalier regime. Until now, there has been very little effort to retrieve these historical narratives, but we are fortunate to have a novel, Femmes au temps des carnassiers (Women in the Time of Predators) by Marie-Célie Agnant with a protagonist based on the persona of Yvonne Hakim Rimpel. The elision of literary writing and history becomes a way to retrieve a narrative that has otherwise left very few archival traces. 
In my dissertation, De Profundis: Screams from the Historical Sublime in Two Haitian Narratives, I have argued that the memory work we dedicate to preventing such narratives being forgotten affects us in the present, as well. An ethics of attention saves us from moral disengagement and connects us to Hayden White’s understanding of the ‘practical past.’ We are not disinterested parties, but are rather stakeholders in the constructed rhetoric of historical representation. The historical sublime is never a coherent and meaningful ‘sublime object’ to be observed or discovered sui generis. We create the epistemological ground that emerges from our own constructions of historical discourse. The sublime spectacle is always overdetermined, with the corollary that our hermeneutic efforts entail complexity. This expectation of historical complexity, this understanding that meaning emerges only after we create it, encourages us to interrogate the broadest conditions of possibility for two Haitian narratives that deserve our attention.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Reading scores have not made a significant shift since the 1990’s when national and state standardized assessments initially tested grade level reading comprehension (National Center for Education Statistics [NCES], n.d. &amp; Florida Department of Education [FLDOE], n.d.). In addition, when analyzing subgroups, economically disadvantaged students have been performing lower than their non-economically disadvantaged students on reading assessments creating a significant gap between the two groupings of students for decades (Coleman et al., 1966). This is still evident in both the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) and FLDOE assessment data (FLDOE, n.d.; NCES, n.d.). Throughout this study, I seek to examine the relationship between students’ participation in the Corrective Reading program and their reading comprehension growth, determined by a pre-and post-assessment that is measured by Lexile. Lexile growth is an indicator of a student’s readability or the ability to read and comprehend. Diving deeper into the data to determine additional relationships, a linear regression model is used to assess how student outcomes are similar or different between male and female students, as well as White, Black, Hispanic and other race/ethnicities populations. Within this outcome model, understanding how Corrective Reading has influenced reading comprehension growth allows for a district to determine value and relevance of a program, specific to our most vulnerable student populations within Title 1 schools.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The focus on decreasing student stress in academic settings is an international concern. With insight into student perspectives of what creates stress for them in an academic setting, teachers, administrators, and county personnel can better design classroom activities with the intention of lowering classroom stress. Because professional environments incorporate both cooperative teams as well as competition among employees, students are required to have experience with both to prepare them for future success. Since some students may feel more stress in a competitive classroom activity and others may feel more stress when working with peers, understanding the student perspective of how they perceive each type of environment as stressful is beneficial for dictation instructional methods. 	This paper will describe an exploratory study of the student perspective of both competitive and cooperative activities in English Language Arts (ELA) classrooms in which students present their perspective of the stress level for each of ten ELA assignments. The group participating in the study is those students who were members of the Northview High School senior class of 2023. Of 418 seniors, 201 participants completed a survey which asked for value judgments of ten ELA assignments as to how competitive or cooperative they were as well as how much stress students felt, based on a Likert scale. This survey also included open-ended questions about ethnicity, country of origin, gender, ELA course level, and Grade Point Average (GPA). 
	Analysis of the data was performed using both SPSS, by IBM and STATA. The analysis reported the exploration of how each participant perceived each of the ten ELA activities to be cooperative or competitive, including the mean for each. Analysis continued with a similar  
analysis of how participants perceived stress associated with each activity. Next, analysis compared the cooperative/competitive response to the stress response to observe correlations. Then the analysis explored how the personal characteristics, described above as open questions on the survey, may have correlated to the judgements. Finally, a previously existing competitive/cooperative survey tool was implemented to explore each participant’s natural cooperative/competitive nature and gauge how this may have influenced their responses. 
	After analysis, specific student characteristics were found to correlate to stress levels, both for specific ELA activities, as well as for the mean stress level participants reported for all ELA activities, combined. The benefits of the exploratory study will be primarily to inform instruction and pedagogical choice. Teachers will be intentionally select ELA activities, which grading category would most help decrease student stress, and to identify students who may feel greater stress than other students so they can receive support.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>A number of groups have historically been underrepresented in the education sciences in the United States, notably students of color, students who have experienced economic hardships, first generation college students, students with disabilities, and armed service veterans. The context of this study is a program to increase the recruitment and retention of underrepresented and underserved scholars into graduate school and research careers. It is important to understand how students experience supports related to doctoral preparation at early stages in their academic careers. Individual students who have been marginalized or minoritized within an oppressive sociocultural context may possess embodied experiences or knowledge that may inform their program of research and inform their analytic lens as researchers. I explored scholar agency within a unique research training program for undergraduate upperclassmen and beginning master’s students in education related fields of study that is designed to build research efficacy and sustain commitment to social justice by embedding research experiences in a service-learning context.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study explored researcher identity development within a research training program, known as Partners United for Research Pathways Oriented to Social Justice in Education (PURPOSE), that had the distal goal of increasing the diversity of the doctorate in education sciences and promoting equity-driven research. During the yearlong training program, fellows worked with the one-on-one support of a faculty mentor to design and implement a research project during a summer service-learning research practicum. Fellows applied their developing research methods knowledge and skills in a community setting. The PURPOSE program partnered with the local Children’s Defense Fund (CDF) Freedom Schools program, a summer literacy and social action camp, which provided a site for research fellows to engage in service and to conduct research.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The central phenomenon of this study was fellows’ researcher identity development in the context of the Freedom Schools service-learning research practicum. The primary research question corresponding to this central phenomenon was: How do Black and Latina/o students conceptualize their researcher identity development after participating in a service-learning research practicum at the CDF Freedom Schools? The sub-questions were:</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A.	How did students experience balancing the implementation of research and service in the in Freedom Schools? B.	How did a service-learning research practicum at the Freedom Schools support students’ researcher identity development?
C.	What meaning did students assign to the Freedom Schools service-learning research practicum for their story as a researcher? </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>I used a phenomenological design to investigate the central phenomenon. Phenomenological designs allow researchers to understand the essence of a phenomenon through the lens of participants’ experiences. In the years corresponding to fellow eligibility for participation in this study, PURPOSE fellows identified as Black (75%) and/or Latina/o (12.5%). I recruited nine former PURPOSE fellows from the first two program cohorts. The data sources in this study included archival and new data from former fellows several (3-4) years after completing the fellowship. The archival data source used in this study was an interview conducted at the end of the PURPOSE fellowship experience. The new data sources included two one-hour interviews with participants. One interview focused on beliefs about research identity and background research and service experiences and stimulated recall around excerpts from the archival data sources. The second interview focused on experiences conducting research and serving in the Freedom Schools context. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>I present findings in the form of individual case stories for each participant that illustrate their researcher identity development before, during and after PURPOSE. Themes derived from axial coding are aligned with the three research questions. The first research question explored how participants experienced the PURPOSE program requirements of conducting research and serving stakeholders in the Freedom Schools context. Participants in this study described subtle balance between research and service in Freedom Schools, characterized by an integration of service with research. All participants emphasized the importance of building relationships with stakeholders in order to successfully complete research. Building relationships also supported service in the Freedom Schools context.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The second research question explored how the service-learning research practicum in the Freedom Schools supported (or not) participants’ researcher identity development. First, most fellows identified as insiders within the Freedom Schools context, supporting their ability to navigate the context to serve and do research. For some fellows, identifying as an insider felt natural because of their racial identity or ties to the surrounding community. Two themes occurred across participants’ expressed beliefs about what it means to be a researcher. The themes were researcher responsibility and researchers solving problems in community or moving society forward.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The third research question explored what meaning the Freedom Schools held for participants’ stories of their own researcher development. Two major related themes emerged. The first theme, Freedom Schools Foundational to Researcher Stories, represents an entry-focused shared meaning of the Freedom Schools as foundational to their researcher stories, with several fellows using the metaphor of laying a structural foundation. The second theme, Becoming a Social Science Researcher in Freedom Schools and PURPOSE, represents an exit-focused meaning of what participants left the context with, in terms of identity development.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Taken together, these themes interact to explain how participants conceptualized their researcher identity development after participating in a service-learning research practicum at the CDF Freedom Schools. Participants in this study all made the decision to set their PURPOSE research projects in the context of the Freedom Schools summer camp. All of the participants in this study were highly successful at conducting the research studies they had designed only one semester earlier as well as balancing their research with service to Freedom Schools stakeholders. Showing Up was a central theme representing day to day experiences in the Freedom Schools context because without a consistent presence in the context, it is plausible that fellows would not have felt like insiders or been able to develop meaningful relationships.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In summary, I found that early career (i.e., undergraduate, n = 1, and graduate, n = 8) researchers leaned into the transformative context of the Freedom Schools to grow in their practice as responsible researchers, build relationships with stakeholders, and build efficacy for centering stakeholder needs in the research process. Most of the participants in this study came to the PURPOSE program and the Freedom Schools context with social capital in the form of rich service identities and prior service experiences. Participants’ positionality as experienced “service-oriented people” may have allowed them to experience the Freedom Schools context as one without clear boundaries between research and service. At the same time, their service identities were connected to their expressed feelings of responsibility as researchers, especially given the opportunity to explore research problems in the Freedom Schools that most fellows perceived as the same or similar as their community given the salience of their racial identities.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The Freedom Schools context provided a space for the integration of research and service identities as fellows grew in their practice as responsible researchers. Fellows also conceptualized their research as service by approaching research problems in the Freedom Schools that felt like doing research for their community, especially for fellows who identified as Black. For these fellows, doing social science research in Freedom Schools was a step for them towards their goals of using their own scientific practice to solve problems that will transform society, particularly for members of society who look like them. At the same time, for fellows who came to identify as insiders in the Freedom Schools context through research and service and held values about the potential of research to change society, the Freedom Schools was similar to a counterspace that affirmed their identities and supported the work they did with the Freedom Schools stakeholders. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>I discuss implications for these findings, limitations of the study, and next directions in research on the experiences of early-career scholars building their programs of research in the Freedom Schools and beyond.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The female singing voice goes through physical changes such as water retention, lack of flexibility, and vocal fatigue days before and during menstruation. Little research has been conducted on the singing voice during menstruation. Eleven female singers who have taken at least one semester of voice lessons and do not take hormonal contraception were utilized for this study. An FDA approved and medical grade electroglottograph and microphone were used to gather data. The closed quotient EGG and audio recording were analyzed through Voce Vista Pro software. Singers were recorded singing an [a] vowel on a pentatonic ascending major scale starting at A5, C5, D-flat5, then E-flat5. They were recorded three times: first, prior to menstruation, second, on their first day of their menses, then third, after completing targeted vocalises on their menses. vocalises were included in this study to offer singers tools to achieve more vocal cord closure and sufficient subglottal pressure while menstruating. A questionnaire was given after each session to document symptoms and emotional response.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>	This treatise will examine two contemporary piano works, Lera Auerbach's Ludwigs Alptraum (2007) and Clifton Callender's à la manière de (2018). Both pieces deliberately include references to the music of particular traditions and compositional styles as well as unique musical languages in rhythm, harmony, texture, and form. The classically trained ears would easily recognize the musical quotations but the quotations are not always as expected as the received effect. For example, Auerbach extracts completely different expressions out of the exact same material, by putting it in a new context; Callender alludes to multiple influences within a single pastiche which often contradict one another. Moreover, even though they have overtly referred to specific styles or works, their experimental musical languages can obscure the quotation itself and its meaning. The received meaning from the borrowed materials helps the listener figure out the possible meanings and interpretations of the new pieces. The listener may also find another meaning in the existing passage in the new context and new language. The interpretation of musical borrowing in these pieces can be more open, inclusive, and subjective by individual listeners. 	The purpose of the analysis is to reveal the possible meaning within the unfamiliar musical language of the new pieces. The idea of intertextuality is adapted to the analyses, to the extent of employing multiple texts to make sense of a new musical text. Theories of intertextuality claim that a reader always brings other texts to an understanding of the single text, so that all writing is filled with allusions, quotations, and references to other writing. It is a postmodern thought that presents multiple meanings and temporalities. The intertextual musical analysis in this paper models on Michael Leslie Klein's Intertextuality in Western Art Music (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2004). The intertextual application is to understand difficult passages in new musical styles of two contemporary composers, rather than to compare the pieces with the knowingly or unknowingly quoted resources. By examining the quoted melodies, alluded styles, and structural similarity from the intertwined references, one can reason the composer's intent and implied meaning of the piece through reconceptualization and interpretation of the passages in question. It will help performers and listeners to understand, interpret, and accept the new languages and styles presented in these pieces more easily and effectively.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This research evaluated the effects of consumer attitudes and trust of those seeking eco-friendly, sustainable brands and the advertising effect greenwashing has had on that brand attitudes and trust. Greenwashing refers to a variety of misleading communications and advertisements that marketers use when they appear to be environmentally conscious and sustainable in products for branding purposes but aren’t making any notable environmentally friendly and sustainable efforts in their products (Markauskaite, 2022). Utilizing the framing theory, focusing on thematic versus episodic framed messages in green advertising, 157 Gen-Z consumers were surveyed online. Analysis of the results to explore the message framing of products in green advertising found in the United States in relation to the levels of brand distrust and attitude were conducted through a between subject experimental study. The results indicated that message framing plays a key role in the perceptions of green advertisements and that episodic framed messages are received more receptively amongst target consumers in comparison to thematic framed messages.  </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This dissertation, The Rise of the Editress: Women’s Editorship in the Literary Marketplace of the Long Nineteenth Century, explores the role of gender in editorial labor during the long nineteenth century. I focus on the “editress,” a term used throughout the nineteenth century to reference women in editorial positions. Like the figure of the “poetess” the editress is treated differently from her male counterparts, having to simultaneously navigate editorial authority and traditional gender roles. However, critical analysis of editorship has lagged significantly behind studies of authorship, and much of the limited work on nineteenth-century editing focuses primarily on male editors. My scholarship resides at the intersections of literary studies and book history in order to interrogate the gendering of literary labor and the British marketplace. To investigate the role of the editress, I study the careers of women across the century and across genres—Anna Letitia Barbauld, Sarah Stickney Ellis, Caroline Norton, and Mary Elizabeth Braddon who edited anthologies, literary annuals, and periodicals, respectively. 
Using what I am calling the “editor function,” after Michel Foucault’s “author function,” I analyze both the editress’s construction and her reception. These case studies help formulate a more complete picture of the editress and to access her role in the larger literary marketplace. I trace a trend of increased visibility of the editress through the century, which ultimately boosted her authority and, at the same time, made her a target of criticism.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Ensemble-based approaches to prescribed fire planning cannot be supported by computational fluiddynamics based models like FIRETEC and the Wildland-Urban Interface Fire Dynamics Simulator
(WFDS) because they are too computationally expensive and cannot leverage large eddy simulation
approaches like CAWFE and WRF-SFIRE because they have too coarse of resolution. QUIC-Fire
was developed to fill this gap but it cannot currently address complex terrain, that is typical
for instance in the Western United States. This dissertation describes a variety of improvements
made to QUIC-Fire and its various incorporated algorithms in an effort to make it a viable tool
in simulating wildland and prescribed fires on terrain. The modifications made to QUIC-Fire are
described in three chapters. The first chapter describes the extension of the diagnostic wind model
QUIC-URB, the wind engine of QUIC-Fire, to a terrain-following coordinate system. The terrain-
influenced winds it generates are analyzed and compared. In particular, this chapter presents the
mathematical derivation of the wind solver leading to a linear system of equations that are solved
through the successive over-relaxation method. The model is validated against a standard test
used in previous works (the Askervein Hill) and against a new dataset from measurements in the
Socorro Mountains, New Mexico. The terrain-following implementation captures the correct phe-
nomenology for the isolated Askervein Hill, with a wind speed up at the top of the hill. The model
agrees well with measurements on the upwind side of the peak, but overestimates speed-up on the
downwind side of the hill. This is due to the inability of the model to generate flow separation and
wake-eddy dynamics. On a common laptop, the divergence-free wind field is obtained in 6 s, mak-
ing the solver appealing for coupled fire-atmosphere simulations. The Socorro Mountain is highly
complex, with many cliff faces, peaks, and valleys. Although the model captures the magnitude
and direction of inlet and outlet areas of the domain, it performs rather poorly in the valley region
and in the regions near the steep cliffs. Hence, the model shows good agreement with data in areas
of open sloped terrain but lacks in areas where flow separation and thermally driven effects may
be present (neither effect is addressed in this work). In the second chapter the implementation
of the terrain-following version of QUIC-URB into QUIC-Fire, and the necessary changes needed
to include terrain are described. No changes to the underlying fire spread algorithm are made
other than what is required to correctly account for the inclusion of terrain. Previously published
FIRETEC results that use five different topographies that share the same centerline profile are
compared to simulation results from the modified QUIC-Fire that use the same topographies and
fuels. QUIC-Fire results show overall similar behaviors in terms of how the topographies affect
fire shapes and trends in spread rates. Due to the terrain-following version of QUIC-URB being
unable to generate flow separations at the crest of hills, fire spread rates in these regions across
all topographies are over-predicted when compared to FIRETEC. Lateral fire growth shows simi-
lar trends with FIRETEC between topographies but does not capture the increase in spread due
to a diagonal interface between grassland and forested fuel region of the domain. These results
suggest that there are three algorithms within QUIC-Fire that could use improvement: how flame
tilt angle is accounted for, the incorporation of non-local drag effects, and the inclusion of the
wake-eddy parameterizations that are used in QUIC-URB. Lastly, the third chapter describes a
modification to the initial guess used for the calculation of the QUIC-URB mass-conserved wind
solution during fire simulations. The modification is aimed at improving fire-fire interactions in
QUIC-Fire simulations. The modification consists of using the solution from the previous timestep
as the starting point for the calculation of the solution for the next timestep. Fire-fire interactions
is greatly improved by the change but a new source of error is introduced. Due to how plumes
are modelled in QUIC-Fire the new solution contains errors where gaps in the plume structure are
present. However, these errors are mostly limited to the upper atmosphere, where they do not
affect fire behavior at the surface, and their magnitude isn’t significant enough to discount the
amount of new fire phenomenology now captured in QUIC-Fire with the change.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Self-dehumanization, a phenomenon relevant within social psychology, has been somewhat absent from clinical psychology research. Furthermore, measures of self-dehumanization are few, and to our knowledge, no validated and generalizable self-report measure of self-dehumanization exists (cf. Fontesse et al., 2021). In order to address this gap, this paper presents a Self-Dehumanization Scale (SDS), which is designed to assess perceptions of nonhumanness. This work incorporates evidence from 2 studies examining the reliability, validity, and factor structure of the SDS in an undergraduate and a clinically relevant community sample. Both studies suggested an 8-item SDS, with Study 1 supporting a single-factor solution, while Study 2 suggested a two-factor solution. The SDS showed discriminant validity from related, yet distinct, measures of self-hate, self-esteem, and dissociation. The SDS had mixed evidence regarding its association to suicidal ideation, above and beyond self-hate, dissociation, and interpersonal needs. Thus, self-dehumanization may prove to be a clinically promising leverage point in assessing psychopathology. This work closes with a discussion of the limitations of the studies and their implications.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The Southern Ocean (SO) is one of the most productive oceanic regions in the world. Despite a high abundance of macronutrients such as nitrate and phosphorus, some areas have a surprisingly low amount of phytoplankton biomass.  These areas are known as high nutrient low chlorophyll regions (HNLC) and are often limited by the micronutrient iron (Fe). The influx of Fe to the surface Southern Ocean has varied over geological timescales and is expected to change further in a future climate. Additionally, climate change will alter surface ocean mixing depth which can constrain phytoplankton productivity. To identify and understand the effects of Fe and light availability on phytoplankton, this study assessed ecophysiological and photophysiological responses of two SO phytoplankton species: the haptophyte Emiliania huxleyi (E. hux.) and the diatom Fragilariopsis cylindrus (F. cyl.). The species were grown under saturating and sub-saturating Fe conditions and different light conditions. A dynamic light treatment mimicked natural light variability in different mixed layer depths, inducing either light limitation, saturation and/or short-term high light stress while a continuous light environment for F. cyl. also simulated conditions in the Antarctic higher latitude summer.  In all treatments, ecophysiological parameters such as growth, elemental ratios, and cellular chlorophyll a were measured. Photophysiology was examined using Fast Repetition Rate fluorometry (FRRf) over a diurnal cycle. For both species, the results indicated a clear reduction in chlorophyll a, growth rate and cellular POC under Fe limitation with weaker effects attributed to light intensity. Fe limitation reduced photochemical efficiency (photosynthetic quantum yield (Fv/Fm)) and resulted in a reduced reoxidation rate of the photosystem (τ). Light affected photophysiological parameters mainly during peak light in the dynamic lighting environment. Irrespective of Fe availability, light adaptation strategies differed between species. E.hux primarily adjusted its photosystem to become less effective in capturing photons under high light (lower low light utilization (α)) while F. cyl primarily adapted to high light by increasing non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) during peak light in the dynamic lighting acclimation. Data on E. hux. productivity and photophysiology indicate that this haptophyte has a high light tolerance, even when Fe depleted, and is capable of acclimating to the full range of environmental stressors applied. F. cyl was less effective at adapting to the Fe-limited conditions. Here a major decrease in productivity was observed under Fe limitation. The overall results of this experiment highlight that Fe is the major driver in changes to cellular energetics with light being a secondary influence.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>AbstractThe Algerian War (1954-1962), as officially acknowledged by the French state since 1999, was one of the longest and most brutal decolonization wars of the twentieth century. It pitted the French army against the Algerian nationalist movement (FLN) and ended with Algeria winning its independence after 132 years of colonialization. France has long nourished ambivalent views about its colonial past, oscillating between defending its legacy as a ‘civilizing power’ and considering its colonial past, especially when it comes to Algeria, as a taboo because of its association with terrorism, massacres, and torture. My dissertation examines (auto)biographical graphic narratives published between 2011 and 2017 to unpack how the Algerian War is at the heart of the social fracture in contemporary France today, a fracture stemming from questions of national identity, national belonging, and national memory. The Algerian War has many different legacies attached to it in contemporary France, especially depending on who is telling the story. In my corpus, I examine three of these legacies—French soldiers, pieds noirs and North African (im)migrants—analyzing life writing that tackles intergenerational tensions that stem from what comics scholar Hillary Chute describes as ‘the intersection of collective histories and life stories,’ especially when the French official memory favored forgetting for so long. By sharing the personal experiences of their elders, each author supports a more pluralistic French society, challenges existing definitions of “Frenchness,” and advocates for more transparency in France regarding the events and the aftermath of the Algerian War by breaking the silences encouraged by the French government. By questioning the relationships between past and present, the authors replace an official and monolithic History with the image of a plural and polyphonic past, challenging dominant ideologies in France that influence how people of North African descent are perceived by some people in France. Thus, the authors open the door to a new creative expression of History.
In this dissertation, I demonstrate how my authors use a popular medium to engage readers on a personal level in a way that a book, a testimony, or a documentary does not, through the act of closure and the interactive process of working through multimodal personal narratives. All of the authors analyzed in this dissertation mobilize comics’ formal conventions to transmit their protagonists’ traumatic memories, encouraging others to do the same but also using the specific genre of life-writing in comics to reflect upon the complex nature of self-identity. They tell a different story of the Algerian War than the one told by the state. Lastly, the authors demonstrate the many diﬀerent ways in which autobiographical writing can encourage the cognitive and emotional engagement of readers through the use of multimodal metaphors and humor, for example, or by drawing characters in close-ups with clearly discernable expressions. My corpus, alongside public intellectuals, and other forms of art, have had an impact on social consciousness in France, contributing to the growing awareness and acceptance of a multifaceted France.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Informal labels and formal labels were hypothesized to impact short-term and long-term delinquency, even when controlling for the effect of other types of labels in the same model. Reflected appraisals were separated by the source of the perceived labels and were each predicted to increase later delinquency. Parent-reflected appraisals were expected to have the greatest influence on delinquency. The effects of informal labels were also hypothesized to be moderated by formal labels. Specifically, the effect of objective parental labeling and reflected appraisals of parents, peers, and teachers on later delinquency were predicted to depend on the experience of a formal label. These hypotheses were tested with OLS regression using data from the first six waves of the National Youth Survey. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The effect of objective parental labeling was statistically significant when reflected appraisals and formal labels were included in the same model. Reflected appraisals had varying effects on delinquency. When separated by source, reflected appraisals revealed an interesting pattern. Reflected appraisals of teachers were relevant to short-term delinquency, whereas reflected appraisals of peers impacted later delinquency. Formal labeling had a consistent and strong main effect on later delinquency, net of controls and informal labels. Surprisingly, informal labels were not dependent on formal labels. Implications of these findings were discussed at length in the final chapter. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This thesis asks whether experimental archaeology can be used to replicate the effects of vitrification seen as a result of  historic fires. The project design uses ceramics, glass, and a recreated wattle and daub structure as the test artifacts. Next, these materials are subjected to fire to simulate what changes an intentional burning event would affect. This question is asked to understand the process of vitrification from historic fires observed in samples from the Bryan Site (8LE6256). The process will be considered using the technology comparable to that in use by people living in the seventeenth context of mission sites.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study aims to help fill the gap about the effect of social media on the Black African diaspora in the U.S. by researching how social media advertising affects consumer behavior within the Black co-cultures. Specifically, this study aims to look at how Twitter advertising affects the Black co-culture's intention to engage with the brand and intention to purchase the advertised product across diasporas. This study is an experimental research design that researches how language identified with the Black African diaspora in advertising used on Twitter affects the intention to click and purchase the advertised product. The findings indicated that when the Black African diaspora has more positive attitudes toward a Twitter ad they are more likely to engage with the sponsored ad. They are also more likely to purchase the sponsored product when their attitudes are highly positive toward a Twitter ad. Also, they are more likely to purchase the product when they engage with the advertisement. There were no significant differences found in the hypothesis that African American consumers who resonate with the AAVE style language will show higher positive attitudes toward the Twitter ad. Finally, the findings indicate that the hypothesis that the higher the ethnic identification of the audience with the culture, the higher the attitudes, engagement, and intention to purchase could only be partially supported.

            <DISS_para>Transport phenomena in general, and specifically, turbulent transport are inevitable processes in environmental problems and in the function of natural and manmade systems on the earth’s surface. The continuously varying solar radiation, wet and dry surface conditions, and variable wind forces create unsteady transport conditions that make it challenging to predict the behavior of systems and events in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). To understand, forecast, and mitigate natural threats and optimize manmade systems it is crucial to investigate the transient nature of the transport and dispersion phenomena under all relevant variable thermal and mechanical forces and energy exchanges. For example, turbulent transport within the ABL is a result of mechanically and thermally induced forces. However, the role of thermally induced turbulence is significantly understudied in the ABL literature, and the gap is mainly due to the lack of knowledge on the source of the thermal forces: the variable earth’s surface energy and moisture equilibrium within the everchanging environmental conditions. The objective of this research is to develop physics-based models and investigate the transient nature of mass and heat transport at the interface of the earth and lower atmosphere to better predict and address environmental problems (e.g., pollution dispersion, fire ignition potential, etc.). The investigation involves multiscale and multi-physics computational model development, detailed turbulence analysis, and a comprehensive assessment of energy and water balance in and over complex terrains and under spatiotemporally variable environmental conditions.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Over the last decade, the number of cyberattacks targeting power systems and causing physical and economic damages has increased rapidly. Among them, False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) is a class of cyberattacks against power grid monitoring systems. Adversaries can successfully perform FDIAs in order to manipulate the power system State Estimation (SE) by compromising sensors or modifying system data. SE is an essential process performed by the Energy Management System (EMS) towards estimating unknown state variables based on system redundant measurements and network topology. SE routines include  Bad Data Detection (BDD) algorithms to eliminate errors from the acquired measurements, e.g., in case of sensor failures.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>FDIAs can bypass BDD modules to inject malicious data vectors into a subset of measurements without being detected; and thus, manipulate the results of the SE process. In order to overcome the limitations of traditional residual-based BDD approaches, data-driven solutions based on machine learning algorithms have been widely adopted for detecting malicious manipulation of sensor data due to their fast execution times and accurate results. Machine learning algorithms have been proposed as a promising solution for detecting FDIAs, as they can automatically learn patterns and anomalies in the data that are indicative of an attack. However, these algorithms are also vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are maliciously crafted inputs that are designed to mislead the model into making a wrong decision.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this dissertation, we focus on evaluating the vulnerability of machine learning algorithms against adversarial examples in the context of FDIAs. Specifically, we study six different cases of adversarial attacks, including Adversarial Label Flipped Attack on SVM, Targeted Fast Gradient Sign Method Attack on MLP, Limited-memory BFGS Attack on MLP, Jacobian-based Saliency Attack on MLP, Carlini and Wagner Adversarial Attack, and Zeroth Order Optimization-based Attack. We implement these attacks on a simulated power system, and evaluate the performance of the machine learning algorithms in detecting them.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The results of this study provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different machine learning algorithms in detecting FDIAs and adversarial examples. We also provide recommendations on how to improve the robustness of these algorithms against adversarial examples. The findings of this research are useful for practitioners in the field of power systems and machine learning, as well as for researchers working on the security of cyber-physical systems. This dissertation is organized into several chapters, starting with background, literature review, objective, adversarial examples, adversarial examples on power systems state estimation, evasion attacks with adversarial deep learning against power system state estimation, adversarial machine learning designs against learning-based attack detection algorithms in power systems and a summary of the work and future work.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This analysis investigates the relationship between Rossby wave breaking (RWB) and tropical cyclone (TC) activity on a variety of timescales in the northern hemisphere (NH). This will be done through a time series analysis between wave breaking extent, TC activity, and climate modes of variability. The relationship between wave breaking and TC activity has previously been done on a case-by-case basis, but it has not yet been done on a climatological basis. This analysis will focus on the wave breaking events between 1960 and 2011 to determine if there is a relationship between wave breaking and TC activity. By focusing on the NH winter, the peak of the wave breaking season will be captured, and the second half of the TC season in the NH will be observed. 	This analysis examines the relationship between wave breaking and TC activity on the intra-annual and decadal timescales as well. Additionally, different climate modes of variability will be examined to see if they have any regulating influence on the relationship between TCs and wave breaking. This study focuses on determining if there is a relationship between RWB and TC activity. It was shown that there are significant relationships between wave breaking and TC activity on the seasonal, intra-seasonal, and decadal timescales, and some of the climate modes of variability can have a regulating influence on these relationships. Because of the techniques used, we can only speculate on the mechanisms that are controlling the relationships. Through this analysis, there is a relationship between RWB and TC activity in the NH, and different climate modes of variability can act as a regulating influence on their relationship. Additionally, there appears to be a long-term trend to RWB across the NH. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>At its core, A 21st Century Romantic Comedy is a commentary on our toxic codependent relationship with plastic. It is written for soprano, percussion, string quartet, electronics, and recycling waste. It is intended to provoke and encourage listeners to think about the current state of the world and our relationship with the planet.  The first and last movements are quite literally love letters to plastic. The singer takes the role of a lover who finds themself a willing and delighted participant in this toxic relationship that is slowly killing them, much like our own relationship with plastic. We rely so heavily on it, and it’s incredibly useful, but the fact remains that we are slowly destroying ourselves and the planet along the way.
The second movement is essentially a hit list; however, it isn’t portrayed that way in the eyes of the singer. Every name is a top contributor to single-use plastic waste (Source: Minderoo Foundation’s “Plastic Waste Makers Index 2021”). Rather than shouting in anger, the singer embraces these “Capitalist Casanovas.” The goal is to create a contrast between the seriousness of the issue and the playful tone of the music, to highlight the absurdity of our reliance on single-use plastics and the culture of overconsumption that led us here.

            <DISS_para>This dissertation explores the dark side of corporate political connections. Chapter One investigates the reputational spillover effect between scandal-tainted congresspersons and politically-connected firms. During the period 1992-2018, firms connected to scandal-tainted congresspersons experience a relative loss in market value and future operating and financing performance following the first media report of the scandal. The losses are greater if the congressperson does not step down from office, indicating that they are not due to broken political ties. This suggests that there is an undocumented cost of existing corporate political connections when a connected congressperson is involved in a scandal. Chapter Two utilizes three rare donor list disclosures of US dark money groups to compare exposed clandestine corporate donors to other similar non-exposed firms. The findings indicate that exposed firms experience a 2.7% increase in valuation following the first report of the donor lists. However, firms exposed as donors to a sabotaging dark money group experience a 17.8% decline in valuation and a relative loss in future operating performance. Further, firms alter their corporate political disclosure activities after these disclosure events. These findings highlight the prevalence of dark money in the US political system and the unprecedented risk associated with corporate political connections to dark money groups involved in political sabotage.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Heteronormativity – the implicit moral assumption that heterosexuality is the preferred or natural sexual orientation – is evident in extant family science literature and presents challenges for researchers and clinicians. The presence of heteronormativity in the field of family science limits generalizability of study findings and promotes clinical decisions based on heteronormative research when working with LGBT individuals, couples, and families. It is imperative to conduct family science research with more diverse samples in order to challenge the dominance of heteronormativity in this field and provide more effective treatment options for those within the LGBT community. Associations have been found between adult attachment, trait mindfulness, sexual desire, and sexual satisfaction separately, but these variables have not been studied in a single model. Additionally, these variables have been studied mainly with heterosexual individuals and couples, even though sexual problems – such as low sexual desire and low sexual satisfaction – can impact all individual regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Therefore, this study sought to explore the associations between adult attachment, trait mindfulness, sexual desire, and sexual satisfaction within the LGBT community. A sample of 303 individuals who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender completed self-report measures that studied levels of attachment anxiety and avoidance, trait mindfulness, sexual desire, and sexual satisfaction. Specifically, the study found significant inverse associations between attachment anxiety and trait mindfulness, attachment avoidance and sexual desire, as well as attachment avoidance and sexual satisfaction. Furthermore, the study found a significant indirect effect demonstrating that the association between attachment anxiety and sexual satisfaction can be accounted for by trait mindfulness. Sexual desire was not found to moderate the association between trait mindfulness and sexual satisfaction. These findings are important as studying these associations within the LGBT community is crucial in order for clinicians to provide the most appropriate and effective treatment options when working with this community. Future research could expand upon these findings by studying the specific facets of mindfulness in relation to sexual satisfaction, in order to better understand the specific mechanisms that underly this negative association. Additionally, future research could include a broader examination of the potential impact of minority stress on these associations.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>There are over 2.5 million people employed full-time by higher education institutions across the United States, with over 1 million full-time employees at individual Research 1 (R1) higher education institutions. R1 higher education institutions employ thousands of individuals and spend at least $5 million on research expenditures.  R1 higher education institutions could not function or succeed academically without the support of their employees, but unfortunately, employee job satisfaction is often ignored to focus on other immediate items like research. The purpose of this qualitative case study was to examine a leadership training program already in place at Southeastern University (SU) during the COVID-19 timeframe (January 2020 - current), while discovering the experiences and satisfaction of participants. This leadership training program has had hundreds complete the program, but there is little to nothing known about the participant's experience and satisfaction with the program. A total of fourteen program completers in a leadership position participated in a semi-structured interview lasting from 40-90 minutes. Specific characteristics were needed for the research questions to be answered successfully so participants were chosen using maximum variation purposive sampling. Constant comparative analysis was used inductively to create codes from the data. Elemental coding was used for the first-cycle method, specifically InVivo. InVivo coding allowed the ability to attune to participant perspectives and actions. The data revealed that overall participants felt like they received the resources and tools needed to lead at SU and were satisfied with the program and their learning experience. However, participants also expressed room for improvement within the program and outside of the program. Outside of the program they saw a lack of leadership skills in leaders across campus and a lack of support for the program.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Demolition projects are dependent on heavy equipment operations, and therefore, the success of these projects hinges on efficient heavy equipment usage. While previous studies have focused on tracking heavy equipment productivity in construction operations, such as earthwork, manually tracking the duration of heavy equipment activities can be time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to errors. To address this, recent studies have employed artificial intelligence-based methods to automatically identify heavy equipment activities and measure productivity in construction operations. However, unlike earthwork activities, which are relatively simple and repetitive, demolition activities are more complex and dynamic, involving structural demolition and material separation. As a result, applying existing approaches to identify demolition activities raises questions. This study proposes an automatic vision-based activity identification model that uses three-dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract spatial and temporal features simultaneously. The model can recognize three excavator activities related to material separation, namely grabbing, swinging, and dumping, used in demolition operations. To develop the model, small-scale excavators were used to simulate real-world demolition operations while recording videos of the experiments using two cameras. The recorded video datasets were manually labeled and used to train the proposed model. Since demolition projects are not as common as construction projects, it can take a while to collect real-world data for training and validating the activity identification model. Thus, small-scale demolition simulations were used to validate the feasibility of the vision-based activity identification model, supporting its application for full-scale demolition productivity improvement. The model achieves an accuracy of 93.68% on the training dataset and 91.84% on the validation dataset. The study highlights the impact of camera placement on the model's performance, suggesting future research to optimize camera placement and configuration. Overall, this research contributes to the development of accurate and effective automated activity identification models for demolition projects. By using computer vision-based models to identify demolition activities automatically, the proposed approach is less labor-intensive, more efficient, and more accurate than traditional approaches, ultimately enhancing the productivity of demolition projects.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Leaking sewer pipes can be a significant source of contaminants to soil, groundwater, and connected surface water bodies, because untreated wastewater contains nutrients, biologic pathogens, and toxic chemicals. Numerical modeling approaches are a useful tool to estimate the amount of sewer exfiltration and to assess impacts of sewer exfiltration especially for problems of a relatively large scale. This thesis research develops a numerical model using Finite Element Subsurface and Transport Flow System (FEFLOW) that simulates variably saturated flow and solute transport from a leaking sewer to a pond located near the campus of the Florida State University in Tallahassee, FL. FEFLOW is a commercial software capable of simulating heat, flow, and transport in the subsurface.This work attempts to answer the following two questions: How much sewage can potentially be leaking from the pipes of this study? How long will it take for exfiltrated sewage to enter the pond? The model-simulated exfiltration rate is between 0.02-0.08 L/s/km, which is similar in magnitude to other studies (Yang et al., 1999; Fenz et al., 2005; Morris et al., 2006). Selected solutes took 5 years to enter the closet portion pond to the exfiltrating sewer pipe. Results indicate that sewage exfiltration accounts for a loss of 4-16% of total flow in the Tallahassee sewer system. However, with solute transport taking five years to travel approximately 50 meters specific contaminants such as nutrients and biologic pathogens may not be a concern (Cordy et al., 2004; Hua et al., 2004). These results have not been evaluated using site-specific data, and thus may not represent the reality. Nonetheless, this study suggests that FEFLOW is a suitable tool for modeling sewer exfiltration problems.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Most proponents of flexible online learning, and critics alike, have little more than anecdotal evidence to support their claims about the benefits or drawbacks of flexibility (Houlden &amp; Veletsianos, 2019; Veletsianos &amp; Houlden, 2019). This study departs from past literature that characterizes flexibility as a universal experience of online learners to explore flexibility as a relative, individual process (Houlden &amp; Veletsianos, 2019). This exploratory, qualitative case study explores how virtual high school students at Alabama Connections Academy (ALCA) perceive and experience flexibility (of time, pace, place, and pedagogy) when learning online.  Fifteen virtual students volunteered as participants and completed this study. Student participants were asked to answer open-ended journal questions about their online learning experience and then participate in 1:1 Zoom interviews about their perception of and experience with flexible online learning. By exploring individual students’ perceptions and experiences, scholars and practitioners may better understand how virtual students experience flexibility in an online learning environment. 
This qualitative study showed that although most student participants had overtly positive perceptions of flexibility, and many reported positive experiences, there was a range in the virtual student experience and a possible tension between some students' perception of flexibility and their experienced reality. By learning more about the virtual student experience, including what students value and/or wish to change about ALCA’s flexible learning policies, educators can craft policies to build more equitable online learning environments, with the potential to make flexibility more beneficial for, and accessible to, all virtual students.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Each Spring since 1932 residents of Natchez, Mississippi have performed a Confederate Pageant. Natchez was once the wealthiest city in the nation due to its slave trade and cotton plantations, and it has more extant antebellum architecture than any other US city. Since the Great Depression Natchez has capitalized on Lost Cause nostalgia, promoting Confederate history through tourism romantically glorifying Natchez as “where the Old South still lives.” Ladies dress in hoop skirts, offer tours of plantations, and direct youth to perform in the annual Confederate Pageant as part of “Spring Pilgrimage,” a lucrative tourist event. Climaxing with a procession by the Confederate Queen and General, the pageant reimagines the past and future nation. I use the Confederate Pageant to argue that performance sustains nationalism, that women and children are critical to the production of nationalism, and that ideologies are embedded in material practices. Performance, nationalism, and memory are interrelated embodied processes; the Confederate Pageant is a node where they intersect.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The Confederate Pageant is a ritual of surrogation that uses ideals of reproductive futurity to resurrect the Confederacy. Teleological ideals of national progress link an idealized past to an imagined future. Illustrating Lee Edelman’s concept of “reproductive futurism” the figure of the child functions politically as an idealized representation of the nation’s future. Children represent nationalist ideals of reproductive futurism in rituals of surrogation, which Joseph Roach describes as rituals where one body replaces another, in attempts to fill perceived social voids. Performances of surrogation reiterate and alter what came before: the performance is doubled yet dislocated, alike, but not identical. Surrogation functions similarly to Jacques Derrida’s supplément as an addition and replacement both extending and displacing. Performance reanimates the nation, not only as symbolic resurrection, but also evoking affect and sensation to create lived, shared experiences that create feelings of national belonging. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In Chapter One, I offer thick description detailing my observations of the performance in April 2019, then use these observations to illustrate my theoretical framework about how performance and memory, women and children, and affect and sensation function to produce nationalism. Then to provide dramaturgical context for that performance iteration, in Chapter 2 I pan to a very broad perspective situating Natchez within deep time. I offer geologic and historic context for how Natchez became the hub of plantation cotton farming, and how this impacted the US’s early development as a nation. Highlighting Mississippi authors, I note how fictional literature influenced historical narratives and memory of the past. In chapter three I use diffractive reading to discuss representations of Natchez history and the Old South. I illustrate how attitudes about race and nation linked to Natchez circulated via marketing materials, souvenirs, etc. as well as through performance. I analyze objects as performative, illustrating how they circulate ideologies, and how many forms/bodies may hold or perform memory. I highlight themes of the gestures curtsey and bow, panoramic theatrical techniques related to animation, and representations of steamboats/showboats. I also focus on silhouettes. I follow a logo that I call the “Natchez Lady Silhouette” used in tourism materials for almost a century, and relate this to developments in mass-circulated media. Finally, in chapter four, I discuss how African American residents have resisted and countered Natchez’s confederate heritage tourism by creating performances, museums, and heritage sites emphasizing their perspectives.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>I take the pageant’s aesthetics as inspiration. The pageant presents the story of Natchez in vignettes of tableaux and dance, with occasional placards, minimal dialogue, and plenty of romantic, flowery imagery. I use these aesthetics (recall: aesthetic means sensation) as formal/stylistic inspiration, writing about theatre theatrically. Like the pageant, I present the story of Natchez in vignettes, silhouetted tableaux, and looping dances. While I make an academically sound argument supported by evidence, I deploy the tone of the novelist or poet. Mississippi authors have been key not just in US literature but ultimately to shaping our ideals of the nation. From William Faulkner’s Yoknapatawpha County to Jesmyn Ward’s Bois Sauvage, many cherished Mississippi authors stage their stories in imagined places, finding the essential truth of the past better remembered in fiction. Natchez offers a unique example of a place that lives materially, imaginatively, and metaphorically. I treat this text like a story, like theatre, to capture that.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The neglect of pet freshwater fish is rampant in the United States. Despite this, awareness about pet freshwater fish and the neglect they face is low among consumers. This study focused on using social identity theory in order to identify the ideal target market for an awareness campaign designed to prevent the neglect of pet freshwater fish. A survey was distributed to 214 participants (n = 214) and results were interpreted using one-way ANOVA. Findings of this study demonstrated a link between higher levels of identification with animal welfare activists and higher levels of identification with pet freshwater fish, higher levels of anger over the neglect of pet freshwater fish and higher levels of moral conviction over pet freshwater fish. These findings can be used by communications practitioners because they suggest higher levels of support towards preventing the neglect of pet freshwater fish by individuals with higher levels of identification with animal welfare activists. Because individuals with higher levels of identification with animal welfare activists can be assumed to have a lower likelihood of neglecting pet freshwater fish based on the results of this study, this study will contribute to the environmental communications field by determining that individuals with low levels of identification with animal welfare activists should be targeted with an awareness campaign to prevent the neglect of pet freshwater fish. This study will also help fill the current gap in literature surrounding pet freshwater fish neglect and communications, as it is the first of its kind to directly link pet freshwater fish neglect and communications.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to examine the qualifications, preservice experiences, and factors that influence teacher retention and attrition; and identify the needs of music teachers working in alternative schools to understand the factors that lead to music teacher retention and attrition in these schools. As this was the first study to examine music teachers in alternative schools, an attempt was made to understand who these music teachers were, recognize the factors related to their retention, and understand why specific factors were essential to the participants while others were considered unimportant. A sequential-explanatory mixed methods design was used to identify those factors that lead to music teacher attrition before exploring these ideas deeper with five specific cases. The Four Capital Theory of Teacher Retention served as the foundation for this study. It organizes the factors related to teacher retention and attrition and investigates these themes through the lens of preexisting theories: (1) human capital, (2) social capital, (3) structural capital, and (4) positive psychological capital. 
Strand 1 was descriptive, and examined the qualifications, preservice experiences, and factors that influence teacher retention and attrition. Results from strand 1 indicated that all teachers in the study chose to teach in their schools, nearly one-third of participants had no training in working with students with exceptionalities, and social factors are of most importance for retention. The qualitative strand 2 followed, shedding light on the lived experiences of teachers who worked in exceptional centers in Florida. Here, each teacher expressed their thoughts regarding each of the factors and how they were impacted by them. Teachers also discussed desired training opportunities. Finally, strand 3 integrated information gathered during the qualitative phase of the study with data from interviews in an effort to understand how these teachers determined those factors of most importance.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Sorrow Festival is a collection of poetry rooted in the north Florida landscape; the juxtaposition of the region’s sublime subtropical beauty with its horrific storms and crawling creatures directly relates to the juxtaposition of transcendent joy and feral sorrow experienced by the post-confessional lyric speaker. Ultimately, the city of Tallahassee and the nearby Forgotten and Gulf coasts (and the wildlife specific to these places) become characters of their own that populate the pages in conversation with the narrator. In a variety of traditional, experimental, and hybrid forms, this manuscript thematically interrogates family memory, grief, sexuality, and gendered violence. Underlying the speaker’s personal revelations is the project of the “confessional” and its relationship to poetic impulse, women’s writing, sexual, political, and personal autonomy, and the social and aesthetic devaluations of these, both historically and in contemporary life. These considerations are in direct conversation with the manuscript’s setting in the American South, and the sociopolitical dynamics that complicate a woman’s place in it. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The first section of the manuscript is driven by memory and story, reflecting on the impact of domestic violence, estrangement, illness, and grief on a family lineage. The second section is composed of a long hybrid poem/lyric essay expanding on the chaotic, animalistic nature of grief as intertwined with the speaker’s understanding of partnership and sexuality. The third section situates the speaker in the present, where the uncontainable beauty and violence of the landscape mirrors the grandeurs and disasters of the speaker’s relationships with friends, family, lovers, and poetry itself. The fourth section takes an epistolary prose poem form, in which the speaker divulges further details about her family history of domestic violence as related to confession. Finally, the fifth section returns to images of Florida’s natural landscape in spring to convey a renewed—though complicated—sense of hope for the speaker. The dissertation opens with a critical introduction that aims to contextualize the creative work within a tradition of Confessional and Post-Confessional poetics, feminist literary theory, and the craft of hybrid texts in contemporary literature.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Research has recognized that a student’s culture plays a role in how they experience an online learning environment, and many higher education institutions are challenged by retaining and graduating historically underserved students identified as a “success gap”. For historically underserved students – defined in this study as students of color, first-generation college students who are the first in their families to attend college, and students from a low-income household – gaining access to, retaining in, and matriculating to post-secondary education can be a challenge. One factor to include in the assessment of the “success gap” is the increasing number of racially and ethnically diverse students, first-generation college students, and low-income students enrolling in online classes and programs. By acknowledging the presence of learners’ diverse cultural backgrounds, instructors, instructional designers, and designers-by-assignment (DBAs)—an impromptu instructional designer—can systematically incorporate cultural values throughout the design and development process. There is a growing concern from DBAs, such as faculty and student support staff in higher education, to address the success gap of diverse students through more inclusive online learning design. Since the instructional systems design field has not been able to produce a more situated framework or consistent strategies for inclusive online learning and culturally sustaining instructional strategies, this study will explore the expertise of higher education administrators who are culturally inclusive subject matter experts (SMEs) and DBAs—specifically staff who work with the Ronald E. McNair Scholars program—to identify key attributes of inclusive online learning environments and culturally sustaining instructional strategies for higher educations’ increasingly diverse student population. Since McNair Scholar staff are DBAs and SMEs in inclusive education and support of historically underserved populations, they could benefit from implementing instructional design models in their online learning environments. This exploratory multiple-case study uses the Culturally Sustaining Instructional Design model as a conceptual framework to investigate how and why DBA administrators in higher education incorporate inclusive strategies into their instructional design practices. The six major themes and culturally sustaining strategies found in the data include creating a space for authentic learning, creating access to learning materials, selecting an inclusive instructional approach, creating a network of support, clarifying expectations, and being flexible. Analysis also found that there were contextual factors and desired outcomes that influenced the DBAs’ decisions to implement culturally sustaining instructional strategies. Finally, four thematic categories were discussed by the participants when discussing how they assessed their instructional strategies: Engaging with the Feedback Loop, Observing Changes in the Scholar, Measuring the Scholar’s Learning, and Issues Identified with Assessing Effectiveness. Finally, I describe implications of my findings for each major theme found for culturally inclusive strategies: Space, Access, Instructional Approach, Network of Support, Expectations, and Flexibility. Working with first-generation college students, students from low-income backgrounds, and underrepresented minority students in higher education, McNair DBAs modeled culturally sustaining instructional strategies by making systematic decisions to implement inclusive online learning environments. This study contributes culturally sustaining strategies to the literature that are popular among McNair DBAs. Ultimately, the success gap will minimize if all online learning environments are intentionally designed for the inclusion of diverse students.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Subsynchronous Resonance (SSR) is a unique power systems phenomenon that was relatively unknown until a 1970’s incident at the Mohave Power Station damaged two turbine-generators in the exact same segment of their shafts. This surprising outcome indicated that the mechanical properties of these shaft segments were somehow related to their failures. Unknown at the time, was that a disturbance in the electrical system created an SSR signal causing rotor torques on the shaft that coincidentally matched its natural oscillation frequency. The result was an increasing energy exchanging loop between the electrical and mechanical sides of the power system ending with shaft failure. This thesis proposes that instability issues like the Mohave case can be identified and corrected early on using an Electromagnetic Transients Program (EMTP) and the Nyquist Stability Criterion (NSC). The results prove that the Nyquist plots of the mechanical and electrical gains over the subsynchronous frequency range (0 – 60 Hz) accurately predict the shaft designs at risk of SSR by encircling the point (-1,0) on their graphs. Moreover, simulation outputs confirm that the torque waveforms exceed safe operating limits for shaft segments predicted as high-risk. The successful demonstration of this predictive process can then be developed to analyze the stability of related phenomena, such as subsynchronous oscillations (SSO), which may impact modern microgrid systems containing power converters.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Principals’ experiences in rural schools often differ from that of their urban and suburban counterparts. They often experience challenges that are not only unique to their specific contexts but influence their roles as instructional leaders. With instructional leadership at the forefront of the principalship, it is important to explore how rural principals engage in the work and how they navigate the multitude of contextual factors that impact their roles. The purpose of this qualitative case study is to gain a deeper understanding of what instructional leadership looks and feels like in a rural, Title I school district in north Florida. Using Leithwood’s (2021) leadership framework to inform the study, data were collected through one-on-one, semi-structured interviews wherein participants described instructional leadership, the practices of instructional leadership that they engaged in, and what factors they identify as influencing their roles as instructional leaders. Data were analyzed using the framework to identify patterns and trends across participants. 
This study found that while there aren’t stark contrasts in the way rural principals described instructional leadership in comparison to the framework’s definition, it is worth noting that participants emphasized that relationships played a vital role in instructional leadership and were critical in building capacity and improving instruction. Furthermore, rural principals spent the majority of their time in the Building Relationships and Developing People Domain and Improving the Instructional Program Domain. When asked about the factors that influence their roles as instructional leaders, principals identified opportunity gaps, resource limitations, and political culture as negative influences, while the community and the availability of programs that support students and families were seen as positive influences. 
The implications of this study are relevant for principals, district leaders, policymakers, and researchers. Principals expressed the desire and need to have more opportunities to engage with their colleagues and in professional development. Given that principals identified barriers and supports that impact their roles, district leaders may consider examining how they can address some of the challenges while leveraging the existing systems and resources available to strengthen principals’ instructional leadership practices. At the researcher level, examining what rural-specific supports impact principals most will provide valuable insight into how rural principals can best be supported.

            <DISS_para>Prior audit research and PCAOB inspection reports provide evidence that auditors often fail to revise audit plans to effectively address new risks that are revealed during audit fieldwork. I investigate how budget performance measures contribute to this issue by increasing both auditors’ perceived and actual resource pressures. I also examine how a psychology intervention called constraint-based planning (CBP) encourages auditors to allocate their resources more effectively in an environment where audit risk is shifting. I incorporate the economic incentives and resource constraints of an audit into an experimental economics experiment to test my research questions. I find that budget performance measures cause auditors to misallocate their resources when the perceived or actual level of audit risk shifts after the creation of the budget. I also find that auditors who participate in CBP allocate their resources more effectively to an extent that they are more likely to address accounts that change in riskiness. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The history of women composers has been defined by overt prejudice. However, in the 20th century that narrative began to change. By the 1950s women composers began to thrive, having their works performed worldwide and in virtually all genres. Recognition of their works has flourished, with two Pulitzer Prize winners, numerous Grammy Awards, acceptance into prestigious fellowships, and more. Their contributions to the world of music are making a noticeable impact on classical music and their works for tuba are no exception.The intent of this treatise is to be a resource of solo literature for tuba written by various women composers. The selected solo works have been chosen to represent quality literature at various difficulty levels. Two works have been chosen to highlight each difficulty level. For each work, the author identified their purpose for selection, musical form, and performance challenges. Along with the description will be suggested performance fundamentals designed to assist with key components of each piece. In addition to the selections in this paper, a more extensive list of works has been provided. Each work includes a brief biography about the composer and a difficulty rating based on the ITEA Standard Literature rubric.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this treatise is to catalog the music of Carl Vollrath and further preserve his work with biographical information and accounts of those who have performed and recorded his music. This document centers around a compendium of works for solo clarinet with piano, solo clarinet with wind ensemble, and chamber music for two or three players that features the clarinet. Each entry contains the title of the work, date composed or copyrighted, titles of movements or sections and tempo markings, and sources for which recordings can be acquired. Further details include Vollrath’s inspiration for each work, and pedagogical considerations including difficulty level, range of clarinet writing, and basic form and stylistic characteristics of the composition. Future implications of this document include the creation of a web archive where information about the composer and his works can be found including this compendium. Information from this document will be presented in future publications, presentations, and lecture recitals to advocate for the composer’s works. Through these resources, Carl Vollrath’s music will become more accessible to the public.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>A growing number of music therapists across the country own a private practice that provides music therapy services to a variety of populations. The purpose of this survey was to analyze data based on demographics of music therapy private practice owners, allocation of administrative time, and private practice business models across the United States. Music therapy business owners (N=111) responded to a nationwide survey regarding how their time was divided throughout the week and how revenue was generated for their individual practice. The results indicated that a majority of private practice owners who responded were new to the field within the past 10 years and devoted the most time during the week to direct client interactions. The results of this survey are beneficial to the field of music therapy because it warrants further discussion regarding the future of private practice.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This paper examines human rights violations in Ukraine, attributed to Russia and the self-proclaimed ‘republics’ of Donetsk and Luhansk. These violations include cases of arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances, torture and ill-treatment, and conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV) against vulnerable populations. Historically, Russia and the self-proclaimed ‘republics’ have failed to take accountability for their role in committing these offenses, including consistently underreporting data and not allowing human rights monitors to access detainees under their administrations. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, systematic abuse has been executed against civilians, detainees, and prisoners of war at even greater rates. In this paper, I argue that they are systematic in nature and fit into the framework for atrocity crimes, as defined by the Rome Statute of International Criminal Court. In my literature review, I discuss prior research and reporting by international monitors, who have watched the progression of abuses taking place in Ukraine and their approach to holding those involved, accountable. Within this paper, I use the method of secondary analysis of existing data, by means of triangulation, to converge data pulled from three human rights monitors. These data are extracted from existing data published by nongovernmental organizations that launched monitoring projects in response to the Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, to document numerous, ongoing human rights violations. This thesis discusses how human rights abuses have systematically increased since the invasion, and how human rights monitors have documented them with the use of a secondary analysis of already existing data. I also discuss limitations that arise from their type of reporting and explore how triangulation trivializes missing numbers, by addressing key trends.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Bethlehem Steel Corporation was once America’s largest private shipbuilder and the second largest steel producer in the world. At its formation in 1904, its founder and chairman Charles M. Schwab combined the plants, mills, mines and other properties of the Bethlehem Steel Company with United States Shipbuilding Corporation to form the Bethlehem Steel Corporation. Much of the historical literature on Bethlehem Steel focuses on explaining the corporation’s downfall. Corporate publications from the wartime era underline Eugene G. Grace’s central role in how Bethlehem viewed, advertised and promoted itself to a wider audience of employees, customers, government officials and the public. This study analyzes publications from this period in the press, industry trade journals, and Bethlehem Steel’s own bulletins and announcements to explore how the corporation, its managers and its employees navigated the wartime years from 1939 through 1945. The main research question is: How did Bethlehem Steel mobilize its plants, yards and workforce in support of the American and Allied war effort during World War II? Production remained the dominant theme throughout the war: producing more steel, ships and other defense-related materials as fast as possible. Shipbuilding was Bethlehem’s most important contribution to the war effort, followed closely by its steel production. The corporation’s integrated nature was a source of strength for wartime production. Bethlehem Steel contributed an enormous amount of raw steel, munitions, fabricated steel products, naval and merchant shipping, and ship repair work in meeting the nation’s defense needs. To meet its production demands Bethlehem Steel expanded its workforce to unprecedented levels. Bethlehem’s leaders expected and demanded the loyalty of its employees. Anything less represented disloyalty to the nation’s war effort. Lastly, Bethlehem activelypromoted its public image. It portrayed itself as a patriotic, benevolent and paternalistic viii
corporation, leading the charge on the front lines of America’s industrial production. Through its effort, teamwork and leadership Bethlehem promoted itself as a decisive contributor to the eventual Allied victory. Bethlehem Steel was an integrated corporation, which went beyond the physical layout and infrastructure of its steel mills and shipyards. Bethlehem also took an integrated approach to narrating its wartime history. In its published materials Bethlehem Steel Corporation emphasized its production, its steadfast loyalty to the United States and a consistently positive corporate image.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to determine whether differences in digital audio and video quality impact collegiate music majors’ ratings of a solo vocalist’s performance. With this purpose in mind, I developed the following research questions: 1) Do instrumental and vocal collegiate music students perceive differences in tone quality of a vocalist’s performance encoded at high and low audio and video qualities? 2) Do instrumental and vocal collegiate music students perceive differences in technique of a vocalist’s performance encoded at high and low audio and video qualities? 3) Do instrumental and vocal collegiate music students perceive differences in musicality of a vocalist’s performance encoded at high and low audio and video qualities? 4) To what extent are collegiate music students aware of differences in audio and video quality when rating a vocalist’s performance?	I made a stimulus recording of a vocalist and pianist performing four verses of Cecil J. Sharp’s arrangement of The Holly and The Ivy. These four verses were then encoded at two video qualities (1080p resolution and 144p resolution) and two audio qualities (48 kHz sample rate with 24 bits of depth and 8kHz sample rate with 8 bits of depth) for a total of four possible video combinations. Participants (N = 93) watched each of the four video clips and rated the participant’s tone quality, technique, and musicality in each condition. After viewing the stimulus videos and making ratings, participants then answered the free-response question “What factors influenced your ratings?”
	After performing statistical analyses, I found significant main effects for audio quality in all three rating categories. Participants rated the vocalist’s tone quality, technique, and musicality higher in the high audio quality conditions than in the low audio quality conditions. I also found significant main effects for participants’ self-identified primary instrument in two of the rating categories, with instrumentalists (n = 35) rating the vocalist’s tone and technique higher overall than vocalists (n = 58) did. Additionally, there were two interactions involving participants’ ratings of the vocalist’s tone: an audio quality by primary instrument interaction and an audio quality by video quality by viewing order interaction. Instrumentalists rated tone quality higher in the high audio quality condition and lower in the low audio quality condition than vocalists did. In the three-way interaction, participants in one viewing order rated tone in the high audio and low audio recordings higher when paired with congruent video quality, even when the audio and video were of congruently low quality. 
	I coded participants’ answers to the free-response question to analyze which factors were most cited by participants as affecting their ratings. Most participants cited either audio quality, video quality, or general recording quality as affecting their ratings. A smaller, but not insubstantial portion of the participants stated they were aware of the recording quality but did not let it influence their ratings. Taken together, this would indicate that judges will inconsistently incorporate knowledge of the quality of digital recordings when making judgements of solo vocalists. Other commonly cited factors included performer sounds and appearance.
These findings have ramifications for musicians, particularly vocalists, who use both livestreamed and pre-recorded audiovisuals to share and view recordings of performances. Given the links between household income, urban-rural classification, parent education level, and other socio-economic factors and at-home internet speed, educators in particular should consider the methods by which they recommend and implement streaming in their classrooms and curricula.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Metal-insulator transitions (MITs) remain one of the unresolved science problems of condensed-matter physics, which are rather general and of fundamental importance.  In the vicinity of the MITs, the behavior is found to be unconventional and exotic. This complexity makes it difficult to recognize the dominant degrees of freedom, resulting in a plethora of theoretical viewpoints based on very different ideas. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>First we study the transport behavior and the dielectric response near Mott Metal-Insulator transition (MIT) using the Iterative Perturbation Theory (IPT), which is exact at the atomic limit at half-filling, for the single-band Hubbard model supplemented by percolation theory. We successfully interpret the experimental observation of a colossal peak of the dielectric function near the Mott MIT in organic material $\kappa\text{-(BEDT-TTF)}_2\text{Cu}_2\text{(CN)}_3$. Our results suggest the diverging feature of dielectric response comes from percolation effects near a first-order MIT, where metallic and insulator domains present simultaneously as long as the materials have defects or impurities. Our findings suggest a similar ‘dielectric catastrophe’ in many other correlated materials and can explain previous observations that were assigned to multiferroicity or ferroelectricity.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Second we summarize both experimental and theoretical observations of the criticality around the Mott transition, in three types of systems: 2-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in Si-MOSFE, Mott organic material ($\kappa\text{-(BEDT-TTF)}_2\text{Cu}_2\text{(CN)}_3$), and transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) moire bilayer $\text{MoTe}_2/\text{WSe}_2$. Particularly, we find robust resistivity maxima are clearly seen in all these materials. We then use dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) and 'hybrid' DMFT correspondingly to show that dielectric response can be used to identify the origin of these resistivity maxima. We find that near the MIT, it corresponds to the percolation effect within the (spatially inhomogeneous) metal-insulator phase coexistence region, where a colossal enhancement of the dielectric response has been found. Deep in the  metallic phase, it signals the thermal destruction of coherent quasiparticles due to strong correlation effects, and a dramatic drop and a change of sign in the dielectric constant would be found.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Third we study the disorder dominated MIT in TMD moiré bilayer. In this material, a long-range geometric moiré pattern emerges when two atomically thin materials are misaligned or have a lattice mismatch. This drastically reduces the electronic kinetic energy, paving the way for new strongly correlated phases. We proposed a minimal theoretical model describing the interplay of interactions and disorder, which is solved at DMFT + coherent potential approximation (CPA) level. The results capture most experimental trends at almost a perfect level. We investigate the quantum criticality near MIT with a fully occupied flat band (f=2), which is found to be in a disorder-dominated regime. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Finally, we consider long-range Coulomb interaction in low band filling cases, where one expects Wigner crystallization to occur. To investigate the nontrivial electronic phases appearing away from commensurate fillings, we first used the spinless Hartree method to calculate the total free energy, and then we used DMFT and Kubo formula to obtain the transport behavior. We find that, for most fillings, an amorphous charge-ordered metallic state – the electron slush – appears in strongly correlated TMD hetero-bilayers. Our results suggest performing transport and Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) experiments on TMD hetero-bilayers to study the interplay between doping a Wigner-Mott insulator and amorphous charge order.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The low flute family–including the alto, bass, contralto, contrabass, subcontrabass, double contrabass, and hyperbass flutes–is experiencing an increase in instrument making, repertoire, and performance opportunities. With growing attention given to these instruments in solo, chamber, and orchestral settings, this treatise strives to examine the history and the teaching practices of low flutes. The instruments included in the discussion focus mainly on the alto, bass, and contrabass, with consideration given to the contralto, subcontrabass, double contrabass, and other bass flutes (i.e. bass in F). The testimonies and histories of professionals, past and present, are referenced in an effort to shed light on the development of alto and bass flutes, as well as other lower wind instruments. This includes recent innovations in flute design that occurred during the twenty-first century.To consider the teaching practices of low flutes, the following section of the treatise addresses the pedagogy of three prominent low flute players¬–Christine Potter, Paige Long, and Carla Rees. Through interviews conducted in 2022, information and detail is provided about their lives, first encounters with low flutes, and teaching emphases. The final chapter explores a pedagogical path of study, proposing possible courses for a graduate-level Specialized Program of Study in Low Flutes. Drawing from the information gathered in the interviews, my personal experience, and historical accounts, I propose a program and teaching materials with syllabi and outline course objectives that aim to advance low flute playing in solo and ensemble settings. Interested teachers and students may use this as a resource to understand the history of low flutes and reference pedagogical approaches for these instruments.

            <DISS_para>Future electric transport systems will have high-power dense devices such as high-temperature superconducting (HTS) motors, generators, and power distribution cable networks. A high power density is desirable to achieve the necessary efficiency and design with space and weight requirements. The electric transport systems would reduce greenhouse emissions and have other benefits, such as reduced noise, compared to the conventional platforms that use internal combustion for propulsion. Two such applications under development are electric ships and electric aircraft. These platforms will have 30-100 MW power systems. Government agencies and industry are investing in the designs and development of component technologies.The dissertation explored the high temperature superconducting (HTS) power devices and the necessary cryogenic system designs. Part of the dissertation focused on HTS power cable designs. The thermal network modeling methodology was used to understand the implications of component failure and options to achieve resiliency. 
A radial architecture for the ship power distribution network was investigated to fully utilize the HTS cable technology in achieving efficiency, stability, and resiliency. Two HTS cable topologies were explored for the radial system. HTS cable ampacity being sensitive to the operating temperature, the resiliency of the cryogenic system in supporting the electrical distribution network is critical. The results of the combined electrical and cryogenic thermal models show that the cryogenic systems can support radial distribution. The models were used to map the cryogenic temperature profile of the distribution system in both normal and contingency operations involving a failure of one of the cables. The cryogenic system satisfactorily supported the increased current in the other cables to mitigate the loss of one of the cables with a manageable temperature increase of 2-3 K. The models also concluded that cryogenics does not hinder the radial distribution concept.
To assess the broader question of cryogenic fuels for large transport systems, a review was performed on the opportunities and challenges of cryogenic power devices for electric aircraft and the ongoing research and development efforts. Relative merits of liquid hydrogen (LH2) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) are compared in supporting the HTS and normal metal devices. The mass flow rates and fuel quantity requirements for both cryogenic fuels were simulated using thermal network models. A twin-aisle, 300-passenger aircraft with a 5.5 h flight duration was used for the models. The results show that the required masses of LH2 and LNG are 750 kg and 13,600 kg, respectively, for the cooling requirement. The corresponding volumes of LH2 and LNG are 10,000 and 30,000 L, respectively. In both cases, the estimated mass of the fuel needed for the aircraft is more than what is necessary to maintain the cryogenic environment of the power devices. It was concluded that an electric aircraft with LNG-cooled normal metal devices is feasible. However, an aircraft with HTS devices cooled with LH2 is more attractive if the ongoing R&amp;D efforts on HTS devices and green hydrogen infrastructure are successful. The emission reductions would be substantially higher with LH2, particularly with green hydrogen produced using renewable energy sources.
A coaxial superconducting gas insulated cable (SGIL) was designed, fabricated, and tested to understand the challenges in making compact cables cooled by gaseous helium (GHe). Two kinds of insulating spacers were explored to understand the effect of permittivity mismatch on the maximum electric field strength. The latest design iteration of the dipole SGIL showed promising results of sufficiently high breakdown strength. Investigations found that the cables suffer from corona discharge activity at the intended operating voltages, reducing the cables' lifespan. The major limiting factor of the design is the high electric field stress at the triple point, causing localized corona discharge activity in the gaseous cryogen trapped between the spacers. New dipole cable designs must address the high permittivity mismatch between GHe and the spacers to reduce the high field stresses. New geometries are needed to achieve desired dielectric properties while maintaining the heat transfer effectiveness and flexibility of HTS cables.
Potential failure modes of HTS devices and related cryogenic systems in electric ships are analyzed to understand and plan for the necessary mitigation systems. Risk-based FMEA methodology was adopted to aid in improving the resiliency of large superconducting power distribution systems. A concurrent FMEA study of cryogenic thermal and electrical systems in an HTS power distribution network is discussed. A one-line architecture for a power distribution system was developed to identify the critical parameters needed for performing FMEA for HTS power distribution systems. The failure modes are listed to show the interdependence of the electrical and cryogenic systems. The severity and detectability of various failures were used to formulate critical redundancy and mitigation tools to design resilient power distribution systems for electric ships.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This thesis explores the worshipscape of First Baptist Church Midway (FBC Midway), a Southern Baptist church located in Plant City, Florida. With nearly 125 years of history and worship, FBC Midway has gone through many eras of music and worship practices. My study of this Southern Baptist church’s worship history is threefold. I examine the spaces in which worship happened and continues to happen, the people who were and still are worshipping in these spaces, and the various musical styles that they have used in worship. Through a combination of archival research, ethnographic conversations, and personal reflection, I piece together a meaningful representation of this specific worshipscape and how the people who inhabited it understood its function in their lives in and outside of the church. 	The term “worshipscape” was coined by Adekunle Oyeniyi and is new to the field of congregational studies. Oyeniyi derived this term primarily from Michela Mari’s and Sara Poggesi’s term “servicescape” (2013). In doing so, he prioritizes the concepts of musical style and demographic appeal. The use of “worshipscape” in this thesis is adapted from this previous work, as well as R. Murray Schafer’s concept of a soundscape, to include all musical and extra-musical aspects of worship in a given church community. This fieldwork conducted at FBC Midway is a practical and multifaceted attempt at unearthing multiple layers of influential factors important to understanding its worshipscape and how it has changed over time. The difficulty in studying worshipscapes lies in attempts at holistic representation. Much like their secular counterparts, spiritual soundscapes constantly evolve and change over time. 
	Through this study, I develop a useful theoretical and methodological framework for investigating a Christian Baptist church’s sonic worship practices from their historical formation through their present-day renditions. By employing a conglomerate of ethnomusicology, ecomusicology, sound studies, and archive studies, I juxtapose multiple influencing aspects of worship and sound into a cyclical relationship. This framework can be applied broadly to the holistic study of worshipscapes that span various religions, geographical areas, and worship practices.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Men commit 86% of all gun-related homicides in the United States despite women accounting for 40% of gun ownership. Hegemonic definitions of gender indicate that traditional masculine traits, compared to traditional feminine traits, are more related to violent behaviors. The precarious manhood paradigm (Vandello et al., 2008) states that masculinity is constantly precarious. According to this paradigm, masculinity must be outwardly defended in the face of threat; the easiest way is through displays of violence and aggression. We conducted the first-ever experiment to test if high levels of trait masculinity, threat to masculinity, and their interaction predicted deadly firearm use during simulated reality scenarios depicting ambiguously dangerous situations. Undergraduate participants were 90 straight, cis-gendered men in the Southeast United States who were randomly assigned to the control group (n=45) or the masculinity threat group (n=45). Consistent with hypotheses, the masculinity threat predicted increased deadly firearm use in men with high trait masculinity, as measured by the CMNI-22 (Burns &amp; Mahalik, 2008). Higher trait masculinity also predicted faster deadly firearm use in men whose masculinity was threatened, which was partially consistent with hypotheses. Findings suggest that threats to one’s masculinity potentiate gun violence in men with high trait masculinity. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The skeletal muscle clock contributes to the regulation of skeletal muscle health and function. Mutations to the muscle clock result in decreased muscle mass and strength, diminished mitochondrial health, and altered substrate metabolism in the muscle. Chronic alcohol (EtOH) ingestion disrupts components of the core molecular clock, alters mitochondrial function, and decreases muscle mass and strength. Exercise is a potent stimulator of the muscle clock, and exercise training promotes muscle and mitochondrial health. PURPOSE: In the current study, we examined the potential protective effects of scheduled, voluntary wheel running on alcohol-induced disruptions to the skeletal muscle clock and the effects of alcohol on exercise-induced muscle adaptations. METHODS: Female C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to one of 4 groups: CON SED (n=26), ETOH SED (n=27), CON EX (n=28), ETOH EX (n=25). Exercise (EX) mice had running wheel access from ZT13-15, while sedentary mice (SED) remained in their home cage. All mice were fed either a control (CON) or alcohol (ETOH)-containing liquid diet. Grip strength and body composition was measured before and after the interventions. After 6 weeks, muscle was collected every 4hrs and RT-PCR, Western blotting, and citrate synthase activity assay were performed in gastrocnemius. Plantaris muscle was used to measure cross sectional area and percentage of fiber type. RESULTS: Transcription of Bmal1, Per1, and Per2 was disrupted in ETOH SED vs. CON SED, while core clock mRNA expression was unaltered in ETOH EX compared to ETOH SED. CON EX phase shifted Bmal1 and Per1 mRNA compared to CON SED. While ETOH SED phase delayed peak nuclear protein expression of MYOD1 and DBP compared to CON SED, CON EX phase advanced peak expression of both proteins and ETOH EX phase advanced peak DBP nuclear expression. While REVERBa and BMAL1 circadian nuclear expression was unaltered, However, overall BMAL1 nuclear expression was increased in ETOH EX compared to ETOH SED. Alcohol blunted the hypertrophic response to exercise in the gastrocnemius, plantaris, and soleus muscles, and overall lean mass and blunted the exercise induced increase in forelimb grip strength. Citrate synthase activity was increased with exercise training in control and EtOH mice, while Complex I-V mitochondrial protein content and Cytochrome C and COXIV protein expression was increased with exercise. The exercise-induced increase in Pcg1a mRNA was impaired with alcohol, and mRNA expression of Opa1, Mfn1, and Drp1 were significantly correlated with average daily running distance, regardless of diet. The mitophagy marker BECLIN was also increased with exercise. CONCLUSION: This data suggests that scheduled voluntary wheel running may be unable to protect the muscle clock against alcohol-induced disruption and that alcohol partially blunts skeletal muscle adaptations to exercise training.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This qualitative and exploratory study sought to better understand how adolescent high school students form perceptions and opinions of the criminal justice system (CJS). Nine freshmen and nine seniors enrolled in a criminal justice magnet program in Florida were interviewed (separately). They were asked to gauge their level of trust in the CJS and to discuss which factors (i.e. personal experience, vicarious experiences expressed by friends &amp; family, school curriculum, and news &amp; social media) influenced their perceptions and opinions of the CJS the most. Additionally, senior participants were also asked to reflect on their time in the criminal justice magnet and to explain if/how the curriculum influenced their perceptions of the CJS. While some students indicated that personal experience, news and social media, and school curriculum influenced their opinions of the CJS, the most frequent response was vicarious experiences shared by friends and family. Furthermore, all senior participants stated they enjoyed their time in the magnet program and believed they could apply what they learned to their future career and educational goals. Most of the student participants expressed interest in legal, forensic, and social work-related occupations. Only 5 students anticipated pursuing careers in law enforcement; three of those five specified interest in federal law enforcement. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>In a qualitative case study utilizing student focus groups, individual student interviews, individual interviews with the Chief of Police, and document analysis of annual campus safety guides and police websites, this study explored the perceptions and experiences that LGBTQ+ students had of their campus police agency at a large public research institution. With a total of 18 participants, all identifying within the LGBTQ+ student population, the study found that students are unaware of their campus police agency’s positionality on LGBTQ+ and have experienced discrimination from their agency based on their gender expression. Further findings showcased that the campus police agency wants to better their relationship with LGBTQ+ students and is willing to collaborate with minorized student groups to ensure the effectiveness of their community policing model. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This quantitative research study investigates the relationship between home-school communication and its connection with student attendance and the relationship between ESOL students’ attendance and academic achievement, focusing specifically on ESOL students at Northend High School (pseudonym) in the Henry William’s County Public Schools (HWCPS) (pseudonym), in the state of Maryland. From this focus, two research questions (RQs) emerged. The first is “What is the relationship between parental communication and ESOL students’ attendance in ESOL English classes at NHS?” The second is “What is the relationship between ESOL students’ attendance and achievement in their ESOL English classes at NHS?” To answer RQ 1, data on parental contact frequency and student attendance from quarter one to quarter four for the 2021-2022 school year in students' ESOL English classes were collected. To answer RQ 2, data on the number of absences of ESOL students in ESOL English classes and their quarterly grades in their ESOL English classes for the 2021-2022 school year were collected. The findings from previous research (Wilder, 2013; Benner et al., 2016; Rivera &amp; Lavan, 2012; Day &amp; Dotterer, 2018; Batalova et al., 2021; Roby, 2004; London et al., 2016) and the findings from the current research align. This study reveals that for RQ 1, the results are mixed. The relationship between parental contact and absenteeism in ESOL classes at NHS is strongest in quarters one and three and weakest in quarters two and four throughout the year. This study reveals that for RQ 2, student attendance is a significant variable when looking at student achievement. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Vertical profiles of wind, potential temperature, and humidity within hurricanes are shown to exhibit approximately log-linear behavior within the near-surface layer and can therefore be used to estimate log-profile parameters in such an environment. We analyze data collected from individual dropsondes in an attempt to better understand the near-surface values of wind, potential temperature, and humidity. This analysis has the advantage of simultaneously fitting all three non-neutral profiles via a Python-based minimization code. Several of these fitting parameters can be combined to estimate surface fluxes of momentum, sensible heat, and latent heat within tropical cyclones. Several strengths and weaknesses of this method will be discussed. Vertical offsets of the profiles have been observed, which could be due to waves or sea spray pushing them upward, or due to an error in the recorded surface level from the dropsonde. Our methodology accounts for these offsets through a displacement height for each profile. While still providing a very good fit to the observations, the log-profile parameters can be sensitive to displacement height error in a manner that impacts our estimation of fluxes. In addition, some assumptions are made regarding surface values for each of the profiles. In terms of a fit to the profiles, the errors in surface values are largely compensated for by the errors in roughness length and have no impact on the friction velocity (or similar terms) and fluxes. The errors in roughness length are exponentially related to the errors in the surface values, which in some cases results in extremely large roughness lengths. Despite the weaknesses, our methods are able to produce near-surface estimates and flux estimates within a certain range of uncertainty that is determined from the observed profiles. These uncertainties can theoretically be reduced in two ways: improved estimates of the surface values for current and temperature, and improved accuracy of the near-surface heights of dropsondes. Examples of the profiles, fluxes, and the above-mentioned problems will be presented.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation examines the relationships between cultural dimensions and impulsive buying (IB) and compulsive buying (CB) behaviors in the US, China, and India. It systematically tests Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory's individual level of predicting power on IB and CB, compares the predicting level of Hofstede's cultural dimensions on IB and CB in the three countries, and explores the associations between impulsive buying and compulsive buying in cross-cultural contexts. The study found that cultural dimensions had different associations with IB and CB across the three countries, with masculinity, uncertainty avoidance, and indulgence being the most important predictors for IB and CB in the US, India, and China, respectively. Additionally, the study found that impulsive buying was associated with compulsive buying in all three countries. The findings highlight the importance of understanding cultural factors in driving these behaviors and provide a better understanding of IB and CB in cross-cultural context. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Deep neural networks have drawn much attention due to their success in various vision tasks. Incremtnal Leaning is a paradigm where instances from new object classes are added sequentially.The traditional training scheme causes a problem called catastrophic forgetting where model the updated model forgets the old classes and focuses only on the new classes.In the second chapter, we propose a frame work called incremental PPCA for class incremental learningIncrementl PPCA uses a self-supervised pretrained feature extractor to obtain meaningful features and trains Probabilistic PCA models on the extracted features for each class separately. 
The Mahalanobis distance is used to obtain the classification result, and an equivalent equation is derived to make the approach computationally affordable.In the third chapter,Experiments on standard and large datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms existing state of the art incremental learning methods by a large margin.
The fact that the model is trained on each class separately makes it applicable to training on very large datasets such as the whole ImageNet with more than 10,000 classes.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>neural network classifiers don't exploit semantic relations between image classes. Inspired by our understanding of the human hierarchical cognition models, we propose a framework called Hierarchical PPCA for image classification in the fourth chapter.
The framework uses probabilistic PCA models as basic classification units and adopts a modified k-means clustering to group the image classes into a smaller number of super-classes.
During classification, Hierarchical PPCA assigns a sample to a small number of most likely super-classes, and restricts the image classification to the image classes corresponding to these super-classes.
In the fifth chapter,experiments on three standard datasets ImageNet-100, ImageNet-1k and ImageNet-10k indicate the hierarchical classifier can achieve the same or superior accuracy with a 4-16 times speedup compared to a standard classifier. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to investigate the race, gender, and historical periods of composers included in syllabi for graduate choral literature courses in the southern region of the United States. The participants (N = 11) in this study were collegiate choral conductors teaching graduate choral literature courses at public/private colleges and universities. After analyzing the syllabi collected from the participants, the researcher extracted composers information from each syllabi including race, gender, and historical periods into a data collection sheet created by the researcher. The results indicated that White male composers from the Modern era are most frequently studied in graduate choral literature courses. The results also indicated that composers of color and women composers are significantly underrepresented in graduate choral literature curricula in the South. These findings suggest that a reform may be needed in graduate choral literature curricula to ensure more composers of color and women composers’ history and compositions are studied in graduate choral literature courses.  </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Dr. Steve Wolfinbarger, professor of music at Western Michigan University, has had an incredible impact on trombone pedagogy over the course of his more than forty-year career. His students play in premier ensembles and teach at over twenty-five colleges and universities domestically and abroad. His teaching has been recognized several times on a local and national stage, including citations from Western Michigan University in 2009, 2010, and 2014, as well as the 2013 Michigan Professor of the Year Award.Wolfinbarger has also been highly involved in the International Trombone Association and International Trombone Festival, helping to shape both into the organizations we see today. He hosted the 1990 International Trombone Workshop, served as president of the ITA from 1994-1996, and continues to serve on numerous committees and boards. The significance of his contributions to the trombone community has been recognized in two of the most prestigious awards given by the International Trombone Association, the ITA Award in 2009 and the Kenneth Hanlon Award in 2019.
The bulk of research for this document was done through personal interviews with Dr. Wolfinbarger and correspondence with his former students and professional contacts. The goal of this research is to provide future performers and educators with a better understanding of Wolfinbarger’s pedagogical philosophies and techniques, as well as the extent of his influence in the trombone world.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>One of the enduring problems over the last century has been the configurations of points which exhibit repulsive type behavior, such as particles of the same charge e.g. electrons, and determining which configurations would these points settle towards to minimize their collective energy when restricted to some compact domain. This problem is known as Thompson’s Problem and is named so for his model of the atom and has proven to be difficult to solve for general configurations of n- points, excluding a few exceptional cases of the vertices of the regular platonic solids. Recent work has been to study the asymptotic behavior of increasing the number of points in the configuration and studying how this affects the growth of the energy of these configurations. A major result in this area is attributed to Hardin and Saff which slightly generalizes to compact manifolds and is aptly named the Poppy Seed Bagel Theorem. We extend this result in a sharp sense and show that for highly non-smooth sets a similar result can be obtained.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Bosons play an important role in the study of emergent phenomena, such as the appearance of effective degrees of freedom, symmetries, and phase transitions. In this work, we use an ensemble of Hamiltonians with two-body interactions with matrix elements randomly chosen from a normal distribution, to explore the behavior of the ground states of systems of identical bosons of spin $\ell$. We especially focus on the predominance of spin 0 (or a single boson spin $\ell$) ground states for an even (or odd) number of bosons. We find that the structure of bosonic ground state wavefunctions are not random, instead preferring to be arranged into condensates of clusters.  </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>	Screening benefits both individuals and systems, enabling early identification of treatable conditions at scale. In education, schools use a variety of assessments and approaches to screen for risk of dyslexia or reading difficulties, and these vary in terms of technical adequacy and ease of administration. Screening assessments are commonly evaluated in terms of classification accuracy, with ideal assessments having at least a sensitivity of .90 and a specificity of .80. A recent study demonstrated that the correlation between a screening assessment and criterion outcome assessment can be used in combination with the base rate of the target condition to derive classification accuracy without actually applying the assessment to a sample. This study demonstrated that a univariate (single indicator) screening assessment could not achieve ideal classification accuracy unless the screener-outcome correlation was at or above .85. Because this level of predictive validity is unrealistically high for a univariate screener, the present study used a series of simulations to test how adding an additional indicator affects the screener-outcome correlation needed to achieve ideal classification accuracy, and compares this threshold across screening approaches (e.g., single-timepoint versus gated screening). Results showed that one- and two-indicator screening approaches using cut-points to assign risk can almost never achieve ideal classification accuracy as commonly defined, particularly when the base rate in the sample is low. Further, the specific approach used to assign risk affected classification accuracy and predictive power. Implications for the recommendations given to schools regarding universal screening and future directions for research are discussed. </DISS_para>

      <DISS_content>
         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Shakespeare’s The Tempest is one of his most musical plays, and the monster Caliban is an inherently musical monster. He demonstrates musical skills and affinities, and his speech “Be not affeard” from Act 3, Scene 2, is one of Shakespeare’s most sonically evocative speeches. Yet Caliban’s speech seems uncharacteristic, because elsewhere Caliban is portrayed as grotesque. As a result of the play’s musical sensibilities, many composers have set the play as opera or concert works. Interrogation of the ways in which interpreters represent Caliban in these adaptations, particularly regarding his “Be not affeard” speech, provide a revealing window on cultural history. This study considers musical adaptations chronologically from the seventeenth century to the present, reading Caliban as a cultural text. It explores the cultural and epistemological contexts of these works and analyzes them through the lenses of dramaturgy and musical style.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The inconsistencies in the monster’s description leave openings for interpreters to inflect the character in any number of directions. In the eighteenth century he is fish-like. In the nineteenth century he is a caricature of the noble savage or the missing link in the human evolutionary chain. In the twentieth century he stands in as a representative of any number of oppressed people groups. The musical styles that represent Caliban run the gamut from stylized grunts or growls to virtuosic vocal lines. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Despite the sonically evocative language of Caliban’s speech, few composers set his remarkable speech about the island at all, and even fewer set it as a discrete aria in its original affect. Examination of musical adaptations of The Tempest shows that the impetus to leave out the speech, or to invert its affect, usually stems from discomfort with portraying the monster in a sympathetic way, because a vulnerable monster would undermine or threaten the stability of cultural values. In the Enlightenment, the predilection for binaries of opposites and dichotomous worldviews necessitated that Caliban be unequivocally malevolent. Nineteenth-century adaptations situated him under the archetype of the noble savage, reading his musical affinities as an index for the presence of a redeemable soul. The advent of postcolonial literary criticism in the mid-twentieth century sparked altogether more sympathetic readings of Caliban. The influence of these readings led composers to set Caliban’s speech as his aria, unrestrained in its ability to reveal the character’s interiority and vulnerability. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation thus situates Caliban as a revealing interpretive window onto cultural history, “listening” to him by reading him as culture and interpreting his meaning. More than other monsters, Caliban has a rich body of music composed for and around him, and listening to the performance of this music is another more phenomenological way to understand Caliban. Listening to the monster sing makes palpable his interiority and vulnerability and provides a way to know and feel Caliban’s emotional worlds.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Educators across the U.S. participate in professional development (PD) to improve their teaching competencies. Numerous legislatures have mandated PD to 
develop highly qualified teachers; however, literature on PD has shown that teachers 
feel PD does not meet their needs. With consideration for the diverse needs of 
teachers, in this study I sought to understand middle school teachers’ perceptions in 
one public school district in Florida regarding the effectiveness and relevance of 
mandated PD during school improvement time. Using an explanatory sequential 
mixed methods design, I collected data through an electronic questionnaire (n =21) 
and interviews (n = 7) to answer the question: What are middle school teachers’ 
perceptions of the effectiveness and relevance of district-mandated PD? The 
questionnaire results indicated teachers’ felt PD is effective when it focuses on 
content, is collaborative, and is coherent. Furthermore, teachers described PD that
was applicable to the classroom and aligned to the needs of their school and students 
was relevant. I used interviews to explain these results further and found that content 
focus was lacking due to an emphasis on PD related to testing. Additionally, teachers 
explained that collaboration with teachers both in and outside of the content area they 
teach is effective. In contrast, the confusion teachers had regarding the planning of 
topics and PD led to them longing for coherence. After triangulating the data, I found 
teachers explained application as the ability to immediately use the training or 
resource without having to adapt it themselves. Furthermore, teachers elaborated that 
when PD is led by someone who has been in the classroom, understands their school, 
or teaches the same subject as them, they find it relevant. Teachers also shared that 
PD was focused on testing when it should be focused on topics related to content or 
student behaviors that have resulted from COVID-19. Findings from this study will 
benefit future educators and district personnel as they prepare for upcoming PD 
opportunities to address the needs of teachers within their district.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Moist convection in the tropics often evolves from randomly scattered cells to organized structures varying across different spatial and temporal scales such as mesoscale convective systems (MCS), easterly waves, or the MJO. Scientists have begun implementing cellular automata (CA) and Conway’s Game of Life in modeling convection because of its similar evolution from a random state to a self-organizes state that tropical convection undergoes. Rules from the Game of Life are implemented in a CA model coupled to an energy reservoir in which an event forms if the energy reservoir in a grid cell exceeds a designated minimum threshold similar to CAPE. Events then consumes the background energy, and the instability once again builds  up from the designated generation rate. This project’s main task is assessing the quantitative aspects such as number of events,environment instability, periodicity, and the qualitative behavior of events, visual and metric spatial organization of events in equilibirum, by experimenting with model parameters: instability generation, environment adjustment, neighboring cell influence, and cell persistence. The secondary task of the project is to evaluate the skill of the model to compare and contrast events in the CA model to idealized tropical convection in radiative-convective equilibirum (RCE ). Individually, energy generation and environment adjustment were found to have positive and negative contribution to quantity of events, and all four parameters affected environment instability in the model; multi-parameter sensitivity showed non-linear characteristics for  events and instability. High rates of environment adjustment, low rates of instability generation, and moderate values of neighboring cell influence had the greatest qualitative response to event organization. This model was able to replicate some aspects of atmospheric convective behavior and acquire spatial organization, but the degree of organization and change with organization in time did not match the behavior of atmospheric convection.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In a 2014 essay on “Queering Criminology,” Jordan B. Woods reflects on the wholesale failure of academic criminology to incorporate the unique experiences of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (LGBTQ) people into the larger scope of critical scholarship (Woods, 2014). The absence of this inclusion from criminological literature and criminal justice theorizing – which remains too narrow – prevents a better understanding of and response to the needs of LGBTQ people to improve their experiences in the justice system. While the volume of intersectional literature has grown in that time, existing deficits and a demand for deeper conceptual development means that filling the scholarship vacuum continues to be relevant. A lack of data on LGBTQ people constrains our understanding of the ways in which identities may influence attitudes, beliefs, and norms around the effects of crime and the institutions used to control it. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation fills a gap in contemporary literature by aiming to strengthen the state of queer criminology and an understanding of intersectional identity on the outcomes of crime. Specifically, the following research uses cross-sectional data (n = 405) from a sample of urban respondents in New Orleans, Louisiana to quantitatively assess how intersections of identity influences one's: (1) fear of crime (FOC); and (2) law enforcement attitudes (LEA). Sexual and gender identity is disaggregated to tease out potential mediating and moderating effects on both outcomes, and the interlocking intersections between sex, sexual and gender-identity, and race are added to assess their roles in predicting FOC and LEA. Results show that there is a direct effect between some intersectional identities and FOC – particularly among those who identity as female – but these effects drop out with the inclusion of additional covariates. The data show an indirect association between some intersectional identities and LEA via FOC. They also show that attitudes regarding police procedural fairness are associated with LEA. This study may provide conditional support for a vulnerability thesis to explain variation in both FOC and LEA.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The goal of this research is to investigate whether mound and shell midden archaeological sites in the Atchafalaya River Basin region have influenced the biodiversity and vegetative health of the surrounding environment. The general approach utilized a LiDAR Digital Elevation Model, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Louisiana Division of Archaeology Master Site File, and National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) multi-spectral imagery datasets to construct a chronology of vegetation changes at mound sites in the Atchafalaya River Basin. The significance of these sites will be examined through the lens of Cultural-Ecosystem Resilience, wherein a system of cultural and natural forces works to promote community stability (Mehta and Chamberlain 2022). The potential ecological benefits of mounds in terms of increased biodiversity and resistance to erosion will also be explored. The methods used in this research are influenced by the work done at the Adams Bay site (16PL8) to examine the biodiversity effects of mounds (Mehta 2023).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Five different mound sites were selected to meet the following criteria: 1) Mound area covered in vegetation, 2) Mound surrounded by comparable type and density of vegetation, 3) Mound is recorded in the Louisiana Cultural Resources Map, 4) Located in the Atchafalaya River Basin. Mound locations from the Cultural Resources Map were then verified with a Digital Elevation Model of the area. Multispectral imagery from NAIP flights was downloaded and used to calculate NDVI for each site across a ten-year span of time. Vegetation growing on top of the mound sites on average outperformed nearby vegetation in the majority of cases, using NDVI values as a proxy for vegetative health and density. Analysis of NDVI value distribution at mound sites showed a clustering effect in the higher range associated with dense vegetation and high levels of chlorophyll. A significant drop in NDVI values at all sites was observed in 2017, possibly attributable to the previous year’s devastating “no-name storm” that caused extensive flooding across the region. The methodology employed seems suitable for site discovery or long-term monitoring of archaeological resources in highly vegetated areas.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Rivalry is omnipresent in sports given the nature of competition in sports. Sports fans likely can easily and quickly name a few rivalries from a variety of sports at either the professional or collegiate level, such as El Classico between Barcelona and Real Madrid. The long history of sports rivalry, the high exposure and rich stories produced by the sports media, the human and financial resources invested in rivalry games, and the frequent appearance of rivalries in sports fans’ discussions, all highlight the importance of sports rivalry. The purpose of this study is to explore distant fans’ perceptions of sports rivalry as a phenomenon with three major topics: (1) distant fans’ perceptions of sports rivalry, (2) the antecedents contributing to the perceived sports rivalry of distant fans, and (3) distant fans’ feelings of Schadenfreude, as well as the differences regarding these three topics toward the top and the secondary rival teams. This study will also include an examination of the role of team identification in association with the primary research topics.The current study utilized online questionnaires to gather data among distant fans of Liverpool FC from the United States, South Korea, China, Malaysia, and Singapore. Convenience sampling was used and questionnaires were distributed through the Official Liverpool Supporters Clubs from the listed countries. The information collected was analyzed using R-Studio and SPSS. Frequency analyses were conducted for the demographic questions and major research questions. Additionally, a qualitative analysis of distant fans’ socializing agents and influencing factors was provided. The assessment of reliability and the assumptions were checked before testing the hypotheses. The hypotheses examining the differences between the top and secondary rivals, as well as between the high and moderate identification fans, were tested by MANCOVA and ACNOVA. The association between team identification and rivalry perceptions as well as Schadenfreude were tested by simple linear regression and weighted regression.
The key findings of the current study were three folds. Firstly, distant fans were likely to identify mass media as the socializing agents introducing them to their favorite sports team, including television, print media, social media, and Esports. Players, specific games, and team spirit were frequently mentioned when distant fans talked about the factors influencing them to become a fan. Secondly, in line with prior research, distant fans would not like to support the rivals when playing against a third party and had strong sense of satisfaction when their favorite team winning a direct game against the rivals. Highly identified distant fans were inclined to have stronger negative perceptions and feelings Schadenfreude against the rivals than fans with lower team identification. Thirdly, inconsistent with previous findings, distant fans did not perceive differently towards the top and secondary rivals nor have different levels of feelings of Schadenfreude. Distant fans perceived greater importance in relative dominance, defining moments, competition for personnel, and unfairness, while considered geography and cultural similarity least important in shaping the perceived rivalries.

            <DISS_para>Music therapy as a field has strived to embrace multiculturalism within education and practice. Over hundreds of thousands come to the United States in pursuit of higher education every year. For decades, these international scholars face many academic and non-academic challenges during their time away from home. Yet, many of these challenges remain relevant today. The purpose of this duoethnographic study was to explore the experiences of two international students who pursued music therapy education and training in the United States of America. The study describes the challenges faced and resources used, as well as provide perception and insights during their music therapy education and training. The participants were two Malaysian students who had received their music therapy education approximately 10 years apart. Both participants had two sessions of conversations, each lasting around one hour and a half. Data were derived from these conversations and categorized into themes and sub-themes, along with a brief transcription of the conversation accordingly. Themes and sub-themes that emerged are (1) Non-academic and academic challenges, (2) Tapping into available resources, (3) Conductive environment for growth, (4) Personal growth, (5) Finding a new ground between Eastern and Western values, (6) Gratitude, and (6) Hindsight. The study allowed participants an opportunity to verbally process their experiences and provide perspectives. While there is much effort put forward by music therapy organizations in developing cultural sensitivity within education and training, this study hopes to encourage further progression in cultural diversity, add insights into the direction of the cultural sensitivity within the field of music therapy, and contribute to the development of a diverse and resilient field. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This project examines how Asian cultural organizations in the United States represent and advocate for the preservation, development, and public presentation of Asian culture through festivals and outreach programs that often involve music, dance, cuisine, and exhibitions. Using the Asian Coalition of Tallahassee (ACT) as my case study, I argue that ACT music and dance events cultivate a collective sense of both particular and more broad-based cultural identities among Chinese, Filipino, Indian, Japanese, and other Asian-identifying groups in Tallahassee. In pursuing this line of argument, I apply theories of festivalization to show how cultural festivals serve to leverage political activism for Asian empowerment in the United States.    </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) savanna is an endangered ecosystem within a global biodiversity hotspot. However, most studies of longleaf habitats have not considered the distinct structure and function of unique longleaf communities, which is critical for developing appropriate management strategies.  Florida has 50% of the remaining habitat, where it occurs in unique community types that differ in their hydrology, species composition, and disturbance regimes. The structure and growth of longleaf pine in the different community types depends on the unique interactions between these abiotic and biotic components. The legacy of anthropogenic disturbance through logging, fragmentation, fire exclusion, and the rapidly changing climate have resulted in potentially novel dynamics for longleaf pine ecosystems. Identifying the drivers of tree growth and population dynamics can facilitate a better understanding of longleaf status and vulnerability to global change. In this dissertation, I explored and assessed how disturbances (fires and hurricanes) interact with species composition and climatic conditions to affect tree density, growth rates, and stand structure across community types in Florida.First, I assessed how differences in climate, fire, and species composition interact and relate to longleaf pine densities and growth rates in distinct communities. I used field surveys and tree cores to estimate stand structure and growth rates across community types. I used linear mixed-effects models to examine the effect of community type on longleaf pine density and growth rates and then used recursive partitioning and regression tree analyses to identify how climate, fire, and species composition affect density and growth rates. I found that stand structure and species composition were different across communities, whereas growth rates were not. Across communities, unique interactions between climate, fire, and species composition, resulted in differences in stand structure. In general, tree and grass stage densities were best predicted by species composition and fire rather than by climate within unique community types, whereas overall growth rates were best predicted by climate. I show that longleaf growth rates increased with higher temperatures, but this effect is reversed in dry conditions. Our research includes the southernmost extent of longleaf, and our results suggest that longleaf growth rates across its range will be more sensitive to current and future climate change than longleaf population density.
Second, I used unique dendroecological methods to explore how climate and fire interact to affect annual tree growth. Traditional dendrochronological methods mask out individual variation by using stand level indices, and have a bias towards sampling resource limited trees, which is an effective strategy for climate reconstruction, but lacks an ecological focus. I present eight ecologically representative Florida longleaf pine chronologies and compare the strength of seasonwood and total ring width chronologies, finding that latewood growth had stronger climatic correlations, but not stronger crossdating. Then, I used correlation analyses to identify the primary climatic drivers of tree growth and found summer precipitation had a positive effect and summer temperature had a negative effect at a majority of sites, although there was no climatic variable at any season length with exact effects on tree growth across sites. Finally, I used linear mixed effects models to estimate how the climatic drivers interact with fire to affect individual tree growth. I identified unique effects from fire seasonality, with negative effects due to dormant season burning at 60% of sites. I found positive effects from fire in the previous year in 60% of sites. In many cases, fire reversed or neutralized the effect of climate, suggesting unique implications for management under climate change. By using ecologically representative samples, I show how climate and fire interact differently to affect tree growth and highlight variability in ecosystem function across communities and sites. 
Finally, I investigate immediate hurricane impacts to stand structure at four sites after experiencing an unprecedented Category 5 storm, which exemplifies the growing threats the longleaf pine ecosystem faces under anthropogenic climate change. I used variable-area transects and generalized linear mixed-effects models to estimate tree densities and logistic regression to estimate mortality by size class. I found at least 28% of the global total remaining extent of the longleaf pine ecosystem was affected in Florida alone. Mortality was highest in medium sized trees (30-45 cm dbh) and ranged from 4.6-15.4% at sites further from the storm center, but increased to 87.8% near the storm center. As the frequency and intensity of extreme events increases, management plans to mitigate the effects of climate change need to account for large-scale stochastic mortality events to preserve critical habitats. Even where protected, critical habitats are vulnerable to the effects of climate change.

            <DISS_para>This dissertation contains two related parts. The first part focuses on affine lines, and the second part is about affine planes. In the first part, it develops tools for statistical analysis on spaces of affine lines. Motivated by the problem of dimension reduction for high-dimensional dynamic data, it develops a natural mathematical representation of affine lines, endowed with a convenient Riemannian structure for computing basic quantities such as geodesics, sample means, and tangent PCA. It adapts recent works for constructing Be ́zier curves on Riemannian manifolds to this representation space and develops a tool for fitting smooth trajectories in the space of affine lines. Finally, it provides techniques to compare such trajectories resulting from different measurements in a manner that is invariant to the parameterizations of these trajectories. These individual tools together form a comprehensive toolbox for representing and analyzing large dynamical systems as low-dimensional objects. We demonstrate this toolbox using a number of examples from real and simulated data. In the second part, we apply a similar statistical analysis procedure on affine planes, such as developing a representation space of affine planes, equipping a Riemannian structure on it, and illustrating statistical analysis through some real and simulated datasets.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The goal of this bibliographic study is to evaluate the complementariness of the Transportation Research Journal Series (Parts A – F) using various natural language processing techniques. First, large-scale bibliographic data, such as paper titles, abstracts, publication dates, and other metadata, were obtained from the Transportation Research International Documentation (TRID), the largest bibliographic database for transportation research. All papers published in Transportation Research (Parts A-F) between 2010 and 2020 were included. Second, after data preprocessing, a topic model, namely the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), was employed to discover latent transportation research topics and further reveal the correlation between transportation research topics and different parts of TR. Third, with topic distributions as features, various classification algorithms (e.g., logistic regression and support vector machines) were developed to predict the most probable TR part a given abstract is from. The accuracy of a classification algorithm could thus be used to assess the complementarity of the six parts of TR. One practical value of this study is that transportation researchers can better understand how various topics are aligned with the scopes of TR journals.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The goal of this dissertation is to improve the predictive performance of a Bayesian hierarchicalstatistical model by incorporating an estimate of the expected out-of-sample error and extending
this method for big data. In Chapter 2, we view the problem of prediction of a latent real-valued
mean as a model selection problem, where the candidate models are all values in the parameter
space for the mean of the data. Specifically, we select a subset of our Bayesian hierarchical statistical
model’s parameter space with high predictive performance (as measured by a criterion). Explicitly,
we truncate the joint support of the data and the parameter space of a given Bayesian hierarchical
model to only include small values of the covariance penalized error (CPE) criterion. The CPE is
a general expression that contains several information criteria as special cases. Simulation results
show that as long as the truncated set does not have near-zero probability, we tend to obtain
a lower mean squared error than Bayesian model averaging. Additional theoretical results are
provided for the foundation for these observations. We apply our approach to a dataset consisting
of American Community Survey (ACS) period estimates to illustrate that this perspective can lead
to improvements of a single model. In Chapter 3, we use cross-validation as an estimate for CPE.
Cross-validation is particularly useful in the big data context because subsampling the data into
training and hold-out data naturally reduces the size of the training dataset. From this perspective,
we propose a statistical model using the recently introduced data subset model and subset model
formulation. Several theoretical results of our truncated data subset model have been presented.
Additionally, we implement our approach to a CO2 dataset and compare the performance with
different spatial predictors. Chapter 4 contains a discussion</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This dissertation investigates the relationship between socialism, nationalism, and the working class in the British and American contexts during the early 20th century, with a particular emphasis on syndicalism and revolutionary industrial unionism. By examining the role of migration in the development of labor movements and the spread of ideas across the British world, this study highlights the significance of transnational networks in shaping the experiences of workers and the diffusion of syndicalist and industrial unionist ideologies. Key figures such as James Connolly and the Irish working-class movement are analyzed to explore the interplay between socialism, nationalism, and labor. The dissertation also delves into the role of unskilled workers in Dublin's labor movement and the impact of the Housing Question on the working class during the Irish Revolution. The study concludes with an examination of the events leading up to the Easter Rising, the role of the working class in the militarization of Irish society, and the broader implications of these developments on the labor movement. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the complexities of labor movements in the British and American contexts during the early 20th century and underscore the importance of transnational connections in the development and spread of labor-related ideologies. </DISS_para>
