         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Florida is more at risk of sea level rise (SLR) and climate change compared with any other state in the United States. Due to its heavily populated coastal districts, moderately sloping low-lying geography, and strategic economic significance, Miami-Dade County, located in the southeast of Florida, is especially susceptible to SLR and climate change. Miami, which is the county's main metropolis, is frequently listed as one of the most susceptible and prone cities in the world to marine and groundwater flooding. Biscayne aquifer, the extremely pervious and porous (mostly limestone), is overlaid by Miami-Dade County which serves as the principal supply of drinkable water in the area. Thus, it is vital to evaluate the potential impacts of climate change and SLR on the aquifer. This work aimed to assess the response of the Biscayne aquifer to climate change and SLR. An existing coupled groundwater and surface water model has been used for this purpose. The model was built utilizing current hydraulic and hydrogeological data as well as an estimate of where the freshwater and seawater interface is located. The model is based on the MODFLOW-NWT. The projected rainfall values derived from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 (CMIP6) and SLR values from the literature were introduced in the model. The model does not have a user interface and this python programming and geographical information system (GIS) tools were utilized to process and present the input and output data. 
The findings reveal the impacts of climate change and SLR are marine and groundwater flooding and saltwater intrusion. The seawater will flood about 1241 km2 of coastal areas nearly 42 percent of onshore areas in 2069 under worst scenario due to SLR combined with low topography. Due to the high-water table brought on by SLR, roughly 2082 km2 the area is also vulnerable to groundwater floods. Although it is anticipated that water consumption would rise due to population expansion, saltwater intrusion limits the amount of freshwater that is available, making it unpredictable when households will have access to water. Therefore, while developing policies and plans for the county, policymakers and planners must consider the dangers brought on by SLR and climate change.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Inclusion in the schools has been mandated since the passing of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act in 1975 (EAHCA ; Public Law 94-142). Within the field of music education, historical events like the Tanglewood Symposium of 1967, the Goals and Objectives (GO) Project of 1969, and the Housewright Symposium of 1999 aimed to achieve the best and most equitable music education for all students (Madsen, 2000). Yet, for decades, music teachers have felt underprepared to teach students with disabilities (Cooper, 1999; Darrow, 1999; McCord &amp; Watts, 2010; Salvador, 2010; VanWeelden &amp; Whipple, 2014a). Researchers have examined music teachers’ perceptions of their preparation for teaching learners with disabilities (Davila, 2013; Gilbert &amp; Asmus, 1981; Hammel, 2001a), university curricula for special education coursework (Colwell &amp; Thompson, 2000; Culp &amp; Salvador, 2021; Salvador, 2010), and pre-service fieldwork experiences in inclusive settings (Bartolome, 2017; Smith &amp; Wilson, 1999; VanWeelden &amp; Whipple, 2005a). Elementary music teachers have felt especially challenged to meet the diverse needs of their students (Allan, 2020a; Grimsby, 2020a; Hammel, 2001a).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The primary purpose of this study was to examine elementary music teachers' perceptions of their preparation to teach students with disabilities. Its secondary purpose was to examine elementary music teachers' perceptions of their preparation so to reduce the three inclusion barriers – organizational, knowledge, and attitudinal – as defined by Adamek and Darrow (2018) when teaching students with disabilities. Data were collected through a researcher-created, web-based survey, which had four sections: (a) Organizational Strategies; (b) Disability, Legislative, and Interprofessional Knowledge; (c) Attitudes Towards Teaching Students with Disabilities; and (d) Open-Ended Questions. The first three sections of the survey aligned with the three inclusion barriers (Adamek &amp; Darrow, 2018). For the first two sections of the survey, participants indicated their perceptions of their preparation for organizational strategies and inclusion knowledge. In the third section, participants rated attitude statements; and in the fourth section, participants responded to short-answer questions in their own words. Participants (N = 87) were members of NAfME who indicated “elementary” as a teaching area and were from all six NAfME regions of the United States. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and a Friedman test, and qualitative data were examined through a coding process.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Results of this study suggested that music teachers need music content-specific preparation to teach students with disabilities and that a lack of training might be negatively affecting teachers’ attitudes towards teaching students with special needs. Most participants received their training outside of college through professional development opportunities, and most of the preparation at the undergraduate level was outside of the music department. Participants’ ratings of specific organizational strategies and inclusion knowledge revealed areas that might need further attention in music teacher preparation programs. Ratings of attitude statements showed music teachers’ desire and willingness to create the best opportunities for students with disabilities, but that they lacked preparation to do so. An analysis of participants’ open-ended comments supported quantitative results and prior literature findings. Implications and suggestions for future research are discussed.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Individuals form global attitudes toward their romantic partners that can have important implications for their subsequent relationship processes and outcomes. However, individuals likely hold other attitudes toward their partners’ specific qualities and characteristics (e.g., their weight, their race) that may interact with their global partner attitudes to predict relationship processes like partner-directed behaviors. I first examined this possibility in one dyadic study of newlywed couples, focusing on one partner quality toward which individuals tend to hold negative attitudes: obesity. When individuals had heavier partners and held relatively negative global attitudes toward their partners, more negative attitudes toward obesity were associated with more negative partner-directed behaviors. However, when individuals had heavier partners but held relatively positive global attitudes toward their partners, these positive global partner attitudes buffered against any deleterious effects of negative obesity attitudes on partner-directed behaviors. In a second study, I examined whether such effects extended to another partner quality: race. Contrary to predictions, participants’ global partner attitudes, attitudes toward Black people, and their partner’s race did not interact to predict partner-directed behaviors. Implications and future directions are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Owing to the onset of applications of technological devices in our everyday life, lanthanide elements are becoming continuously important. Traditionally known as rare earth metals, lanthanides (Ln) are categorized as critical materials by the technological companies. Their broad utilizations comprise catalysis, permanent magnetics, phosphorus, etc. Ln help creating clean energy by being employed in electric vehicles and technological devices like smartphones. The massive usages of Ln in industry, however, could have a drastic impact on the sustainable use of these elements. Thus, one needs to address this issue by studying the lanthanide separation where we can recover them and provide more resources for their re-use. This viral use of employment of lanthanides in high-tech economies and the limited understanding of their coordination environment will present new opportunities for lanthanide recycling from waste separation techniques. Historically, trivalent lanthanides were thought to be the only accessible oxidation state of these element, however, after successful synthesis of the divalent species nearly a decade ago, they start to attract lanthanide chemists. Becoming a new emerging subfield of lanthanides, divalent lanthanides (Ln2+) are still lacking many experimental and theoretical aspects of which thermodynamics properties are very important and make the experimental studies challenging since Ln2+ are very unstable species. This complexity introduces new opportunities to engage theoretical studies to uncover the complex behavior of these newlygrowing subfield of Ln. Chapter 1 will provide background information on the lanthanides, as well as their importance, applications, and the need for recycling them. Information regarding the need and challenges for theoretical studies of these elements is discussed. Chapter 2 builds a theoretical foundation for studying the divalent lanthanides theoretically. Given
the dynamics aspects of Ln2+ are of important and interest, potentials were developed for AMOEBA force field which is necessary to use in molecular dynamics (MD) simulation for solving Newton’s equation of motion. Since water is of great importance from many aspects, hydration of the two most stable Ln2+, Sm2+ and Eu2+, as well as their coordination
environment and phenomena affecting the coordination like water exchange mechanism is studied and analyzed in depth. Details about the coordination environment of high concentration of Sm/EuCl2 salts are provided, too. After paving the path for theoretical studies of Ln2+, chapter 3 lays the ground for studying the complexation of several Ln2+, Sm2+, Eu2+, Dy2+ and Yb2+, and one divalent actinide, Cf2+ and their halide (Cl−, Br−, I−) salts with dicyclohexano-18-crown-6 (DCH18C6) in two different solvents, tetrahydrofurane (THF) and acetonitrile. DCH18C6 is a promising crown ether that is used in an industrial scale in lanthanide separation. This crown ether has five common diastereoisomers of which cis−syn−cis, cis−anti−cis are the best complexants. Being able to form a bowl shape, the trans − anti − trans is also added to our study to observe if encapsulating the cations would lead to a better complexation compare with the mentioned diastereoisomers. It is worth mentioning that the latter diastereoisomer is not well studied like the other two. As such, the first step is to parameterize the mentioned new cations plus THF and DCH18C6 for AMOEBA force field. In the next step, MD simulations were carried to see the conformational changes of all diastereoisomers in the solvents. In addition, the Ln trend for both acids and bases were studied with Dy, Yb and Cf. Following the MD simulation, to gain better insight into the selectivity of these diastereosiomers, binding free energy calculations were performed with Bennet’s acceptance ratio (BAR) method for SmBr2 systems in the absence of experimental values. Chapter 4 demonstrates the complexation of Sm2+ and Eu2+ and their halide (Cl−, Br−, I−) salts with a larger crown ether, dibenzo-30-crown-10 (DB30C10). This crown ether shows larger conformational fluctuation because of having a larger polyether ring. As such, conformational analysis from both energy and structure
points of view has been done. Moreover, for comparing the complexation of this crown ether with the one mentioned in chapter 3, binding free energy of SmBr2 is calculated and reported without a direct comparison with experimental value. Finally, chapter 5 will provide the concluding remarks by comparing the obtained results.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Selective crystallization offers new opportunities for separating lanthanide elements, which have considerable importance in advanced materials. The first part is the second and third chapters, which investigated that the coordination chemistry and selective crystallization of Ln3+ cations with the water-soluble ligand, 5-(pyrimidyl)tetrazolate (pmtz−), dtp2− (H2dpt = 2,3-di-1H-tetrazol-5-ylpyrazine) and H2ibt− (H3ibt = 4,5-bis(tetrazole-5-yl)imidazole). In the second chapter, the wide range of coordination modes of pmtz allows for discrimination between Ln3+ cations, and five distinct compound types can be prepared that are dependent on the lanthanide employed, [La(pmtz)2(H2O)6]Cl (S1), [Ln(pmtz)3(H2O)3]·(3+n)H2O (Ce3+and Pr3+, S2). [(Ce(pmtz)2(H2O)3)2(μ-pmtz)]∙11H2O (S3), [(Ln(pmtz)2(H2O)3)2(μ-pmtz)]2(pmtz)2∙14H2O (Nd3+ and Sm3+, S4) and [Ln(H2O)8](pmtz)3·3H2O (Dy3+ to Lu3+, S5). This selective crystallization of Ln3+ cations based primarily on ionic radii provides a simple method for achieving group separations. The third chapter describes a series of lanthanides with two water-soluble tetrazolate-based ligands, dtp2− and H2ibt−. These ligands allow the separation of Nd3+ and Dy3+ through selective crystallization. The reactions of Ln3+ with the ligand Na2(dtp)·2H2O lead to two distinct phases, Na[Ln(dtp)(H2O)8](dtp)∙H2O (Lndtp1, Ln = La−Pr) and [Ln(H2O)8](Hdtp)(dtp)∙H2O (Lndtp2, Ln = Nd, Sm−Lu). Three structure types [Ln(H2ibt)2(H2O)6](H2ibt)·3(H2O) (Lnibt1, Ln = La, Ce), [Ln(H2ibt)((H2O)7](H2ibt)2·4(H2O) (Lnibt2, Ln = Pr, Nd), and [Ln(Hibt)(H2ibt)(H2O)4]·4+x(H2O) (Lnibt3, Ln = Sm−Lu) are obtained from reacting Ln3+ and Na(H2ibt)·3(H2O). Changing the pyrazine core in H2dtp to imidazole in H3ibt leads to different phases for Nd (Lnibt2) and Dy (Lnibt3), which allows for a crystallization-based separation of Nd/Dy in a short separation time.The second part is fourth, fifth, seventh chapters, which focus on the coordination of tetrazolate ligands with plutonium, reporting that the salt metathesis reaction of 5-(Pyrimidyl)Tetrazolate (pmtz‒), 2,3-di-1H-tetrazolate-5-ylpyrazine (dtp2‒), 5-(2-Pyridyl)-tetrazolate (pdtz‒) and 1,3-di(tetrazolate-5-yl)benzene (m-dtb2‒) with hydrated 239PuBr3 in an aqueous solution gives the mononuclear compound [239Pu(pmtz)3(H2O)3]·(3+n)H2O (n = ~8), dinuclear compound, [(Pu(pmtz)2(H2O)3)2(μ-pmtz)]2(pmtz)2∙14H2O,
xxvi
[239Pu(pdtz)3(H2O)3]·3.5(H2O), [Pu(m-dtbH)(H2O)8](m-dtb)·11(H2O) and [Pu(H2O)9](m-dtbH)3·9(H2O). All these plutonium compounds were synthesized and characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, in addition to solid-phase and solution UV–vis–NIR absorption spectroscopy. The comparisons between these compounds and their lanthanide isostructural complexes demonstrate the bonding differences between lanthanide and actinide ions of identical ionic radii. The Laporte-forbidden 5f → 5f transitions are assigned in the UV-VIS-NIR spectra for these f-element-tetrazolate coordination compounds.
The sixth chapter is about the synthesis and characterization of Am1, [Am(pdtz)3(H2O)3]·3.5(H2O) through single-crystal X-ray diffraction, solid-phase, solution UV–vis–NIR absorption spectroscopy and pressure study. The comparisons between Am1 and its lanthanide isostructural complexes demonstrate the bonding differences between lanthanide and actinide ions of identical ionic radii. The Laporte-forbidden 5f → 5f transitions are assigned in the UV-VIS-NIR spectra for Am1. Also, with the increasing of the pressure, the broad, split and blue shift of these transition from 8S7/2 are observed. The seventh chapter concludes the dissertation.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Declines in iron status are frequently reported in those who regularly engage in strenuous physical activity. A proposed reason is increases in the iron regulatory hormone hepcidin, which functions to inhibit dietary iron absorption and can be induced by the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6. Prolonged physical activity results in an inflammatory response, and circulating hepcidin is consistently shown to increase with physical activity &gt;60 min in duration, typically peaking 3-6 h following completion of exercise. Thus, physically active individuals may experience declines in iron status overtime due to reduced dietary iron absorption. However, current evidence using stable iron isotopes is conflicting on whether dietary iron absorption decreases in the post-exercise state. Furthermore, while inflammatory signaling of hepcidin is the leading hypothesis for post-exercise increases in hepcidin, evidence suggests that gluconeogenic signals in response to low energy availability may also contribute. In Chapter 1, the literature is reviewed on hepcidin’s regulation of systemic iron homeostasis and its proposed role in the declines in iron status with physical activity, with a particular emphasis on the mechanisms that induce hepcidin. Chapter 2 details a published study that sought to determine the effects of a prolonged bout of running on hepcidin and dietary iron absorption, compared to rest, in trained collegiate cross country runners. Following the run, circulating hepcidin increased and dietary iron absorption decreased compared to the rest condition, however, evidence for inflammatory signaling of hepcidin was not convincing. These findings provided rationale for the study in Chapter 3, which aimed to investigate the contribution of REDD1, a known target of IL-6 and gluconeogenic hormone signals, on the responses of hepcidin and its regulators following prolonged treadmill running. Liver mRNA expression of hepcidin and its regulators were measured in REDD1 knockout and wildtype mice after rest or 1, 3, or 6 h recovery from 60 min treadmill running. Both treadmill running and REDD1 knockout increased expression of hepcidin, gluconeogenic regulators of hepcidin, and markers of gluconeogenesis. Moreover, hepcidin was correlated with gluconeogenic regulators of hepcidin and markers of gluconeogenesis, indicating a possible role of gluconeogenic signaling of hepcidin following prolonged physical activity. Findings presented in this dissertation indicate that post-exercise increases in hepcidin may lead to declines in iron status due to decreased dietary iron absorption following exercise. Second, post-exercise hepcidin may be influenced by gluconeogenic signaling in the post-exercise state, which potentially informs dietary strategies to mitigate the post-exercise hepcidin response and prevent declines in iron status with frequent physical activity.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Chromatin profiling in single cells has been extremely challenging and almost exclusively limited to histone proteins. In cases where single cell methods have shown promise, many require highly specialized equipment or cell type specific protocols and are relatively low throughput. Here, we combine the advantages of tagmentation, linear amplification and combinatorial indexing to produce a high throughput single cell DNA binding site mapping method that is simple, inexpensive, and capable of multiplexing several independent samples per experiment. Targeted Insertion of Promoters (TIP-seq) uses Tn5 fused to protein A to insert a T7 RNA polymerase promoter adjacent to a chromatin-bound protein of interest. Linear amplification of flanking DNA with T7 polymerase provides much higher starting material prior to sequencing library preparation and yields &gt;10-fold higher unique reads per single cell compared to other methods. We apply TIP-seq to map histone modifications, RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) and transcription factor CTCF binding sites in single human and mouse cells, and demonstrate proof-of-principle for haplotype-phased protein-DNA interaction mapping. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Individuals with posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) have been shown to use a variety of safety behaviors to manage their distress. When used in the absence of true threat, safety behaviors serve to maintain PTSS by preventing the individual from collecting disconfirming evidence about the dangerousness of the situation. Thus, individuals with PTSS may benefit from eliminating their maladaptive safety behavior use. The current study aimed to develop and evaluate a brief, computer-based safety behavior reduction intervention, Safety Behavior Elimination for Traumatic Stress (SBETS). Seventy-four participants were recruited based on lifetime trauma exposure and elevated PTSS. Participants were randomly assigned to the SBETS condition or a physical health control condition (Modifiable Behavior Intervention [MoBI]). At the end of the intervention, participants selected two behaviors to reduce or eliminate over the coming month. Participants were sent reminders to reduce those behaviors twice a week, and treatment outcomes were assessed at two-week and one-month follow-up. Hierarchical linear regressions demonstrated significantly greater reductions in safety behavior use at two-week follow-up in the SBETS condition, as compared to MoBI. Further, individuals in the SBETS condition demonstrated significantly greater reductions in PTSS at one-month follow-up. Additionally, change in two-week safety behavior use fully mediated the relationship between treatment condition and one-month PTSS. The current study was limited by its relatively homogenous sample and brief follow-up period. Despite its limitations, results suggest that SBETS has a significant effect on safety behavior usage and PTSS, and may represent an acceptable, accessible treatment option for future trauma survivors. Additional research is needed to establish the efficacy of the SBETS intervention among diverse trauma-exposed populations.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Women have historically been underrepresented in the field of trumpet, including as performers, trumpet pedagogues, and composers. For many collegiate trumpet studios, standard repertoire includes works predominantly written by men. This canon is self-perpetuating, as it is easy to obtain music from the standard repertoire and it is natural to perform and assign repertoire for study that is familiar. There are many works by women that can positively supplement existing repertoire taught in the collegiate trumpet studio setting and can contribute to a balance of standard and newer works. This treatise investigates the pedagogical value and uses of eight 21st-century works for solo trumpet by women: “Fantasia” by Lauren Bernofsky, “Sonata for Trumpet and Piano” by Elaine Fine, “Trumpet Songs” by Jennifer Higdon, “Framed” by Cecilia McDowall, “Golden Hour” by Cait Nishimura, “Kupala Night” by Elizabeth Raum, “Stories for Our Time” by Faye-Ellen Silverman, and “Nostalgia” by Barbara York. While there are countless valuable works composed by women to be studied, the works selected for this document are meant to represent a varied group of styles, difficulty levels, and potential pedagogical uses. Biographical background is given for each composer accompanied by a pedagogical discussion of their work and basic programming information, including challenges regarding flexibility, range, endurance, technique, articulation, musicality, coordination with accompaniment, and potential use of each work in a collegiate trumpet studio setting. Advice on addressing pedagogical challenges and suggestions of books, etudes, and exercises that can assist with preparation of these works are provided.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Environmentally conscious science education is of great importance due to dramatic anthropogenic effects on the environment.  The World Health Organization reports 25% of children deaths, ages five and under, are the direct result of pollution (Osseiran &amp; Chirscaden, 2017). Anthropogenic climate change has resulted in the higher severity and frequency of storms.  The damage from Hurricane Michael caused $8+ billion in damages to Florida excluding flood damage (Associated Press, 2018).  Despite overwhelming scientific consensus, anthropogenic environmental issues, especially global climate change, the topic is still politically debated (Oreskes, 2004).  The National Science Teachers’ Association released a study, in which they find science teachers feel uncomfortable teaching politically contentious material without a scientist present (NSTA, 2017). Melillo, Richmond, and Yohe (2014) report that “because environmental, cultural, and socioeconomic systems are tightly coupled, climate change impacts can either be amplified or reduced by cultural and socioeconomic decisions” (p.5).  UNESCO’s Global Education Monitoring Report states “increased educational attainment helps transform lives by reducing poverty, improving health outcomes, advancing technology and increasing social cohesion. It can also enable individuals to better cope with, and reduce their vulnerability to, the dangers associated with climate change” (UNESCO, 2016, p.10).  There have been a few case studies which support these assertions.  Schools have been able to make substantial environmental changes through collective community engagement (Howley et al., 2011; McNeal et al., 2017; Schelly et al., 2012). While these case studies represent the limited research regarding environmental science teachers, there is little to no research on EPD and how teachers choose to expand their environmental science knowledge.  McNeal et al., interviewed middle school science teachers who actively taught issues surrounding anthropogenic environmental issues – most often anthropogenic global climate change (2017). In this study, McNeal et al. found that teachers were most influenced by direct experiences with environmental issues.  This study will focus on teachers who have actively chosen environmental professional development (EPD) programs, in an attempt to ascertain more in-depth information about the reasons teachers have to take EPD and if/how it changes classroom instruction.

            <DISS_para>The purpose of this paper was to examine the relationship between childhood maltreatment, dysfunctional career thinking (DCT), and career adaptability. The primary goal of this paper was to explore the potential overlap between the long-term impact of childhood maltreatment and the potential link to an individual’s dysfunctional career thinking and career adaptability. The present study explored the relationship between childhood maltreatment using the Maltreatment and Abuse Chronology of Exposure (MACE; Teicher &amp; Parigger, 2015), dysfunctional career thinking using the Career Thoughts Inventory (CTI; Sampson et al., 1996a), and career adaptability using the Career Adapt-Abilities Scale (Savickas &amp; Pofeli, 2012). </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The aim of this work is to understand the relation between pulse parameters, plasma characteristics and chemical synthesis/degradation of organic and inorganic compounds. Plasma properties include electron density and electron temperature. Electron density varying in a single pulse was calculated using the Stark broadening of H-Balmer series lines i.e., H_α and H_β. Electron temperature was calculated using the line intensity ratio method. PFOA was used as an example to understand the relationship between plasma characteristics and chemical degradation of organic compounds. Two nanosecond pulsed power supplies with varying frequency between 1-100kHz and pulse width between 40-200ns were used to study the degradation of PFOA to form F-. Degradation of PFOA was directly correlated to the peak electron density. Also, in this work NO was used as OH scavenger to understand oxidative pathways in our continuous gas-liquid flow film reactor. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Anxiety among teachers is an important area to study because of the potential for anxious teachers to pass their anxiety to some of their students. From a growing body of research, we see that both preservice and practicing elementary school teachers can also experience anxiety when teaching math. Given that elementary school teachers often teach all school subjects, it is possible that this anxiety about teaching is not distinct for math but could also be experienced when teaching other subjects as well, especially when teachers are early in their careers. From the current literature, we also see that these levels of anxiety, whether about math or about teaching, can vary depending on the grade level the teacher is teaching as well as how long a teacher has been teaching. Using a sample of 296 kindergarten through third-grade teachers, we examine if teachers’ general math anxiety and anxiety about teaching math differ depending on the grade level they teach and the length of time they have been teaching, and whether teachers’ anxiety about teaching varies by school subject, the grade level they teach, or by the length of time they have been teaching. We found that teachers of earlier grades had more general math anxiety than teachers of upper grades. We also found that the 281 teachers who taught multiple subjects not only experience anxiety when teaching math, but also when teaching other subjects as well, especially at the upper grades. For these teachers, gaining teaching experience was associated with decreases in anxiety when teaching different school subjects. These findings provide evidence for future studies examining anxiety experienced by elementary school teachers who not only teach math, but who teach other subjects as well.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This paper addresses the role of tuition on retention rates for full-time students across in 2 and 4-year public institutions in the United States.  Multiple regression on tuition variables was performed by using institutional data on demographic, pre-college characteristics, and institutional characteristics as controls.  The results show that an increase in tuition for low-income students reduces retention rates for 2- and 4-year public institutions.  Additionally, an increase in institution profits off full-time students’ credit hours decreases retention rates at 2-year public institutes.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation examines market-based shifts in moral reasoning within nineteenth-century England’s lucifer matchstick industry. Lucifers were the first widely-produced friction matches, able to be struck on any surface thanks to a compound including elemental (also called white or yellow) phosphorus on the matchstick head. Unfortunately, it was recognized very early in the industry’s life that workers exposed to white phosphorus were at risk of developing a gruesome jaw disease. Osteonecrosis of the jaw, colloquially referred to as “phossy jaw”, caused gum soreness, tooth loss, bone deterioration, and, in the most serious cases, death. As I argue, over the history of lucifer manufacture, the moral dilemma of industrial disease came to be addressed as a market problem that required a market solution. By focusing on primary sources and moral responses in the early lucifer industry, this dissertation traces the development of a market-based moral response to phossy jaw. I argue that the moral solutions to the dilemmas of the matchstick industry preserved a host of harmful arrangements while casting them in the optimistic light of progress towards a just market. In short, the market could not solve the problems that the market was causing.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In order to clarify this dynamic, I build on Karl Polanyi’s theory of the double movement of marketization and protectionism that came to be characteristic of market society. Over the course of the nineteenth century, the move to treat “the market” as something separate from society that also ought to arrange society, had deleterious effects on the social bonds between human beings. The requirement to work for a wage and the imperative to produce commodities to sell at profit required that human activity and nature be treated as commodities. On a large scale, this resulted in harm to people and the environment, but this harm was addressed through social, political, and legal forms of protectionism that addressed the damage while preserving the market imperatives that caused it. On a smaller scale, phossy jaw and the lucifer industry provide a case study in the ways that this grand movement impacted the daily lives of children, women, and men who produced matchsticks.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>After the introduction, the next two chapters tell the history of two constants in the industry: the production of phosphorus-tipped matchsticks and phossy jaw. Chapter Two is the history of phosphorus production from its discovery to its application in matchstick manufacture. Chapter Three, “A Grinning Death’s Head”, analyzes several early medical reports of the disease itself and contains graphic accounts of the disease and its clear link to lucifer production. Chapters Four and Five illustrate the ways that responses to the industry’s dilemmas preserved the production of a harmful commodity while casting its preservation as a moral good using the emerging categories of the logic of the market. Chapter Four uses Henry Mayhew’s London Labour and the London Poor to illustrate the wide-ranging reach of the industry, from factory laborers to street laborers. Mayhew’s work witnesses to the ways that, in Polanyian terminology, the social was being subsumed to the demands of the market. Mayhew illustrates the interconnectedness of society even while categorizing human activity in market terms, thereby reproducing the conditions necessary for society to become arranged to primarily support commodity production. Chapter Five examines the ways that a factory commissioner’s report in the early 1860s provides the moral framework to justify the continued production of lucifers. The report does so by changing every aspect of the industry except the commodity itself. The conclusion illustrates the ways that these approaches solved the problem of phossy jaw without ever solving the problem of phossy jaw and, more broadly, the way that market-based solutions failed to solve market-induced moral dilemmas.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>School librarians are specialized educators who lead technology initiatives and who adjust their programs annually to local and national trends.  The profession’s changing nature requires perpetual learning unmatched in other educator positions.  In this survey study, school librarians reported their perceptions of professional learning in Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, and LinkedIn using a quantitative questionnaire.  In addition, participants described their perceptions through comments.  The study sought answers to three research questions: 1) how do school librarians perceive user roles, activities, motives and barriers in different platforms used for professional learning, 2) how do results compare among platforms, and 3) how do results divided into user roles align across platforms.  This multi-factor research captured four-facets of professional learning in one study, creating platform and user role profiles.  Most participants used multiple platforms for learning, but they used platforms differently.  Twitter and Facebook were the most popular platforms, followed by Instagram.  Most participants reported few habitual activities, but diverse motives.  Barriers were limited.  The Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram profiles indicated rich learning opportunities, whereas the Pinterest and LinkedIn profiles indicated narrow use.  Participants selected user roles based on their learning goals: Community Leader, Contributor, Networker, Active Lurker, and Passerby.  Most participants identified as Active Lurkers.  The user role profiles were more comprehensive than the traditional lurker-poster dichotomy.  The school librarian results affirmed many findings in educator populations, but also suggested differences may exist between the populations.  This exploratory study opens new avenues for population-specific research in how school librarians approach professional learning in a dynamic field.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Cigarette smoke is a known exacerbator of age-related pathologies such as cardiovascular (CV) disease, atherosclerosis, and cellular aging (senescence). However, the role of nicotine and its primary metabolite cotinine in these processes is yet to be elucidated. With the growing number of nicotine-containing aerosol use in recent years, the impact of nicotine on health is a relevant concern. A number of recent studies and health education sites focus on nicotine aerosol-induced adverse lung function, neglecting cardiovascular (CV) impairments and diseases. Critical review of the present scientific literature leads to the hypothesis that nicotine mediates the effects of cigarette smoke in the CV system by increasing mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling and cell migration, inflammation and oxidative stress through NADPH oxidase 1 (Nox1) to induce vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) senescence. Accumulation of senescent VSMCs in the atherosclerotic lesion cap is detrimental as it increases the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis by promoting an unstable plaque phenotype. Thus, nicotine, and most likely its metabolite cotinine, adversely influence atherosclerosis. In addition, changes in gut microbiota are associated with many diseases including CVD; an area not explored in relation to E-liquids. Other harmful compounds in E-cigarette aerosols include flavorings, which have been shown to negatively influence endothelial cells (ECs), however their effect on VSMCs remains to be elucidated. Thus, this dissertation tested the hypothesis that E-cigarette aerosols have similar sex-dependent detrimental effects as cigarette smoke in vascular senescence and atherosclerosis and that menthol exacerbates the effect of nicotine aerosols in the cardiovascular system and alters the gut microbiome in atherosclerotic ApoE-/- mice. The hypothesis was tested through two aims: aim 1 examined the role of sex in the effects of cigarette smoke in vascular senescence and atherosclerosis in vivo in ApoE-/- mice and in VSMCs function in vitro and aim 2 determined the contribution of E-cigarette aerosol components (vehicle, nicotine and menthol) to senescence and atherosclerosis and gut microbiome dysbiosis in ApoE-/- mice. Overall, we found aerosolized nicotine E-liquid exacerbated atherosclerosis and vascular senescence and caused changes in the gut microbiome in a sex-specific manner.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this treatise is to examine the phenomenon of embodied experience in selected solo piano works of five Black composers of the United States and United Kingdom: Shawn Okpebholo, Hannah Kendall, Brian Raphael Nabors, James Lee III, and Eleanor Alberga. I use the term “embodied experience” primarily to consider how their music embodies African American and African identity, memory, and cultural expression. I also use it to describe my perspective as a performer having studied and engaged deeply with these works.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Shawn Okpebholo	ψαλμοὶ καὶ ὕμνοι καὶ ᾠδαὶ πνευματικαί (2012), Amazing 	Grace (2006)
Hannah Kendall	Processional (2018)
Brian Raphael Nabors	Piano Sonata (2016), Nocturne (2022)
James Lee III 	Recuerdos Diaspoìricos (2018)
Eleanor Alberga	Jamaican Medley (1983), Oh Chaconne! (2014)</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The music of these five composers represents a synthesis of their cultural heritages, personal identities, musical backgrounds, values, and creative interests. Their piano works reflect the diversity of music by Black composers writing in the “classical contemporary” idiom. As the titles suggests, these works are shaped by both Western European and non-Western musical traditions, namely from East and West Africa, the United States, Papua New Guinea, the United Kingdom, Guyana, Australia, Cuba, and Jamaica. My treatise seeks to portray a balanced understanding of Black composers writing contemporary classical music and to promote further study of their music. Each chapter begins with biographical information and a summary of the composer’s musical style, followed by an analysis of their respective piano works focusing on style elements and aesthetic aspects as they relate to the idea of embodied experience. Throughout the discussions, I offer ways to approach and engage with this music, as well as my perspectives on ways it expands and enriches the canon. My conclusion chapter invites readers and performers to consider their own embodied experiences, as well as their roles as active participants in “culture care,” as they engage with music and everyday life. It also considers implications this music has for the classical music and future generations of Black musicians and composers.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Improving the accuracy and efficiency of methods has always been the pursuit of scientific computing. In this dissertation, we developed several methods to improve the computational efficiency and accuracy of Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT) and orbital-free density functional theory (OF-DFT). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Random-phase approximation (RPA) correlation functional greatly improved the accuracy of KS-DFT and has gained much attention. For example, RPA correlation energy gives more accurate lattice parameters and atomization energies of solids, producing reasonable phase transition pressure for the $\alpha$-$\gamma$ transition of cerium, and much-improved adsorption energies of CO molecule on various transition metal surfaces. In Chapter 2, we developed a stochastic method, based on the kernel polynomial method (KPM), to calculate the RPA correlation energy. To accelerate the sampling efficiency, we introduced an atom-based correlated sampling (ACS) scheme to accelerate the convergence of the energy-difference calculations of two similar systems. Our method may be applied to calculate the adsorption energies of molecules on transition metal surfaces in the future.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>OF-DFT is a promising tool for large-scale metal simulations. Its accuracy is determined by two factors: (a) the quality of the kinetic energy density functional (KEDF) and (b) the quality of the local pseudopotentials (LPSs). Compared to simple metals, it is challenging to develop reliable KEDFs and LPSs for transitional metals due to the localized d electrons. In Chapter 3, we built high-quality LPSs for both main-group and transition metals by letting the LPSs reproduce the atomic orbital energies and orbitals (beyond certain radii). For the magnetic systems (Fe, Co, and Ni), our LPSs are also required to reproduce the energy difference between the high-spin and non-spin atomic states. Our LPSs were tested against the projector augmented wave (PAW) and the all-electron (AE) results by calculating various phases' lattice constants, bulk moduli, and energies. Our LPSs agree well with the PAW and AE results in most cases. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Lastly, we collaborated with Prof. Biwu Ma’s group at the Florida State University to study the absorption and emission spectra of various binuclear platinum (II) complexes. Linear-response time-dependent density functional theory (LR-TDDFT) was used to explain the photophysical results of these complexes with various Pt-Pt interactions. It was found that strong Pt-Pt interactions lead to pronounced metal-to-ligand charge transfer absorptions in the lowest energy peaks (between 450 nm to 500 nm). </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The Spinozan theory of belief fixation is the result of some remarks made by Baruch Spinoza about the nature of the mind in The Ethics. Modern scientific methods applied to human minds have yielded evidence supporting Spinoza’s insights. In this dissertation, I explore some of the implications of the Spinozan theory of belief fixation. Insights from the Spinozan theory of belief fixation are applied to topics in epistemology, metaethics, meta normativity, and the nature of propaganda. Two appendices appear at the end. The first appendix provides a survey of the evidence supporting the Spinozan theory of belief fixation. The second appendix provides additional support for the claims made in chapter 2. The Spinozan theory of belief fixation is an interesting and provocative account of our cognitive architecture. Those who are interested in the Spinozan theory of belief fixation will find themselves with an embarrassment of riches when considering which of its myriad philosophical implications to explore. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>While rape and sexual violence is a topic that has been well-covered in the areas of Classics and Biblical Studies, there has been relatively little written about this subject that focuses exclusively on late Antique Christianity. Previous work in these fields has been oriented around legal definitions of rape in antiquity, the modern concept of consent, or theological engagement with biblical rape stories. This project uses modern philosophical approaches to sexual violence to analyze the rhetorical function of sexual violence in early Christian literature of primarily the 4th-6th centuries CE in the Latin West. The first two chapters explore how rape threats are used in fictionalized Christian literature, across a variety of genres, to shape expectations for appropriate behavior for Christian women. The threat of sexual violence is a tool deployed by anonymous authors and ecclesiastical and ascetic leaders, such as Ambrose of Milan and Jerome, to keep Christian women, and virgins in particular, in line. Sexual violence was not, however, merely an imaginary horror, but a very real one, too. Chapter three addresses the leap from the imagination to reality, and how ecclesiastical leaders like Augustine of Hippo and Pope Leo I addressed and categorized the raped virgins in their flock. This project offers a study of sexual violence across genres, across time, and across imagination and reality to demonstrate the rhetorical usefulness of sexual violence, both as a threat and as a lived experience, in early Christian literature. Sexual violence, and the threat thereof, helped shape the spiritual hierarchy of early Christian communities and revealed changing attitudes about physical embodiment, purity, and virginity. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation explores the time-dependent equation-of-motion coupled-cluster (TD-EOM-CC)framework for the accurate calculation of the excited electronic states within molecules, with a
focus on lowering the computational cost of the TD-EOM-CC time simulation. Chapter 1 is an
introductory chapter, presenting the mathematical foundation for the methods discussed, descrip-
tions of the treatment of the electronic ground state in Hartree-Fock and coupled-cluster theories,
and discussing the ways in which electronic excited states can be calculated in electronic structure
theory. Chapters 2 and 3 cover ways to reduce the computational cost of a TD-EOM-CC proce-
dure. First, because the choice of integrator has a significant effect on the cost of the simulation,
we study an implementation of the short iterative Lanczos (SIL) scheme as an integrator for TD-
EOM-CC methods and benchmark the cost and accuracy compared to the previously utilized 4th
order Runge-Kutta scheme. We then discuss the use of the core-valence separation (CVS) approx-
imation within the TD-EOM-CC framework for the calculation of core-electron excited states of
molecular systems. Chapter 4 outlines a TD-EOM-CC framework for the calculation of molecular
absorption spectra in the presence of finite external electric fields, and compares the stability of
propagation within a finite field and propagation where the light is treated perturbatively when
complex eigenvalues are present within the eigenspectrum.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>On a global scale, peatlands contain 530 ± 160 Pg carbon, which is equivalent to &gt;50% of the atmospheric pool. The fate of this enormous C reservoir could significantly impact the climate trajectory. Yet, two puzzling phenomena persist regarding C cycling dynamics in Sphagnum-rich peatlands (“bogs”): (1) their extraordinarily slow C mineralization rates; and (2) their high (relative to predicted) CO2:CH4 production ratios. This dissertation investigates three mechanisms thought to contribute to one or both phenomena. It also investigates the effects of temperature on C cycling dynamics within peat bogs and assesses the ability for incubation experiments to predict peatland climate responses. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The first mechanism that we investigated involves interactions between phenolic compounds and enzymes. We hypothesized that these interactions would significantly limit C mineralization rates in bogs given that (1) these interactions cause enzyme immobilization and decreased C mineralization rates; and (2) bogs are postulated to contain an abundance of phenolics. The second mechanism that we investigated, “non-enzymatic browning”, consists of a series of abiotic reactions involving a metabolite of Sphagnum spp. (galacturonic acid). Given its propensity to expel CO2 and limit bio-available nitrogen, we hypothesized that non-enzymatic browning would elevate CO2:CH4 production ratios and suppress overall decomposition rates in peat bogs. The third mechanism that we investigated, “organic matter hydrogenation”, involves the addition of H2 (a biproduct of fermentation) to organic matter. As organic matter hydrogenation has a higher energy yield than methanogenesis (which also uses H2), we hypothesized that this mechanism would elevate bog CO2:CH4 production ratios (via methane inhibition). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Using a combination of incubation experiments and field measurements, we determined that the extraordinarily slow C mineralization rates associated with bogs are influenced by both phenolic-enzyme interactions (mechanism 1)—which inhibited CO2 and CH4 production rates by 62 ± 16% and 54 ± 19, respectively—and non-enzymatic browning (mechanism 2)—which caused changes to the dissolved organic matter pool consistent with bioavailable N sequestration. We determined that non-enzymatic browning could also account for the high (relative to other peatland habitats) CO2:CH4 production ratios frequently observed in bogs—as evidenced by our observation that abiotic bog incubations with minimal hydrolytic enzyme content yielded CO2 production rates equivalent to ~8% of control treatments (bioactive) at 23℃. We demonstrated a positive and significant correlation between inferred indicators of organic matter hydrogenation (mechanism 3; based on analyses of dissolved organic carbon) and CO2:CH4 production ratios. While this finding is consistent with the hypothesis that organic matter hydrogenation elevates CO2:CH4 production ratios in bog peat, further research regarding our methodology is necessary for this hypothesis to be thoroughly assessed. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Using a series of temperature-controlled incubation experiments, we determined that production rates of CO2 and CH4 increase exponentially with temperature across a range of 1-26°C. Combining these results with seven years of field CH4 flux measurements, we assessed the extent to which soil temperature, alongside basic field data (water table position and permafrost depth), could accurately model CH4 emissions. The model produced yearly estimates that were within 5-60% of all measured values, or 5-34% when excluding two outlier years. These findings suggests that (1) three variables currently undergoing significant change—temperature, water table position, and permafrost depth— have a collectively significant effect on methane fluxes; (2) incubations can serve as useful tools for understanding this interplay; and (3) understanding the impact of additional variables (other than temperature, water table position, and permafrost depth) on methane fluxes could lead to improved model performance.   </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The main goal of the present work was to introduce a new conceptual framework for quantifying and classifying the environment by imposing a structure for sequencing contextual influences that echoes the study of genes. According to Bronfenbrenner’s Bioecological Model of Human Development (BMHD), children’s developmental outcomes are the result of an interplay of biological propensities that contribute to children’s individual characteristics and the many layers of environments in which children exist and interact with people and things. I proposed a framework for identifying and measuring context systematically based on the resources that provide the raw materials for proximal processes, the main drivers of development. Specifically, three resource categories were introduced: physical, social and symbolic, and they were defined and described within the context of the developmental outcome of reading achievement. Physical resources capture the tangible and intangible “stuff” that makes up the environment, including the actual physical spaces, structures, and items (i.e., books) that comprise a child’s context, as well as the quiet, space, and time needed for a child to interact with others. Social resources are the people within a child’s contexts, including their parents, siblings, teachers, peers and other social partners, as well as the knowledge, experience, ideals, beliefs, and attitudes of these social partners. Symbolic resources are the meaning and stability with which interactions are imbued, and they are characterized by the existence of routines and norms within a context, as well as a context’s overall climate, or feeling. For instance, the sense of safety and belonging a child feels as well as the qualities and actions that are celebrated and prioritized in an environment are examples of symbolic resources. In order to test this proposed framework for context, a proof-of-concept analysis was conducted using publicly available data from the US Census Bureau to capture the neighborhood environment and state-specific department of education websites, as well as the NCES and CRDC websites to capture the school environment. The study sample comprised 163 students (93 first graders and 70 second graders, Mage = 11.99 years old, SD = 2.22 years, 56% girls) from the National Project for Achievement in Twins, a federally-funded study exploring the development of reading and math skills in twins across the United States. A single twin was randomly chosen from each twin pair, and a total of 28 states were captured in the study sample. Reading was measured using the DIBELS Nonsense Word Fluency subtest. Neighborhood physical resources were captured by census tract-level measures of income, cost of living, household space, having health insurance, and household computer and internet access. Neighborhood social resources were captured by family size, percent couple-headed households, and percentage of coresident grandparents within a census tract. Neighborhood symbolic resources were captured by neighborhood climate, which was comprised of the educational attainment of residents within a census tract, as well as the percentage of residents on public assistance and unemployment, and rurality. School physical resources were captured by school-level average per pupil expenditure, student enrollment, and free or reduced-price lunch eligibility. School social resources were captured by pupil-teacher ratios, teacher quality (i.e., teacher experience, teacher certification) and peer composition and achievement influences at a given school (i.e., percent LEP students, percent LD students, average test score trend and average learning rate). School symbolic resources were captured by school climate, which was measured by student demographic density, the percentage of negative incidences at a school, and average student attendance. The analysis used to test the viability of this proposed framework for context was conditional inference random forest (RF-CI), a non-parametric analysis that allows for the use of different types of variables measured on a variety of scales. In support of the proposed contextual framework, the results of the RF-CI analysis, which explained 30% of the variance in NWF scores, demonstrated that all three resource categories (physical, social, and symbolic) are vital to include in a context-based prediction model of children’s early reading skills. Additionally, in line with the BMHD, the results showed that both proximal environments – neighborhoods and schools – not only play a role in children’s NWF performance separately, but they also work interactively to influence child outcomes. These results align with the idea that each environment is multifaceted and requires a systematic approach like the one presented here in order to make sure all aspects of a given contextual framework are accounted for, rather than zeroing in on only a single resource category. Thus, the proposed theoretical framework for measuring context systematically is recommended for future work exploring the influence of the environment on development. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Background: Aligning energy intake with the biological circadian rhythm and extending periods of fasting within a 24-h cycle improves whole-body metabolism. However, it is unknown if these improvements are related to changes in intestinal nutrient absorption. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of early time-restricted eating (eTRE) on energy and macronutrient digestibility, metabolizable energy, gastrointestinal (GI) function, and cardiometabolic health markers. Furthermore, we sought to determine predictive factors of digestibility. Methods: Healthy adults (n=16, age 31.1 ± 5.2 y, BMI 23.8 ± 3.4 kg/m2) participated in a 9-d randomized, crossover, controlled feeding trial where they followed an eTRE schedule (i.e., all calories consumed between 0800 and 1400) and a control eating schedule (i.e., all calories consumed between 0800 and 2000). After a 3-d acclimation to the study diet and eating schedule, all stool and urine were collected for 3-d. The energy content of the diet, stool, and urine was measured by bomb calorimetry and the results were used to calculate energy and macronutrient digestibility and metabolizable energy. An ingestible capsule was used to measure intestinal transit time and hydrogen gas production. Additional outcomes included resting energy expenditure, thermic effect of food, mean 24 h glucose, glucose variability, fasting and postprandial glucose, insulin, and lipids, and circadian gene expression. To determine the relationship between digestibility and GI function, components of energy expenditure, and cardiometabolic health markers, participants were dichotomized based on median digestibility (91.4%) during the control eating schedule and classified as an absorber (digestibility above median) or excreter (digestibility below median). Multivariable regression was used to assess predictors of energy digestibility. Results: When following a controlled, weight maintenance diet, eTRE had no impact on energy digestibility (eTRE, 91.7 ± 2.3% vs. CON, 91.7 ± 1.5%, P=0.97), metabolizable energy (eTRE, 88.0 ± 1.5% vs. CON, 87.8 ± 2.3%, P=0.71), whole-gut gastrointestinal transit time (eTRE, 23.3 ± 8.6 h vs. CON, 26.1 ± 8.6 h, P=0.32), or hydrogen production when normalized by transit time (eTRE, 4.2 ± 7.6 % H2 vs. CON, 1.4 ± 1.5 % H2, P=0.44) when compared to a control eating schedule, respectively. Compared to the control eating schedule, eTRE decreased 24 h glucose (eTRE, 95.0 ± 18.1 vs. CON, 101.1 ± 18.5 mg/dL; P&lt;0.0001), fasting glucose (eTRE, 87.3 ± 6.4 vs. CON, 93.6 ± 7.3 mg/dL; P=0.01), insulin (eTRE, 10.1 ± 3.9 vs. CON, 13.5 ± 7.4 µIU/mL; P=0.008), HOMA-IR (eTRE, 2.2 ± 0.9 vs. CON, 3.2 ± 1.7 mg/dL; P=0.001), VLDL-C (eTRE, 14.6 ± 6.9 vs. CON, 16 ± 6.1 mg/dL; P=0.03), and triglycerides (eTRE, 73.3 ± 34.1 vs. CON, 80.2± 30.3 mg/dL; P=0.03). eTRE did not affect resting energy expenditure (eTRE, 1484 ± 315 vs. CON, 1480 ± 321 kcals/d; P=0.75), thermic effect of food iAUC0-4h (P=0.59), or postprandial metabolism (iAUC0-4h, all metabolites P&gt;0.20). Lastly, after characterizing participants as an absorber (digestibility above median) or excreter (digestibility below median), absorbers had slower colonic transit time (absorber, 34.0 ± 15.8 h vs. excreter, 17.6 ± 9.5 h, P=0.04), greater glycemic variability (CV%: absorber, 21.9 ± 3.6 vs. excreter, 14.9 ± 3.3; P=0.002), and lower fasting insulin (absorber, 9.9 ± 4.5 vs. excreter, 17.1 ± 8.2 µIU/mL, P=0.05). Moreover, daily wet-weight (R2=0.79,P&lt;0.0001) and dry-weight (R2=0.78, P&lt;0.0001) stool production, glucose variability (R2=0.60, P=0.0007), colonic transit time (R2=0.40, P=0.02), age (R2=0.39, P=0.01), resting energy expenditure (R2=0.35, P=0.02), whole-gut transit time (R2=0.29, P=0.03), and gross energy intake (R2=0.28, P=0.04) were all predictive of digestibility. Conclusions: In this randomized, crossover trial in healthy adults, eTRE was more effective for reducing 24 h mean glucose, fasting glucose, insulin, insulin resistance, triglycerides, and VLDL-C. However, intestinal energy and macronutrient absorption were not impacted by eTRE. These findings suggest that changes in intestinal absorption do not seem to mediate the clinical benefits traditionally observed with eTRE. Intestinal absorption is an understudied component of nutrition and physiology. We found that energy digestibility was associated with gastrointestinal function and glucoregulatory factors. Determining factors that predict individual energy digestibility may aid in the development of personalized nutrition recommendations.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Online discourse facilitated by information and communication technologies (ICTs) has become a vital aspect of modern political life. Such discourse is heavily valued by politicians, corporations, and other political actors, with digital comment sections serving as popular hotspots of political debate for ordinary people. The comment sections of news sites have become a particularly meaningful host for partisan rhetoric, liminal experiences (temporary, space-specific, and personally impactful processes), and identity development for both conservative and liberal political actors. To investigate the political and uniquely liminal processes that guide this phenomenon, the top stories of two liberal-leaning and two conservative-leaning notable partisan U.S. news websites were collected for 53 concurrent days, as well as the comment sections of these stories, with 200 articles and 9575 comments studied in total. An inductive content analysis of emotional, political, civility and political themes, and chi-square tests of these conversations revealed the significance of “liminal browsing” and online political liminality in driving this phenomenon, while also illustrating specifics on how liminal and collective identities manifest in certain digital spaces. A “digital liminality framework” is established using these findings, one which highlights three key components: accessibility, encouragement, and feedback, as key to digital liminal behavior. I chiefly argue that certain digital spaces should be considered liminal environments in a similar capacity (and political capability) to physical liminal spaces. Collective identity behavior was useful in driving various behavioral trends throughout the sample, but was less impactful than predicted, and especially less influential when compared to liminal identity enactment and behavior, with key differences based on partisan influence. Participants in these forums used these liminal processes as a means of political identity development and attunement with partisan rhetoric, in ways that may not have been possible without the unique aspects of these liminal spaces aiding this process. These findings support the idea that online forums, as liminal spaces, keep ordinary citizens “connected and engaged” to political rhetoric over time, especially when these spaces provide a direct link to emerging political rhetoric. These findings have significance for the development of political culture within digital spaces, the importance of ICT-influenced liminal processes in informing identity development, and the future of the political significance of online forums. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Duocarmycin and other natural products that possess prominent anticancer properties are vital to understand for chemotherapy and other forms of treatment. With an ever expanding breadth of  reactions to design a synthesis from, there will always be room to improve prior total syntheses of small molecules. Our lab foresaw a  novel strategy that would encapsulate the pyridazine N-oxide photochemistry into a concise total synthesis in building the core framework of duocarmycin. While this thesis does not provide a synthesized route to the desired framework, an initial investigation has been accomplished in understanding and determining the reactivity of diamino pyridazines and how to build such a substrate. In addition to this synthesis, a mechanistic study was conducted to understand the selectivity and unique nature of an auto-oxidation of a key [5.8.5] carbotricycle. Wherein, the opportunity to perform a more facile oxidation could replace the current cumbersome MTO oxidation used to generate a hydroxy-enone. We have shown that the diastereoselectivity is dependent on the species of O2  where triplet oxygen incorporation results in a mixture of diastereomers, and singlet oxygen results in a selective addition over the olefin resulting in a highly diastereoselective  auto-oxidation.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The work disclosed in this dissertation explores using two-center/three-electrons and electron upconversion in C-N bond formation. In particular, three areas will be discussed in detail: 1) computation exploration into intermolecular C-N bond formation between a methyl radical and various nitrogen nucleophiles; 2) DFT calculations are used to investigate electron upconversion in an intramolecular C-N bond formation between dimethyl malonitrile and anilines; 3) An intramolecular C(sp3)-H amidation which opens a new path to hydroxyisoindolines.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter One begins with a broad overview of N-heterocycles, their applications, and general approaches for constructing them. One approach, C-H activation, is expanded upon as a promising method for constructing and functionalizing N-heterocycles. Four general methods for C-H activation are introduced: 1) direct activation, 2) C-H activation with delayed C-N bond formation, 3) nitrogen assisted C-H activation, and 4) independent N-H/C-H activation. This final approach activates both the N-H and C-H bonds and transforms them into reactive intermediates. For instance, the formation of a radical and a (persistent) anion (typically C-radical and N-anion) can be used to productively form a three-electron bond. Due to the extra electron is “upconverted” and creates a species with a higher oxidation potential capable of being oxidized by a mild oxidant, such as molecular oxygen. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter Two further expands upon the concept of “electron upconversion” as a synthetic method for constructing C-N bonds. When the orbitals of the two centers mix two new orbitals are created, a bonding and anti-bonding orbital. When three electrons are used to make a bond two of those electrons will be stabilized in the bonding orbital and a single electron will be destabilized in an anti-bonding orbital. The result is a net stabilization of a single electron. Additionally, by moving a single electron from a non-bonding orbital to a higher energy anti-bonding orbital one transforms the reactant from a weaker reductant to a more potent reductant, allowing for a facile electron transfer. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter Three uses DFT calculations to probe the effects solvent polarity has on intermolecular three-electron bond formations as well as the ability to trap a methyl radical with a range of N-nucleophiles. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter Four explores if oxidation under basic conditions allows the formation of three-electron bonds (resulting in “upconverted” highly-reducing radical-anions). The benefit of this “upconversion” process is in the ability to use milder oxidants (e.g., O2) and to avoid high-energy intermediates. Comparison of the two- and three-electron pathways using quantum mechanical calculations reveals that not only does the absence of a strong oxidant shut down two-electron pathways in favor of a three-electron path but, paradoxically, weaker oxidants react faster with the upconverted reductants by avoiding the inverted Marcus region for electron transfer.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter Five presents An intramolecular C(sp3)-H amidation proceeds in the presence of t-BuOK, molecular oxygen, and DMF. This transformation is initiated by the deprotonation of an acidic N-H bond and selective radical activation of a benzylic C-H bond towards hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). Cyclization of this radical-anion intermediate en route to a two-centered/three-electron (2c,3e) C-N bond removes electron density from nitrogen. As this electronegative element resists such an “oxidation”, making nitrogen more electron rich is key to overcoming this problem. Remarkably, this reaction also converts a weak reductant into much a stronger reductant. Such “reductant upconversion” allows mild oxidants like molecular oxygen to complete the first part of the cascade. In contrast, the second stage of NH/CH activation forms a highly stabilized radical-anion intermediate incapable of undergoing electron transfer to oxygen. Because the oxidation is unfavored, an alternative reaction path opens via coupling between the radical anion intermediate and either superoxide or hydroperoxide radical. The hydroperoxide intermediate transforms into the final hydroxyisoindoline products under basic conditions.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The endocrine system manages the body’s organ function and growth in harmony with each other and the environment. This system is a network of glands that control themselves and other organs via hormones. Building a healthy hormone secretion pattern begins at the cellular level, where the calcium dynamics in coordination with the membrane potential dynamic plays a key role. The elevated calcium concentration promotes hormone secretion, which is strongly correlated with the rate of bursting behavior compared to spiking in membrane electrical activity of endocrine cells. Many studies have focused on deterministic modeling of electrical activity in the endocrine cells such as pancreatic β-cells, pituitary lactotroph cells, and pituitary corticotroph cells. But the stochastic nature of excitable endocrine cells, like other biological systems, is the missing factor in a fully deterministic model. In other words, stochasticity cause behaviors that are not predictable in the deterministic models. Therefore, throughout our work, we utilize stochasticity in the modeling to explain electrical behavior and as a source for the heterogeneity in empirical studies. In the first project, we show the phantom bursting mechanism in the modeling of isolated β-cell is capable of producing slow bursting even if noise is present. In the second project, in collaboration with biomedical researchers at the University of Edinburgh, we demonstrate the effect of stochastic BK ion channels on tiny corticotroph cells, especially its vital role in stress hormone secretion from cells of chronically stressed animals. The other novelty of our work is the use of fast/slow analysis to understand the mechanism of these stochastic behaviors from the dynamical systems point of view. This method uncovers both the bifurcation structure of the fast subsystem of stable and unstable equilibria and also demonstrates that the bifurcation of the invariant manifold and the heteroclinic orbits are essential to reveal the bursting mechanism of a hybrid model with the stochastic variable. In the final project, we used tools from network theory to study a network of electrically coupled endocrine cells where secretion accumulation depends on their synchronized activity. Unlike β-cells in islets with a uniform network, pituitary endocrine cells are organized in a scale-free network. In this novel modeling study of the lactotroph cell network, we demonstrate that the degree distribution of the functional network, where links between nodes represent synchronized cells, is related to its betweenness centrality density in the structural network. We also find that structural hubs (cells with extensive coupling to other cells) are typically not functional hubs (cells synchronized with many other cells). Overall, the dissertation describes research on endocrine cell electrical activity at both the single-cell and network levels.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Sinking particles transport organic carbon produced in the surface ocean to the ocean interior, leading to net storage of atmospheric CO2 in the deep ocean. The rapid growth of in situ imaging technology has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of particle flux attenuation in the ocean; however, estimating particle flux from particle size and abundance (measured directly by in situ cameras) is challenging. Sinking rates are dependent on several factors, including particle excess density and porosity, which vary based on particle origin and type. Additionally, particle characteristics are transformed while sinking. We compare optically-measured particle size spectra profiles (Underwater Vision Profiler 5, UVP) with contemporaneous measurements of particle flux made using sediment traps and 234Th:238U disequilibrium on six process cruises from the California Current Ecosystem (CCE) LTER Program. These measurements allow us to assess the efficacy of size-flux relationships for estimating fluxes from optical particle size measurements. We find that previously published parameterizations that estimate carbon flux from UVP profiles are a poor fit to direct flux measurements in the CCE. This discrepancy is found to result primarily from the important role of fecal pellets in particle flux. These pellets are primarily in a size range (i.e., 100 – 400 µm) that is not well-resolved as images by the UVP due to the resolution of the sensor. We develop new, CCE-optimized parameters for use in an algorithm estimating carbon flux from UVP data in the southern California Current (Flux = ∑_(i=1)^x▒〖n_i A〖d_i〗^B ∆d_i 〗), with A = 15.4, B = 1.05, d = particle diameter (mm) and Flux in units of mg C m-2 d-1. We caution, however, that increased accuracy in flux estimates derived from optical instruments will require devices with greater resolution, the ability to differentiate fecal pellets from low porosity marine snow aggregates, and improved sampling of rapidly sinking fecal pellets. We also find that the particle size-flux relationships may be different within the euphotic zone than in the shallow twilight zone and hypothesize that the changing nature of sinking particles with depth must be considered when investigating the remineralization length scale of sinking particles in the ocean.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This thesis describes the relevant background, process, and results of two measurements of the cyclotron frequency ratio (CFR) of  H2+/D+ as measured using a hyperbolic Penning trap, to determine the deuteron-to-proton mass ratio m(d)/m(p). The first of these measurements was done using the ``alternating-technique" in which the  H2+ and D+ ions are simultaneously trapped, but measured separately, with the ion being measured centered in the trap as the other ion is held in a 2 mm cyclotron orbit before exchanging the positions of the ions to measure the newly centered ion. This measurement resulted in a value of m(d)/m(p) = 1.999 007 501 274(38), which has an uncertainty three times smaller than the current CODATA value. The second measurement detailed in this thesis attempted to improve upon the precision of the first by performing simultaneous measurements of cyclotron frequency on the H2+ and D+ ions. This method, which was developed at MIT and only used for four ion pairs of m/q ~ 30, had not been used in over a decade, and never for light ions such as H2+ and D+. Using this method we obtained a value of m(d)/m(p) = 1.000 007 501 272(9), reducing our uncertainty by a factor of 4 from our previous measurement. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Cyclotron frequency ratio measurement using H2+ is complicated by the 20 bound vibrational energy states and over 200 metastable rotational energy states which it can be found in. These energy states shift the mass of the H2+ due to the mass energy relation E=mc^2, and must be accounted for in the precision measurement of the CFR. The vibrational energy states could be observed using the alternating measurement technique and clearly identified using the simultaneous measurement technique. This, to our knowledge, is the first demonstration of observation of quantum excitation through direct mass-measurement. Correction was made for rotational quantum energy to the alternating-technique results by the approximation of mass shift through maximum likelihood estimation using a model of rotational excitation. Increased resolution using the simultaneous measurement technique allowed the fitting of specific rotational states to measurements taken, using the minimization of chi-squared when comparing our data to known rovibrational energy levels, drastically reducing the contribution to uncertainty from rotational quantum excitation.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study examined the factors contributing to the underrepresentation of women studying undergraduate Computer Science (CS) at Florida Research University (FRU), a preeminent public university. Even as the growing popularity of computing technologies has boosted enrollment numbers in CS majors over the past decade, women’s attrition rate remains much higher than that of their male counterparts (FL DOE, 2021). The research literature on women in science and math majors identifies a number of reasons for this gender gap, including the lack of pre-collegiate exposure, stereotype threats from both society and the classroom, and embedded biases in the curriculum itself (Holmberg-Wright &amp; Wright, 2018; Ellis et al., 2016). To date, there has not been an in-depth look into women’s experiences enrolled in the CS major at FRU, and this research was intended to fill that void.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Black and Brown college students with autism are missing in the higher education research surrounding the college experience and college readiness. This is important because understanding the college experience and college readiness for college students center many debates and research queries within higher education practice and policy (Carnevale et al., 2010; Hurtado et al., 2020). Research also asserts these barriers are further compounded when considering the intersection of disability and minoritized identities (Chiang et al., 2012). The dominate narrative regarding these college barriers for autistic college students is centered around the experience of White college students with autism. This inadvertently pushes the nuanced experiences of Black and Brown students with autism to the margins and assumes homogeneity for the autistic college experience. Critical theories on race, education, and disability, question the notion of a homogenous experience for all college students with autism and call researchers to intentionally interrogate such notions. Therefore, the purpose of this quantitative study was to describe the experiences, and expectations for Black and Brown college students with autism. The findings of this study demonstrate there are differences for Black and Brown students with autism and their White autistic and non-autistic peers for factors of college readiness and the relationship for College Involvement and Degree Aspiration. The results of this study helped to shed a light on the factors that may influence their perceptions of college readiness for Black and Brown College students with autism, and reiterate that the intersection of race and disability needs to be examined. Further this study served as a resistance to the current autism literature that inadvertently conceals Black and Brown experiences.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>High critical current density (Jc) in MOCVD REBCO coated conductors is accomplished by highly engineered artificial pinning centers (APC) nanostructures that are, however, difficult to control in repetitive long-length production. Adding APC contributes to the crystallographic Jc anisotropy, where Jc varies considerably with the angle (θ) of the applied magnetic field to the tape-plane. These strong correlated APC result in additional point pins around the nano-columns that provide extra, uncorrelated pinning below 45 K, further complicating the pinning landscape. For accurate magnet quench modeling, wide-ranging Jc(B,T,θ) data is needed, where 72-108° is typical of the important angular range for solenoids (θ=90° when B||tape plane). Here we report on four tapes purchased to the same advanced vortex pinning specification that showed substantial variation in the low T, high B current density for BꞱtape (0) and 108° which correlate well with the varying APC size, volume fraction and density. Jc(B,T, 108°) measurements, ranging from 1 T &lt; B &lt; 15 T at 4.2 K &lt; T &lt; 77 K, were probed using a Ginzburg-Landau model of vortex pinning. To further understand the detailed correlation of nanostructure to Jc, the four tapes underwent detailed Jc(B,T,θ) measurements using a novel torque magnetometer at fields up to 30 T, temperatures from 4.2 K &lt; T &lt; 45 K, and angles from 30°-150°. Tapes with higher densities of long, thin nanorods showed a wider ab-plane peak, while the tape with a low density of thick, short nanorods had a sharp, narrow peak. The tape with the lowest Jc for BꞱtape and a low nanorod density however had the highest Jc(B||ab) at all measured B and T. In summary, we find that substantial variations of the Jc magnitude  exist for these 4 representative samples and that the common optimization of tape behavior for BꞱtape is not optimum for angles closer to the ab-planes where many important magnet properties are determined. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Best There Ever Was, The Best There Ever Will Be operates at the intersections of sports and performance studies. This dissertation builds upon Joseph Roach’s concept of surrogation, first outlined in 1996’s Cities of the Dead, with a primary focus on the performances of four specific players in the sport of basketball: Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, and Candace Parker. I argue that each performs Roach’s surrogation through media, race, and gender. I also examine the history of women’s basketball, arguing that basketball is an inherently gendered sport in both its origins and practices over the course of its evolution in more than a century. 	The Best There Ever Was, The Best There Ever Will Be uses performance theory, critical race theory, and gender studies to examine how basketball has become a unique performance tradition. First, I analyze a process called mediatization, arguing that Jordan, James, and Bryant’s performances of mediatization shape how we think of them in basketball culture. I then examine Jordan’s performance as “The Man” of his team and the NBA, using Black masculinity and performativity to create a specific basketball masculinity which James and Bryant surrogate in their own ways. In the third chapter, I pivot to Candace Parker and the WNBA, tracing the history of women’s basketball to argue that basketball itself is an inherently gendered sport through both language and the body. I conclude the project by offering up theoretical concepts of possibility and potentiality, drawing these terms from Daniel Sack’s After Live to argue that they can help us think deeper about surrogation and basketball. Surrogation is key to analyzing the sport of basketball because basketball itself is its own performance practice, one that will be passed down and endure for future generations.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>	This dissertation explores several aspects of microwave spectroscopy of  two-dimensional electron systems (2DES), motivated by the microwave signatures of Wigner crystal phases that can exist in these systems. The spectroscopy is carried out by means of coplanar waveguide transmission lines patterned onto the top of semiconductor samples. 	
	
	Wigner crystals form from otherwise mobile charge carriers when inter-carrier Coulomb repulsion  overwhelms the kinetic energy.  This occurs when the 2DES is sufficiently dilute, for low  temperature and small disorder.  These solids are insulating due to pinning by disorder, and in the rf or microwave range exhibit ``pinning'' modes, in which pieces of the crystal oscillate within the disorder potential.  In high magnetic fields these pinning modes are known to be sharp and can vary widely in frequency.  I describe  high magnetic field measurements of a series of nominally identical devices with unprecedented low disorder and which only vary in the thickness of the quantum well that house the 2DES.  This research has demonstrated the lowest frequency pinning mode observed to date, and further shows that the pinning  is due to alloy disorder in the confining barriers that form the quantum well.   A self consistent model of the wave functions of the quantum wells gives a good explanation of the pinning frequency as a function of well thickness.  
	
	Wigner crystals are predicted to form in zero magnetic field as well, although at much lower carrier densities, and should have microwave signatures.  An excellent candidate for housing such a solid is AlAs.  In exploring 2DES in AlAs to search for microwave signatures of Wigner crystallization at zero magnetic field, we found a novel type of cyclotron resonance, in which plasma shift due to finite sample size is absent
	
	In another step toward studying 2DES at extremely low carrier density I developed a new type of transmission line, a coplanar waveguide whose slots are filled with resistive film, a resistively loaded coplanar waveguide (RLCPW), to measure 2DES. The RLCPW applied to the sample hosting the 2DES provides a uniform metallic surface serving as a gate, to control the areal density of the 2DES.  As a demonstration of this technique I present measurements on a Si metal oxide field effect transistors (MOSFET) showing that the RLCPW can be used for quantitative measurements of 2DES microwave conductivity, and additionally measured a heterojunction insulated gate field effect transistor (HIGFET), a type of device that is particularly promising for study of zero magnetic field Wigner crystals.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This study builds on prior literature that examines the importance of Black male teachers in the K-12 public education system. I began by exploring the differential attitudes of Black male teachers and the systemic, institutional, and organizational factors that contribute to their growth or stagnation within the profession. Through the lens of critical race theory, I conducted a narrative inquiry to discover Black male teachers’ experiences in one school district. In an effort to bring attention to the factors, be they support systems or barriers, I acquired an understanding on what they see as critical in shaping their decision to stay in K-12 public education. I explored the extent to which the perceived notions of Black male teachers’ workplace experiences differ from their actual narratives. Findings indicated there is a lack of supports specific to the needs of in place for Black male teachers in place to aid them in their career as teachers. Implications for future research is presented at the conclusion of the study.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>With the use of sponsorship, the company was especially successful in establishing itself as a sports media brand, primarily within action sports industries. However, in addition to sponsoring entertainment media, Red Bull also financially supported scientific research. Thus, despite the intensified public scrutiny placed on the health risks of energy drinks, the company’s involvement in funding academic work allowed it to indirectly participate in relevant scientific discourse or policy debates concerning the regulation of energy beverages. When using a critical political economic lens, both the work of sponsored athletes and sponsored scientists can be understood as similar types of corporate public relations work and subjected to similar pressures of commercialization. Given the complex power dynamics at play within sponsorship agreements, critical political economy’s emphasis on re-emphasizing the undermining of labor evaluation within cultural work is a fruitful foundation for revealing the ways in which corporate sponsors such as Red Bull have used such agreements to sway the creative efforts of athletic performers and university professionals toward their own interests.The results of this analysis reveal that Red Bull actively facilitates the creation of neoliberal discourse through its sponsorship of action sports media and contrarian academic research. As illustrated by the answers to RQ1 and RQ2, the company has extensively invested organizational resources toward developing sponsorship networks within both action sports and nutrition science. Regarding the company’s sponsorship of action sports, at the time of this study, nearly 90% of sponsored athletes listed on Red Bull’s official U.S. website compete in non-traditional sport disciplines. Within research related to energy drinks, the results of this dissertation revealed the company is heavily involved within academic discourse. Out of the 112 studies examined, 27 (or 24%) featured authors with disclosed associations with Red Bull. Not only did this make the organization the most prolific sponsor of energy drink-related research, but out of the 27 studies, 25 exclusively focused on topics disputing scientific evidence indicating potential health risks linked to the use of energy drinks. When contextually examining the political economic dynamics of company’s athletic and academic sponsorship networks, the results to RQ3 highlight Red Bull’s organizational emphasis on unlimited growth is all-encompassing, including not just athletic performance, but all human potential in general.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>People with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) consistently have deficits in performing adaptive behaviors (Kenworthy et al., 2010; Perry et al., 2009; Pugliese et al., 2017), which are skills needed to care for oneself, have social interactions, and to function at home, in school, at work, or in the community (Harrison &amp; Oakland, 2015), and may be linked with deficits in executive functioning.  Across the United States, diagnoses of ASD continue to increase (Baio et al., 2014; Kogan et al., 2018), suggesting that more children and adolescents with ASD enter adulthood with deficits in adaptive skills (Kanne et al., 2011).  Along with deficits in adaptive skills, those with ASD also display deficits in executive functioning (Lind &amp; Williams, 2013), suggesting a possible link between executive functioning and adaptive skills in those with ASD. Executive functioning is the ability to incorporate goal-directed behavior overriding automatic processes for desired processes (Garon et al., 2008). To examine the relationship between these three constructs, the following research questions were asked: 1) What is the association between ASD behaviors and adaptive skills? 2) What is the association between ASD behaviors and executive functioning? 3) Do executive functions moderate the relationship between ASD behaviors and adaptive skills? 4) Does the cognitive triad of executive functioning (inhibition, cognitive flexibility, working memory) moderate the relationship between ASD behaviors and adaptive skills?.  The current study included 79 participants (M = 9.92 years; Females = 29%).  The results indicated that ASD behaviors have a significant negative relationship with adaptive skills and executive functioning.  The findings suggest that executive functioning moderates the association between adaptive skills and ASD behaviors.  Because executive functioning is malleable and an area of intervention (Kenworthy et al., 2014; Sasser et al., 2017), these findings are important because they indicate that executive functioning is an area to intervene and improve skills.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>ABSTRACT    Social-Emotional Learning (SEL), the process of developing and utilizing interpersonal skills for everyday life, has become a primary vehicle for structuring students’ social and emotional health in the United States and across the world. In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the importance of understanding SEL practices, is increasingly at the forefront of many discussions in education today. Since “non-academic factors” like SEL were added to U.S. education law (ESSA, 2015), the state of Florida has also added two mandates concerning SEL (Florida Senate Bill 7026: The Marjorie Stoneman Douglas Act and FS 1003.42; Rule 6A-1.094121: Curriculum mandate for four hours of SEL as part of mental health education). This has led to the adoption of SEL programming in schools. In 2018, Martin County Public Schools adopted the BASE Education learning program, an SEL approach that aimed to help high school students, identified as at-risk after a discipline infraction, to “learn about and apply psycho-social concepts through supportive, therapeutic dialogue” (MCSD Code of Conduct, Chapter V, 2022, p.18). BASE Education is an online program currently being implemented in all high schools within the Martin County School District. In purchasing BASE for implementation into the disciplinary process and SEL supports, the district projected that BASE Education would increase self-awareness and increase responsible decision making, thus decreasing discipline referrals. This study examines two components of the disciplinary experience of MCSD students: (1) The SEL experience of high school students referred to BASE Education intervention programming in the Martin County School District, and (2) How students who have participated in [personalized] BASE Education modules describe the nature of their pathway within the online experience. This study represents the first time that an analysis of the student referral experience data and online SEL intervention experiential pathway program data has been undertaken in Martin County Public Schools. 
Key Words: BASE Education, CASEL, SEL, Social Emotional Learning, SEL Blended Learning, SEL competencies, Responsible-decision making, self-awareness, social-awareness.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Fossil fuel-derived materials are readily incorporated into the built environment without much knowledge about how they can impact the long-term well-being of natural ecosystems and public health. Ultrahigh resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) has allowed for the molecular characterization of complex fossil fuel-derived materials, such as crude oil and asphalt binder, and their photoproducts that are produced as a result of exposure to weathering processes (i.e. solar irradiation). Photooxidation from sunlight has been identified as the primary phototransformation process responsible for the transformation of fossil fuel-derived materials in the environment. As photooxidation affects these materials, the generation of newly formed oil- and water-soluble compounds becomes a concern and new evidence points to the consideration of these materials as emerging environmental contaminants. Thus, it is important that knowledge regarding the molecular composition, structure, and subsequent behavior of fossil fuel-based photoproducts is acquired as it is valuable in understanding the long-term effects that occur from the use of materials such as crude oil, asphalt binder, and pavement sealant. Specifically, much remains unknown regarding the toxicity of water-soluble photoproducts from fossil fuel-derived materials that can contaminate waterways after introduction to the environment. It is essential that the effects of these potentially toxic compounds in the built environment are understood to combat their effects on the ecosystem, wildlife, and human health.Chapter 1 provides an introductory overview on FT-ICR MS and how it has been used to provide relatively comprehensive molecular profiles for complex unweathered and weathered petroleum-derived materials. Chapter 2 describes the work done to characterize photochemically produced asphaltenes (PPA), a newly formed oil-soluble fraction of crude oil. PPA are of interest as they can persist in the environment due to their inability to degrade over time.
Chapter 3 explores an emerging contaminant of great concern, coal tar pavement sealant. This work seeks to provide a relatively comprehensive understanding of petroleum-derived and coal tar-derived sealants and compares how they are transformed after photooxidation which includes molecular characterization, dissolved organic carbon production, and toxicity analysis. Chapter 4 continues to explore coal tar pavement sealant and compares it to another road paving material, asphalt binder. This work focuses on the solubility fractions, maltenes and asphaltenes, from asphalt binder and coal tar sealant and determines their contributions to the production of water-soluble photoproducts. Lastly, Chapter 5 focuses on the potentially harmful water-soluble photoproducts generated from asphalt binder and coal tar sealant that are introduced in Chapters 3 and 4 and seeks to determine their structural profiles by MS/MS techniques. This work also proposes and discusses photochemical pathways that result in the production of different types of water-soluble compounds. This work is of great importance since structural motifs contained in water-soluble photoproducts from fossil-fuel derived materials have yet to be explored. Collectively, this work aims to demonstrate the consideration of fossil fuel-derived oil- and water-soluble photoproducts as emerging environmental contaminants due to their molecular and structural compositions.

            <DISS_para>A basket trial evaluates one or more treatments for efficacy among more than one cancer type in a single clinical trial. Although the treatment targets the common genetic aberration that is associated with different cancer types, the possible heterogeneity in the treatment effects poses challenges in modeling. Compared to traditional designs, basket trials can reduce the time required for testing and, by pooling across cancer types, they also allow the drugs to be tested for rare cancers. Basket trials are gaining increasing importance with advancements in precision medicine. Using covariate information has shown merit for improving efficacy of these trials. We incorporate subject-level biomarker information to aid identification of responsive and non-responsive baskets. We model subjects’ responses using a two-component Bayesian mixture model where the mixture weights depend on a measure of similarly among subjects’ biomarker values. We demonstrate the performance of this model using simulation. We also illustrate a two stage implementation of the model and discuss the application in case of multiple covariates. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Unlike other Western Boundary Currents (WBCs), the Kuroshio Current, experiences bimodal path flux variations known as the Kuroshio Large Meander (LM) on the southeastern coast of Japan. In this manuscript, the extent to which the Kuroshio LM on the southeastern coast of Japan can be identified through sea surface temperature (SST) spatial patterns is investigated. The methodology in this manuscript varies from previous work which identified the Kuroshio LM through sea surface height (SSH) data.  While SSH data is not found in atmospheric datasets, SST data is often available in atmospheric reanalysis datasets allowing for consistent investigation of ocean-atmosphere interactions using a single dataset.  The SST LM index developed in this study is valid in wintertime months, with the highest correlation found in February. The index developed in this study used to investigate both the time-mean near surface wind divergence/convergence (NSWD/NSWC) and precipitation rates within this region. Further criteria explored includes identifying changes in these variables while atmospheric fronts are present in the Kuroshio LM region and is shown that the presence (or absence) of the Kuroshio LM on the southeast coast of Japan has noticeable influence on the impacts related to frontal boundaries, allowing the small-scale SST-induced diabatic signal to be analyzed. The results of this study aid in explaining the time-mean NSWC of atmospheric fronts over this region, except for a small area off Japan, which is shown to have heightened and intensified time-mean non-frontal NSWC and moderate precipitation rates during the Kuroshio LM on the southeastern coast of Japan, which was previously poorly understood. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Teacher perception has been demonstrated to be a key contributor to instructional practices within the classroom. As additional technologies become available to enhance and supplement instructional practices, game-based learning has emerged as an included component to classroom strategies for improved student achievement. With primary focus within the educational field placed on decreasing the achievement gap, emphasis on approaches that demonstrate affective ways of promoting the achievement of minority students has increased over the past few decades. Primary measurements of student achievement begin in 3rd grade. The purpose of this study was to identify and evaluate teacher perceptions on the use of game-based learning software within the contemporary classroom, specifically in the 3rd and 4th grade ELA domain. Survey responses from 823 3rd and 4th grade ELA teachers provided insight to factors contributing to teacher perception on the implementation of game-based learning into the ELA curriculum. In addition to the quantitative survey results, 37 face-to-face interviews were conducted to elicit qualitative information on the factors influencing teacher perception. Analysis of the results indicated that teachers have a generally positive view of the incorporation of GBL into the ELA curriculum. One of the key factors contributing to GBL implementation is an increased level of student engagement. Prior experience with GBL implementation also served as a primary element impacting teacher perception.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This dissertation study sought to examine the relationship between risk-taking behaviors and meaning in life. A United States sample of adults ranging from 18-40 were surveyed via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk platform. Statistical analyses of the relationships between meaning in life group and risk-taking behaviors were assessed using a multivariate analysis of covariance, while treating age as a covariate. Additional statistical analyses of the predictive relationships between variables were assessed through five hierarchical regression models. 	Results of the study indicated that there were significant group differences for risk-taking behaviors based on meaning in life group. Further examination indicated that there were significant group differences for ethical, financial, and social risk-taking behaviors. Consistent with previous research in risk-taking behaviors and meaning in life, the results also suggest that meaning in life does have a significant predictive relationship with risk-taking behaviors. This study highlights the importance of assessing meaning in life and continuing to expand on the interrelation between presence of meaning and search for meaning on current behavioral functioning. Given that risk-taking behaviors could have negative effects on the individual displaying the behavior, elevate the risk for maladaptive behaviors later in life, and puts others at risk, it becomes apparent that risk-taking behaviors could have lasting negative consequences. Therefore, meaning in life has been identified as a potential protective factor to assess in future research and clinical settings when considering risk-taking motivation or interventions.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The newly emerged medium-voltage (MV) silicon carbide (SiC) MOSFETs, spanning 2.5 kV to 15 kV range, are under the rapid developments and have received increasing attention recently. Compared to Si devices, SiC MOSFETs have significant improvements on the blocking voltage, specific on-resistance, switching speed and operating temperature. Therefore, MV SiC MOSFETs have a great potential to improve the efficiency and power density of MV converters, and meanwhile to drive down the system complexity. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>As the interface between MV SiC MOSFETs and control circuits, gate driver (GD) performance is critical to fully leverage the potential benefits of SiC devices as well as to enhance the reliability, such as the sufficient common-mode (CM) transient immunity (CMTI) and fast fault protection. Since there is little commercial GDs for MV SiC MOFETs, the research on MV GDs is still being explored, mainly focusing on the isolated GD power supply (GDPS) and fault protection designs. Existing MV GD solutions exhibit bulky size and high cost, since they not only require bulky GDPS to transmit GD power, but also need costly fiber optics (FOs) to transmit gate/ fault signals. State-of-the-art (SOA) GDPSs have demonstrated a reduced size aiming at the MV insulation requirement, but the total GD volume is still comparable or larger than the MV SiC devices. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation proposes the power-signal integrated GD for MV SiC MOSFETs to minimize the GD footprint, which helps to integrate the GD into MV SiC device packages. This concept is utilized to firstly propose a 20-MHz dual-transformer-based isolated GD with power-signal integrated transmission. It not only removes costly FOs and bulky GDPSs, but also achieves the good timing performance including the full PWM duty-cycle range operation, low propagation delay time, and high PWM duty-cycle resolution. The solid-dielectrics-based insulation scheme is applied for proposed GD, which enables an insulating voltage &gt; 10 kV rms for MV requirements as well as a moderate coupling capacitance to enhance the CMTI. The experimental results have verified the validity of proposed 20-MHz dual-transformer-based power-signal integrated GD for 3.3-kV and 10-kV SiC MOSFETs. To further reduce both the coupling capacitance and footprint of the power-signal integrated GD for MV SiC MOSFETs, a 50-MHz single-transformer-based design is then proposed, and its performance has been experimentally verified by driving 10-kV SiC MOSFET. The PD performance of GD transformer under the high frequency, high dv/dt PWM voltage excitation is also characterized using photo-multiplier tube method.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Due to the lack of comprehensive and quantitative design principles, the conventional DESAT protection circuit parameters usually require trail-and-error efforts to achieve both the sufficient noise immunity to high dv/dt and fast fault response time. To address this issue, the quantitative design constraints and optimization methodology for DESAT circuit parameters are developed with little tuning work. The proposed DESAT circuit parameter design and optimization methodology has been experimentally verified on 3.3-kV SiC MOSFET module.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The conventional DESAT protection scheme cannot be applied into switched-capacitor-based converters due to the inrush current spike occurring at the converter commutation. To eliminate the false-triggering issue induced by the inrush current, a novel charge-based DESAT protection scheme is proposed, where the "fault charge" rather than "fault current" is selected for the fault diagnosis. The proposed charge-based DESAT protection scheme considers the accumulation of fault current over time and thus can screen the narrow inrush current spikes with high magnitude. The proposed charge-based DESAT protection scheme has been designed and experimentally verified on 3.3-kV discrete SiC MOSFETs.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Flux synthesis is a very powerful and versatile technique for the exploratory synthesis of rare earth intermetallics. Reactions of rare earth metals and alkali earth elements with silicon in a Mg/Al flux or a Mg/Zn flux have yielded single crystals of a series of new complex intermetallic phases. The structures of products were determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. Identical reactions were explored in both fluxes; both yielded large crystals suitable for study using single crystal X-ray diffraction and magnetic susceptibility measurements, although Mg/Zn reactions produced higher yields and larger crystals. While elemental analysis indicates that the product formed in the Mg/Al melts contains traces of aluminum, no incorporation of zinc was observed in compounds formed in the Mg/Zn flux. Reactions of Eu, Ca, and Si in either Mg/Zn or Mg/Al yield products with two structure types depending on the ratio of europium to calcium in the final product. Calcium-rich reactions produce Ca1-xEuxMgSi (0 &lt; x &lt; 0.7) compounds with the orthorhombic TiNiSi structure type in space group Pnma. Increasing europium content led to the prevalence of Eu8-xCaxMg16Si12 (0 &lt; y &lt; 3.4) products with the hexagonal Ho5Ni19P12 structure type in space group P-62m.  In all the products, Eu is expected to be divalent, however there may be some switching to a trivalent state in the TiNiSi type compound due to chemical pressure. In all cases these compounds appear to order ferromagnetically. 
Ba6R1.8Mg18.2Si13 (R = Dy, Y) grow as large crystals from reactions of barium, silicon, and either dysprosium or yttrium in Mg/Al or Mg/Zn fluxes. The presence of the trivalent Y or Dy in the reaction mixture promotes the formation of Ba6R1.8Mg18.2Si13 in the Ho6Ni20P13 structure type (hexagonal P-6 space group) instead of the expected Ba5Mg19Si12 (Ho5Ni19P12 type).  The trivalent cations are incorporated at a specific amount in the compound, mixing on one particular Mg site in the structure. Magnetic susceptibility measurements on Ba6Dy1.8Mg18.2Si13 confirm the presence of Dy3+ and indicate magnetic ordering at 9 K. 
The low melting point of gallium flux enabled an in-situ neutron diffraction study of the reaction of Ce and Ni in excess gallium.  Initial formation of CeNi0.74Ga3.26 was seen at high temperature; this transforms into Ce2NiGa10 and Ce2NiGa12 below 600°C.  This information enabled isolation of the high temperature phase by quenching the flux reaction at high temperature.  CeNi0.74Ga3.26 is a strongly anisotropic ferromagnet below 7 K.

            <DISS_para>This work reports on the first efforts at FSU's John D. Fox Accelerator Laboratory to study the nuclear structure of states embedded in the continuum through particle-unbound angular correlations. As part of this work, two principle experiments were performed, both using the $^{12}$C($^{3}$He,$d$)$^{13}$N reaction at $E_{^{3}He}$ = 24 MeV in the Super-Enge Split-Pole Spectrograph (SE-SPS) to populate proton-unbound states in $^{13}$N whose decays were then measured in coincidence by silicon detector arrays. An angular correlation formalism was developed to utilize outputs from the reaction theory code FRESCO between the reaction products (deuterons) and decay products (protons) to connect the decay observables to the fundamental structure of the parent $^{13}$N states. This technique was found to work well for narrow, long-lived states with modest continuum coupling, but to reach its limitations for strongly continuum-coupled states like the broad ``superradiant'' where a more unified description of nuclear structure and reactions is required.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Rhetoric and Composition (R/C) practitioners have a variety of ways of enacting the object/motive (Russell, 1997) of the discipline: to study writers and writing. Differing approaches have been well documented in terms of pedagogical styles and their underlying philosophical assumptions (e.g., Berlin, 1982; Faigley, 1986; Berlin, 1988; Kopelson, 2003) or what “counts” as writing in the digital age (Yancey, 2004)—to name a few. Similarly, scholars have pointed out that the whole premise of “writers and writing” has and continues to support white ways of knowing and doing (e.g., Prendergast, 1998; Kynard, 2005; Kynard, 2013). Along with these scholars who contemplate the goals and objects of the discipline, recent Conference of College Composition and Communication calls for presentations (Lindquist, 2019; Hassel, 2020) suggest practitioners take a moment to (re)consider our values. This project offers another approach to answering the question disciplinary values examining how new R/C faculty navigate disciplinary values as they are instantiated in a specific genre, the academic research article (RA).The research article (RA) was chosen because it is an economically central feature of the tenure-track promotion process, as well as a pedagogically central feature of many writing programs’ curricula. Furthermore, the RA is philosophically central as a site where knowledge is authorized, reinforcing what writers and what writing counts as publishable. Finally, the RA is culturally central within the discipline as a socializing feature. Writers who wish to publish RAs—and thus participate with this powerful text in the discipline—must contend with the RA’s generic (genre) norms to produce a text that fits within the discipline’s expectation of what a RA should do. These assertions of how the RA functions in academic spaces echo central tenets of rhetorical genre studies (RGS). RGS, my theoretical framework, acknowledges genres as socialactions (Miller, 1984) that help writers to perform the function of communities, disciplines, or activity systems (Bazerman, 2003) and, as such, are also socializing mechanisms for those communities (Bawarshi, 2003, p. 354). Therefore, writers’ agency is located at the crux of social expectations and personal goals (e.g., Porter, 1986; Russell, 1997; Schryer et al, 2003). RGS also acknowledges that, given these features of genres, individuals are always navigating potentially competing (Russell, 1997) personal and disciplinary motives as they compose what Anis Bawarshi (2000) calls sites for the “articulation…and acquisition of desire” (p. 1-2).
This study joins traditional ethnographic methods used in RGS and builds in additional research steps to locate not just texts and their social actions but also locate what might have been left behind, the “rhetorical silences” or strategic omissions (Randazzo, 2015). RGS research methods typically use ethnographic methods for researching in addition to a rhetorical reading of genres (Paré and Smart, 1994). To study genres as sites of desires, I employ a unique methodology in RGS to understand just what sort of desires composers navigate as they engage in the RA-composing process. I surveyed 72 recently graduated R/C faculty, collect documents constituting the “genre set” (Devitt, 1991; Bazerman, 2003) of their RA-composing process, and conduct interviews (Schryer, 2011; Randazzo, 2015) to locate not only what rhetorical moves made it to the final, published products, but also what rhetorical silences, repressions, and/or defenses they may have enacted.
Studying “generic desires” helps describe the tensions between individual agency and community norms, but it also requires a different methodological approach to uncover just what desires writers negotiate and how, particularly the “repressions” and “defenses” writers may enact, which may not show up in a final draft (Bawarshi, 2000, p. 98). Bawarshi recognizes that writers exist in and across multiple communities and, similarly, even within a single community may occupy different social positions as writers take up different genres within the community (2000, p. 98). Generic desires are a potent concept for theorizing about genres, agency, and the potential for authors to impact community norms and values.
My findings suggest that individuals navigate personal and professional desires along with the desires of the discipline—enacted through the genre and enforced by the journal review process—as they engage in the composing process. These desires shift along the process, demonstrating that articulating and acquiring genres is a mutable, not fixed process. Thus, my findings demonstrate in writers’ own words how generic desire works and where the potential for disciplinary change through “knowledgeable resistance” (Powell, 2003) might exist in the RA-composing process.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation contains three essays that aim to better understand the topic of business-state relations in authoritarian regimes. To do this, I use various causal inference techniques and utilize Russia as my geographic focus. Below is an overview of each of the three essays.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The first chapter examines whether some judges are more willing to rule in favor of the state than others during business disputes. While previous researchers have studied the court system in authoritarian regimes, very few have examined the factors that shape judges' decision-making, especially in the commercial realm. In this regard, I argue that public sector (e.g., the court bureaucracy, prosecutor's office, investigative services, or other government agencies) judges are more likely to rule in favor of the regime because they may have similar preferences to the autocrat or they may have career incentives because of their lack of employment options outside of the state. To test this hypothesis, I use original data from the Russian commercial courts on the career paths of judges and a sample of more than 200,000 court cases from the last decade. For my causal identification strategy, I exploit the random assignment of cases to judges, ensuring that there are no significant differences in case characteristics that could potentially impact judges’ decisions. Ultimately, I found that public-sector judges are no more likely than private-sector judges to issue favorable rulings toward the state.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The second chapter examines whether corruption scandals impact the value of politically connected firms. While extensive literature examines whether and how political connections affect firm value, no studies have examined whether corruption scandals influence this. To answer this question, I take advantage of the release of a widely viewed Russian documentary film about an alleged corruption scheme involving former Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and the anti-corruption protests that followed in March 2017. To estimate the impacts of these events, I use data on political connections to Medvedev and daily stock returns from the Moscow Stock Exchange. For my research design, I use an event study to gauge how investors reacted to these events. In addition, I use synthetic controls to control for any confounding factors. In the end, I found that investors did not respond to either the video or the protests. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Finally, the third chapter explores whether economic sanctions impact the value of firms. While some scholars have examined how sanctions influence macroeconomic outcomes, such as trade or FDI, few have explored firm-level effects. To this end, I contend that investors would respond negatively to economic sanctions because they could cause firms to lose benefits, such as foreign direct investment, access to financing, and various goods and services. To test this hypothesis, I take advantage of the sanctions imposed on multiple Russian businesspeople and their firms for malign activity in April 2018. To estimate the relationship between sanctions and firm value, I utilize data on different firm-level covariates and daily returns from the Moscow Exchange. For my identification strategy, I use an event study to gauge how investors react to the sanctions. In addition, I use synthetic controls to control for any confounding events. Ultimately, I found that investors did not respond to the announcement about the imposition of sanctions against Russian firms or their leadership.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Researchers have reported an overall shortage of Black behavioral health practitioners in the workforce (West &amp; Schoenthaler, 2017).  This shortage is problematic because Black and African American people seeking behavioral health services often, at least initially, prefer a same-race practitioner (Swift et al., 2015).  Additionally, there is evidence that treatment duration increases (Ratts et al., 2016) and therapeutic outcomes improve (Swift et al., 2015) when there is a racial match between practitioner and client. There are several reasons contributing to this shortage; however, one reason is low retention of racially diverse (e.g. Asian, Black, Latinx) students in graduate training programs (Kaplan et al., 2018; Tinto, 1975; Wu et al., 2020).  Major factors involved in retention in graduate school relates to students’ college readiness, sense of belonging within the institution, financial instability, and experiences of racial microaggressions (Joseph, 2012). These factors become more prominent when the students are from racial minority backgrounds, indicating a possible connection to Pillerman’s minority status stress framework (Pillerman, 1988).  This framework identifies a unique set of stressors experienced by individuals whom are members of marginalized racial groups; specifically, Black/African American.  Additionally, research also indicates that those students experience psychological distress (e.g., anxiety, depression, stress) over and above their White counterparts as a result of their minoritized status. Mitigating or protective factors that are said to reduce development or maintenance of psychological distress can be racial centrality (i.e., race being a significant aspect of identity; Nioplias et al., 2018; Sellers et al., 1997) and attending a historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) (Joseph, 2012).  Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine associations between minority status stress and psychological distress (i.e., anxiety, depression, and stress) among Black students enrolled in behavioral health training graduate programs. Implications from this study will aid administrators and policy makers, at PWIs, in creating a safe and supportive environment for their students of color, which can ultimately impact these students’ persistence and degree completion. The results of the present study demonstrated a significant relationship between MSS and psychological distress (Research Question 1), along with the inclusion of racial centrality held constant (Research Question 2). However, the inclusion of school type (PWI, MSI, HBCU) had no effect on the degree to which MSS and psychological distress were correlated (Research Question 3).

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Mobile performance support systems (MPSS) are being adopted to support workforce performance across many industries and organizations. An MPSS provides just-in-time access to assist workers with their job tasks from anywhere with minimal help from others (Gery, 1995b; Hueftle, 2005; Layton et al., 1995; Ruffner &amp; Deibler, 2010). A review of the literature suggests that empirical research on MPSS is sparse and sporadic. Scholars from human performance technology (HPT), computer science, engineering, and business fields have called for additional studies on MPSS (Egger &amp; Masood, 2020; Porcelli et al., 2013; Rossett, 2011). To date, only a few studies have explored the use of MPSS in the context of HPT. 
The purpose of this study was to explore why MPSS is adopted in companies and organizations in North America to solve performance problems and meet organizational goals. The study focused on why MPSS is considered an appropriate intervention, the benefits of adopting MPSS, and the challenges in the adoption. The three research questions of the study are: 
I.  Why is MPSS adopted in the workplace? 
II. What are the benefits of adopting MPSS in the workplace?
III. What are the challenges that participants encountered in MPSS adoption?
To answer these questions, the study employed qualitative field interviews. Managers and leaders of MPSS projects from 13 companies and organizations in North America joined the study, representing government, military, transportation, aviation, health care, higher education, medical, restaurant, retailing, semiconductors, and manufacturing. 
The results led to the identification of ten main reasons, six salient benefits, and 12 top challenges reported by over 30% of participants. The main reasons for adopting MPSS were to improve efficiency, aid work in the field, lower costs, provide support in the moment, minimize human errors, manage content, meet job condition requirements, alleviate worker burdens, assist highly complex tasks, and support learning. The salient benefits for adopting MPSS were to boost performance, build confidence, encourage professional satisfaction, increase ROI, manage corporate knowledge, and enhance organizational reputation. The 12 prevailing challenges in MPSS adoption were grouped into four themes: change management (resistance, organizational culture, project planning, change implementation), technology usability consideration (Wi-Fi connection, interface design, device and infrastructure, environment), intervention design and development (development and delivery, content creation and maintenance), and project-related issues (cost and return, IT support).
The findings of the study provide insight about the adoption of MPSS in the workplace.  As the use of mobile technologies continue to expand and penetrate our daily lives, the results can help HPT professionals strategically adopt MPSS to support performance instead of blindly following current trends.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Many students experience writing anxiety, which may lead to students dropping out of or changing classes, majors, college, or professions to get away from writing requirements. This repeated measures random control trial tested the effect of an online scaffolded writing time management intervention on two outcome variables (1) writing performance and (2) writing anxiety. The intervention was designed to help students reduce their writing anxiety by providing structure and guidance to help students self-regulate (keep themselves on task during the pursuit of a goal; Zimmerman, 2000) in the context of a writing assignment. This study also explored the impact of five moderator variables: (1) writing self-efficacy, (2) self-efficacy for writing self-regulation, (3) procrastination, (4) gender, and (5) year-in-school. Participants of the study were 118 undergraduate students from fall and spring Educational Psychology courses. Participants were randomly assigned to either the control (business-as-usual) or intervention condition. Participants received pre-test measures at time 1 when the assignment was introduced, a writing anxiety and writing self-efficacy measure at time 2 during the week the assignment was due, and post-test measures at time 3 after students submitted their assignment but before receiving their grades. Only writing anxiety and writing self-efficacy were measured at all three time points. The main analysis of the effect of the intervention on writing performance was severely underpowered; however, the moderator analyses had some significant and adequately powered results. Student writing self-efficacy moderated the effect of the intervention on writing performance (? = .045). Specifically, participants in the intervention with below average writing self-efficacy at T1 had a significantly higher score (23.6%) on writing performance (? = .033, ? = -1.900). While the overall test of students’ self-efficacy for writing self-regulation did not moderate the effect of the intervention on writing performance (? = .203), it was underpowered and visually presented an interaction. Follow up tests revealed, that participants in the intervention with above average self-efficacy for writing self-regulation had a significantly higher grade (22.1%) on writing performance (? &lt; .001, ? = -2.186), leading to the overall conclusion that a student’s perceived self-efficacy for writing self-regulation does moderate the effect on writing performance. Results indicated that there was an increase in writing anxiety scores between T1 and T2 for all participants (? = .024) and specifically for the control group between T1 and T2 (? = .048), however, when corrected for Type I error these tests were not significant. The intervention also may have stabilized participants‘ writing anxiety. There were two moderators from the writing anxiety tests with enough power to form a conclusion. Both procrastination (? = .515, ηp² =.305) and self-efficacy for writing self-regulation (? = .269, ηp² =.304) did not moderate the effect of the intervention on writing anxiety. All other analyses were underpowered. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Suicide is a leading cause of death and a serious public health problem in the U.S., with certain age, gender, and ethnoracial subgroups being at greater risk. Incorporating dimensional models of psychopathology (e.g., Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology) into suicide prediction models may improve performance and effectiveness of the prediction of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs). Such efforts may be complemented by examining whether dimensional psychopathology and STB prediction models are valid and applicable across diverse identities, as samples in both dimensional psychopathology and STB literature tend to lack diversity. Thus, multi-group confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to assess structural invariance of the dimensional psychopathology model across sex assigned at birth and ethnoracial identity in a sample of substance-using young adults (n = 511). Additionally, hierarchical logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the associations between the dimensional internalizing and externalizing psychopathology factors and suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempts (SA) and whether these associations were moderated by sex assigned at birth and ethnoracial identity moderated the association between. Structural invariance testing results supported partial metric (i.e., weak) invariance of the dimensional internalizing and externalizing psychopathology model across sex assigned at birth and ethnoracial identity. Logistic regression models indicated internalizing psychopathology was significantly correlated with suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempts (SA) above externalizing psychopathology; follow-up mediation analyses showed the association between externalizing and SI and SA was fully mediated by internalizing. No significant moderation effects were found for ethnoracial status, indicating the association between internalizing and externalizing psychopathology and SI and SA did not differ across ethnoracial identity. Moderation results showed the association between internalizing and SI were stronger at higher levels of externalizing for females and lower levels of externalizing for males.  </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Historically, soldiers wore decorative uniforms to distinguish between friend and foe on the battlefield. During World War I, heavy casualties caused the French Army to recruit artists to develop camouflage patterns for their battlefield uniforms. Since then, military camouflage uniforms have been universally implemented for forest, desert, grassland, ocean, and snowy environments. Although many nations have international boundaries that border a large body of water, very limited research has been conducted to develop camouflage patterns for littoral environments. Currently, camouflage pattern effectiveness are evaluated by using the camouflage similarity index (CSI). This technique, however, has drawbacks due to the heterogeneity of camouflage designs and the under-representation of environmental features. Hence, the two overall goals for this research are to (i) create novel littoral camouflage patterns for Northwest Florida’s coastal environments, and to (ii) develop new camouflage assessment procedures. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the first goal, new littoral camouflage patterns were modeled after eight variations of military camouflage designs. These patterns were created by inserting dominant environmental colors for Northwest Florida’s littoral environments into eight custom-built digital camouflage templates. The dominant colors were extracted from three custom-built images datasets for Northwest Florida’s estuarine, sandy, and combination estuarine-sandy coastlines. Twenty-four new littoral camouflage patterns were created by using these custom-made templates. These camouflage patterns were then used to produce the 64x64-pixel camouflage swatches, the 128x128-pixel camouflage patterns, and the 256x256-pixel camouflage patterns training datasets. Each training dataset had three variations for Northwest Florida’s three types of shorelines. As a result, nine custom-made training datasets were produced to train generative models to output novel littoral camouflage patterns. These generative models included a variational autoencoder (VAE), a generative adversarial network (GAN), and a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The second research goal was to develop new camouflage pattern evaluation procedures. A novel camouflage assessment method (NCAM) was created. It overcame the CSI drawbacks by achieving a better representation of a camouflage design and a natural environment. The NCAMs for each novel camouflage pattern were sorted in ascending order. The most effective pattern had the lowest NCAM and a ranking of one. The least effective pattern had a NCAM of one and a ranking of 81. A new camouflage pattern rating system that uses a holistic approach for assessing camouflage patterns was then developed. It was based on NCAMs, runtimes, absence or presence of unusual features, and design appearances. This rating system could be adapted to incorporate other camouflage assessment methods to rank patterns. It has seven categories ranging from “best” to “worst”. Each novel camouflage pattern was assessed by using this rating system. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The impact of hyperparameters on pattern effectiveness was analyzed. The overall effectiveness of camouflage patterns, generative models, the impact of training dataset pixel size on pattern ratings, and the effect of training epochs on pattern appearances were also addressed.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>There were eight contributions for this investigation, and they were grouped into five categories. The first area was to develop a glossary of littoral terms that provided definitions and locations of Northwest Florida coastal features. It could be used for educational purposes and for other types of littoral research to include beach re-nourishment, wildlife biology, and ecological research. The second involved developing two types of custom-built datasets because they are unavailable in the public domain. The littoral images and camouflage training datasets were required for creating and evaluating new camouflage patterns. The third contribution involved creating digital camouflage templates to facilitate creating new patterns. These templates are also not available in the public domain. The fourth involved creating new littoral camouflage patterns by using two different procedures. The first was to insert extracted colors from the littoral images datasets into the digital templates. The second was to create novel camouflage patterns by training generative models on the custom-built camouflage training datasets. Currently, littoral camouflage patterns are unavailable for use by militaries. The fifth contribution area involved developing two camouflage pattern evaluation procedures: NCAM and camouflage pattern rating system. The NCAM overcomes CSI drawbacks to achieve a better representation of a camouflage pattern and an environment. The camouflage pattern rating system is a holistic approach developed to evaluate camouflage pattern effectiveness. It takes into account NCAMs, runtimes, design artifacts, and design appearances. This rating system could be adapted to incorporate other camouflage assessment methods, such as the combined NCAM-SSIM procedure. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study offers an overview of the landscape of LGBTQ+ leadership and initiatives at large public universities in the state of Florida. Through the recognition that LGBTQ+ leaders often have to navigate complex institutional, social, and political systems, Bronfenbrenner’s Ecological Systems Theory provided the theoretical framework for the study and served as a way to examine the relationships between the leaders and the varying institutional bodies they serve. Eight leaders from seven of Florida’s public universities were interviewed in this qualitative, exploratory study, and the study was guided by questions related to how leaders were supporting their LGBTQ+ populations and how LGBTQ+ initiatives were being designed to engage with students in virtual environments. The findings suggest that leaders support LGBTQ+ populations in three ways: through advocacy work, educational training and programming, and community building. Regarding how LGBTQ+ initiatives are being designed for virtual environments, the findings reveal that leaders develop strategic communications plans, leverage social media, and design and develop their programming for hybrid and online delivery. Because the findings highlight the value of partnerships as ways to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion work, the implications are presented for LGBTQ+ leaders, LGBTQ+ leaders and faculty, and LGBTQ+ leaders and instructional designers. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>I report the effects of aspartame on anxiety-like behavior, neurotransmitter signaling and gene expression in the amygdala, a brain region associated with the regulation of anxiety and fear responses. C57BL/6 mice consumed drinking water containing 0.015% or 0.03% aspartame, a dose equivalent of 8-15% of the FDA recommended maximum human daily intake, or plain drinking water. Robust anxiety-like behavior (evaluated using open field test and elevated zero maze) was observed in male and female mice consuming the aspartame-containing water. Diazepam, an allosteric modulator of the GABA-A receptor, alleviated the anxiety. RNA sequencing of the amygdala followed by KEGG biological pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes showed glutamatergic and GABAergic synapse pathways as significantly enriched. Quantitative PCR showed upregulation of mRNA for the glutamate NMDA receptor subunit 2D (Grin2d) and metabotropic receptor 4 (Grm4), and downregulation of the GABA-A receptor associated protein (Gabarap) mRNA. 	Thus, taken together, our diazepam and gene expression data show that aspartame consumption shifted the excitation-inhibition equilibrium in the amygdala toward excitation. Even more strikingly, the anxiety-like behavior, its response to diazepam, and changes in amygdala gene expression were transmitted to male and female offspring in two generations descending from the aspartame-exposed males. Extrapolation of the findings to humans suggests that aspartame consumption at doses below the FDA recommended maximum daily intake may produce neurobehavioral changes in aspartame-consuming individuals and their descendants. Thus, human population at risk of aspartame’s potential mental health effects may be larger than current expectations, which only include aspartame consuming individuals.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Adolescence is a period of increased risk-taking behaviors including the initiation of alcohol use, which appears mechanistically related to the brain’s reward system. Available evidence provides support for both hyposensitivity and hypersensitivity as mediators of substance or alcohol use escalation – calling for further research to better understand the role of reward systems in risk trajectories, utilizing effective indices of reward processing. The reward positivity (RewP) is a commonly utilized index of hedonic “liking,” an important aspect of reward activation. Existing studies with adults have provided evidence for reduced, enhanced, or intact RewP among samples with risk for, or histories of problem drinking or other harmful substance use. However, to date, no research has examined relations between youth alcohol use and RewP, although research on adolescents at risk for substance use, or currently using tobacco or cannabis, has not found differences in RewP relative to adolescent controls, outside of one past sex-specific finding in adolescent males. The current study measured the RewP within a binary-choice reward task in a large sample (N = 250) of adolescent females (Mage = 14.40) to evaluate its predictive association with self-reported drinking initiation and past-month drinking. Regression analyses showed that adolescents who had initiated drinking exhibited a smaller RewP—specifically, a smaller response to monetary gain feedback—compared to not-yet drinkers. There was no difference in RewP between past-month drinkers and non-drinkers. These findings provide evidence for the importance of limited capacity for hedonic “liking” as a risk factor for early initiation of drinking in adolescent females, while other patterns may underlie likelihood for proximal drinking escalation. Future studies should incorporate additional indices of reward activation, and mixed-sex samples with greater drinking variability to replicate current study findings and test for sex moderation of observed reward-response/drinking associations.   </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Protein function needs to get regulated in every organism, and mis-regulation of protein function can cause serious disease states. Regulation of protein function is essential for controlling and organizing many different cellular processes. It has been postulated that the emergence of a new regulatory mechanism often requires protein conformational heterogeneity. In another word, protein needs to have access to two or more different conformations. Although there are many studies performed on different polypeptides and the regulatory processes associated with them, there is little knowledge available regarding the evolutionary origins of new regulatory mechanisms. One example of such regulatory process is allosteric regulation. One example of allosteric regulation is the allosteric regulation of glucokinase by one of its substrate glucose. Glucokinase is the primary glucose sensor in human body and a key determinant of glucose homeostasis in vertebrates. Allosteric regulation of glucokinase is of substantial interest as glucokinase is a monomeric enzyme and has just one binding site for glucose. Mis-regulation of glucokinase activity causes diabetes and hyperinsulinemia. Glucokinase is an ideal system to investigate the evolutionary link between conformational heterogeneity and regulation because: glucokinase is regulated by several mechanisms that require access to multiple states, also, glucokinase is evolutionarily tractable. As such, understanding the evolutionary origins of glucokinase regulatory processes provides direct insight into the emergence of physiology and disease. The aim of this research is to understand how evolution, by the means of natural selection, altered protein sequence, structure and function to introduce a new regulatory mechanism. For this purpose, herein, I reconstructed ancestral glucokinase sequences, resurrected extinct proteins and performed biophysical analyses to illuminate the functional transitions that afford access to new glucokinase conformations. I used a variety of techniques such as kinetic assays, proteolysis, X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance experiments for the purpose of this study.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The growth of social media has created a new type of celebrity, referred to as social media influencers (SMI) (Appel, Grewal, Hadi, Stephen, 2020), and a new endorsement technique known as influencer marketing (Brown, Hayes, 2008). Influencer marketing is particularly dominant in the beauty and fashion industries (Driver, 2018).Despite the growth in the influencer marketing industry, the amount of academic research on social media influencers is insufficient (Taillon, Mueller, Kowalczyk, Jones, 2020). In addition, there are inconsistencies across the literature about the source factors’ outcomes. Finally, a significant majority of the research in the area of SMI, examined the effectiveness of SMIs in a broad context and not in a specific product category.
The main objective of this dissertation is to investigate the influence of source factors among social media fashion influencers (SMFIs), including perceived trustworthiness, expertise, physical attractiveness, perceived similarity, likability, and identification, on consumers’ attitudes toward SMFIs and consumers’ attitudes toward the product endorsed by SMFIs. Next, the impacts of consumers’ attitudes toward SMFIs, and attitudes toward the endorsed product, on consumers’ purchase intentions are explored. Additionally, the correlation between consumers’ attitudes toward SMFIs and their attitudes toward the product endorsed by SMFIs, and the correlation between consumers’ fashion involvement and their purchase intention are examined.
The results show that perceived trustworthiness, physical attractiveness, and likability have a significant and positive influence on consumers’ attitudes toward SMFIs. Additionally, perceived expertise and likability have a significant and positive influence on consumers’ attitudes toward the product endorsed by SMFIs. Also, it was found that consumers’ attitudes toward the product, perceived similarity, and identification have a significant and positive influence on consumers’ purchase intention. A significant and positive correlation between consumers’ attitudes toward SMFIs and consumers’ attitudes toward the endorsed product was found. Finally, the results show a significant and positive correlation between consumers’ involvement with fashion products and their purchase intentions.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The eastern Indian Ocean is dynamic and rich in mesoscale eddy activity, and this complex circulation has implications for biological properties. The Argo Basin, south of Java and northwest of Australia, is located in the tropical eastern Indian Ocean and is considered an oligotrophic region (i.e., low in chlorophyll and nutrient concentrations). Despite this, it is the only known spawning region for Southern bluefin Tuna. Generally, oligotrophic regions are nitrogen limited. However, the processes that supply nitrogen to the Argo Basin are not known. Here we investigated how much particulate organic matter (POM) is laterally advected and the role of this advected organic matter in supplying new nitrogen to the mixed layer of the Argo Basin using 14 years (2003 -2016) of remotely sensed data. Our results show that the average net primary productivity of phytoplankton in this offshore oligotrophic region is 98.5 Gg C d-1 and that lateral advection of particulate organic carbon (POC) transports 1.21 Gg C d-1 into the region. If we assume that the Argo Basin has an f-ratio (ratio of new production / net primary production) that is typical of oligotrophic regions (i.e., 10%) we find that lateral advection of organic matter supplies an annual average of 12% of the nitrogen supporting the ecosystem (assuming that bulk particulate matter has a similar C:N ratio to phytoplankton). This suggests that lateral advection is a quantitatively important but not dominant source of nitrogen supporting the phytoplankton at the base of the food chain. This region has its highest productivity during the austral winter (June to August) which may be due to the Southwest monsoon causing substantial mesoscale activity. Furthermore, we found that 65% of lateral advection of POC into the region is driven by mesoscale eddies and organic matter primarily enters our study region through the eastern boundary of our domain. Our results may help to inform predictions and models to simulate the responses of oligotrophic systems to future change.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Volunteer engagement is critical to achieving the mission of volunteer organizations (Boone et al., 2002). Fogarty et al. (2009) found that 4-H volunteers are a mediating factor in achieving positive youth development outcomes and are responsible for teaching at least 50% of the life skills youth gain from participation in the organization. For 4-H to consistently achieve positive youth development outcomes, volunteers must be prepared for their roles (Arnold, 2009). However, most 4-H volunteer education programs are offered sporadically (Smith et al., 2017) and tend to focus on fundamental skills (Serafino, 2001), rather than more complex skills volunteers need to create supportive environments for positive youth development outcomes to occur (Arnold et al., 2009). Volunteers often state that a lack of learning opportunities is the reason why they do not continue to serve as a volunteer (Fahey et al., 2003). Also, many volunteers face obstacles participating in formal training, particularly when it is only offered face-to-face in a physical location (Ouellette et al., 2014). 	To address these issues, Spink (2016) recommends integrating more opportunities for self-directed learning and on demand resources. Studies by Homan et al. (2020) and White et al. (2020) found that 4-H volunteers desired more opportunities for mentoring, networking, and access to communities of practice to build content-specific knowledge and skills. 4-H volunteers also want more opportunities for mentoring and online and virtual learning (Dillard, 2020; Hensley et al. 2020; Kok et al., 2020). Intentionally providing opportunities for volunteers to learn through informal learning may be a solution to address issues related to volunteer education. 
	The relationship between work &amp; informal learning is the strongest within the context of volunteering (Livingstone, 1999) but is the least understood (Duguid et al., 2013). While informal learning has been studied in the context of paid work, informal learning that occurs through volunteering is often considered passive (Cox, 2002), and is unplanned, unstructured, and ignored by organizations (Duguid et al., 2013; Livingstone &amp; Guile, 2012). As a result, a systematic framework for organizations to intentionally develop and support pathways for informal learning does not currently exist. The purpose of the current study was to explore how volunteers in the Florida 4-H Positive Youth Development program engage in informal learning to support their volunteer roles. The goal of the study is to develop a list of informal learning activities volunteers participate to design a conceptual framework to guide organizations in the development of informal learning activities for volunteers to select from and explore. Four research questions guided this study:
1.	What types of informal learning activities do Florida 4-H volunteers participate in to support their performance as a volunteer?
2.	How frequently do volunteers engage in these types of informal learning activities?
3.	Which informal learning activities do volunteers identify as most helpful to support their volunteer performance? 
4.	Why do Florida 4-H volunteers engage in informal learning?
This two-part study consisted of an online questionnaire and follow-up interviews with current Florida 4-H volunteers. Respondents to the survey included 237 adult volunteers of which 20 participated in semi-structured interviews. 
	The results from both survey and interview data indicated that volunteers frequently engage in a variety of informal learning activities. The top five activities volunteers did on a weekly basis included: searching the internet, reading newsletters, blogs, curriculum, and other print materials, collaborating with others on a joint task, setting personal goals, and using social media. When 4-H volunteers use informal learning, they want to learn about topics related to positive youth development, educational design and delivery, organization, 4-H program management, and interpersonal relationship skills. These topics are domains of learning Culp et al. (2007) found to be essential for volunteers to be successful. 
Volunteers shared the number one reason why they choose to participate in informal learning is because they want to improve their performance. This supports the motto of the organization, which is “to make the best better.” Volunteers also stated that they use informal learning because they have learning needs that are not currently being met by the organization and because it is more convenient and flexible for them than traditional didactic methods. Finally, volunteers said that informal learning aids in not only motivating youth but keeps them excited about the volunteer work they do for the organization. This study resulted in several implications for volunteer organizations, as well as a conceptual framework for organizations to guide intentional informal learning for volunteers.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The issue of non-degradable petroleum-based plastics waste is a global challenge that requires urgent attention due to its harmful impact on humans and the environment. To overcome this challenge, biomass-based materials have received great attention these days. Lignin is not only one of the important biomasses due to its abundance, low price, and rich aromatic group, but also an important material that can be used as a raw material to produce biodegradable polymers. However, lignin modification is not well understood or characterized due to its complex chemical structure, limiting the use of lignin. Especially, poorly defined excessive reaction sites of lignin cause uncontrolled crosslinking in lignin to make thermoset polymers. This dissertation presents novel methods to achieve the advanced biodegradable lignin-based polyesters with covalent bond via 1) precise and well-defined chemical modification of natural lignin and 2) controlling the crosslinking density of lignin. Then, by combining the methods of 1) and 2), we can develop 100 % biomass-based biodegradable polymer.
First, we developed a new and precisely defined synthetic protocol which integrates lignin and poly(ethylene brassylate) (PEB) to make a lignin-graft-PEB. The lignin was chemically modified by sebacic acid to introduce a carboxylic acid functionality. Abundant hydroxyl groups on lignin were used for its modification. A relatively unexplored and inexpensive castor oil-derived polymer, PEB was prepared by ring-opening polymerization of ethylene brassylate in the presence of a catalyst, 1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec-5-ene. The prepared PEB was graft copolymerization onto modified lignin through an acid anhydride bond. The new polymer shows optimal melting temperature (78 ℃) that enables an easy thermal process. Mechanical properties of the new lignin-graft-PEB can be changed by altering the molecular weight (Mn) of PEB and mass ratios of lignin and PEB. The highest modulus is 471.99 MPa, which is 3-folds higher than low-density polyethylene. However, blended polymer without covalent linkage shows poor mechanical properties (220.7 Mpa of young’s modulus) due to the microlevel phase separations within the polymer matrix.
Second, we developed a highly efficient crosslinking control method by using a capping agent, acetic acid. Acetic acid capped the hydroxyl group to reduce the number of excessive reaction sites in the lignin, and succinic acid is used to introduce carboxylic acid functionality. Using this method, we prepared succinic acid-modified lignin-graft-poly(ethylene glycol) with different amounts of a capping agent. The lignin-based polymer synthesis has two steps: 1) lignin modification with succinic acid and capping agent and 2) graft copolymerization of PEG-OH onto the modified lignin. Thermal properties of prepared succinic acid-modified lignin-graft-PEGs were investigated to study the relation between the amount of capping agent and crosslinking density. Lignin-graft-PEG showed a clear trend to lower Tm and Tg at lower crosslinking (large amount of capping agent). Tg of the lignin graft-PEG decreased from 2.6 °C to 27.5 °C by increasing the capping agent from 6 % to 59 %. The precise control of available reaction sites on lignin using a capping agent resulted in a convenient way to adjust the degree of crosslinking. 
Third, we have synthesized a fully biomass-based polyester, capped lignin-graft-castor oil. The lignin was chemically modified by succinic acid and capping agent, acetic acid. The other biomass of the copolymer was castor oil. The castor oil was used in its pristine form without any modification. These two biomasses are linked with covalent bonding through esterification in the presence of carbodiimide. This new method could be easily scalable in the industry due to its convenient synthesis procedure, fewer reaction step and moderate reaction conditions. The synthesized copolymer showed decent melting temperature and glass transition temperature to enable thermal processing. The mechanical properties of new capped lignin-graft-castor oil can be controlled by changing the crosslinking density and the mass ratio of capped lignin to castor oil. The highest modulus is 228.43 MPa, which is higher than that of low-density polyethylene (LDPE). In addition, a structure-property relationship of capped lignin-graft-castor oil was confirmed by controlling the crosslinking density and weight % of capped lignin and castor oil. 
Overall, this dissertation demonstrates novel synthetic methods for advanced biomass-based biodegradable polymer. Our new lignin modification methods would increase the value of lignin as a raw material of biodegradable polymers. These methods can significantly change polymer properties while improving mechanical properties and enabling thermal processing. In addition, the synthesized 100 % biomass-based biodegradable can be expected to have great advantages in terms of cost and mass production. The demonstrated approaches and synthesized lignin-based biodegradable polyester in the dissertation can be important discoveries in the global trend to replace petroleum-based non-degradable plastics with biodegradable polymers.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The focus of this thesis is to examine skeletal health indicators of prehistoric Native Americans populations from the Central Illinois River Valley from the early Woodland period into the Mississippian period. The effects of specific subsistence practices with the introduction of maize agriculture, site proximity to mound centers, and increasing population density during the Mississippian period has long been tied to an overall increase in the frequency of certain pathologies. Through an observation of pathological presence/absence and scoring of severity across multiple sites from St. Clair County, Green County, and Fulton County, I hypothesize that there will be a significant increase in all the observed pathologies during the Mississippian period in comparison to the Woodland period for all regions. Analysis includes the examination of periodontal disease, signs of anemia, signs of growth stresses, non-specific infections, trauma, and degenerative joint disease. My primary findings partially support my hypothesis of increased likelihood of pathologies related to health in the Mississippian period. The greatest significant differences between these two periods were found with the increase in trauma and DJD in the Mississippian. This trend is particularly visible when comparing site location. Green County (Schild site) and Fulton County sites carry by far the greatest percentage of trauma and arthritis (particularly in the lumbar vertebrae). The overall conclusion is therefore mixed. It seems that some pathologies increased in this region during the Mississippian, but they may be more related to interactions or perhaps conflict between mound centers in Central Illinois and Southern Illinois, rather than shifts in subsistence from the Woodland.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The problem of class imbalance has become frequent, and missing data also are often a predicament in the social sciences. In the literature, the two problems have been debated substantially and separately. Class imbalance has been shown to adversely impact the estimation of logistic regression coefficients. Also, the missing data problem has been demonstrated to yield bias in parameter estimation in various types of statistical analyses. This simulation study focuses on the context logistic regression and investigates how class imbalance interact with missing data to impact the estimation of the coefficients and test procedures such as the Wald and likelihood ratio tests. Three factors are considered in this simulation—(1) missing data mechanisms MCAR, MAR, MNAR, (2) sample sizes—small, 100; medium, 500; and large, 1000, (3) class imbalance ratios 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50%. The results demonstrate that the combination of class imbalance and missing data problems affects the performance of the logistic regression, particularly when the imbalance ratio is as low as 10% and the sample size is also low, and potential methods for the remedies are suggested.  </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>When we construct a Bayesian hierarchical model, we are required to specify a prior distribution. There are some considerations when specifying the prior distribution, such as prior misspecification, and this use of preliminary estimates. This dissertation proposes to constrain a Bayesian model on a ball centering at a preliminary estimate or the ball's complement (i.e., disc). This approach extends the constrained Bayesian model in Bradley and Zong (2021) to consider the ball or the disc in specific inferential settings. In Chpater 2, we are motivated to estimate the change in the distribution of housing sale prices in the Manhattan housing market during the COVID-19 pandemic with strict COVID-19 guidelines and social distancing policies using individual transaction and property data from Zillow (ZTRAX). To improve the precision of the Dirichlet process mixture model (DPM) for density estimation, we adopt a constrained Bayes approach incorporating the kernel density estimator (KDE). Specifically, this approach constrains the joint support of the data and parameters in the DPM on either a set centered around a KDE or the complement of this set. When the KDE is a reasonable (as measured by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic) preliminary estimator, we constrain the DPM to be close to the KDE and vice versa. We call our method the density-constrained Bayesian hierarchical model (D-CBHM). By doing so, we can simultaneously account for all sources of variability as well as incorporate preliminary information from the KDE. We demonstrate that the D-CBHM analytically (under reasonable conditions) and empirically outperforms the DPM in mean integrated squared error. We apply our method to our motivating dataset of Manhattan's home sales price and estimate how the COVID-19 pandemic changed the market in volume and distribution.
 In Chapter 3, we introduce the constrained Bayesian hierarchical model (CBM), which considers Bayesian models with both a noninformative and an informative prior distribution. Specifically, we constrain the joint support of the data and parameters in a noninformative Bayesian model on a ball centering at an informative posterior estimate, such as the posterior mean in the Bayesian model with an informative prior distribution or its complement. This approach incorporates prior sensitivity analysis by considering two different prior distributions. It also alleviates potential concerns related to prior misspecification but still uses the given prior information outside the Bayesian model whose support is constrained. We then prove that the constrained model outperforms the Bayesian model solely with the noninformative and the informative prior distributions in terms of mean squared error. In practice, the set which the Bayesian model is constrained on is determined based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic and the posterior expected mean squared error, and the Bayesian model whose support is constrained is determined based on the predictive accuracy measure such as Watanabe–Akaike information criterion. We show that the practical CBM empirically and generally outperforms the (unconstrained) Bayesian model. We apply the practical CBM to Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data to estimate the association between gene expressions and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Extant literature indicates that Chinese graduate students experience academic writing anxiety when writing with English as their second language (Cheng, 2014b; Ho, 2016; Huang, 2014; Liang &amp; Turner, 2021).  Writing anxiety exerts negative impacts on students’ engagement with writing (Daly &amp; Miller, 1975), has negative association with writing self-efficacy (Pajares &amp; Johnson, 1994) and the quality of writing (Daly, 1978), and negatively predicts self-regulated writing strategy use (Paul et al., 2021; Stewart et al., 2015; Wang &amp; Zhan, 2020). Therefore, it is important to further understand academic writing anxiety with English as a second language (L2) so that Chinese graduate students have successful learning experiences in the American educational setting. However, few theories account for language learning anxiety, including such skill-specific anxieties as writing anxiety. Besides, previous studies did not link the antecedents and consequences of writing anxiety together. To address these gaps, this dissertation study investigated the relationships among Chinese graduate students’ L2 academic writing mindsets (students’ beliefs about whether they can increase their academic writing competence or not), their perceived academic writing competence, academic writing anxiety, academic writing self-efficacy, self-regulated writing and students’ self-satisfaction with their own academic writing.  The participants (n=223) were Chinese international students enrolled in various graduate programs in American universities. All the data for this dissertation study were collected through an online survey questionnaire. A path analysis was conducted to investigate the relationships among the antecedents and consequences of Chinese graduate students’ academic writing anxiety. Results of data analysis showed that when students endorsed fixed mindset, they tended to have higher levels of writing anxiety, as well as lower levels of academic writing self-efficacy. On the contrary, when students had a stronger endorsement of growth mindset, they tended to have higher levels of academic writing self-efficacy. However, students’ growth mindset was not significantly associated with their levels of academic writing anxiety. Students’ perceived competence for academic writing had a significant moderation effect on the relationship between growth mindset and writing self-efficacy. When students perceived higher competence for academic writing, the relationship between growth mindset and writing self-efficacy became weaker. When students had lower levels of perceived competence, the relationship between growth mindset and writing self-efficacy was stronger. Both students’ perceived competence and their writing self-efficacy accounted for students’ use of self-regulated strategies. That meant, when students had higher perceived competence and/or higher writing self-efficacy, they tended to use self-regulated writing strategies more often. In turn, students’ use of self-regulated writing strategies, together with perceived competence, was positively associated with students’ self-satisfaction with their academic writing. 
The dissertation study had both theoretical and pedagogical implications. The study provided valuable information on mindsets, perceived competence, and writing anxiety, which is relevant for Chinese international graduate students, graduate students experiencing writing anxiety, professors, academic advisors, and writing center staff. The findings of the study underlined the importance of overcoming fixed mindset and cultivating growth mindset, as well as improving writing competence and using self-regulation. The present study can also help pave the path for future research on related topics.        </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Between the years of 1932 and 1945, modern Italian muralism, otherwise known as l’arte murale, made its debut in the Italian art world, bringing with it disputes and problems related to the discourse surrounding the endeavor, the materials that would make up these works, and the iconography and subject matter of the images. The muralists of modern Italy primarily depended on funding from the Partito Nazionale Fascista (National Fascist Party or PNF) to make public murals for schools, post offices, train stations, fascist administrative buildings, and temporary exhibition spaces, complicating their works and raising the stakes of the modern practice of muralism. This dissertation considers the understudied history of modern Italian muralism in the ventennio, or twenty years of fascism and its relationship to the building of the Italian fascist empire under Benito Mussolini. Focusing on such artists as Mario Sironi, Massimo Campigli, Gino Severini, and Enrico Prampolini, each of the four chapters largely considers the language used to describe modern Italian muralism by practitioners, architects, critics, and fascist bureaucrats. As a secondary goal of each of the four chapters makes claims about the iconography related to imperialism and the experiments in modern and ancient materials. By focusing on these aspects, this dissertation demonstrates how modern muralism shifts throughout the 1930s and 1940s in Italy and how those alterations relate to political, social, imperialistic, and artistic issues and debates. 
While the existing scholarship has paid abundant attention to the art of Italian fascist culture, there is a major gap in the literature regarding Italian muralism during the ventennio and its effect on Italian artists, viewers, administrators, and future trajectories of Italian art. According to some of the primary literature and the secondary scholarship, modern Italian muralism was seen as a regression in art, returning to a more traditional or conservative position at a time when European modernism and the avant-garde laid a foundation for radical experimentation and a reshaping of human existence. However, the work of the Italian muralists, and the discourse surrounding it, demonstrate a serious desire and initiative to explore the social, political, and visual effects of modern materials within their murals. While some of the modern Italian murals may superficially appear conventional or predictable, this dissertation proves otherwise.
Unlike mural practices occurring simultaneously in France, Germany, Mexico, the United States, and the Soviet Union, Italy’s modern muralism carried the weight of mural traditions that extend back to antiquity. Italy’s rich past is something that modern Italian muralists grappled with when creating their own murals under fascism. With experiments in fresco, mosaic, the plastica murale (plastic mural), and the fotomosaico (photomosaic), the modern Italian muralists transformed the tradition of Italian muralism into something unique and modern, and these examples are deserving of a rigorous analysis.

            <DISS_para>The focus of this study is the merger of the arts and business through the lens of African American entrepreneurs The culmination of business and the arts is unique for African American artists who face unique challenges pursuing entrepreneurial endeavors. For undergraduate and graduate students studying the arts, the benefit of such research is more knowledge of general business practices; for those studying business, this merger of disciplines provides exposure to the arts and aesthetics. Despite the emergence of arts entrepreneurship as a field, African American arts entrepreneurs remain under studied within the research. The purpose of this study is to identify factors that influence paths to entrepreneurial success for African Americans arts entrepreneurs. This qualitative research study explored and described the education, training, and career backgrounds of African American arts entrepreneurs, factors that advanced their entrepreneurial efforts, factors that impeded their efforts, and strategies they used to overcome barriers to success as entrepreneurs. I anticipate my study will advance the conversation on the uniqueness of the African American arts entrepreneurs. Exploring the entrepreneurial efforts of African Americans in the arts is critical to expanding knowledge about the commonalities and differences found in successful arts business ventures. I chose an exploratory qualitative approach in this study to aid in analyzing the data and establish a better understanding of success among African American arts entrepreneurs. I based the interview protocol on the overarching research question about the factors that influence the achievement of success of African American entrepreneurs in the arts, and the questions sought to unearth how the participants navigated such barriers.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This treatise presents Leoš Janáček’s Sonata for Violin and Piano and George Enescu’s Sonata for Violin and Piano No. 3, Op. 25 “dans le caractère populaire Roumain” with a focus on indigenous elements and vocal influences, in order to guide a violin-piano duo’s musical interpretation. Chapter One presents Janáček’s speech-melody theory and connects it to his use of interruptive motifs and rhythmic irregularities in the sonata. It also describes the vital role and influence of the cimbalom in Moravian indigenous music as well as Janáček’s replication of its textures throughout the piece. Chapter Two introduces musical elements of the Romani lăutari style and examines Enescu’s portrayal of “le caractère populaire Roumain” through the lenses of rhythmic complexity, elaborate violinistic ornamentation, and unique sound colors that imitate lăutari instruments. This treatise serves as a guide to help performing musicians craft an informed, artistic interpretation of these two sonatas, and offers suggestions for practice, rehearsal, and performance.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Changes in water balance variables such as runoff and evapotranspiration (ET) are essential in planning and management of land and water resources. Two major factors affecting these variables are climate and land use change. There is a need to investigate the combined effects of land use and climate change at local scales. Towards that end, the hydrological processes were modeled using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to investigate the impacts of climate and land use change in Southeast US (Makhtoumi, Li, Ibeanusi, &amp; Chen, 2020). We integrated land use based on the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) with future climate data (CMIP5) to study the combined effects on hydrological response of Upper Choctawhatchee Watershed (UCW.) Future rainfall and air temperature, for two time periods (2040-2069 and 2070-2099), were obtained using Global Climate Models to provide SWAT with the climatic forcing in order to project water balance variables. The simulation was carried out under two radiative forcing pathways of Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP6.0.) Our results indicate that increased imperviousness resulted from urbanization has more impact on runoff than that of projected changes in climate. Impacts on water balance variables (runoff, ET, discharge) differed seasonally. Results showed peak surface runoff experienced changes under both emission scenarios in June up to five times increase. Among the water balance variables, ET as the least dominant pathways for water loss, showed the modest changes with the largest decrease during fall and summer. Projections indicated more frequent extreme behavior regarding precipitation, peak surface runoff, water yield (WY) and ET, during midcentury. Discharge was estimated to increase through the year and the highest changes were expected during summer and fall with 186.3% increase in November under RCP6.0. Relying on rainfall for farming along with reduced agricultural land use (11.8%) and increased urban area (47%) and population growth, would likely make the water use efficiency critical.  In our second study, we focused on the combined impact of land use and climate change on soil erosion at local scales. Topsoil loss is a widespread environmental concern causing adverse impacts on natural and human systems. Severe weather accompanied with human activities can exacerbate this issue degrading soil health and consequently accelerating global and regional food insecurity and injustice. Erosion impairs soil physical and chemical properties such as infiltration rate, water holding capacity, loss of nutrients including soil carbon and nitrogen. Although, temporal properties of a rainfall event have meaningful implications for soil erosion, spatial heterogeneity of a rainfall contributes substantially and cannot be overlooked. Therefore, in the third chapter we investigated soil loss using SWAT in Northern Mississippi. First, we built a hydrological model and calibrated it for both flow and sediment discharge. Then we developed land use and climate scenarios. The land use scenarios include farming (soybean and corn) and grazing practices. The climate scenarios comprise of four different precipitation time series, S0 which no concentration is forced, while S1, S2, and S3 have 3%, 6%, and 9% concentration in top four rainy days, respectively. We coupled the land use and climate scenarios and evaluated a small watershed (Hickahala Creek Watershed) in response. We classified the subbasins into different classes of soil loss severity and then determined the hotspots for soil loss at subbasin scale. Our result suggests that the resolution of rainfall data is crucial in studying the soil loss. We found that pasture management by itself can manifold soil loss, and if accompanied with extreme rainfalls, soil loss accelerates impacting different subbasins each time. We found that spatial heterogeneity of extreme rainfalls (ERs) can be more substantial than land use in individual extreme rainfalls; however, over a year, soil moisture and type of the management practices (grazing and farming) could contribute more to soil loss. Soil loss can go as high as 350 (ton/ha/yr) under the ERs. Adding only the management practices can increase erosion 3600%. Under S1 parts of watershed yield more than 150 ton/ha/yr (extremely severe). Under S2 and S3 more soil loss hotspots emerge yielding approximately 200 ton/ha/yr. We found that in the hotspots, up to 10% increase in CI can increase annual soil loss up to 75%. Single ER can generate up to 35% of annual soil loss. Under one ER event hotspot subbasins can lose up to 160 ton/ha/day (subbasin 15). The results reveal that adding grazing and farming (S0) under one ER event can increase soil loss by 95%. 32% and 80% increase in rainfall amount in one ER event can increase soil loss by 94% and 285% respectively. Our results suggested the importance of site-specific managements to mitigate soil loss and all the consequences. It is essential to consider the varying sensitivity of subbasins for the sustainability of agricultural landscapes.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Historical, cultural, and religious buildings and monuments frequently play an important role in everyday life.  Depending on the type of monument, they can speak to ideas such as identity, religious affiliation, or cultural heritage.  Often, these monuments represent specific ideas, beliefs, or concepts.  As physical symbols of these ideas, they are uniquely vulnerable.  Where intangible concepts themselves cannot be physically attacked, material representations of them can.  In armed conflict, it is not uncommon for these sites to become subject to the effects of combat, either deliberately or accidentally.  Throughout the history of warfare, monuments have been protected, other times, they have been intentionally attacked, and other times they were given little extra consideration over the rest of the battlefield’s topography.  What are the consequences of these various actions?  What are the military consequences when a belligerent military destroys a historical, religious, or cultural monument belonging to either belligerent or an otherwise neutral party?  What impact does the destruction have at war’s tactical, operational, or strategic levels?  These are the main questions this dissertation answers.  To answer these questions, this dissertation examines three different examples of the destruction of monuments during armed conflict throughout history.  The case studies examined include the burning of the Second Temple in Jerusalem by the Romans in 70 CE, the burning of the White House and Capitol by the British in 1814, and the bombing of the Abbey of Monte Cassino by the Allies during the Second World War.  This dissertation concludes that the destruction of monuments during armed conflict has military consequences, but they are often not significant or overwhelmingly negative for the attacker, and where more significant consequences are identified, it is difficult to assess their role in motivating particular actions.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Parrotfishes are nominal herbivores whose grazing is considered an important top-down control on benthic coral reef communities, maintaining cropped reef substrates that are conducive to the settlement and recruitment of coral larvae. As such, parrotfishes are crucial to the maintenance of reef resilience and in facilitating the recovery of reefs to healthy coral-dominated states following disturbance. Parrotfish foraging and its top-down effects on benthic coral reef communities have received substantial attention in the literature, but there are still key knowledge gaps in our understanding of parrotfish foraging ecology. The effects of grazing on benthic reef communities likely depend on how parrotfishes are using space on the reef. In many parrotfish species, large males defend intraspecific territories that include harems of initial phase females. While the social and mating systems of parrotfishes have been described for multiple parrotfish species, the effect of territoriality on space use in parrotfishes remains understudied. Likewise, the influence of spatial interactions on competition and coexistence has not been considered. In Chapter 1, we provide a general introduction to parrotfish ecology, highlighting important gaps in our understanding of parrotfish foraging, social, and spatial ecology. In Chapter 2, we investigate the occurrence of coprophagy (i.e., fecal consumption), in five Caribbean parrotfish species in Bonaire, Caribbean Netherlands. We found that coprophagy occurred frequently in four of the five most common parrotfish species in Bonaire. The majority of the feces consumed by parrotfishes were produced by planktivorous reef fishes, primarily Chromis spp. We used estimates of the carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous content of Chromis spp. feces from the literature to estimate their relative contribution to parrotfish diets, and determined that the amount of carbon obtained from these feces is equivalent to ~27 % of the carbon intake from their preferred benthic foraging substrates despite representing &lt;5% of their total bites. As such, coprophagy represents an important component of parrotfish diets. Recent studies have also highlighted the importance of microautotrophs, including cyanobacteria, to parrotfish nutrition. Cyanobacteria, including mat-forming benthic cyanobacteria, have increased in abundance on coral reefs globally, including in Bonaire. In Chapter 3, we investigate the consumption of benthic cyanobacterial mats in five Caribbean parrotfish species in Bonaire. We found that benthic cyanobacterial mats were a preferred foraging target for multiple parrotfish species, providing direct evidence in support of the recently proposed hypothesis that cyanobacteria and other microscopic photoautotrophs are the primary nutritional resource for parrotfishes. In Chapter 4, we investigate the effect of social interactions on parrotfish space use using data from concurrent GPS tracking and behavioral observations of five Caribbean parrotfish species in Bonaire. We found species-specific differences in space use among parrotfishes and that terminal phase male home ranges corresponded to largely exclusive, fixed intraspecific territories that were readily defended from intraspecific intruders. In Chapter 5, we build upon this foundation to investigate the potential role of movement and space use in mediating parrotfish coexistence. We quantified spatial interactions between parrotfishes and found that territorial intraspecific males avoided one another by reducing the spatial overlap of their home ranges, presumably a response to strong intraspecific competition. In contrast, interspecific male home ranges overlapped significantly more, suggesting the potential for dynamic interactions in shared space. We investigated dynamic interactions between pairs of simultaneously tracked interspecific males of Sparisoma viride and Scarus vetula to determine whether they move jointly, independently, or avoided one another in shared areas. We found evidence of dynamic avoidance for interspecific males that shared the most space. Movement may, therefore, play a role in limiting interference competition between competing species, particularly when sharing space is unavoidable. In Chapter 6, we assess the presence of dear enemy effects in Sp. viride. Dear enemy effects, in which territory holders interact more aggressively with strangers than with familiar neighbors, may reduce the cost of territoriality by reducing the number of energetically costly and time-consuming contests with intruders. Consistent with the dear enemy phenomenon, we found that male stoplight parrotfish, Sp. viride, interact more aggressively with non-territorial floaters than with neighbors. Aggressive interactions with territory holders also appear to drive movement and space use patterns in non-territorial males, relegating them to the boundaries between territories. Territoriality can regulate animal populations by setting the upper limits on population densities and non-territorial floaters play an important role in buffering population changes. Additionally, the constrained movement and space use that we report in the previous 3 chapters may have important implications for the functional roles of parrotfishes on coral reefs. Constraints on movement and space use result in spatially constrained grazing by parrotfishes, and may drive spatial heterogeneity in the structure and composition of benthic coral reef communities. Finally, in Chapter 7, we broadly discuss the importance of studying movement and space use to elucidate the effects of climate change on reef fish communities, including a discussion of trophic feedbacks between benthic and fish communities and the potential effects of climate change on spatial interactions and coexistence in reef fishes. As climate change continues to alter the composition of benthic communities on coral reefs, reef fish space use, which is often related to resource abundance, will also change. Altered patterns of space use may influence spatial interactions and increase competition for reduced resources (e.g., space and food), thus influencing species interactions and the composition of reef fish communities. Reef fish movement and space use may also interact with changes in benthic communities following disturbance to alter recovery trajectories. As such, baseline studies of reef fish space use, and the importance of movement and space use in mediating community structure will be important for predicting and understanding the effects of climate change on coral reefs.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Whereas it is generally accepted that theory of mind and language are related constructs, the nature of the relation remains unclear. Past research has suggested that two related, but distinct, components of theory of mind are differentially related to language. The present study attempted to clarify the relation between theory of mind and language within the context of this two-component model of theory of mind. Data from a large sample of preschool children were analyzed by utilizing a cross-lagged panel model to investigate concurrent and longitudinal relations between both theory of mind components and oral language. Results contradicted the predictions of the two-component model, however, features of the analysis prevent strong conclusions from being made about the relation between each theory of mind component and language. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) is a vascular disease that affects over 8 million Americans.  PAD patients commonly have vascular dysfunction and difficulty walking due to pain in the legs during physical exertion. Walking therapy has been recommended to improve walking performance and attenuate disease progression, but this therapy remains underutilized in PAD patients. Nutritional supplementation also has the potential to improve vascular health and walking performance, but there are few trials that combine exercise therapy and supplementation for PAD patients.  Recent evidence indicates that muscle stretching via ankle dorsiflexion splints improves vascular health and walking performance in PAD, but it is unknown how this stretching intervention affects microvascular function.  Additionally, there is some evidence to suggest that supplementation with creatine monohydrate can improve microvascular function, but it is unknown if this can enhance the effects of stretching in PAD patients.  Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of 4 weeks of a splint-based passive muscle stretching protocol with and without 4 weeks of creatine monohydrate supplementation on microvascular function, walking performance, and subjective measures of walking performance in patients with PAD.  Methods: Thirteen patients with PAD (69.2 ± 8.8 years; female = 6) were randomized to either a stretching plus creatine (Stretch + Cr) group or a stretching plus placebo (Stretch + Pl) group.  Both groups wore an ankle dorsiflexion splint for 30 minutes per day, 5 days per week for 4 weeks.  The Stretch + Cr group consumed 20 grams of creatine per day for the initial 5 days of the intervention period and 5 grams per day for the remaining days.  The Stretch + Pl group consumed the same amounts of a cellulose powder during the intervention period.  Microvascular function was assessed during a vascular occlusion test to determine the occlusion slope, reperfusion slope, and area under the curve overshoot (AUCO).  Walking performance was assessed via a six-minute walk test (6MWT) in which total walk distance (TWD) and pain-free walk distance (PFWD) were determined.  Finally, 8 participants completed the validated Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) before and after the intervention to determine subjective measures of walking distance, speed, and stair climbing.  A two-way (group x time), repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the effect of creatine (group) and stretching (time) on these outcomes.  Significance was accepted at p &lt; 0.05. Results: There were no significant differences between any baseline measurements nor protocol adherence rates between the Stretch + Cr and Stretch + Pl groups.  Additionally, there was no group x time interactions for any measured variables.  Therefore, the data for the two groups were pooled to evaluate the effects of the passive splint stretching intervention on measured variables.   Following 4 weeks of stretching, there was a significant improvement in AUCO (Pre: 11.7  5.6 %; Post: 20.4  12.2 %; p = 0.050) and TWD (Pre: 392.8  76.5 m; Post: 415.0  71.9 m; p = 0.030).  Furthermore, the occlusion slope (Pre: -0.10  0.03 %/sec; Post: -0.13  0.07 %/sec; p = 0.074), reperfusion slope (Pre: 0.59  0.31 %/sec; Post: 0.70  0.40; p = 0.063), and PFWD (Pre: 321.3  107.1 m; Post: 342.0  95.0 m; p = 0.083) approached significance. Conclusions: Four weeks of stretching improved microvascular function in PAD patients; however, creatine supplementation did not enhance these effects.  This study confirms that stretching is an effective therapy for improving vascular function and walking performance in patients with PAD.  Future studies should investigate mechanisms involved in this intervention and if combination therapies enhance outcomes.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Current U.S. energy policy, which includes wind and solar incentives, favors the increased use of renewables for power generation.  Renewable energy incentives and falling technology costs support robust growth in renewable energy resources as shares of coal and nuclear power decrease.  It is projected by the U.S. Energy Information Agency that renewable generation will supply 44% of U.S. electricity by 2050.  For wind energy, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) defines four IEC Wind Classes – Class I (High Wind), Class II (Medium Wind), Class III (Low Wind), and Class IV (Very Low Wind).  Most utility-scale wind farms are constructed at Class II or higher sites where average annual wind speeds at hub height are 8.5 m/s or greater.  To expand wind power to states like Florida, which is typically third in the nation in overall electricity consumption, it will be necessary to develop wind power at an increasing number of low and very low wind sites.  One way this development can take place is by implementing new technologies.  The Department of Energy (DOE), in Enabling Wind Power Nationwide, states that “near-future turbines” – defined as conceptual wind turbines with rotor diameters of 124 m, turbine nameplate capacities of 1.8 MW, and hub heights of 140 m – have the potential to bring wind energy to all 50 states.  This research examined ten years of hourly wind speed data collected at Florida airports to determine temporal and spatial characteristics of the wind resource.  It was found that for low and very low wind regions with large numbers of calm or sub-threshold wind speed measurements, Weibull probability distribution functions tend to overestimate wind energy production.  Three characteristic histogram shapes were identified to improve estimates.  This information was used to determine the wind energy potential for near-future turbines and to develop a conceptual structural support system. In low and very low wind regions, reduced shear turbulence and wind thrust help to reduce fatigue damage on the turbine rotors, components, and support systems.  For locations like Florida, located in coastal regions of the Atlantic Hurricane Basin with an average of 12 named storms each year, these advantages are partially offset, as design is typically governed by load cases that include tropical cyclone winds.  For turbines supported on shallow circular or octagonal foundations, common in the industry, it is essential to predict the settlement and tilt of an eccentrically loaded foundation with a soil gap to ensure stability.  Numerical modeling was performed for foundation diameter-to-thickness ratios of 5, 10, 15, and 20 to verify a new solution procedure that uses existing elastic settlement equations with the equivalent bearing area definition found in Design Guide for Wind Turbines.  Differences in modeled and calculated settlements had an MSE of less than 0.15 for all cases.  Conservative estimates of differential settlement were found using a 35% increase factor.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Polyethylenes with functional groups placed at precise locations along the backbone serve as model systems for studying the effect of co-units on crystallization behavior of polymers. Good thermal stability and high crystallinity afforded by long methylene sequences between functional groups make these polymers attractive for potential future application as sustainable alternatives to commercial polyethylenes. This Dissertation provides a comprehensive study of the influence of acetal, carbonate, and ester functional groups on self-assembly, crystalline structure, and crystallization kinetics of these polyethylene-like materials with methylene spacer lengths ranging between 6 and 48. At a fixed functional group content, crystallization and melting temperatures increase with increasing functional group interaction strength (ester &gt; carbonate &gt; acetal) and decrease with increasing functional group content within each series. Polyesters and polycarbonates have an isomorphic, polyethylene-like unit cell, enabled by dipole-dipole interactions between functional groups of adjacent chains that serve to compensate for the enthalpic penalty introduced by the presence of functional groups in the crystals. In contrast, the relatively weaker interactions and the drive for gauche bonding near acetal groups in polyacetals leads to multiple crystalline polymorphic forms depending on the crystallization temperature. 
Although the polymers investigated herein maintain many characteristics of polyethylene, unique crystallization behaviors as a result of the functional groups, and furthermore their precise placement, are also observed, for instance unexpected minima in crystallization rate with increasing isothermal crystallization temperature. This distinctive feature of the crystallization behavior observed in polyacetals is driven by polymorphism, while in polyesters and polycarbonates, minima are attributed to quantized differences in lamellar thickness. Analyses presented in this Dissertation are relevant for discerning fundamentals of self-assembly that impact structure-property relationships of sustainable and recyclable polyethylene mimics.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The continual study of shock wave boundary layer interactions (SBLIs) is driven by their presenceon the internal and external surfaces of transonic, supersonic, and hypersonic flight vehicles. SBLIs
manifest in a myriad of practical high-speed flight scenarios, such as supersonic engine inlets,
launch vehicle booster separation, transonic wings, and aircraft-store interactions during carriage
and release. These interactions incite numerous consequences to the operation of high-speed vehicles
and their components. They cause highly unsteady mechanical-thermal loads that threaten the
aerostructural integrity, cause flow separation that increases drag, and induce pitching moments
causing undesirable changes to the vehicle trajectory. Current strategies to address the SBLI related
issues have led to flight envelope reduction and over-design of the aircraft components. Study of SBLIs
have been the focus of numerous experimental and computational investigations using canonical
geometries that simplify the complex real-flow configurations. Analysis of two-dimensional (2-D)
canonical SBLIs has laid a strong foundation on which advanced three-dimensional (3-D) interaction
studies have continued to build. However, the same cannot be said for axisymmetric SBLIs,
which have received little attention compared to their 2-D and 3-D counterparts.
The present work investigates the flowfield of an inviscid-viscous interaction between a planar
oblique shock wave, generated by an off-body wedge, and the turbulent boundary layer on an ogive
nose-cone cylinder (axisymmetric) body. Investigating SBLIs on curved surfaces is pertinent to the
evolution of high-speed flight, because they simulate real-flight bodies and interactions that many
traditional 2-D and 3-D configurations do not. Literature has yet to bridge the gap between 2-D,
3-D and axisymmetric SBLIs, as the few axisymmetric SBLI studies that do exist only offer a glance
at the flow topology and mean flow behavior with limited analysis. A comprehensive understanding
of axisymmetric SBLIs requires that a few core questions be answered.
1) Are the SBLI flow features on axisymmetric bodies the same or different from the well-studied
2-D/3-D canonical flows?
2) Are the scaling (spatial/temporal) parameters identified for 2-D or 3-D SBLI flows valid for
curved surface interactions?
3) How do key flow parameters, such as interaction strength, Mach number, and Reynolds number
affect the axisymmetric SBLI flow physics?
The present research was conducted at the Florida State University Polysonic Wind Tunnel
located at the Florida Center for Advanced Aero-Propulsion. Advanced flow diagnostics were carried
out with an aim to characterize the principal off-body flow features and on-surface interactions
from an incident-reflection shock wave on an ogive-nose cylinder body. Measurements involved
mean flow topology from oil-based paint and high-speed shadowgraph, time-averaged surface pressures
using an electronic pressure scanner (ESP), and pressure sensitive paint (PSP), and unsteady
pressures using fast-response Kulite pressure sensors. Flow conditions were established at various
Mach number (M∞ = 2–4) and wedge deflection angle (δ = 10◦ – 25◦) combinations at a constant
Reynolds number (Re ≈ 9.09x105). Body forces were also measured at a few selected conditions
using an internal six-component strain gauge balance.
Shadowgraph images revealed a diverse mean flowfield with several shock-based interactions.
At lower Mach numbers the separation shock was observed having an unsteady component as
it oscillated along the ϕ = 0◦ meridian. Oil flow visualizations showed that the surface flow is
windward symmetric and highly three-dimensional, as the flow topology varies significantly based
on the streamwise and azimuthal positioning. The number of separation lines present on the surface
is a result of the SBLI strength. Primary separation lines wrap nonlinearly around the model surface
independently of flow conditions, and secondary separation lines are decoupled in interactions with
small wedge angles. A region of vortices (VR) exists between the primary and secondary separation
lines. Results of the mean pressure distributions complimented by surface flow streamlines indicate
that the region of vortical flow is open-type and develops on the curved surface, similar to the
separation region seen in single blunt-fin SBLI flows. The VR grows non-linearly in size with the
smallest in length along the windward meridian (the side facing the shock generator).
A length-scale suitable for defining shock induced interactions for axisymmetric bodies still
remains unknown, but similarities between the axisymmetric windward plane flow and 2-D SBLI
show potential adaptation. Mean surface pressures from ESP and PSP match very well, provide
quantitative pressure maps, and support the flow features observed using flow visualization. Flow
separation on the surface is driven by pressure gradients caused by both the impingement of the
oblique shock and the curvature of the body. Unlike 2-D and 3-D SBLI the separation region is
only detected in the windward plane, as the nature of its three-dimensionality remains unclear.
Unsteady pressure measurements reveal that the SBLI features broadband pressure fluctuations
beneath the separation shock foot and flow reattachment regions. Pressure fluctuations indicate
that the flow is most energized near the separation shock foot and the isotropic node, and loses
energy nonlinearly with distance from the interaction regions. As with 2-D SBLI, the windward
flow is largely influenced by low frequency energy content. Both the distribution and magnitude of
flow energy are significantly affected by proximity to the SBLI region location and length scales.
Spectral analysis shows that although the wedge angle and Mach number influence the energy
magnitude in a single flow region, the energy distribution remains unchanged. It also shows that
the overall energy levels decrease at higher Mach numbers, and increase with the wedge angle.
This dissertation offers a significant contribution to the understanding of the underlying flow
physics associated with incident-reflection SBLI on an axisymmetric body. It has answered a few
fundamental questions, provided new insights into the introductory flow dynamics, and established
key parametric relationships. Although the continuation of this work remains challenging, the
use of high-fidelity experimental techniques, along with validated numerical tools, will expand the
understanding of 3-D flow complexities, and move towards future designs of high-speed flight control
mechanisms.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Mobility and access are the two essential criteria for evaluating any mode of transportation. A private vehicle comes at the top when we think about mobility and access. But 
an increase in the utilization of private vehicles has many drawbacks, such as an increase in 
traffic congestion, air pollution, fuel consumption, etc., which also affect public health. It is 
essential to provide an efficient public transportation system to minimize these effects, especially 
in urban areas. Bus transportation is one of the significant modes of transport with a good 
capacity compared to private vehicles, but there is a need to compromise for access. Bus 
transportation is an essential mode of transportation for students, faculty, and staff, especially to 
travel to, around, and from school and work. It is always necessary that buses reach the stop on 
time and service all the passengers waiting at the stop, considering peak hour demands and 
potential uncertainties in transportation time. To achieve such an objective, it is essential to 
improve the serviceability of the bus transportation network. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study focuses on improving the operations of the Florida State University (FSU) campus bus service, Seminole Express, for the ―INNOVATION‖ bus route in Tallahassee, 
Florida (USA). The ―INNOVATION‖ bus route service connects the main FSU campus with the 
FAMU-FSU College of Engineering and is heavily used by the FSU students. A simulation 
model is built using the FlexSim simulation software to emulate the operations of the 
―INNOVATION‖ bus route service to determine the required number of buses to be deployed. 
An excessive number of buses may increase the operational costs and idling time. In the 
meantime, an insufficient number of buses will cause significant waiting times at the bus stop, 
which are not desirable as some students may be late for their classes. The developed simulation 
model will assist with effectively planning the bus route connecting the main FSU campus with 
the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering by providing solutions with adequate waiting time and 
operational costs</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Research has shown that during this time of development, adolescents may encounter obstacles in navigating sexuality, identity, academics, and friendships that can exacerbate risk-taking behavior (WHO, 2018; WHO, 2011). Adolescents tend to participate in higher levels of risky behaviors (i.e., unprotected sex, substance use, and violence) compared to individuals over the age of 21 (Duell et al., 2018; Reniers et al., 2016). School and parental connectedness are significant protective factors for health, school success, and overall well-being (Hay et al., 2016).  Adolescents who feel a greater connection to their home and school communities are less likely to face damaging health outcomes (i.e., sexually transmitted infections [STI], drug abuse, death) connected to substance use, sexual risk, violence, and mental health (CDC, 2019a).  Therefor aim of the current study was to examine whether school and parental connectedness in a preadolescent population delays onset of risk behaviors (e.g., initiation of sexual intercourse, initiation of drug, alcohol and tobacco use).  The research was conducted using previously collected data from 1115 African American pre-adolescents (age 9-12 at study entry) and their primary caregivers, who were followed longitudinally for three years as part of the Parents Matter! project.  The study was conducted using structural equational modeling (SEM) and path analysis to answer the research following questions: (1) Is there an association between school connectedness and risk-taking behavior (i.e., risky sexual behavior and alcohol and drug use) among African American youth?, (2) Is there an association between parental connectedness and risk-taking behavior (i.e., risky sexual behavior and alcohol and drug use) among African American youth?, (3)Does school connectedness moderate the relationship between parental connectedness and risk-taking behaviors for African American preadolescents?, (4) Does gender moderate the relationship between parental connectedness and risk-taking behaviors for African American preadolescents?, and (5) Does SES moderate the relationship between parental connectedness and risk-taking behaviors for African American preadolescents? Each research question was examined from two perspectives: the perspective of the parent and the perspective of the preadolescent. 
Results from analyses indicated a significant association between school connectedness and risk-taking behaviors for both the preadolescent and parent models, although the correlation was in opposite directions (i.e., negative correlation for preadolescents, positive correlations for parents) (Research Question 1). The results also revealed a significant correlation between parental connectedness and risk-taking behavior (Research Question 2). Gender moderated a significant correlation between parental connectedness and risk-taking behavior according to parent reports, however the preadolescent model only indicated a significant correlation for females as it pertains to parental connectedness and risk-taking behavior in African American preadolescents (Research Question 4). SES moderated a significant relationship between parental connectedness and child sexual behavior in all three SES categories in the parent model and in the low SES category in the preadolescent model. The preadolescent model also a revealed significant correlation between parental connectedness and substance use in the Low and Moderate SES categories (Research Question5). Results  for both parent and preadolescent models yielded no significant correlation when school connectedness moderated the relationship between parental connectedness and risk-taking behavior (Research Question 3).  
The results of this study offer significant additions to the field of psychology, particularly within the treatment and study of risk-taking behavior reduction in African American preadolescents.  Limitations regarding sampling, measures, and data analyses were taken into consideration when analyzing the results and implications of the study. Implications associated with theory, future research, and clinical practice were taken into consideration.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Prior research has noted the unique interpersonal, affective, lifestyle, and antisocial factors associated with psychopathic personality traits (Hare, 1990; Cooke &amp; Michie, 2001; Hare, 2003; Hare, 2010; Skeem &amp; Cooke, 2010).  In line with these findings, life-course research has noted the link between psychopathic personality characteristics and life-course offending outcomes (Moffitt, Caspi, Harrington, &amp; Milne, 2002; Farrington, 2006; Hare, 2009; Moffitt et al., 2011; Beaver et al., 2014).  Considerably less research, however, has examined potential psychosocial factors that may moderate the associations between psychopathic personality characteristics and life-course offending outcomes. This dissertation will address these gaps in the literature by examining associations between psychopathic personality characteristics and offending outcomes, while controlling for potential psychosocial moderating factors. The results reveal that psychopathic personality characteristics are associated with offending outcomes. Additionally, the findings indicate that the relationship between psychopathic personality characteristics and offending outcomes is moderated by several psychosocial factors. The implications of these findings are discussed in reference to theory, policy implications, and future research.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>	In an era of increasing weather extremes, it is important to understand how best to encourage pro-environmental behaviors related to climate change risk mitigation. Protection Motivation Theory offers insight into the factors most relevant to addressing environmental threats. Experiential learning provides insight into how immersive technology may impact learning outcomes. Other factors are known to influence learning and behavior in this context, including the technology adopted to create and consume learning materials about climate change.	To explore the impact of system immersion, the current study relied on two distinct treatment groups, one relying on a laptop with a flat screen to consume the instructional media and one relying on a virtual reality headset to consume the instructional media. Neither treatment group showed significant improvements in the learning outcomes under investigation: knowledge recall of climate change risk mitigation behaviors or perception of learning effectiveness. The study results indicate consuming the media through a flat screen is effective for improving a learner’s threat and coping appraisal, though not effective for improving the intention to adopt risk mitigation behaviors. The VR headset did not appear effective at improving either of these behavior outcomes.
	The study results suggest 360° microlearning content is most effective for encouraging behavior changes when viewed on a flat screen. Yet small effect sizes and low statistical power indicate the results are not reliable and further research is needed to define the relationships and impacts of the factors under review in this study. Open science protocols, including consistent definitions, measures, and analysis tools, can ensure future research is comparable to the current study and the body of knowledge for immersive learning technologies is built on a solid foundation.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>At the end of World War I, why did Germany’s surface ship sailors embrace and spread the cause of moderate revolution, rather than embrace either a radical, Bolshevik style of revolution or fight the revolution altogether? War weariness, in the absence either of a tightly knit and anti-revolutionary view forged by frequent military action experienced by frontline U-boat crews, or the particular code of honor of the naval leadership, prompted sailors to pursue this course. The wartime experience starting in 1914 proved crucial to shaping the responses of naval personnel to revolution from the start of the sailor uprising in October and November 1918 through the survival of the new republic against the communist Spartacus uprising of 1919 and counterrevolutionary Kapp Putsch of 1920. Generally speaking, the surface sailors, in contrast to U-boat crews or naval leaders in the officer corps or high command, sought a moderate space for soldiers, workers, and sailors to have a voice through councils that supported reformist, electoral politics in a post-Kaiser republic. The surface sailors navigated a middle ground between weak communist forces and counterrevolutionaries who saw moderate and communist revolutionaries as people cut from the same cloth who had to be stopped by any means necessary.  </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Over the past few decades, numerical weather prediction (NWP) models (and by extension human forecasts) have evolved markedly due to better meteorological understanding, improved observations, data assimilation, physics parameterization, and increased model resolution (Simmons and Hollingsworth 2001, Elsberry 2013, Landsea and Cangialosi 2018). This includes operational modeling of tropical cyclones (TCs), which were poorly resolved in the mid-1990’s but are currently well-resolved in mesoscale models and even some global models. Despite these improvements, there are still cases of large model forecast error and ensemble disagreement (e.g. Sandy 2012, Joaquin 2015, Matthew 2016, Florence 2018). It is important to know if these model improvements are coincident with less frequent poor TC model forecasts over time. In other words, are large model forecast error events becoming less frequent as models have improved? Identification of recurring synoptic environments in which these poor model forecasts occur is also important not only from a meteorological understanding point of view, but also to aid the forecasters to identify in advance of such forecast meteorological setups.Accordingly, the focus of this study is to evaluate how the National Centers for Environmental Prediction’s (NCEP’s) Global Forecast System (GFS) and Global Ensemble Forecast System ensemble mean (GEFSM) have improved with respect to TC track forecasting over the past two decades, and quantify whether the frequency of truly poor forecasts (e.g. 90th percentile track error) has changed over that period of time. Using the National Hurricane Center’s (NHC’s) archived model run (advisory files) and verified data (best track files) for the years 2005 through 2020, track errors for the GFS and GEFSM were calculated and statistically analyzed. From those statistics, all forecasts with track error at or above the 90th percentile were identified and the climatology of those forecasts over the years was developed. A comparison between the GFS and GEFSM was also conducted to further evaluate the evolution of TC forecast error over time given the improvements to the GEFS have not been coincident with the GFS. Lastly, spatiotemporal patterns of both track error and synoptic-scale setups common to those cases of poor model performance were identified and subjectively evaluated. 
This analysis found there was no statistically significant trend in the frequency of these poor GFS track forecasts between 2005 and 2020. However, there was a statistically significant trend in the frequency of poor GEFSM track forecasts. Across the 16 seasons, when the monthly distribution of the worst 10% of track forecasts was normalized by the monthly distribution of all forecasts made (i.e., removing the seasonal cycle), there was not a particular month during which significantly more poor GFS or GEFSM track forecasts occurred. 
A comparison between the average track error of the GFS and GEFSM showed that on average there was smaller GFS mean track error through 72-hour forecasts. Beyond 78 hours, the GEFSM on average outperformed (had smaller track error) than the GFS. Geographically, both models produced poor forecasts for storms in the same month and general basin location. When analyzing the cases in which one of the models, rather than both, produced inaccurate track forecasts, it was found that a considerably large number of poor forecasts were made in the area between 20°N and 24.9°N, 65°W and 69.9°W by either one of the models, a region of the Atlantic basin in which many TCs recurve as the mean flow changes and vertical shear increases.
Finally, the synoptic environments in which these poor forecasts occurred were evaluated. Patterns in the orientations of the forecast and observed tracks in the 90th percentile of track error were analyzed and grouped into four categories: vertical ladder, horizontal ladder, funnel, and timing error. In addition, synoptic-scale features potentially related to these large error patterns, such as the subtropical high and the presence of other TCs, were analyzed.   </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The written record of music (the score) has an extremely important role in the development of music in its various forms of action in society, with the editor being the professional responsible for preparing the musical text to be published, to be made available to society, they are the bridge between the composer and the reader.This treatise aims the development of a guide to the guitarist editor based on the practices and standards of the philology area. Philology is the area of science that deals with the study of text, from its origin to its impact on society, the preparation of texts is one of the branches of philology, our objective is to adapt philological editing methods to the music area, comparing and taking advantage of the methods already used by music editors.

            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of Florida’s Best and Brightest Teacher Scholarship on the retention rates of “High-Quality” Teachers. In 2015, the state provided $44 million for recruitment and retention bonuses of $10,000. In subsequent years, the program was reduced in size of award until ultimately canceled in 2020. The program used teachers’ SAT or ACT scores (specifically if their score was above the 80th percentile) to determine if a teacher would qualify for the award. If they were not a new teacher, they would submit a combination of SAT/ACT scores and their principal’s evaluation. I use logistic regression to estimate the influence the policy had on the rates of retention. I do not address the effects on recruitment due to sample size limitations. Further, I estimate if the program was more influential based on the subjects that teachers were certified to teach and defined by Florida as critical shortage areas subjects. Finally, I report on the differential rates of retention as the size of the award varied after the decrease in award amount. The findings are that the teacher scholarship was related to an increase in retention for critical shortage area subject teachers who received the award, as well as the entire sample of educators who received the award. No effects were found for early career teachers. The policy implications are addressed, and future research avenues are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Mindsets have been gaining popularity recently in the field of second language acquisition (SLA). There have been studies exploring language mindsets in relation to emotions such as anxiety and fear of failure (e.g., Lou &amp; Noels, 2017), anxiety, rejection sensitivity, contact avoidance, and willingness to interact (e.g., Lou &amp; Noels, 2020a), language anxiety, use of language, and reported language proficiency (e.g., Lou &amp; Noels, 2020b), anxiety and confidence (e.g., Ozdemir &amp; Papi, 2021), and L2 grit (e.g., Khajavy, et al., 2020; Teimouri, et al., 2022). Although these studies help scholars to understand the relationship between mindsets and emotions, there is a gap in the literature of SLA in terms of language mindsets intervention. There are only a few studies implementing an intervention to change students’ language mindsets in the field of psychology (e.g., Lou &amp; Noels, 2016, 2020a). In order to fill in the gap of the lack of intervention studies in the field of SLA, the current study implemented a language mindset intervention with international graduate students to change their fixed language mindsets to growth language mindsets. For this purpose, 108 participants were recruited for Phase 1 of the study. Out of 108 participants, 61 of them were eligible to take part in Phase 2. However, 60 participants’ data were analyzed because 1 participant wanted to skip the writing part, which was part of the intervention and the manipulation check. Out of 60 participants, 57 of them were willing to participate in Phase 3. The results revealed that fixed language mindset predicted L2 speaking anxiety, whereas growth language mindset was a predictor of L2 enjoyment. There was a significant change in language speaking performance for the growth language mindset condition in terms of lexical and syntactic errors and fillers. The use of errors and fillers decreased in the growth language mindset condition. On the other hand, there was an increase in lexical diversity in the fixed language mindset condition. Theoretical and educational implications will be discussed.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This qualitative study explores a pedagogical approach that centered participants' epistemic authority to select the ways of knowing and focus for their practices of science. Guided by Black feminist theory, the program facilitators and participants engaged multiple cultural practices to (re)define science practices and (re)center participants’ intersectional identities within the praxis of a liberatory and loving pedagogy. Participants explored and challenged their initial ideas of science as the group collectively considered diverse ways of knowing and spent time in reflection around practices of inquiry that are not typically recognized as science. Then, to support the science identity development of participants, facilitators engaged participants in designing and enacting science inquiries to provide opportunities for science performance, recognition, and competence. Participants concluded the program with reflections on the experience and the tools they gained, including their perspectives on themselves as science people. Through the methodology of portraiture, participants and researcher together explored and organized three stories that attend to details within lived experiences, including actions, emotions, and thoughts. The portraits are organized around the themes of science identity, race, and gender and attend to the relational elements that position participants as knowledge holders and science people. This critical study may benefit others by showing how epistemic injustice in science education can be healed within learning contexts that attend to power and justice. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In groundwater modeling, the term “post audit” refers to a method of verifying simulated (predicted) data produced by a groundwater model against analogous measured data. According to Anderson et. al., (2015), evaluation of model performance includes two components: a “hard knowledge” evaluation which compares direct field measurements with simulated values; and a “soft knowledge” evaluation of the conceptual flow model. This two-pronged approach applies relevant concepts from the literature, site conditions, hydrogeological principles, and professional experience to comprehensively evaluate the suitability of model assumptions, parameters, and performance with respect to the hydrogeologic system, purpose of investigation, and available resources. If a model fails to achieve an acceptable history-match with measured data or applies unreasonable calibration parameters, the model must be modified or discarded (Anderson et. al., 2015). Of course, a universal standard of what may be considered “suitable” or “reasonable” in groundwater modeling is not possible, as any interpretations made to this effect inherently depend upon the hydrogeologist’s experience with the problem at hand. Therefore, any such interpretations must be substantiated by quality data, and include the caveat that human error may give rise to inherent or random bias in these interpretations.  In the interest of supporting environmental management efforts, the subject thesis investigation is a post audit of the Davis subregional groundwater flow model, which evaluates the accuracy of model-predicted discharge at Wakulla Spring from 2010 through 2018. This investigation is structured with the intent to resolve causal mechanisms of anomalous discharge trends at Wakulla Springs over time. Parameters compared for this evaluation were selected based on the model purpose and model calibration approach. These parameters include simulated and measured spring discharge at Wakulla Spring’s main vent, plus simulated and measured hydraulic heads from 4 wells close to Wakulla Springs from 2010 through 2018. The quantitative accuracy of model-predicted discharge and hydraulic head is evaluated by applying standard statistical methods in groundwater modeling. The Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient and the Root Mean Square Error for model “residuals” (measured values minus simulated values) describe error associated with model-predicted spring discharge and hydraulic head values, respectively. Model error statistics are considered with respect to the model purpose, design, and observed system behavior. Results of the post audit evaluation culminate in two main conclusions which support model updates to optimize utility and overall accuracy of the subregional model, rendering a robust tool in support of conservation and water resource planning near Wakulla Springs. 
Based on evaluation of post audit results and hydrologic data, it is proposed that recharge rate simulated simulated during stress periods 50 and 54 (corresponding to years 2010 and 2014) in the numerical model should be updated to reflect all sources of recharge in the groundwater contribution area. This update is suggested in accordance with observed changes in permitted wastewater discharges in the immediate recharge area for Wakulla Springs between 2010 and 2014. Additionally, the conceptual model of groundwater flow may benefit from an update that accounts for two mechanisms that are unique to hydrologic conditions of the study area. These mechanisms include anthropogenic drivers of system recharge, and conduit flows associated with karst lake dry down events during times of seasonal drought. 
These conclusions are significant because they optimize the potential for future application of this model to relevant management issues; offer a mechanistic understanding of anomalous flow trends observed in recent years at Wakulla Springs; and demonstrate the sensitivity of first magnitude karst springs to anthropogenic inputs.  </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The COVID-19 pandemic was a unique phenomenon that significantly impacted higher education. Programmatic grants were an important source of funding at community colleges during this unusual time, helping to provide vital resources and support services to institutions and their students. This study is one of the first of its kind to explore the utilization and impact of programmatic grants at Florida College System institutions during the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic between March 2020-August 2021. The data sources for this study are the directors of the grants offices of the colleges that make up the Florida College System. Using a survey method design, I investigated how Florida College System institutions utilized programmatic grant funding during the pandemic, the impact of this grant funding, and the potential sustainability of these grant programs. I found that Florida College System institutions are most likely to have used grant funds during the pandemic on Scholarships and Technology/Distance Learning Support. Most Florida College System institutions indicated they received a larger amount of programmatic grant funding during the COVID-19 pandemic as compared to before the pandemic. I also found that the most common impact of programmatic grants during the pandemic was the expansion of student support services. Federal and state governments were the most common sources of programmatic grant funding at Florida College System institutions during the 2020-2021 pandemic. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Laura Greenfield and Karen Rowen argue that in order to realize the change potential within tutor education, writing center directors must look critically at how we have been designing and executing our tutor education courses. This dissertation addresses the call to examine the additional factors on which tutor education can be structured or restructured and what ideologies about language, and specifically second-language use, inhibit writing center administrators ability to decouple tutor-training from the unidirectional monolinguistic ideals that have historically been at the center of writing instruction. As one site of both language instruction and writing support, writing centers are an optimal space to analyze the assumptions that administrators and tutors bring to working with multilingual students. The writing center tutor education course is often where tutors learn the tacit theories that tell them what is “right” or “normal” in the writing center. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>I followed Johanek’s (2000) lead in adopting an epistemologically mixed approach to this study. By “epistemologically mixed,” I mean it accounts for multiple ways of knowing. This study uses CDA as its methodological grounding because it takes into account the social act of knowing and enables a researcher to analyze linguistic and semiotic details in light of larger social and political or, in the case of my study, institutional contexts. Huckin et al. (2012) describes critical discourse analysis “as an interdisciplinary approach to textual study that aims to explicate abuses of power promoted by those texts, by analyzing linguistic/semiotic details in light of the larger social and political contexts in which those texts circulate” (p. 107). Because I examined the attitudes and expectations about second language writing through the use of interviews, it was essential that this research was grounded in a methodology that accounts for both the context and theory.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study has three key findings: (a) writing Center Administrators who had experience in either linguistics or TESOL took a more second language studies approach while those that had little or no formal preparation in TESOL or linguistics took a more translingual approach to working on language diversity; (b) when writing center administrators lacked expertise in expertise in the very areas that their L2/ESL/residential multilingual students need they have a tendency to hook onto the agendas that they can understand; and (c) one of the central reasons that writing center administrators are hesitant to train tutors to offer linguistic feedback is because they are afraid of being labeled as racist, or not anti-racist enough. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Ramos Mariachi Violin Method treatise is an overview of Books 1 and 2 of an original violin teaching method. These method books teach violin and Spanish language vocal technique through carefully paced mariachi and Spanish language children’s songs. Each song serves a pedagogical function and teaches incrementally paced violin skills such as bow strokes, left hand finger dexterity, sound quality, bow articulation, rhythm, and intonation. In addition to teaching violin pedagogy, the Ramos Mariachi Violin Method prepares the student to sing and perform violin on each song. Upon completing this method’s series of books, the violin student will have developed a solid foundation of violin skills that fosters the musicianship and technical proficiency that is essential to violin playing. In addition, these same students will learn to sing Spanish language mariachi songs, preparing them with the ensemble and vocal skills necessary to sing and play mariachi music with a full band. In this way, students can learn to play the violin, while simultaneously celebrating mariachi music and Mexican culture.     </DISS_para>

The primary topics that were discussed in this study were (a) cultural awareness, (b) stigmas of therapy within the African American community, and (c) historical realities vs. popular myths. The content analysis used 6 research questions with 10 African American music therapists in the Southeastern, Mid-Atlantic, and Southwestern regions. There were multiple variables found among the respondents related to the themes of these interviews. These issues are discussed and illustrated with examples drawn from the interview transcripts.  </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Compared to Islamic terrorism, right-wing domestic terrorism is relatively understudied, even though right-wing domestic terrorism claims more lives in the United States and the frequency of these incidents is increasing (Jones, 2018; Jones, Doxsee, &amp; Harrington, 2020). This study addressed the gap in knowledge of understanding how media outlets frame right-wing domestic terrorism in the initial days of coverage. Understanding how the media frames the issue of right-wing domestic terrorism is vital, as framing can influence how an audience comprehends an issue and what the possible solutions might be. To understand this media framing, this study employed a longitudinal qualitative and quantitative content analysis of right-wing domestic terrorism media framing in local and national newspapers. The use of these two methods allots both a micro and macro analysis and in turn a more well-rounded understanding of right-wing domestic terrorism media framing. The quantitative content analysis examined national and local newspaper coverage of right-wing domestic terrorism incidents and found several differences in framing between these outlets. The qualitative content analysis examined seven right-wing domestic terrorism incidents in national newspaper coverage and found twenty unique major frames. The frequency of use of these frames changed between incidents and a longitudinal trend of increasing frame usage was found. Differences in frame usage suggests that frames are competing for visibility and there is not one narrative utilized in a right-wing domestic terrorism context. This study represents the first large scale, multi-incident, analysis of right-wing domestic terrorism media framing and is a vital first step in understanding the media terrorism relationship within this context.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>	Information that changes is often recalled worse than information that does not change, such that memory interference is observed (Anderson &amp; Neely, 1996). However, studies using the A-B, A-D paradigm have revealed that when reminding occurs during the encoding of changed information and is recollected at test, it can result in memory facilitation, such that changed information is recalled better than control information that is only presented once (Wahlheim &amp; Jacoby, 2013). One possibility is that reminding allows for memory integration, which in turn produces the facilitation observed in prior work. Memory integration allows us to make sense of new information in our daily lives, and has significant implications for the field of education (Bauer, Esposito, &amp; Daly, 2020). Although reminding appears necessary for memory integration to occur, reminding alone does not appear sufficient. The aim of the present studies was to better understand the factors and mechanisms underpinning the relationship between reminding and integration. Although animacy status has appeared to be an important factor for integration in previous studies (Schreiner, Meiser, &amp; Bröder, 2022), Experiment 1 found that animate and inanimate cue words did not differ in reminding during encoding, reminding recollection at test, nor in evidence of integration. Experiment 2 suggested that measuring reminding through mental imagery reports better captured integration relative to asking a direct question about reminding, and provided a new method of investigating the relationship between reminding and integration. Experiments 3 and 4 found that reminding occurred in an open-loop paradigm, but critically, found that an increased rate of reminding in that paradigm did not predict increased evidence for memory integration, and provided mixed evidence for a correlation between event structure awareness and memory integration. Taken together, the results of these experiments deepen the current understanding of the human memory system by providing support for the notion that reminding is necessary but not sufficient for memory integration, and providing new methods for investigating reminding and integration that can be used in new paradigms.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study explores the project-based learning (PjbL) of middle school teachers by examining their instructional context and the project design and management strategies they used to implement PjbL. The significance of this study is to provide middle school teachers with greater perception, insight, and strategies about how the quality of their PjbL practice can be calibrated and improved. A purposeful sample of five middle school teachers across English Language Arts (ELA), mathematics, and career and technical education (CTE) courses participated.  The research questions guiding this study were:
Research Question 1. What are the contextual factors under which middle school teachers implement PjbL? 
Research Question 2. What design and management strategies do middle school teachers use to implement PjbL? 
The project design elements and teaching practices listed in the Gold Standard Project-based Learning model were used to describe each case. Evidence shows that all the elements and teaching practices listed in the Gold Standard Project-based Learning model appeared to some degree in each case. Three context-specific themes: curriculum, pedagogy, and structural, were also identified. 
Findings from this study contribute to the ongoing discussion of effective PjbL practice, illustrate the complexities of designing and managing PjbL, and can used to inform future research of PjbL.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Elementary school children with academic challenges are often provided special education services. These services are meant to support children in their academic goals, through either academic intervention (e.g., reading or math) or physical aids (e.g., extra test time, larger fonts). Being classified as eligible for receiving special education services has been shown to be associated with a child’s mental health. One potential outcome is higher levels of anxiety. Children worry about their academic disparity and about how they may be ostracized from their peers, given their label of requiring special education. All these factors could increase their risk for developing higher levels of anxiety. To explore associations of special education participation and anxiety in children, I used archival elementary grades follow up data from a larger intervention study conducted with children during preschool; the follow up outcome of interest is child anxiety symptoms as rated through parent report. The data were analyzed through three ANCOVAs to explore the relationship between special education classifications and anxiety levels. I found non-significant results between children receiving special education classifications of any kind on parent-reported anxiety levels. When I compared individual classifications clusters to no special education classifications, I found significant results between children who were classified as having a combination of physical and cognitive special education classifications on parent-reported anxiety levels. Lastly, I found non-significant results for the relation between the age children began receiving special education classifications and anxiety levels. All of this concludes in a complex picture of special education classifications on parent-reported anxiety levels. Further research is required to discover if special education classifications work as a protective factor or a risk factor for child anxiety levels. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Cells sense the mechanical properties of their environment through physical engagement and spreading, with high stiffness driving nuclear translocation of the mechanosensitive transcription factor YAP. Restriction of cell spread area or environmental stiffness both inhibit YAP activation and nuclear translocation.  The Arp2/3 complex plays a critical role in cell spreading, protrusion, and migration. While YAP activation has been closely linked to cellular spreading, the specific role of the Arp2/3 complex in force buildup and YAP activation is unclear. To assess the role of Arp2/3 in this process, we measured cell spreading, YAP nuclear translocation, force on the adhesion adaptor protein Talin (FRET tension sensor), and extracellular forces (traction force microscopy, TFM) in 3T3 cells with and without inhibition of Arp2/3. The results indicate that YAP activation still occurs with reduced cell spreading. Interestingly, while actin de-branching resulted in decreased force on talin on stiff glass surfaces, relatively little change in average traction stress was observed on the softer TFM substrates. While cell spreading is a driver of YAP nuclear translocation, this is likely through indirect effects.  Changes in cell spreading induced by Arp2/3 inhibition do not significantly perturb YAP activation.  Additionally, this work provides evidence that focal adhesion and cytoskeletal forces are less direct regulators of YAP activation than previously thought.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Academic innovation centers (AICs) are a new phenomenon that are being invested in by higher education institutions. As they are a new type of information center, Library and Information Science (LIS) researchers can revisit past LIS approaches in this new setting. Surveys of these centers have been investigated for their service offerings creating a nascent method of characterization. This LIS research explores this new research setting through the lens of the undergraduate student worker using narrative analysis methods. The library undergraduate worker has a limited depth of study within LIS research. This exploratory research repositions student workers’ agency to an elevated level for the understanding and development of academic innovation centers. These findings represent often silent voices of information center partnerships that bring added value to the higher education experience. This research highlights the developing perspective of undergraduate pre-professional leadership activities along with the theoretical basis of Constructionism Leadership.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Liquid helium-4 undergoes a phase transition below about 2.17 K where it is called the superfluid (He II). He II is a non-classical fluid which is one of the very few macroscopic manifestation of the quantum mechanics. He II entails several bizarre properties including an extremely low kinematic viscosity. Due to this, He II has been proposed as an exceptional working fluid for turbulence research. The primary goal of the current thesis is to design a pioneering experiments to investigate the possibility and potential non-classical behavior of a law of the wall scaling in turbulent He II pipe flow. Here we report assembling a 5-m long He II flow facility so-called Liquid Helium Flow Visualization Facility which can generate He II turbulent flows with Reynolds numbers ($Re$) larger than a million. Inside an optically-accessible square flow pipe of $2 \times 2$ cm$^2$ cross-section, we generate fully-turbulent He II forced flows using an automated bellows-linear actuator pump. We also report the incorporation of a quantitative flow visualization technique called molecular tagging velocimetry (MTV) using metastable triplet helium molecules as tracers. This visualization technique is based on a combination of a femtosecond laser-field ionization together with a 905-nm laser-induced fluorescence scheme to generate and illuminate the metastable helium molecules, respectively. We have designed and implemented a novel optical system to guide and satisfy the optical criteria for visualization of He II. Using this one-of-a-kind facility, we report the first quantitative flow visualization study of the law of the wall in He II turbulent pipe flow. We acquire the mean velocity profile near the wall region using a robust image processing algorithm, specifically developed for the type of images we acquire in our flow pipe and we compare it with the existing data in classical fluid research. Our data shows the existence of a logarithmic profile of ``the near-wall mean velocity profile in turbulent pipe flow (NVP) in He II". By fitting the velocity profile using the law of the wall formula, we determined the two fitting coefficients including the von K\'arm\'an coefficient $\kappa$ and the additive constant $B$ in He II. We also conducted a comprehensive uncertainty analysis of data to evaluate the associated error. It turns out $\kappa=0.160\pm 0.015$ and $\kappa=0.154\pm 0.010$, and $B=-23.2\pm 0.4$ and $B=-24.0\pm 0.4$ for $Re_D=1.01\times 10^6$ and $Re_D=1.21\times 10^6$, respectively. On the other hand, the values of these two constants in classical turbulent pipe flow are determined about $\kappa=(0.37-0.42)$ and $B=(4-6)$. This significant difference suggests that the non-classical properties of He II affects the velocity profile in extremely high $Re$ He II pipe flow. This deviation from classical turbulence is of great significance for future numerical research as well as engineering designs of the He II pipe systems.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Prospective memory, the ability to remember and carry out an intention in the future, is crucial for maintaining health, independence, and social connections. Wearable technologies, such as smartwatches, have the potential to serve as effective prospective memory aids, but little is known about how older adults, particularly those with cognitive impairment, might interact with such devices. This study aimed to 1) understand the types of challenges older adults with a diverse range of cognitive abilities experience when using a smartwatch, and 2) gain an initial understanding of the potential for smartwatches to serve as a prospective memory aid for this population. Participants included 27 older adults (age 60+) with normal cognitive functioning and those with cognitive impairment due to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), traumatic brain injury (TBI), or post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI). Participants were asked to wear a smartwatch and use its reminder notifications to remember to complete a daily automated telephone survey for 10 days. Half of the participants were first asked to use their usual memory strategies without the smartwatch to remember to complete the same daily survey for 10 days. Participants completed an initial interview consisting of demographic, neuropsychological, and technology acceptance measures, and a final interview consisting of usability measures. Participants gave relatively low usability ratings for the smartwatches overall and reported a variety of challenges. The smartwatches did not appear to significantly help or hurt participants’ abilities to remember to complete the daily survey. Participants’ perceptions of their memory were significantly associated with their perceived usefulness of the smartwatches, suggesting that perceived memory challenges may play an important role in the adoption of smartwatches. Results suggest that the smartwatches used in the present study may not be the best fit for providing prospective memory support and can inform the development of future efficacy tests and interventions involving smartwatches.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Sexual and gender minorities (i.e., gay men, lesbians, bisexuals, trans people) (SGMs) have experienced both social and legal progressive change over the last 50 years. However, this group still reports worse health outcomes and healthcare experiences, compared to heterosexuals (Fingerhut and Abdou 2017; Fredriksen-Goldsen et al. 2013). An innovative survey instrument that applies stereotype threat to the healthcare setting (e.g., healthcare stereotype threat, HCST) offers a new avenue to detail these disparities and uncover potential means of mitigation. Stereotype threat is the fear of confirming negative stereotypes about one’s social group (Steele and Aronson 1996). HCST expands the construct to also include the fear of being negatively judged, evaluated, or diagnosed because of one’s SGM status (Abdou and Fingerhut 2014). Work on HCST shows it has significant effects for sexual minorities’ well-being (Fingerhut et al. 2021) and variations exist across age (Abdou et al. 2016). However, previous work is limited in several aspects. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>First, it is unknown how and if HCST retains its significant adverse effect on well-being while considering more established health factors such as everyday discrimination and experiencing stigma. Second, the extant literature currently treats SGMs as a monolith by ignoring how HCST effects can differ across SGM groups and across birth cohorts. Third, there is currently no literature that details how HCST is associated with the well-being of trans people. Guided by previous literature, this dissertation investigates three main research questions to address these gaps: (1) How does the inclusion of discrimination and stigma influence HCST’s association on well-being?; (2) How does the effect of HCST on well-being vary across SGM groups?; (3) What moderating effects does birth cohort have on the association between HCST and well-being. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To explore these questions, I used two national probability datasets that I harmonized: Generations and Transpop. Both of these dataset are the first of their kind to have national probability samples focusing on SGM status. These data are also the first of their kind that capture representative groups of SGMs across three birth cohorts: young (18 to 27 years old), middle-aged (32 to 43 years old), and older (50-60 years old).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Results from Study #1 showed evidence that HCST is a unique health factor and that its effects significantly vary across SGM groups. Examining how HCST’s association performed with the inclusion of everyday discrimination and stigma shows that HCST retains a significant association on self-rated health and psychological distress, which supports that HCST is a unique, viable, and useful tool to understand health disparities SGMs experience. Second, Study #1 shows how trans people tended to report significantly worse outcomes when HCST was high compared to gay men reporting the same level. This result shows the importance of including trans people in future analyses and examining inter-group differences.  Results from Study #2 highlighted variations of HCST effects on well-being across birth cohorts and further highlighted a heightened plight trans people face. Standardized effects of HCST on self-rated health show worse effects for older lesbians and older bisexuals while the effect is similar for young and older gay men. Middle-aged trans people’s self-rated health suffered significantly more so than young trans people’s. HCST emerged to hold a more severe effect on the psychological distress of the older cohort as their distress were significantly higher than their younger counterparts, regardless of SGM group. This latter trend also emerged for trans people compared to gay men in the young and middle-age cohorts for self-rated health and for the young and older cohorts for psychological distress. In these cases, trans people reported worse outcomes than gay men when both groups were reporting the same level of HCST.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation contributes to scholarship in many ways such as using two nationally-probability samples of SGMs in the US, exploring differences within the SGM groups, and including transgender people. And, known to this author, the first cohort differences tests of HCST on well-being for SGMs. The dissertation breaks new ground also in testing how HCST as a measure performs compared to more established health factors, which highlights a new avenue in studying health disparities. Finally, these results have several implications for informing future work on health disparities, beyond SGMs, and with informing interventions and policy change to mitigate this process. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>	Sojourners, people who live outside their home countries, experience inevitable hardships when they separate from their home countries and live in new cultures. These hardships are collectively known as acculturative stress (Spradley &amp; Phillips, 1972). To deal with acculturative stress, some sojourners seek information and social support from other sojourners in online sojourner communities (Oh &amp; Butler, 2019; Ong &amp; Ward, 2005). Sojourners have different knowledge needs throughout their sojourns, but it is unclear much they learn from participating in online sojourner communities and how useful this information is (Yoon &amp; Chung, 2017). This study explores the information that sojourners need to adapt to life in their host countries during each stage of their sojourners and how effectively information they learn through participating in online sojourner communities.	Though some researchers have focused on how sojourners benefit from online sojourner community participation, other researchers have had concerns. Researchers have found that long-term, extensive contact with other sojourners from the same country, termed co-nationals, is associated with poor cultural adaptation to the host country (Kim, 2001; Lim &amp; Pham, 2016). In a meta-analysis of 76 studies about international students, Bender et al. (2019) found that “only support from mixed sources (i.e., not distinguishing between internationals, host, or co-nationals) is associated with a stronger effect of social support than support from co-nationals or fellow international students (compared with support from host sources)" (p. 827). Lim &amp; Pham (2016) argued that sojourners could become so invested in online sojourner communities and their families in their home country that they have no free time to explore the host country and its culture. However, another study suggested that long-term contact with co-nationals could benefit sojourners' cultural adaptation (Cao &amp; Zhang, 2012). This study explored the relationship between online sojourner community usage and cross-cultural adaptation. Additionally, it explored the benefits and drawbacks of participating in online sojourner communities.
	A convergent mixed methods research design using surveys and interviews guided this study. The surveys had qualitative questions, two quantitative psychological scales to assess cross-cultural adaptation, and one quantitative scale to assess Facebook usage. In keeping with Creswell &amp; Creswell (2018)’s research methods, the qualitative interviews provided depth and explanations for quantitative findings from the survey. 160 sojourners currently living in South Korea completed the survey. Eight participants participated in the qualitative interviews through Zoom to investigate what sojourners gain from participating in an online sojourner community. 
	This study found 25 common topics that sojourners must learn to adapt successfully to life in their host countries. As Yoon &amp; Chung (2017) found, these needs varied by their sojourning phases. During the settling stage, Korean language learning/translation and banking/finance/insurance are followed closely by Korean rules/regulations/law, healthcare, and employment/work-related issues. During the established stage, overall reported needs increased by 19%. Most needs remained steady or had modest increases between phases, with few exceptions. Needs like automotive service/repair, childcare, and housing, had large increases between phases. Only one need had a sizable decrease between phases; Korean language learning/translation declined by 10% between phases.
Participants reported the topics they learned about through participating in online sojourner communities. The most common topics they learned during their established phases were visa-related issues, Korean rules/regulations/law, employment/work-related issues, and groceries/dining. Participants also ranked the usefulness of the topics they learned about. The most valuable things they learned were employment/work-related issues, visa-related issues, childcare, groceries/dining, and Korean rules/regulations/law. Though childcare was a less common need, those with children found the information especially useful. Despite the information that sojourners exchange, there was no significant relationship between either of Demes &amp; Geeraert (2014)’s cross-cultural adaptation scales and Facebook Sojourner Community Intensity Scale, an adaptation of Ellison et al. (2007)’s Facebook Intensity Scale.
This study uncovered additional positives about participating in online sojourner communities. The communities provide socio-emotional support through fostering friendship, commiseration, and familial relationship support. Sojourners often organize and help foster offline events and can help sojourners establish connections to the host country. Sojourners generally regard the information in online sojourner communities as more timely, accurate, and accessible than official online sources. The communities also helped working sojourners with professional development and special lifestyle needs. 
	However, there are also considerable drawbacks to participating in online sojourner communities. Negativity is a constant problem in many communities, discouraging some sojourners from participating. Inactive communities were more prone to inaccurate and outdated information. Tempers can flare, and arguments can occur in some communities. Repetitive low-effort questions can be a source of annoyance for long-established sojourners.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The primary objective of this dissertation is to examine how attitudes towards immigration are affected by individuals beliefs about three actors: receiving-country governments, foreign aid donors, and immigration service contractors. I examine the impact political trust has on the willingness of individuals threatened by immigration to decide for greater restrictions on immigration, ﬁnding for an eﬀect that is conditional on which type of governmental actor is made salient to respondents. I also examine how the increasing presence of private contractors in the provision of immigration services in the U.S. impacts attitudes of the immigration regime’s legitimacy abroad. I ﬁnd that legitimacy is impacted by privatization but might depend on which type of functions are delegated to private actors. Finally, I look at the eﬀect of foreign aid on attitudes towards immigrants from donor countries and political support for increased immigration from donor countries. Using both observational and novel survey data, this collection of studies aims to provide the public opinion literature on immigration with a better understanding of how attitudes towards three major actors in immigration can inﬂuence subsequent policy and social attitudes.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Due to the large variance in the stochastic nature of evolution and DNA, it can be difficult to be sure that inferences that use genetical data are perfectly correct. However, as we incorporate more data into our analysis then the confidence of our inferences increases. I investigate the inclusion of 3 types of data that are typically ignored. The use of deletions and insertions in the maximum likelihood calculations of trees is investigated as well as using the quality scores in those same calculations. I show that including this data increases the probability of the true evolutionary tree being the same tree that a maximum likelihood method will infer. I also investigate the effects a geographically continuous population has on the genetical patterns and rates of fixation and timing of fixation, and how those rates compare to panmictic models, which ignore spatial structure. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Typically, Maximum likelihood techniques treat gaps in genetic data as unknown values. There have been a few attempts to build maximum likelihood techniques that include insertion and deletion processes, but these are usually very computationally expensive and infeasible in most cases. A Poisson Indel Process (PIP) has been developed, which reduces the theoretical computation of the likelihood calculations. I show how this method's computational cost can be decreased even further. I also show that it provides slightly more accurate inferences. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>All data gathering techniques introduce some sort of error. DNA sequencers quantify the confidence the program has in each nucleotide with a quality score. These quality scores represent the probability that the sequencer misclassified the nucleotide in question. Most Maximum likelihood techniques ignore these quality scores. At times when the scores are really low that data will be thrown out. I show how to incorporate these quality scores into a maximum likelihood calculation. This requires an adjustment to the traditional conversion of nucleotide data into numerical data into a more realistic biological and mathematical conversion. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Modelling the spatial structure populations are often constrained to has proved to be difficult. There are infinite types of structure that can be imposed by a landscape, each structure having a different effect on the dynamics of the population. I investigate how a continuous landscape with individuals how can disperse only a finite distance affects how quickly new alleles spread through the population. The spread of neutral alleles is shown to be independent of population density. The expected probability and time to fixation are examined and shown to be affect by both the size and shape of the geographical area and the population density.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The rate of spread for advantageous alleles is dependent on the population density, with diminishing returns as population density increases. The probability of fixation is only slightly dependent upon population density, it is mostly dependent upon selective advantage, but the expected time to fixation is heavily dependent on population density and geographical area.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Accurate chromosome segregation is vital to maintain genomic integrity. Chromosome missegregation, or aneuploidy, contributes to cancer development and conditions like down syndrome (Trisomy 21). Chromosomes are attached to microtubules during mitosis through centromere-localized kinetochores, and accurate chromosome segregation requires establishment of chromosome bipolar attachment. As a result of bipolar attachment, tension is generated across sister kinetochores. Failure in this process  activates the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) to prevent anaphase entry and allow for correction of attachments errors. In contrast, tension generation is believed to silence the SAC for anaphase onset. One key regulator of the SAC is the conserved chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), composed of Ipl1 kinase, Sli15, Bir1, and Nbl1 in budding yeast. The CPC localizes to the kinetochore/centromere before anaphase entry. Kinetochore protein Ndc80 is one Ipl1 substrate, and its phosphorylation destabilizes kinetochore-microtubule interaction to promote error correction. After anaphase onset, the CPC is removed from the kinetochore/centromere and relocates to the spindle, where it assists in spindle stability. Meanwhile, Ipl1-dependent Ndc80 phosphorylation is reversed, but the phosphatase responsible for this reversal is unknown. In budding yeast, the phosphatase Cdc14 becomes active after anaphase onset and dephosphorylates Fin1, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). Fin1 dephosphorylation allows kinetochore recruitment of Fin1-PP1. In this work, we show that kinetochore recruitment of Fin1-PP1 triggers the removal of the SAC proteins Bub1/Bub3. Furthermore, Fin1-PP1 partially dephosphorylates Ndc80, which promotes kinetochore dissociation of Bub1/Bub3. In addition, phospho-deficient ndc80 mutants causes viability loss in response to syntelic chromosome attachment, wherein sister kinetochores are attached by microtubules from the same spindle pole, indicating the importance of timely Fin1-PP1 kinetochore localization in checkpoint regulation.
Multiple mechanisms  regulate CPC kinetochore/centromere localization. A main driver for localization is Sli15 phosphorylation by both cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) and Ipl1 kinases. After anaphase onset, Sli15 is dephosphorylated, which triggers CPC translocation to anaphase spindle. Active Cdc14 reverses CDK-imposed Sli15 phosphorylation, but it is currently unclear which phosphatase reverses Ipl1-imposed Sli15 phosphorylation. Here we show that Fin1-PP1 partially reverses Sli15 phosphorylation. Interestingly, premature Fin1 kinetochore localization is sufficient to promote both CPC dissociation from the kinetochore/centromere in metaphase and CPC spindle association in anaphase. In addition, premature Fin1-kinetochore localization or phospho-deficient sli15 mutants result in SAC defects in response to tensionless attachments. These results indicate that Fin1-PP1 reverses Sli15 phosphorylation imposed by Ipl1 to promote CPC translocation in anaphase.
The tension checkpoint is a subset of the SAC that prevents anaphase onset in response to tensionless attachments. In response to tension defects, Ipl1 kinase phosphorylates the kinetochore protein Dam1 to prevent anaphae onset. Budding yeast Cin8 is a kinesin-5 motor protein, and its synthetic lethality with SAC mutants indicates the role of Cin8 in accurate chromosome attachment. To study the function of Cin8 in chromosome attachment, we constructed an auxin-inducible degron (AID) mutant, cin8-AID. With this conditional mutant, we show that cells lacking Cin8 arrest in metaphase due to unseparated spindle pole bodies. This metaphase arrest depends on the SAC as well as Dam1 phosphorylation by Ipl1 kinase. In cells expressing phospho-deficient dam1-3A, the metaphase arrest induced by Cin8 depletion is abolished, causing chromosome missegregation. These results support the conclusion that the cell cycle delay in cin8 mutants is a result of tensionless chromsome attachments.
Because of the critical role of CPC in chromosome bipolar attachment, its kinetochore/centromere localization must be tightly regulated during cell cycle. SUMOylation is a post-translational modification, wherein SUMO (Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier) proteins are covalently attached to other proteins. SUMOylation has been shown to promote protein subcellular localization through the interacteion between SUMO and SUMO-interacting motifs (SIMs). This interaction  facilitates formation of molecular condensates through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). On the other hand, formation of SUMO chains (polySUMOylation) can induce condensate disassembly by triggering a series downstream events, including ubiquitination by SUMO-dependent Ubiquitin ligases (STUbLs) and extraction by Cdc48 segregase. In mammalian cells, the CPC was shown to be enriched at kinetochores through LLPS. A recent work indicates that CPC components Bir1 is SUMOylated. One attractive idea is that CPC SUMOylation promotes it kinetochores localization, while polySUMOylation triggers CPC kinetochore delocalization for its translocation. In this work, we show that Bir1 phosphorylation is cell cycle regulated, and the absence of STUbL delays Bir1 dephosphorylation. Moreover, depletion of SUMO protease, Ulp2, increases Bir1 SUMOylation Interestingly, inducing polySUMOylation prevents proper CPC kinetochore localization in metaphase. These preliminary results support the idea that Bir1 SUMOylation may regulate Bir1 phosphorylation and CPC localization.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of isolated and confined spacecraft environments on astronauts' psychological well-being with the aim to develop innovative strategies to mitigate senses of stress and anxiety in spacecrafts. Specifically, the author identified the features of spacecraft interior environments that negatively or positively affected astronauts’ perceptions of the environment and stress levels, including the size of spacecraft, orientation and layout, color, and presence of portholes. Space travel has been a longtime aspiration of humans. In historical terms, we only recently started exploring outer frontiers of Earth and planning for a distinct possibility to travel to neighboring Mars. During long-term space travel, astronauts may experience high levels of stress and anxiety, which may affect their well-being, create tension between crew members, and complicate the completion of tasks, ultimately leading to mission failure. The most critical issues related to astronauts' psychological well-being are physical isolation, stresses working and living in a hostile environment where a simple mistake can result in severe injuries or death, necessity to share workspaces and living quarters with other crew members resulting in limited privacy and personal space, and fatigue due to packed schedules. Two theoretical frameworks discussed in Chapter 2 of this thesis identify the specific aspects of the physical environment and psychological climate aboard spacecraft needed to maintain astronauts’ well-being: the Self-Determination Theory (Goemaere et al., 2019; Ryan et al., 2014) and the framework for relating crew member performance measures to spacecraft design and operations (Fanchiang et al., 2020), referred to as the Crew Member Performance Framework in this research.The interior design of spacecraft environments is essential to support not only the lives of astronauts but to help them with successful performance of work-related tasks, activities, and communication, enable physical mobility, and provide a supportive environment for crew socialization, recreation, and rest. The data for this qualitative ethnographic study was gathered from three different sources: publicly accessible astronauts journals and books, spacecraft schematics, and photo and video materials. The research focused on the analysis of the interior environment of the International Space Station, which has been continually operating and hosting astronaut crews since November of 2000. The data was analyzed using DeDoose qualitative coding software to identify thirty-two emerging themes over five major categories that characterize spacecraft interior environments: microgravity, workday, psychological health, design features, and other issues. A close examination of these categories indicates that module functionality, safety details, together with size, wayfinding and orientation, comfort and privacy features, incorporation of portholes, and color are the characteristics of spacecraft interior environments that affect astronauts’ overall psychological well-being and stress levels most. In the programming phase, the researcher analyzed historic spacecraft schematics to determine the potentially most effective design solutions for the project portion of this thesis, the renovation of the International Space Station. These results can be utilized by spacecraft engineers, architects, and interior designers to serve the needs of astronauts by supporting their psychological well-being and enhancing their experience onboard spacecraft during long-term space travel.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>When compared to restudy, a practice test results in greater final test recall, a phenomenon known as the testing effect, and has been replicated across hundreds of experiments (Rowland, 2014; Adesope et al., 2017); however, consistent theoretical explanations for the benefits of testing remain elusive. I investigated the underlying assumptions for two prominent theories of the testing effect, the episodic context theory (Karpicke et al., 2014) and the dual memory model (Rickard &amp; Pan, 2018). Across four experiments (combined n = 426) I contrasted the predictions of the theories regarding the specificity of learning (Experiments 1 and 2), attempted to manipulate context updating as proposed by the episodic context theory in a restudy condition using instructions to retrieve the acquisition phase context during the practice phase (Experiment 3), and attempted to manipulate the number of memory traces the dual memory model proposes are created during the practice phase using pretesting (Experiment 4). Across these experiments I found no support for the episodic context theory assumption that context updating results in greater retrieval on a final test. In contrast, I found conflicting evidence for the dual memory model assumption that a second memory trace is created during a practice test. These experiments take an initial step toward behavioral tests of the core assumptions for two important models of the testing effect and reveal important directions for future research. Additionally, the results of Experiment 3 suggest a complex context change may be a potential boundary condition for the testing effect, which has important implications for education and learning.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to explore the ways graduate students’ interpretive lenses manifested in reflective storytelling of their collaborative object-based learning (OBL) experiences with Andean textiles in the John and Mary Carter Collection. This occurred in the context of visitor-centered exhibition (VCE) development. Adapted Feminist Thinking Systems (Love &amp; Villeneuve, 2017; Stephens, 2013) as an epistemological framework guided the development and implementation of this research project. The methodology of narrative inquiry (Clandinin, 2016; Clandinin and Connelly, 2000) recognized the complexity of student experiential stories as expressions of their unique voices. Five graduate students reflectively narrated their OBL and VCE experiences at Florida State University during a global pandemic. Student interpretive lenses during OBL activities showed the ways differences in their backgrounds and experiences contributed to their stories on the Andean textiles. The imaginative storytelling process provided scaffolding for participants to interpret novel OBL experiences with the textiles and generate creative ideas for VCE development. The dissonance between individual interpretive lenses and collaborative OBL influenced participant stories and the VCE narrative process. The VCE team members needed facilitative guidance with rationales on the relationships between object study, object stories, object research, and different types of interpretive narratives for the VCE plan. Collaborative OBL and VCE activities constituted paradoxical events. Students acknowledged the importance of collaboration for VCE planning and museums. Participant interpretive lenses of OBL activities with Andean textiles for collaborative VCE development contributed to embodied stories of experiential museum training as aesthetic life-story narratives for future experiences. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Early childhood traumatic experiences place children at-risk for social, emotional, and behavioral impairments that contribute to poor educational outcomes. There is an increasing awareness that children with early traumatic exposure may need supplemental supports for academic success. These supports may be presented in the form of individual-student or whole-school trauma-informed care models. Existing prevention models, such as Multi-Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS) or Trauma Informed Care (TIC), accommodate early screening of students’ skills and behaviors, however, there is a lack of consensus in the literature regarding how trauma is measured within school environments and at what age students should be screened for the effects of childhood trauma on their educational success. Using a dominance analysis and ROC Curve analysis, this dissertation examined the overall predictive validity of childhood trauma measurement to early literacy skills and the tradeoff in classification accuracy of the measurement of childhood trauma in the early identification of kindergarteners (n=145) engaging in virtual learning environments who are at-risk for poor early reading and language outcomes. Findings demonstrated that trauma was a significant predictor of reading outcomes but integrating student behaviors enhanced the classification accuracy of the traditional MTSS methods for identifying at-risk readers. Results from this study provided the first empirical link between trauma and reading outcomes in  kindergarteners in virtual learning environments.  Results can inform TIC and MTSS models of care and provide preliminary empirical support for Whole-Child  Learning Models.  </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Physical appearance concerns are a prominent feature of several psychiatric disorders including body dysmorphic disorder, eating disorders, and social anxiety disorder, and a growing body of research suggests that appearance concerns may have important utility as a transdiagnostic construct. However, self-report measures of this individual difference characteristic have been developed primarily within disorder-specific frameworks, in contrast with emerging dimensional models which seek to identify and investigate shared factors impacting systematic comorbidity. The lack of a psychometrically sound, transdiagnostic measure of appearance concerns constitutes a major limitation of ongoing work in this area that hinders the ability of researchers to integrate results across studies and samples. The aim of the current work was to develop and validate an efficient scale measure of physical appearance concerns for use in future studies investigating its role in different psychiatric conditions and their systematic comorbidity. We utilized item response theory and structural modeling methods to identify a subset of items from three widely used appearance-related scale measures with optimal measurement properties for indexing variations in general appearance concerns - resulting in a brief, nine-item General Appearance Concerns Scale (GACS). This new scale showed effective coverage of the general appearance concerns trait continuum, a unidimensional structure and excellent internal consistency, and evidence of criterion-related validity. Results support the GACS as an effective instrument for assessing symptoms within the domain of appearance concerns and a vehicle for pursuing systematic research on physical appearance concerns as a transdiagnostic construct.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Concepts like cultural relativism, tradition, and authenticity warrants a more critical examination in an age where much of the world’s population has adopted a digital lifestyle that is always online. As a cultural artifact, the internet has become integrated with human interaction and the cultural impact of its convenience has been taken for granted—the effect the internet and mobile telephony continues to have on blurring boundaries between cultural appropriation and cultural appreciation is tremendous and deserves more critical introspection, dialogue, and discourse among scholarship within the field of humanities. This dissertation uses the lens of online shakuhachi study to not only explores the boundaries between cultural appropriation and cultural appreciation but also to bring forth a much-needed dialogue about the meaning of terms such as cultural relativism and tradition in an era of hypermediated technoculture. The combination of interlocution, observation, interpretation, and participation has revealed that the ethnographic encounters of shakuhachi in the United States are mostly represented by “non-native” shakuhachi musicians. The transmission of the shakuhachi tradition, and other similar cultures that have non-native participants, are contending with a more complicated notion of the “crisis of representation”—lineages of different types of shakuhachi traditions are being transmitted by non-native shakuhachi musicians.The internet and other media devises play a significant role in how the narrative of shakuhachi history is told—a popular trope in the historiography of the instrument is that “the shakuhachi is an ancient instrument of Zen.” By drawing on my experiences studying shakuhachi with dai-shihan (大師範, grandmaster) Michael Chikuzen (竹禅)Gould, I deconstruct the history of the instrument in an effort to understand why shakuhachi is still characterized through romanticized notions of Buddhist thought and imagery.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Biomedial literature usually contains cutting edge research results on biomedical entities, in particular the relation between them, for example the interaction between two proteins. However, the ever-increasing volume in the literature makes it impossible to humanly annotate them all, thus automatic extraction of these relations from literature has become more important. In this dissertation, we discuss three projects related to extract relations in biomedical text, as well as another project on protein surface matching. In the first project on extracting relations, we process protein-protein relations from protein-protein interaction databases and build a sentence level relation model using distance learning. This method uses bags to group predictions of all sentences related to an entity pair into a prediction on the entity pair itself. We show our performance on our own dataset.
In the second project, we participated in the BioCreative VII challenge on text mining drug and chemical-protein interactions. For each sentence and entity pair in the sentence, we are asked to find the exact relationship type of the entity pair. We achieved 75% F1 score and placed the 8th out of 21 participants. 
In the last project, we participated in the LitCoin challenge. Here we focus on the the second part of the challenge, where the goal is to predict the exact relation type for biomedical entities of various types, including genes, diseases, cell lines, etc. We won the first place by achieving a 0.633 Jaccard score. 
In the protein surface matching project, we developed a fast program to calculate distances between protein surfaces using an algorithm that our group has published before.

            <DISS_para>The representation of Black women in senior leadership positions within higher education hovers at a dismal 5.8% (Wilder et al., 2013). Though Black women’s degree attainment has increased substantially in comparison to other racial groups (NCES, n.d.), they are not recruited and supported in these roles (Jackson &amp; Harris, 2007), especially in both Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Historically White Institutions. Consequently, the women who are successful in obtaining administrative and executive positions share experiences that illuminate a system still plagued with sexism and racism (Cooper, 2020). Using Black Feminist Thought, Intersectionality, and Misogynoir as frameworks, as well as a critical narrative inquiry, I explored the intersection of race and gender for Black women in senior-level leadership roles at HBCUs and HWIs. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Bioacoustics has long been a vital source of knowledge in the life sciences.  Bioacoustics provides us with an invaluable set of tools and insights to help us better understand how life interacts with one another and its environment.  Traditional bioacoustic techniques have all drawn heavily from Signal Processing, itself a subfield of Electrical Engineering.  Signal Processing techniques have allowed for unprecedented insight into the structure and makeup of these signals.  They have also allowed us to better understand their information content and time-varying structure.  However, much work remains to be done.  Much of the information encoded in the frequency-domain representations analyzed by most traditional methods are also encoded in the time-domain shape of the signal itself.  In this work, we present a new technique for analyzing bioacoustic signals using only the time-domain and the shapes of individual vocalization acts, called pulses.  This method provides a new, simpler way of comparing vocalizations across individuals and populations. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Ideal Standards Model suggests that individuals should demonstrate more romantic interest in a potential partner and be more satisfied with an existing partner to the extent that the partner possesses the traits they desire (termed ideal-partner consistency). Further, evolutionary perspectives on mating suggest that individuals should possess varying degrees of desire for three critical partner traits – attractiveness-vitality, status-resources, and warmth-trustworthiness. While ideal-partner consistency on these traits has predicted satisfaction with existing partners in prior work, findings for interest in potential partners have been more mixed. This dissertation proposes that findings have been mixed because the self-report measures used in most prior work have failed to capture individuals’ automatic, gut-level preferences. Accordingly, I examined the extent to which ideal-partner consistency using (1) self-reported preferences for attractiveness, status, and warmth in a partner and (2) automatic preferences for these traits in a partner captured using a new implicit measure uniquely predicted interest in potential partners during a speed-dating event and satisfaction with relationships formed after the event. Ideal-partner consistency for self-reported preferences did predict more interest in potential partners for men and more satisfaction with current partners for both men and women, though greater consistency predicted less interest for women. Further, ideal-partner consistency for automatic preferences predicted more interest in potential partners among individuals with a short-term mating orientation, but surprisingly, less interest among those with a long-term mating orientation. Lastly, consistency for self-reported preferences generally predicted outcomes more strongly than did consistency for automatic preferences. These findings join some prior work in demonstrating that some of the preferences individuals report predict both the partners they later pursue and their later satisfaction with those relationships. These findings also may suggest that individuals do not allow their gut-level associations with certain traits to strongly guide them toward partners with these traits, nor do these associations affect their later relationship satisfaction. However, future work may benefit from re-examining these associations using a revised implicit task.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Photon upconversion (UC), especially through the process of triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA), is capable of combining two photons into one higher energy photon which could be captured in applications such as photovoltaics, photocatalysis, optogenetics, imaging and sensing, and many others. TTA-UC systems rely on spin-triplet states donated from a sensitizer material, which is commonly either an organometallic molecule or a semiconductor nanocrystal confined in three dimensions, typically referred to as a quantum dot. This dissertation encompasses a different approach to triplet sensitization specifically applied to TTA-UC. Semiconductor nanocrystals with quantum confinement relaxed in either one or two dimensions have unique properties endowed by their shape, size, and anisotropic nature, making them viable candidates for triplet sensitization. Chapter 3 explores CdTe nanorods, materials with two dimensions of quantum confinement, as potential triplet sensitizer materials in a red-to-blue TTA-UC scheme. TTA-UC is successfully observed in this system with a UC efficiency better or comparable to similar nanocrystal sensitized systems. Chapter 4 investigates the use of CdSe nanoplatelets, which are only quantum confined in their thickness. Here, the nanoplatelets are compared directly to quantum dots. Comparing the results of the nanoplatelet and quantum dot sensitized systems results in an interplay between the incident power threshold required for efficient TTA-UC and the UC efficiency, attributed to stacking of the nanoplatelets, which was shown to inhibit the performance of the nanoplatelet sensitized system. In Chapter 5, bulk semiconductors are explored as potential triplet sensitizers, through the use of bulk metal halide perovskites, which rely on no quantum confinement, and sensitize the annihilator molecule through a free charge mechanism.  The performance of these systems is reliant on many factors, including the composition, fabrication method of the perovskite sensitizer, and the illumination time of the perovskite, which tunes its defect density. 
In summary, this dissertation looks beyond conventional semiconductor quantum dots as triplet sensitizer materials toward a new class of materials which include nanorods, nanoplatelets, and bulk semiconductors. In all cases, TTA-UC is successfully observed. However, the lasting relevance of these systems may rest on their ability to sensitize TTA-UC systems in the solid-state, which is a key development for their implementation into solid-state device applications such as photovoltaics. Bulk perovskite sensitized systems are already among the most efficient and useful solid-state triplet sensitizers, while nanorods and nanoplatelets could outperform existing solid-state nanocrystal sensitizers due to their improved exciton diffusion lengths upon self-assembly. These potential strategies and future developments toward improving TTA-UC are further discussed in Chapter 6, where we look toward the potentially bright future of TTA-UC, especially toward device-relevant applications.

            <DISS_para>This dissertation examined the relationship between student engagement in college and subsequent employment status and early career earnings in a public university. This study sought to understand whether or not student academic and social experiences in college are related to post-baccalaureate early career earnings. The literature review explored human and social capital theories, related student development theories, and the economics of education as it relates to the earnings premium of postsecondary education. The study analyzed student data and explored the relationship between student experiences in college and subsequent employment status and early career earnings. The overall engagement measure dramatically increased the likelihood a student was employed within 6 months of graduation and was also positively related to early career earnings. Of the student engagement subscales, leadership and campus involvement and community service and philanthropy increased the likelihood a student was employed within 6 months of graduation. The leadership and campus involvement measure was also positively related to early career earnings in the full model, as well as in many of the conditional models for different student subpopulations. The international and global learning measure and the research and academic endeavors measure both had a negative relationship with the natural log of wages in the overall model and in many of the conditional models, plausibly due to increased engagement of students who may have been more inclined to enter into public service, social services, or the non-profit sector. Regarding the moderating relationships, the results suggested that the research and academic endeavors measure was more important to early career earnings for males than females, while the overall engagement measure and the community service and philanthropy measure were less important for STEM majors compared to non-STEM majors.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Following the Second World War and through the end of the twentieth century, the Christian Reformed Church in North America experienced massive changes, beginning with unified institutional growth and a wave of new migration and ending with an internal struggle over the cultural changes occurring in North American culture. Rooted in Dutch migration, ethnicity, and Reformed theology, the denomination provides examples of how an established ethnic community adapted to new migrants, Christian youth adopted the cultural changes of the 1960s era, and a confessional religious community interacted with the rise of conservative white evangelicalism. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Part religious history and part ethnic history, this study attempts to merge the two historiographies to demonstrate how a community rooted in both religious faith and ethnic identity navigated the cultural and political landscape of the late twentieth century. Due to the binational character of the Christian Reformed Church, transcending the American/Canadian border, and the transnational nature of Dutch Reformed denominations during this period, this study engages with these changes outside of a strictly U.S. context.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Ultimately, I explore the development and meaning of community across time. Both the leaders and members of the Christian Reformed Church belonged to a specific community, one which plotted the direction of their lives and shaped their understanding of their local communities, their nation, and the broader world. I hope the reader will gain a sense of the world they created and developed and how it changed in relation to wider cultural transformations.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study examines the research and scholarship sharing and dissemination practices in an online environment among law school faculty. Guided by one of the most widely used technology usage and adoption models, Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), it investigates law school professors’ attitudes and perceptions toward self-archiving and subsequent adoption and usage behavior through a qualitative research design of semi-structured interviews.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The findings indicate that participants generally have very positive attitudes towards Open Access (OA) and are in favor of supporting self-archiving and OA practice despite lacking knowledge of the subject. The majority of the participants use the Social Science Research Network (SSRN) for self-archiving which appears to be an “industry standard” in legal academia. Other platforms the participants choose to self-archive include institutional repositories, ResearchGate, Academia.edu, personal websites, institutional websites, and research consortium websites. Research confirms the accuracy of UTAUT’s concepts for understanding motivation factors for self-archiving among law school faculty; the findings further identify additional emerging concepts and also barriers and concerns law professors have regarding OA and self-archiving.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study helps to fill the research gap and understand the self-archiving social phenomenon within an under-studied user group therefore supports libraries with improving current services, ensuring effective advocacy, and engaging potential initiatives regarding scholarly communication in the legal profession.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Formation of cold, dense waters south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) is one of the main drivers of the global overturning circulation, with major implications on the earth’s climate. A key region where the densest waters on earth are formed is the Ross Sea which is separated from the ACC by the Ross Gyre. The strength and variability of the Ross Gyre circulation impact the formation and export of dense water, and it is therefore important to understand its circulation and dynamics.  Observations in the Ross Gyre are limited because of its remote location and the severe weather conditions. Furthermore, the ice cover limits the application of remote sensing techniques. Quantitative estimates of the gyre’s strength are difficult to obtain from hydrographic observations alone due to the limited sampling and the relatively weak stratification. In this dissertation, we use a combination of observations and modeling studies to a) provide an estimate of the strength and variability of the Ross Gyre transport and b) investigate the relative contributions of the wind and buoyancy forcing, eddies, and the presence of ACC to the Ross Gyre circulation. We find that the mean transport of the Ross Gyre can be as high as ~45 Sv, about twice of the typical estimate ~20 Sv reported in the literature. Sensitivity experiments to wind and buoyancy forcing, nonlinear terms, and the ACC were performed with a regional configuration of the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM). The numerical experiments show that the Ross Gyre, and its variability, are primarily wind-driven. The ACC is responsible for part of the recirculation. Buoyancy and nonlinearity/eddy do not appear to play a major role in the gyre dynamics.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Active flow control can achieve substantial performance gains and meet the challenges of next-generation air vehicles and energy harvesting devices. The use of active flow control techniques with the deflecting flap or morphing surfaces has been shown to be a viable path to regulating the flow-induced vibration of the foil. However, due to the complex nature of flow over morphing surfaces, all physical phenomena are intertwined, which prevents a clear understanding of the underlying flow physics and, therefore, a successful design of a controlling action to optimally modify them. In this research, fluid-structure interaction systems are modeled with a high-fidelity tightly-coupled numerical scheme. Specifically, an embedded geometrical description is used to model and track the dynamics of a foil with an actively deflecting flap. Through various analysis tools, including a geometrically-weighted modal analysis technique, mode competitions are observed between flow-induced and geometry-induced mechanisms, and the morphing structure is proven to be capable of regulating the fluid-structure interacting behaviors. Furthermore, an advanced network is developed to extract the transient transition of different modes in the fluid-structure interaction systems. With all the knowledge acquired through the modal analysis, an active flow control framework with the model predictive control theory is built to modulate the flow-induced flutter using morphing surfaces. The geometrically weighted dynamic-relevant modes are used to build surrogate models to achieve rapid model-based active control of complex systems. The proposed technique can create a systematic framework to advise substantial improvements in the functionality of next-generation systems through detailed investigations of fluid-structure interactions and provide insights into the effects of control design changes on the physical phenomena that drive the dynamic performance of these systems.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The 26S proteasome is the largest and most complicated chambered protease known. It is responsible for regulated degradation of proteins within all eukaryotic cells, and is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis. Disruptions to proteasome assembly, composition, or function cause or exacerbate numerous human diseases, including cancers, neurodegenerative disorders, and a family of autoimmune disorders. The proteasome is comprised of two major subcomplexes: the regulatory particle (RP) and the core particle (CP). Each serves distinct functions in degradation of substrate. The RP contains a ring of six AAA+ ATPase subunits that mechanically unfold substrate and translocate it into the proteolytic chamber of the CP, which houses the proteolytic active sites. The ATPase subunits are absolutely essential to proteasome function, as they served as both gatekeepers and guides for the diverse population of protein substrates that proteasomes must degrade to maintain proteostasis in a complex and crowded cellular environment. The unstructured C-termini of most proteasomal ATPase subunits dock into pockets in the surface of the barrel-shaped CP, tethering the RP to the CP and regulating substrate access to the proteolytic core. Furthermore, flexible pore-1 loops extend from each Rpt subunit into the central channel of the ATPase ring. These pore loops grip substrates and, via ATP-fueled movements, mechanically unfold and translocate them through the ATPase ring’s pore and into the CP for destruction. Given the exceptional size and complexity of the proteasome, the unstructured pore-1 loops and C-termini of the ATPase subunits exert disproportionally large impacts on its structure and function. Although some rudimentary analyses of their individual contributions have been performed, the myriad of ways in which they contribute to proteasome physiology remain very poorly understood. In this thesis, I describe my analyses of these key functional elements, which have challenged some aspects of the current model of substrate translocation by the proteasome, and have serendipitously revealed a potential quality control mechanism that disassembles proteasomes with compromised RP-CP interfaces. I discuss these findings in the context of our current understanding of proteasome function and quality control, and provide perspectives on new hypotheses and questions arising from my work.  </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study examined the transgenerational relationship between the prevalence of maternal childhood traumas for justice-involved adolescent mothers and her baby’s social and emotional risk by the age of 24 months. Two separate variables for the mother’s childhood trauma were used. The first of these variables came from the mother’s self-reported completion of the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) Questionnaire. The second variable on the mother’s experiences of early adversity came from the same ACEs Questionnaire being completed by home visitors who worked with the mother/baby dyad scoring the questionnaire on the teen mother based on information that was shared by the teen and reviewing the teen’s records. Guided by the Ecobiodevelopmental Framework, the current study included epigenetic concepts in social science research to acknowledge the growing body of evidence that documents the complexity of contributing factors to infant social and emotional risk that go beyond the child’s significant relationships, environment, and community. The results indicated that the teen mother’s self-reported ACE score was not a significant predictor of the child’s social and emotional risk. The home visitor calculated ACE score, however, was a significant predictor of the child’s social and emotional risk. The gender of the child was also a significant predictor when controlling for the home visitor’s ACE score with boys being more likely to score at risk on the ASQ:SE.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Variable selection methods have become an important and growing problem in Bayesian analysis. The literature on Bayesian variable selection methods tends to be applied to a single response- type, and more typically, a continuous response-type, where it is assumed that the data is Gaus- sian/symmetric. In this dissertation, we develop a novel global-local shrinkage prior in non- symmetric settings and multiple response-types settings by combining the perspectives of global- local shrinkage and the conjugate multivaraite distribution.
In Chapter 2, we focus on the problem of variable selection when the data is possibly non- symmetric continuous-valued. We propose modeling continuous-valued data and the coefficient vector with the multivariate logit-beta (MLB) distribution. To perform variable selection in a Bayesian context we make use of shrinkage global-local priors to enforce sparsity. Specifically, they can be defined as a Gaussian scale mixture of a global shrinkage parameter and a local shrinkage parameter for a regression coefficient. We provide a technical discussion that illustrates that our use of the multivariate logit-beta distribution under a P ́olya-Gamma augmentation scheme has an explicit connection to a well-known global-local shrinkage method (i.e., the horseshoe prior) and extends it to possibly non-symmetric data. Moreover, our method can be implemented using an efficient block Gibbs sampler. Evidence of improvements in terms of mean squared error and variable selection as compared to the standard implementation of the horseshoe prior for skewed data settings is provided in simulated and real data examples.
In Chapter 3, we direct our attention to the canonical variable selection problem in multiple response-types settings, where the observed dataset consists of multiple response-types (e.g., con- tinuous, count-valued, Bernoulli trials, etc.). We propose the same global-local shrinkage prior in Chapter 2 but for multiple response-types datasets. The implementation of our Bayesian variable selection method to such data types is straightforward given the fact that the multivariate logit-beta prior is the conjugate prior for several members from the natural exponential family of distributions, which leads to the binomial/beta and negative binomial/beta hierarchical models. Our proposed model not just allows the estimation and selection of independent regression coefficients, but also those of shared regression coefficients across-response-types, which can be used to explicitly model dependence in spatial and time-series settings. An efficient block Gibbs sampler is developed, which is found to be effective in obtaining accurate estimates and variable selection results in simulation studies and an analysis of public health and financial costs from natural disasters in the U.S.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Low-level wind shear (LLWS) is one of the most common aviation hazards in both clear and bad weather conditions. Low-level wind shear is dangerous for landing or taking off activities because it can cause the aircraft to overshoot or undershoot. The short spatial and temporal scale of the occurrence of low-level wind shears and the lack of understanding of its characteristics cause the wind shear warnings can not to be carried out optimally. Therefore, this study aims to determine the characteristics of low-level wind shear that occurs in the Bali region, especially at Ngurah Rai International Airport. This study mainly uses two years of observational data from wind profilers to determine when LLWS occurs based on reports from pilots and wind shear warnings. This data will then also be used to calculate the value of the bulk Richardson number (Rb), which will be used to determine the condition of atmospheric stability during the LLWS. Additional data in the form of weather radar data and ERA5 will also be used to identify weather phenomena that can affect LLWS events. The results showed that LLWS in the Bali region most often occurred from morning to noon and in clear weather conditions. Moreover, the leading cause of LLWS is due to the inversion layer. The blocking of momentum transfer by the inversion layer usually causes LLWS to form at a threshold value of -0.25&lt;Rb&lt;0.1. Changes in the value of Rb and the formation of an inversion layer affect the location of the occurrence of LLWS, where most occur above the inversion layer or above the layer with a value of Rb&lt;0.1. The calculation of the skill score shows a good result for the POD value of 0.7, FAR 0.27, CSI 0.55, and ETS 0.43, which indicates that LLWS can mostly occur if it is followed by a decrease in Rb in the threshold value range for four minutes and a change in wind direction and speed of 5 kt for ten minutes.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>a heavenly steed, soaring across the skies is a two-movement work for orchestra. The title derives from the Chinese idiom. Chinese people use this idiom to describe a bold, imaginative, unconstrained style. This work intends to create an elevated and cohesive atmosphere connecting two superficially unrelated objects: sky lanterns as a symbol of fortune and the Forbidden City, a palace complex located in Peking (Beijing).The first movement is inspired by a story during the Three Kingdoms period (from 220 to 280 AD). A military strategist of one of the three kingdoms, Zhuge Liang (also known as Zhuge Kongming), invented the sky lantern. When the other Kingdom's army surrounded him in a town, he made sky lanterns to transmit messages to manage an escape from the siege, and he succeeded. Since then, the sky lantern has symbolized hope for success and fortune. Thus, this movement intends to deliver a prayer for hope. It begins with a slow-growing motive decorated by the ostinato in the high register to create a serene atmosphere. The middle section takes inspiration from Igor Stravinsky's "Infernal Dance" from “Firebird”, while reimagining it as if this music is written for a video game by featuring repetitive motives and limited polyphony. The driving and relentless section proceeds with the off-beat melodies and disturbs the previous tranquil section. Increased rhythmic pulses and an intense and dramatic atmosphere aims to throw the audience in a place as if a mighty force traps them. Along with the ascending stepwise motive truncated at the end of the middle section, the beginning slow-growing motive returns. The coda depicts sky lanterns flaming while flying to the sky.
The second movement is about the Forbidden City. The Yongle emperor of the Ming Dynasty built this marvelous architecture. Since then, the emperors of all dynasties have lived in it. It gives people a sense of mystery and inaccessibility. This movement begins quickly with a short piano introduction accompanied by strings and woodwinds. After a dialogue among woodwind instruments, the main theme is presented in tutti. Influenced by the theme of the film music “The Last Emperor” composed by Ryuichi Sakamoto, the main theme of this movement features a four-note motif with pitches drawn from the pentatonic scale. This motif develops through variations of pitch and rhythmic durations. This movement also fused the features of film music, as it presents various moods through different distinctive musical characters. For example, the middle section uses the extensive virtuosic runs in woodwind parts interrupted by swells creating a sense of exhaustion; in contrast, a slow and lyrical dialogue between clarinet and piano relaxes the tensions between two climaxes, whereas the biggest climax (mm. 125-145) resembles a culmination of a soundtrack from an epic film. This movement aims to make the audience feel the magnificence of the Forbidden City.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>There is much research on music preferences, responses to music, and music therapy using client-preferred music. Not as much research exists about the effects of music therapists’ preferred music, specifically their disliked music. The purpose of this study was to investigate music therapy students’ perceptions about their experiences with their disliked music and their opinions about using their disliked music in music therapy. A survey was sent out via email and social media, with a total of 20 undergraduate music therapy students responding. It included questions about having disliked music, listening frequency for disliked music, reactions to disliked music, preparation and use of disliked music in music therapy, and disliked music’s effect on relationships with clients. The survey consisted of 21 questions in total. In general, disliked music was listened to relatively infrequently, and participants perceived disliked music to produce negative emotional responses. Both similarities and differences were found between results for slightly disliked music and results for strongly disliked music. A notable difference was that most (n=9) music therapy students thought they should use slightly disliked music in music therapy but most (n=10) were unsure about using strongly disliked music. Two other differences between slightly and strongly disliked music were related to reactions to the music and the predicted effect on the relationship with clients. In light of the perceived negative effects of disliked music and other results from this study, music therapy students may benefit from discussion about possible responses they may have to disliked music and using disliked music in music therapy, including strategies that may facilitate its use.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a leading monogenetic cause of intellectual disability and autism. It is caused by transcriptional silencing of the FMR1 gene and the resultant loss of its product, Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). Individuals with FXS display prominent sensory dysfunction including acoustic hyperactivity and compromised hearing in noise, which emerge at young ages. Animal studies have revealed maladaptive developmental events caused by the absence of FMRP, including delays in axonal and synaptic development as well as alterations in experience-dependent neuronal plasticity. These cellular abnormalities may underlie sensory processing deficits in FXS but show high regional- and time-specificity. Thus, whether and how individual developmental events contribute to the emergence and progress of circuit alterations are largely unknown. In addition, the precise sites of FMRP action in regulating these cellular and circuit pathophysiology remain elusive.In this dissertation, we dissected the role of FMRP in synaptic tonotopic development, afferent regulation of neuronal dynamics during developmental critical periods, and the association with the emergence of auditory processing problems by focusing on the auditory brainstem circuit using mouse and chicken as model organisms. In Chapter 2, we characterized the developmental distributions of key presynaptic neurotransmitter-releasing machinery in the mouse developing medial nucleus of the trapezoid body, a major auditory nucleus receiving excitatory inputs from the cochlear nucleus and serving as an inhibitory station for further processing.  We identified novel tonotopic gradients of selective presynaptic proteins in immature auditory synapses in the first postnatal week, which gradually flattened before the onset of hearing (around postnatal day 12-14). In Fmr1 (human FMR1 homolog) knockout (KO) mice, a mouse model of FXS, progress to achieve the mature-like organization was selectively altered in some presynaptic proteins. These results provide a potential mechanism that may contribute to tonotopic differentiation of neurotransmission in the auditory system during normal and abnormal development. In Chapter 3, we examined how afferent deprivation affects the cellular FMRP dynamics and the association with neuronal reorganizations in the chicken cochlear nucleus, an auditory nucleus receiving afferent inputs from the cochlea. We observed rapid aggregation of FMRP immunoreactivity into large granular structures in a subset of neurons following afferent deprivation, and the persistent FMRP aggregation was associated with neuronal cell death in these neurons. In the surviving neurons, FMRP level was correlated with multiple types of neuronal responses and synaptic rearrangements, suggesting a potential role of FMRP in afferent-regulated neuronal dynamics. In Chapter 4, we investigated how loss of FMRP affects the afferent regulation of neuronal dynamics within a critical period in the mouse ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN), identified the relationship between the closure of the critical period and the onset of auditory experience, and determined a peripheral site of FMRP in regulating these events. We found that a critical period for VCN neuronal loss in response to deafferentation was preserved in Fmr1 KO mice, and within this critical period, the degree of neuronal loss was unchanged. However, the closure of the critical period for neuronal cell death was delayed and temporally coincidental with reduced hearing sensitivity in the absence of FMRP. Furthermore, selective deletion of FMRP expression in spiral ganglion neurons recapitulated the delay in VCN critical period closure, similar to Fmr1 KO mice. This study identified a novel involvement of cochlear FMRP in shaping the temporal features of neuronal critical periods in the brain, and highlighted a peripheral mechanism of neurodevelopmental pathogenesis.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Meta-analysis is a widely used tool to combine research findings from multiple studies in many disciplines. In this thesis we develop novel methods to deal with two critical issues in systematic reviews and meta-analyses, such as assessing and testing between-study inconsistency and time-lag bias. The first part of this thesis concentrates on addressing the inconsistency between different studies' results. Such inconsistency could arise due to several factors, such as heterogeneity in baseline characteristics of individual studies' populations, different methods applied by research teams, and outlying effects of a few studies. In the current literature, the Q and I^2 statistics are commonly used to test for and quantify the between-study heterogeneity, respectively, but they are not powerful in many cases, particularly when the number of studies is small. This article propose alternative Q-like statistics for assessing inconsistency. We also propose a hybrid test to utilize the information and strength of all tests, and it is found to have relatively high power across multiple settings. We use simulated and real data to evaluate the performance of tests.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The second part of the thesis focuses on addressing the time-lag bias of studies. Time-lag bias occurs when studies with positive results are more likely to publish earlier than non-significant findings. The current literature uses the regression-based model to test the time-lag bias, but it is not powerful if the relationship between effect sizes and published time is not linear. This article proposes alternative measures and tests for assessing time-lag bias. Similar to the first part, We also propose a hybrid test to utilize the information and strength of all tests, and it is found to have relatively high power across multiple settings. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Facial expression recognition (FER) is a promising but challenging area of computer vision (CV).Many researchers have devoted significant resources to exploring FER in recent years, but an
impediment remains: classifiers perform well on fine-resolution images but have difficulty recog-
nizing in-the-wild human emotional states. In order to address the issue mentioned above, we
introduced some novel designs and implemented them in neural networks. More specifically, we
utilized an asymmetric pyramidal network (APNet) and employed multi-scale kernels instead of
identical-size kernels. In addition, square kernels were replaced by square, horizontal, and vertical
convolutions. This structure can increase the description ability of convolutional neural networks
(CNN)and transfer multi-scale features between different layers. Grouped convolution was adopted
as well. It reduces the training time and improves the model’s performance. Additionally, when
training CNN, we applied gradient centralization to stochastic gradient descent with momentum
(SGDMGC), which centralizes gradients to have zero mean and makes the training process more
efficient and stable. Furthermore, the learnable preprocessor is placed before feeding initial images
into the classification network. This structure generates images for a better recognition performance
than high visual quality ones.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To verify the effectiveness of the proposed design, we used four of the most popular in-the-wildemotion datasets, FER-2013, FER+, RAF-DB, and SFEW, for our experiments. The results of our
experiment and comparisons with state-of-the-art (SOTA) designs from others demonstrate that
APNet with SGDMGC outperforms most of methods with a single model and even has comparable
performance to methods with multiple models. By conducting an ablation study on our model, we
found that removing any proposed technique or techniques would lead to performance degradation.
The results thus prove that each design has boosted the performance of the proposed model on
FER tasks. Next, simulation results from APNet with SGDMGC combined with the learnable
preprocessors are displayed as well. This combination has a competitive performance compared
with other SOTA model fusion methods.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Psychosis may arise from an altered modulation of the mesolimbic dopamine system. However, the source of upstream disturbance and the underlying neural circuitry remain unknown. It is generally agreed that genetic susceptibility contribute to the development of psychotic disorders. Among identified risk genes, several encodes multiple members of the 14-3-3 family of proteins. Previously, by transgenically expressing an isoform-independent 14-3-3 peptide inhibitor (difopein), we reported that 14-3-3 functional knockout mice exhibit psychomotor behavior and increased dopamine content levels in their striatum, both corresponding to human psychosis. To identify the key brain regions involved in the top-down control of specific schizophrenia-associated behaviors, we utilized an adeno-associated virus mediated difopein expression approach and found that region-specific inhibition of 14-3-3 proteins in the dorsal hippocampus CA1 (dCA1) alone is sufficient to induce psychosis-like behaviors in mice, including a novelty-induced hyperlocomotive activity associated with an increased neuronal activation in the hippocampus.While hippocampal hyperactivity is implicated in psychosis by both human and animal studies, whether it induces hyperdopaminergic state and the underlying neural circuitry remain elusive. Here, we further showed that 14-3-3 dysfunction in the dCA1 over-activates ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopaminergic neurons, and such over-activation is necessary in eliciting psychomotor behavior in mice. We demonstrated that such hippocampal dysregulation of the VTA during psychomotor behavior is dependent on an over-activation of the lateral septum (LS), given that inhibition of the LS attenuates over-activation of dopaminergic neurons and psychomotor behavior induced by 14-3-3 inhibition in the dCA1. Moreover, 14-3-3 inhibition-induced neuronal activations within the dCA1-LS-VTA pathway and psychomotor behavior can be reproduced by direct chemogenetic activation of LS-projecting dCA1 neurons. Collectively, these results suggest that 14-3-3 dysfunction in the dCA1 results in hippocampal hyperactivation which leads to psychomotor behavior via a dCA1-LS-VTA pathway.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In many biomedical studies, multiple sourced data with varied features are observed on the same subjects. Examples include longitudinal markers measured along with a time-to-event outcome of interest and multiset data with varied dimensions. To extract the association structure from the multi-sourced data poses great challenges. We present two Bayesian frameworks utilizing latent variables in order to provide solutions for these two specific data scenarios. For modeling longitudinal markers measured along with a time-to-event outcome, we develop a fully Bayesian joint longitudinal-survival model that uses a latent class structure to facilitate discovery of subgroups exhibiting distinct behavior, and our formulation incorporates estimation of the number of subgroups and offers enhanced flexibility with a subgroup-specific piecewise linear log baseline hazard. For modeling multiset data with varied dimensions, we propose a Bayesian framework that uses latent factors to decompose data into four conceptual parts: joint structure induced by the latent factors shared across all the sets, partial association structure induced by the latent factors shared by the associated subsets of the multiset data, individual structure induced by latent factors unique to each set, and noise. Our method enables flexible selection of latent factors and discovery of association structure as well as variable selection in the joint structure (and, if desired, in the partial association structure). For both methods, we show the ability and the performance by simulation, and use real data for demonstration.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Many music therapists provide school-based services of various forms throughout the country. Music therapy is eligible for inclusion in IEPs as a related service, but there has been little to no research into the rate at which music therapists are involved with IEP procedures. IEP teams must include a special educator, general educator, the student’s parent(s) or guardian(s), a school district representative, a school psychologist, and any related service that the student receives. How often do music therapists communicate and collaborate with these IEP team members? The researcher developed a 44-question survey to address these inquiries and distributed it to all MT-BCs who consented to receive research invitations. A total of 209 responses were included in analysis. Respondents practiced in all seven regions of the country and worked in a variety of school settings. Respondents had access to their students’ IEP information 82.8% of the time, and of those that had access to IEP information, 81.5% were satisfied with their level of IEP involvement. Most respondents communicated with IEP stakeholders on an as needed basis, reflecting the individuality and variability of needs that each student has. Limitations, implications for practice, and suggestions for future research are included.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Loop unrolling is a compiler optimization that can improve the performance of applications without explicit intervention from programmers. In this study, we analyze how traditional loop unrolling techniques attempt to improve performance, and we propose new unrolling strategies that can unroll a greater number of loops than what is usually possible. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We perform loop unrolling using our assembly optimizer, which analyzes and optimizes code at the assembly level instead of at the compiler level. This gives us a different perspective of the code than what a typical compiler would have, as we do not concern ourselves with the source code or an intermediate language. We are free to make modifications at the instruction level, which allows us to optimize large sections of code that might otherwise be impossible to work on.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The optimizer collects statistics on the loops it unrolls, some of which are shown in our Results section. We ran our optimizer's unrolling algorithms on the SPEC 06 benchmark suite, and present both the statistics it generated as well as performance results from three different simulators. While performance gains are highly dependent on the application being optimized, we have shown it is possible to achieve considerable improvements by the use of loop unrolling.</DISS_para>
