         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Polyelectrolytes are polymers consisting of charged repeat units resulting in a netcharge for the macromolecules. Mixing oppositely charged polyelectrolytes creates
polyelectrolyte complexes (PEC). Different types of complexes can be obtained by
modifying the preparation technique. This dissertation focuses primarily on one kind of
PEC known as a polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEMU). These systems are formed by
depositing alternating “layers” of oppositely charged polymers onto a substrate. PEMUs
have been proposed for various applications, from electronic devices to antibacterial
coatings and drug delivery. These applications rely on the composition and integrity of
these films to withstand dynamic changes in the external environment, such as
temperature and environmental composition. They also rely on doping the films with
additives called “dopants” to modify the properties of these films.
This dissertation focuses on the stability of PEMUs and the motion of various
analytes through the films. This first aspect centers initially around the water content. The
PEMUs in this work are plasticized by water, becoming brittle when dry. This plasticization
led to the theory that the change in modulus close to room temperature for these systems
was not a glass transition but instead a dehydration/rehydration event. Fully hydrated
films were monitored using ATR-FTIR to assess the water content through the glass
transition at various salt concentrations. There was no discernible change in water
content that would indicate hydration or dehydration, supporting the theory that this
change in modulus results from a glass transition.
The commonly used polyelectrolyte pairs in this work are hydrophilic. This affinity
for water combined with added salts bringing in additional water and breaking up Pol+Polinteractions causes concern for the stability of the film. PEMUs were built again on the
ATR-FTIR and monitored in-situ as a solution of changing salt concentration flowed over
the film. The salt concentrations ranged from 0 to 1.0 M NaCl for 1, 2, and 4 hours and
then were brought back to 0 M NaCl over the same time period. The rapid change in salt
concentration was expected to stress the film, potentially causing it to swell to the point
of degradation. All three rates resulted in intact films, with the fastest change in
concentration resulting in the water not having sufficient time to equilibrate in the film, 
14
shown by a difference in response to increasing and decreasing NaCl concentration.
Long-term exposure to NaCl, especially high concentration salt, was also monitored.
Films were constructed on quartz slides and placed parallel to the beam in the cuvette.
Solutions of NaCl ranging from 0 to 2.5 M were added to the cuvette and monitored for
10 hours. The spectra indicate minimal leaching from the films into the solution at all but
the highest salt concentrations.
Ferrocyanide and ferricyanide diffusion through PEMUs was tested to determine if
their movement through the film would be sufficient to impact the rate of electrons
transferring from the redox centers through the film to an electrode. Films were built on
silicon wafers and monitored using transmission FTIR by taking spectra of the dried film
at specific time points during the exposure to the ferri- or ferrocyanide solutions. The
diffusion coefficients were determined, indicating ferricyanide diffuses significantly faster
than ferrocyanide. From the diffusion and the IR spectra, the concentration and spacing
of the redox centers were determined, indicating that the motion of the redox species is
not sufficient to alter the rate of electron motion.
Ligated lanthanide complexes are efficient emitters but often have issues with the
substrate quenching emission. PEMUs were tested to see if they could be used as
scaffolding to prevent this quenching. Hydrophilic and hydrophobic systems were
compared based on quantum yield and fluorescence lifetime. Hydrophilic films had faster
and higher uptake of the emissive sites, needing only five minutes for full incorporation,
but the hydrophobic films outperformed the hydrophilic films in emission under various
environmental humidity levels by better maintaining the quantum yield.
Diffusion of PSS through films was monitored with varying molecular weight,
temperature, and solution salt concentrations. Shorter chains diffused faster at the same
temperatures and were not impacted by changes in salt concentration. This could be
because the short-chain systems are above the Tg in those salt concentrations. Both long
and short-chain films were slower below Tg. Long-chain systems had a dependence on
salt concentration and a two-part diffusion regime at room temperature. This is because
the polymers closer to the surface of the film were more hydrated, and therefore above
the Tg, while the chains at the substrate were below Tg at room temperature. This resulted
in a two-part diffusion.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study examined the relationships among eHealth literacy, information consumption ‎from different sources, information overload, information anxiety, and information avoidance. ‎Drawing on the Comprehensive Model of Information Seeking framework (Johnson et al., ‎‎1995), a model was proposed to investigate factors influencing information avoidance during ‎the COVID-19 pandemic.‎Data were collected from adults in the United States using an online survey and the ‎proposed model was initially tested using SEM (n=1,875). The research questions were ‎answered using Exploratory Factor Analysis, Confirmatory Factor Analysis, Structural ‎Modeling correlational analyses, reliability analyses, and Generalized Linear Modeling. The ‎results showed the data do not fit the initial model properly. However, by implementing EFA, ‎an alternative best-fit model was identified. In addition, the study shows that information ‎consumption from both credible and noncredible sources had a significant relationship with ‎information overload and eHealth literacy. Also, eHealth literacy, information overload, and ‎information anxiety can be predictors of information avoidance.‎

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The forecasting of financial time series has been very important in both finance industry and academia for several years due to the volatile and unstable nature of financial systems. However, researchers believe that financial time series data can be modeled accurately, despite its noisy and unstable nature. Therefore, they have created several applications of time series modeling, which have been very successful when applied to financial markets, the prediction of stock prices being one of the main examples. In order to build better models for predicting stock prices, advanced data analysis techniques such as machine learning, deep learning, time series analysis, and probabilistic pattern recognition have been developed by researchers among from various areas in the past decades.Lately Recently, Deep Learning and Probabilistic Models are have become popular regarding due to developing their success in financial time series forecasting. This study focuses on a Deep Learning Model called Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and a Probabilistic Model called Hidden Markov Model (HMM) implementation for financial time series forecasting and on building a hybrid model by combining these two models to enhance prediction accuracy. More Specifically, the main objective is to build a novel approach of by combining LSTM with HMM, train the resulting model by using historical data, and predict future behavior of financial time series indicators. The results of our study indicate that the HMM is better than LSTM in predicting the stock closing price. The experimental result of our hybrid model process showed shows that the prediction accuracy of LSTM model increased when model combined with the HMM.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Meta-analysis has been frequently used to combine findings from independent studies in many areas. Bayesian methods are an important set of tools for performing meta-analyses. They avoid some potentially unrealistic assumptions that are required by conventional frequentist methods. More importantly, meta-analysts can incorporate prior information from many sources, including experts’ opinions and prior meta-analyses. Nevertheless, Bayesian methods are used less frequently than conventional frequentist methods, primarily because of the need for nontrivial statistical coding, while frequentist approaches can be implemented via many user-friendly software packages. This thesis divide into three parts, the first part aims at providing a practical review of implementations for Bayesian meta-analyses with various prior distributions. We present Bayesian methods for meta-analyses with the focus on a univariate meta-analysis of odds ratio for binary outcomes. We summarize various commonly used prior distribution choices for the between-studies heterogeneity variance, a critical parameter in meta-analyses. They include the inverse-gamma, uniform, and half-normal distributions, as well as evidence-based informative log-normal priors. Five real-world examples are presented to illustrate their performance. Under certain circumstances, Bayesian methods can produce markedly different results from those by frequentist methods, including a change in decision on statistical significance. When data information is limited, the choice of priors may have a large impact on meta-analytic results, in which case sensitivity analyses are recommended. Moreover, the algorithm for implementing Bayesian analyses may not converge for extremely sparse data; caution is needed in interpreting respective results. As such, convergence should be routinely examined. When select statistical assumptions made by conventional frequentist methods are violated, Bayesian methods provide a reliable alternative to perform a meta-analysis.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A critical issue of meta-analysis is that the combined studies could be heterogeneous because of differences in study populations, design conducts, etc. Thus, heterogeneity is an issue that can affect the validity of meta-analytic results. In the existence of heterogeneity, a random-effects meta-analysis is considered an appropriate model to estimate a summary effect and a between-study variance. For several studies, conventional methods could be used to estimate the random-effects meta-analysis model, but the estimate of between-study heterogeneity could be imprecise in the case of few studies, and this imprecision is not acknowledged. In this situation, a Bayesian random-effects meta-analysis is advantageous in accounting for all sources of uncertainty. The second part of this thesis uses Bayesian methods to examine the impact of meta-analysis characteristics on between-study heterogeneity by analyzing data from a large collection of meta-analyses with binary outcomes. We classify and examine all included meta-analyses by outcome types and intervention comparison types. Then, based on these outcome and intervention classifications, we derive a set of predictive distributions for the extent of between-study variance expected in a future meta-analysis in different effect measures. These findings may help researchers to use them as informative prior distributions in new meta-analyses of binary outcomes. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The last part of this thesis quantifies the between-study heterogeneity by using prediction intervals. By reporting the prediction interval, we show how often there is a contradiction in the conclusion compared to the conclusion based on the confidence interval. We also show the benefits of reporting the prediction interval in a meta-analysis, which has a straightforward clinical meaning that may guide researchers to expect the true effects in future settings. In addition, we use a large collection of meta-analyses from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews to evaluate the real-world performance of the prediction interval. We assess whether the previous meta-analysis successfully predicts a future study or a study not included in the meta-analysis based on publication years. This assessment is illustrated using a case study.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The epistemology of disagreement is primarily concerned with determining the rational response to disagreement. Of particular interest in the literature is the question of peer disagreement: how should you revise your beliefs when faced with the disagreement of an epistemic peer (i.e., someone who is just well-equipped as you are to evaluate the topic of disagreement)? The majority of the disagreement literature is directed toward the question of peer disagreement, and a range of different views have been proposed. Some views maintain that the rational response is to withhold judgment when faced with peer disagreement, while other views maintain that it can be rational to remain steadfast in your initial belief, and still other views hold that each of these responses can be reasonable under the right circumstances. In what follows, however, I will argue that the literature’s emphasis on peer disagreement is misguided, because it leads to unnecessary confusion, without offering any additional insight about how to rationally resolve disagreements. After a brief introduction in Chapter 1, I go on in Chapter 2 to argue that, although the concept of epistemic peerhood is useful for identifying epistemically interesting disagreements for study, when it comes to determining the rational response to those disagreements, peerhood becomes more of a hindrance than a help. As an alternative to standard peer-centric views of disagreement, I propose a ‘sliding-scale’ approach to the epistemic evaluation of interlocutors, a view I refer to as the Variable Weight View of disagreement (the VWV). After proposing the VWV in Chapter 2, I expand upon it in Chapter 3, responding to several potential objections, as well as considering how the VWV might be expanded upon in the future. I pay particular attention to the social dimension of disagreement, and the potential role that collective or community-level epistemic norms might play with respect to disagreement – a topic which I suggest deserves more attention than it presently receives in the literature. In Chapter 4, I consider what I take to be a particularly clear example of how peer-centric views of disagreement can go wrong. I consider the Equal Weight View as defended by Elga (2007), and I argue that his view ultimately fails because it relies for its success on a particularly problematic definition of peerhood. In Chapter 5, I conclude by comparing the VWV to the standard peer-oriented views of disagreement in the literature. I argue that, in each case, the most plausible versions of those views would benefit from abandoning their strict focus on peer disagreement, in favor of adopting a sliding-scale approach to epistemic evaluation, such as that proposed by the VWV.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation discusses brass bands in Mobile, Alabama and their individual “brands”(performance norms) and their relationship to the broader branding aspects of the city’s Mardi
Gras. I call this brass branding. How do the brass bands showcase their brand verbally and
performatively? How do different forms of Mobile Mardi Gras media incorporate brass band
aesthetics (visually and/or aurally) to convey Mobile as a Mardi Gras city? I answer these
questions through interviews, ethnographic observations, and analyses of media to show how
brass band aesthetics are tied to Mardi Gras. I found that the brass brands in the case studies I
discuss are multifaceted and function differently from context to context. The brass brands
communicate different messages regarding what Mardi Gras means to individuals or
communities in Mobile. Collectively, though, the brass brand case studies show that Mobilians
take great pride in their Mardi Gras and recognize the integral role of the brass band tradition.
Overall, this project offers approaches to studying the relationship between musicians,
marketing, and events to understand how ritual participants see and imagine themselves.
Examining the branding of Mardi Gras shows how Mobile is portraying itself as a “music” city
like New Orleans to live up to the same level of exceptionalism and how the bands each
contribute to the festivities through distinctive modes of performance.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The late Silurian was a turbulent era, with widespread environmental, biotic, and oceanographic variability. Major climatic and palaeoceanographic oscillations are often associated with faunal reorganizations and extinction events, and the late Silurian was no exception. The Lau/Kozlowskii extinction (LKE) event, associated with the Lau positive carbon isotope excursion (CIE, ~425 Ma), is recognized as a major marine extinction event in Earth’s history. The Lau CIE has been recognized in Sweden, Ukraine, Czech Republic, Latvia, Estonia, Australia, and North America with peak carbonate carbon isotope excursion values of +8 to +12‰ in certain localities. The Lau CIE has been previously hypothesized to be the result of increases in organic carbon burial with increased preservation due to an expansion of reducing marine conditions. While previous studies have shown evidence for a global expansion of reducing conditions surrounding the LKE, this previous work has focused on low latitude areas whereas this study focuses on a mid-latitude dataset from a peri-Gondwanan terrane, Perunica. Here I present a multi-proxy geochemical dataset from shale interbeds of the Kosov Quarry section (Czech Republic). Local redox proxies, including pyrite sulfur isotopes (34Spy), Fe speciation, and trace metal concentrations, suggest that marine redox conditions were consistently reducing through the late Silurian (Ludfordian) in this part of peri-Gondwana. Additionally, I have also utilized a novel global redox proxy, thallium isotopes (ε205Tl), to provide a critical constraint on the increase in bottom water anoxia in the global oceans during the Ludfordian Stage with locally highly reducing conditions recording accurate ε205Tl values. ε205Tl show multiple global excursions beginning with a sharp positive trend before the LKE before returning to original levels. ε205Tl values trend positive again starting just before the Lau CIE and begin trending negative after the CIE but do not return to pre-excursion levels within the section. This data highlights two global deoxygenation and reoxygenation events. Geochemical box modeling was used in this thesis to constrain fluxes needed to recreate carbonate carbon and carbonate-associated sulfate sulfur isotopic trends observed in datasets globally. This study lends further evidence for the expansion of marine reducing conditions playing a pivotal role as a kill mechanism for the LKE event and provides new insights on the extent of global ocean anoxia during the late Silurian.  </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between leadership styles and music therapy by examining perceptions of leadership styles among music therapy student and professional leaders within one of the seven regions of the American Music Therapy Association. This study also explored how leadership styles were viewed and implemented in the music therapy field. Data were analyzed for 13 participants, 12 professional board members and 1 student board member. Mental Health was the most frequently served population by the professional participants (21.21%). Democratic leadership was the personal leadership style chosen by the most participants (40.91%). Democratic leadership also was rated the most implemented every time these leaders have had to lead (23.08%) while affiliative leadership was most usually implemented by these participants (46.15%). In the role of a music therapist, the importance of these leadership styles did not vary much from the indicated general effectiveness of the styles. Democratic leadership was rated “extremely important” by 38.46% of respondents. Coaching leadership was rated “very important” by 38.46% of respondents. Six of the participants (46.15%) strongly agreed with the idea that a successful and effective music therapist should have some sort of leadership training or taken a leadership-specific class. Additionally, six participants (46.15%) agreed that a successful and effective music therapist should be aware of their leadership style and how it plays a role in their practice. From the data gathered, Democratic, coaching, and affiliative leadership were the most important, most implemented and most effective leadership styles in general settings and, specifically, music therapy.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Families are the building blocks of society and the first system that children are a part of. Varying in both structure and function, families serve to develop their members and create a collective identity. When the family system struggles, family therapy may be needed. Music therapy has been shown to improve communication skills, facilitate positive interactions, and express emotions. The most efficacious and widely practiced family therapy theory among Marriage and Family Therapists is Family Systems Theory, while research shows that most music therapists working with families practice within a Humanistic Theory. The purpose of this study was to create a research-based guide to educate and prepare music therapists to provide services to families within Family Systems Theory by giving recommendations through the elements of the music therapy standards of clinical practice. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This dissertation examines a series of cycles painted between 1760 and 1778 for the sanctuary of San Dionisio in Higüey, Hispaniola, which feature miracles performed by the Virgin of Altagracia, to identify intersections between Marian piety, artistic practice, race, and the development of Creole (island-born) origin stories during the long eighteenth century. Charged with strengthening ties between sanctuary, icon, and devotee in a rural enclave of the Spanish empire in the heart of the Caribbean, the cycles were part of a miracle-making industry that forged communities of faith, sacred landscapes, and geopolitical economies. Adopting an intertextual approach to read the medallions as an integral series, the study unpacks how the framing, context of display, and iconography helped produce collective memory. Thematic chapters engage Black presence and representation in Creole epistemologies, the role of the artist in the miracle-making industry, and placemaking in the New World through the Marian miracle narrative.   </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Hardbottom coral and sponge communities differ along portions of the WFS in species occurrence, diversity or size. However, specific differences and spatial distribution of these communities are not well understood. Community transitions have been proposed in the central portion of the WFS, around Tampa Bay, Cedar Keys and as far south as Charlotte Harbor, but supporting data are sparse. This project surveyed fifteen sites in 3 regions and found significant differences in benthic hardbottom communities north of Tampa Bay. Distinct communities were found between Franklin County, Hudson, FL and Tarpon Springs, FL. Coral and sponge densities were highest off of Tarpon Springs, FL followed by Franklin County on the Florida Panhandle and lowest off of Hudson, FL. Stony corals, Siderastrea radians, Cladocora arbuscula and Phyllangia americana, and gorgonian complexes, Muricea spp. and Plexauridae were the main drivers of differences between the regions. Several species of corals significantly varied in size between the three regions and generally, stony corals in this study were larger when compared to the same region four years ago. The overall communities had healthy corals with no disease and minimal bleaching. This research broadens the understanding of WFS hardbottom communities and their spatial distributions, though detailed surveys. Additional research on the hardbottom communities of the WFS is necessary to attain a comprehensive understanding of the coastal shelf and support long-term monitoring efforts.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This dissertation seeks to add substantial knowledge to the field of international political economy by introducing novel theoretical and empirical insights via the study of international sea routes. International sea routes represent the maritime pathways that cargo ships take as they move between different countries. In the modern globalized world, these sea routes represent critical components of the global economy. This dissertation takes an economic geography approach to study how proximity to these sea routes affects international trade and development as a dependent variable. This dissertation’s primary goal is to introduce how geospatial models can understand how sea routes generate the patterns and dependencies seen in studies of current trade flows.Recent work in international political economy has used network approaches to address the economic connections between states in ways beyond state-level or dyadic analysis. Literature has concluded that economic connections between countries consist of complicated patterns with many countries all linked together in different ways. Yet not enough work looks at what aspects of the global economy create these linkages. This dissertation asks how sea routes create important economic connections between countries. The economic connections created by sea routes directly impact a state’s ability to engage in the global economy. This dissertation expands current knowledge by providing a novel theoretical concept of sea routes as physical and observable connections between states. This dissertation provides the first theoretical and empirical analysis of sea routes in international political economics. In doing so, this dissertation adds to the growing literature on networks of economic linkages, and determinants of trade, to provide novel testable hypotheses.
These contributions lead to scientific foundations for studying essential policy considerations in the modern world. In 2021 alone, the importance of maritime policy has jumped to the forefront of policy debates with the jamming of the Suez Canal, the backlog of ships outside of LA port, and global supply chain delays. This dissertation offers the first look at how sea routes can contribute to international trade’s scientific and policy discussions.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation responds to the paucity of research that explicitly accounts for self-efficacy, defined as perceived confidence in one’s ability to reach a desired goal or outcome, within the context of online writing instruction. Although self-efficacy has attracted considerable interest in writing studies for more than three decades, this research has almost exclusively centered on traditional, face-to-face composition classes. This restricted focus poses a particular problem given the rising number of online composition courses, especially in the wake of the coronavirus, COVID-19. Therefore, this dissertation asks how students’ self-efficacy operates in an online writing course. Specifically, it examines the following questions through a multiple-case study of six students in a single section of an online writing course: 1) What domains, defined as integral to online writing instruction, emerge as focal to students’ self-efficacy beliefs in an online writing class? 2) How, when, and where do self-efficacy beliefs manifest within these focal domains? 3) What, if any, circumstances surrounding online writing instruction emerge as tangential to students’ self-efficacy beliefs in an online writing class? In what ways? 4) What, if any, constellated relationships emerge from integral domains and external circumstances? This study finds that, first, although each integral domain—writing, technology, instructor communication, and peer interactions—as well as one additional domain, online learning—emerged as focal to the six students’ self-efficacy, the degree of influence varied. Writing, by far, held the most influence. Second, some domains tend to lend themselves more readily to certain self-efficacy sources. For instance, instructor communication was most likely to provide opportunities for social persuasion. Third, while circumstances had the potential to impinge upon students’ efficacy expectations, the data suggest that they were not particularly salient. Finally, the constellated relationships that formed between and among domains and circumstances indicate that density of connections might correlate to students’ ability to stabilize and maintain their positive self-efficacy. Ultimately, the findings of this study inform theoretical understandings of both self-efficacy and online writing instruction, which, in turn, offers several potential implications for online composition pedagogy. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Zika virus (ZIKV) became a global health concern in 2016 due to its links to congenital microcephaly and other birth defects. ZIKV is part of the genus flavivirus, a class of positive(+)- sense single-stranded RNA viruses. Flavivirus infection results in a reorganization of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to form a viroplasm, a subcellular structure where viral RNA replicates and virus particles are assembled. The overall goal of this research project is to better understand how the ZIKV viroplasm forms and organizes.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Microtubules (MTs) and microtubule-organizing centers (MTOCs) coordinate structural and trafficking functions in the cell, and MTs also support the infection cycles of flaviviruses. In the first part (Chapter 2), we investigated the roles of MTs and the cell’s MTOCs on ZIKV viroplasm organization and virus production. We show that a toroidal-shaped viroplasm forms upon ZIKV infection, and MTs are organized at the viroplasm core and surrounding the viroplasm. We show that MTs are necessary for viroplasm organization and impact infectious virus production. In addition, the centrosome and the Golgi MTOC are closely associated with the viroplasm, and the centrosome coordinates the organization of the ZIKV viroplasm toroidal structure. Surprisingly, viroplasm formation and virus production are not significantly impaired when infected cells have no centrosomes and impaired Golgi MTOC, and we show that MTs are anchored to the viroplasm surface in these cells. We propose that the viroplasm is a site of MT organization, and the MTs organized at the viroplasm are sufficient for efficient virus production. Supplementary movies (Appendix A) for Chapter 2 are available through the online version of this dissertation published on ProQuest.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Viral proteins interact with host proteins to cause subcellular rearrangements during infection. In the second part (Chapter 3), we investigated how individual viral proteins contribute towards the formation and organization of the ZIKV viroplasm. We found that expression of NS3 alone was sufficient to form a structure that resembles the ZIKV viroplasm. NS3 has protease and helicase domains, and we further found expression of the NS3 helicase alone was sufficient to form a viroplasm-like structure. In addition, we found that the centrosome and the Golgi associate with this structure. Besides localization and formation of the viroplasm-like structure, NS3 associates with the centrosome and forms filamentous structures. We propose that NS3 may be playing a role in viroplasm organization during ZIKV infection.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The use of photochemistry in organic synthesis has enable chemists to build structural complexity into molecules that is either difficult or impossible to achieve using traditional thermal methods. Using light as a reagent is a desirable, cost-effective, and green tactic for constructing molecules, and is an attractive alternative to expensive catalysts or harsh reaction conditions. Over the years, our lab has developed several methods that exploit the synthetic utility of photochemistry in complex molecule synthesis.Chapter 1: The ophiobolins are naturally sesterterpenes that contain a 5-8-5 fused carbocyclic core. Many of these molecules have been shown to possess potent and interesting biological activities, making them attractive targets for synthetic organic chemists. There have been many synthetic efforts and approaches towards these natural products, however, only four total syntheses are reported to date. Ophiobolin A, the first isolated and reported ophiobolin, is especially of interest to both chemists and biochemists due to its potent anti-cancer activity. In recent studies, the primary biological mechanism of action for this sesterterpene was reported and has sparked an interest in the scientific community in synthesizing ophiobolin derivatives to gain better insight into their biological activities and structure-activity relationships.
Chapter 2: Our group has developed a method that utilizes a tandem diastereoselective photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition and Cope rearrangement to access complex, functionalized 5-8-5 fused ring systems. Rapid and modular access into this class of molecules can enable future efforts for synthetic endeavors into natural products containing this carbocyclic framework or biological structure-activity relationship studies. We further elaborated our method in efforts towards the synthesis of the ophiobolin pharmacophore.
Chapter 3: Indoles are a class of molecules that are commonly found in nature and in a variety of FDA approved drugs. The synthesis and reactivity of indoles has been extensively studied and reported in literature, however some indole scaffold that have been notoriously difficult to efficiently synthesize include 1H-indole-2-acetamides. Our lab has developed an efficient, modular route to access a variety of functionalized 1H-indole-2-acetamide derivatives. This method could prove useful for future biological studies as well as offer new synthetic utility for entry into structurally diverse indole targets.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Mental health concerns and resource utilization has greatly increased on college campuses in recent years (ACHA – NCHA, 2017, AUCCCD, 2012, Bourdon et al., 2018).  Campus counseling centers are concerned about their ability to meet the sheer volume of students with severe mental health concerns though (AUCCCD, 2012).  Drum and colleagues (2009) proposed that college campuses should expand their interventions to address the mental health needs for students across the distress continuum.  Sense of coherence (SOC), theorized by Aaron Antonovsky (1987), is a protective factor in which students will be better equiped to handle a variety of life stressors through internal and external coping strategies.  Previous research suggests that mindfulness training can increase SOC levels in diverse populations (Karlsson et al., 2000, Volanen et al., 2004).  The “Take a Breath” study assessed if the online mindfulness intervention, “Headspace,” can impact college students’ SOC levels, perceived stress, mindfulness skills, and help-seeking intentions.  Results indicate that the mindfulness skills and SOC levels influence perceived stress and help-seeking intentions.  However, the “Headspace” intervention did not significantly impact the dependent variables in comparison to the control group.  The COVID-19 pandemic occurred during data collectino and emphasized the importance of protective factors and mentalh health resource accessibility.  Although the results did not indicate “Headspace” to have a significant influence on the variables of interest, college campuses should continue to research accessible mental health resources for students at all levels of distress in light of the recent pandemic. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Zika virus (ZIKV) is a re-emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus that has been linked to severe neurological disorders such as microcephaly in newborns as well as Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults. It is closely related to other flaviviruses such as Dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus and Yellow Fever virus with high similarities in structure and genomic organization. However, the tissue tropism after systematic infection and the clinical outcomes varies significantly between each species. Among its family members, ZIKV is distinct regarding its ability to infiltrate multiple immune-privileged sites, especially the brain, as well as its neurotropic nature to cause neurological defects in the central nervous system (CNS). However, the detailed molecular mechanism(s) by which it gains access to the brain and impairs development and function are not yet fully elucidated.To first understand how ZIKV access the brain, which is typically protected by blood-brain barrier (BBB), we utilized induced human brain microvascular endothelial cells (iBMECs) derived from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) to study virus-BBB interactions. These iBMECs exhibited functional and physiological BBB properties and faithfully recapitulated the in vivo neuroinvasiveness of both alpha- and flavi- viruses. We further developed a BBB model consisting of cocultured iBMECs and astrocytes in transwell setups. This model exhibited high trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) value and selectively blocked non-neurotropic flaviviruses from crossing the barrier. Gene profiling identified that iBMECs constitutively express an interferon-stimulated gene, IFITM1, which contributes to the selective restriction of non-neurotropic flaviviruses. We further investigated the interactions between ZIKV and other physiological barriers including blood-testis barrier (BTB) and blood-retinal barrier (BRB). Barrier cells from BTB and BRB also intrinsically expressed IFITM proteins that contribute to their viral resistance. We discovered that the membrane localization of IFITM1 as well as the structure of DENV prM-E region both contribute to the selective restriction of DENV. Our application of this renewable human iPSC-based model for studying virus-BBB interactions revealed dual mechanism for human physiological barriers to restrict viral infection and highlights the ability of ZIKV to specifically bypass this restriction as a mechanism for it to gain access to these immune-privileged sites.
We next focused on understanding ZIKV pathogenesis in brain after breaching the BBB. Astrocytes are the major cell population in the brain and one of the first cell types to be targeted by virus infection. While extensive studies have examined the role of ZIKV infection in human neural progenitor cells, the role of astrocytes has yet to be fully examined. Here, we utilized iPSC-derived astrocytes and neurons to study ZIKV infection in CNS. Both stem cell-derived and primary astrocytes were highly permissive to ZIKV infection and support production of infectious ZIKV virions. Increased caspase-3 activity and decreased ATPase content were observed in ZIKV-infected astrocytes, suggesting ZIKV infection significantly induced cell death in astrocytes. Global transcriptome analysis revealed that ZIKV triggered antiviral response as well as cytokines/chemokines production in infected astrocytes. Specifically, we identified two important cytokines involved in synaptic maintenance and neurogenesis, IL-6 and CXCL10, in supernatants of ZIKV-infected astrocytes. Treating the iPSC-derived neurons with conditioned medium from ZIKV-infected astrocytes drastically decreased the synaptic density of mature neurons, and this reduction was rescued by supplementary treatment of anti-IL6 antibody. These discoveries revealed the non-cell autonomous effect of ZIKV-infected astrocytes on neuronal survival and synaptogenesis that can be a contributive mechanism for ZIKV pathogenesis in CNS.
Collectively, by using iPSC-derived iBMECs, astrocytes and neurons, we were able to effectively model virus infection in these physiologically relevant cell types. We identified two mechanisms, applied either by the host cells or the viruses, that donate to ZIKV pathogenesis. Our study highlights ZIKV’s ability to bypass the cell-autonomous antiviral immunity conferred by the physiological blood-tissue barriers and disrupt neuronal synaptic formation in a non-cell autonomous manner conferred by infected astrocytes.

            <DISS_para>While protein has been extensively studied in older adults, not as much is known about the relationship of amino acids and functional health outcomes in this population. This cross-sectional study characterized usual intakes of total and individual amino acids and determined associations between usual intakes and body composition, muscle strength, and physical function in U.S. adults 65 y and older utilizing the NHANES dataset from 2001-2018. Usual intakes of each essential amino acid (EAA) were above the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) for all deciles in both males and females over the age of 65 y. Absolute (g/d) and relative (mg/kg ideal body weight/d) EAA, leucine, lysine, and sulfur-containing amino acid (SAA) intakes were not associated with body composition measures of appendicular lean mass, whole body fat mass, BMI, and waist circumference in males for the fully adjusted model. Absolute lysine intakes were positively associated with BMI (linear trends only; 3.0 ± 0.7, P &lt; 0.0001) and waist circumference (linear trends only, 7.0 ± 1.7, P = 0.0001) in females. Absolute intakes of EAA were also positively associated with waist circumference in females (linear trends only, 2.1 ± 0.6, P = 0.0007). Relative intakes of EAA, leucine, and lysine were positively associated with BMI (linear trends only, 0.1 ± 0.02, P &lt; 0.0001; linear trends only, 0.3 ± 0.1, P = 0.0004; 0.4 ± 0.1 per decile, P &lt; 0.0001, respectively) and waist circumference (linear trends only, 0.2 ± 0.01, P &lt; 0.0001; linear trends only, 0.8 ± 0.2, P &lt; 0.0001; 0.1 ± 0.2 per decile, P &lt; 0.0001, respectively) in females. Relative intakes of lysine were also positively associated with whole body fat mass (linear trends only, 0.2 ± 0.1, P = 0.0006) in females. Absolute and relative EAA, leucine, lysine, and SAA intakes were not associated with muscle strength measures of combined grip strength in both males and females. Self-reported physical function measures (difficulties of walking up 10 steps without resting, walking for a quarter mile, standing up from an armless chair, pulling or pulling large objects and lifting or carrying something as heavy as 10 pounds) were not associated with absolute or relative amino acid intakes in older men or women except for difficulty of pushing or pulling large objects which was negatively associated with absolute EAA, leucine, and SAA intakes in older men (-0.9 ± 0.27, P = 0.0010; -0.2 ± 0.05, P = 0.0007; -0.1 ± 0.02, P = 0.0003, respectively). Overall, individual usual amino acid intakes were above the EAR for U.S. older adults. There does not appear to be a relationship between amino acid intake and body composition in older men. Amino acid intake may be positively associated with BMI and waist circumference in older women. There is no relationship between amino acid intake and muscle strength in older men and women. There is no relationship between amino acid intake and self-reported physical function in older women. The self-reported physical function of pulling or pulling large objects may be negatively associated with amino acid intake in older men. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of mortality in United States (US) [1], and the inevitable process of aging, or one’s age, remains the primary unmodifiable risk factor and independent predictor of CVD events across the lifespan [2]. With aging comes a progressive deterioration in vascular health, characterized by arterial stiffening and endothelial dysfunction (ED) [3-5]. Furthermore, oxidative stress, marked by an accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), increases with age and is a prominent feature of vascular disease [6]. These vascular changes, in addition to other age-related declines in strength and cognition, all contribute to reduced functionality in many older adults. While popular dietary interventions have been applauded for their benefits upon cardiovascular health [7, 8], there is emerging evidence that suggests creatine supplementation may also serve as a therapeutic supplement [9]. Although well known for its metabolic properties, recent research has exposed a much broader application for creatine in clinical populations, acting as an antioxidant, energy shuttle and neuroprotective compound [10-12]. Despite these benefits however, there is scarce information on the application of creatine for vascular health and functional capacity in older adults. PURPOSE: Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of 4 weeks of creatine monohydrate supplementation, as compared to placebo, on vascular endothelial function, blood flow, oxidative stress, and functional capacity in older adults. Methods: Twelve, healthy older adults (M = 6, W = 6, age: 58 ± 3 years, BMI: 26 ± 6) participated in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. Eligible participants completed 4 official study visits: Pre-Testing 1, Post-Test 1, Pre-Testing 2, Post-Test 2. At every study visit participants were fasted and completed anthropometric assessments (height, weight, BMI), body composition [dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA)], and venous blood draw. Participants then completed assessments of vascular function [flow mediated dilation (FMD%), brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), pulse wave analysis (PWA), near-infrared microvascular reperfusion (NIRS MOXY)], cognitive function [forward digit span test (FDS), backward digit span test (BDS), trail making test part A (TMT-A) and B (TMT-B)], and physical function [6-minute walking test (6MWT), BioDex assessment of isometric muscle strength and endurance]. Once all Pre-Testing assessments were complete, participants were randomized to receive one of two blinded supplements: placebo (maltodextrin) or creatine monohydrate. Participants were asked to consume supplements for the following 4 weeks (4 x 5 g/day for 5 days, followed by 1 x 5g for 23 days). Following supplementation, participants returned for Post-Testing. During this visit, all procedures from the Pre-Testing Visit were repeated. Participants were then asked to return to their normal daily lifestyles for a 4-week “wash-out” period. After the washout, participants returned for their second Pre-Testing visit. Following this, participants were given their remaining supplement. Following the final supplementation, participants returned to the lab to complete their final Post-Test visit. Results: After creatine supplementation there was a significant improvement in FMD% (Pre: 7.68 ± 2.25 %, Post: 8.9 ± 1.99 %; p &lt; .005), absolute change in diameter (Pre: 0.33 ± 0.12 mm, Post: 0.38 ± 0.12 mm; p &lt; .05), normalized FMD% (Pre: 2.57E-04 ± 1.03E-04 %/SSAUC, Post: 3.42E-04 ± 1.69E-04 %/SSAUC; p &lt; .05), and microvascular reperfusion (Pre: 2.29 ± 1.42 %/sec, Post: 3.71 ± 1.44 %/sec; p &lt; .05); however, there were no significant changes in baPWV or PWA compared to placebo. There were no significant interactions found for any of the blood biomarkers; however, there was a significant effect of time for oxLDL (p &lt; .05), and a trending toward significant effect of treatment for MDA (p = 0.055). There were significant improvements seen in both FDS (Pre: 7.08 ± 0.99, Post: 7.83 ± 1.27; p &lt; .05) and BDS (Pre: 4.83 ± 1.64, Post: 5.83 ± 1.27; p &lt; .05) following creatine, but no significant changes in TMT-A or TMT-B following either creatine or placebo. There were also no significant changes in 6MWT distance covered or isometric muscle strength; however, isometric muscle endurance, as indicated by total torque produced per set, improved for Set 1 (Pre: 2046.03 ± 823.78 Nm, Post: 2341.92 ± 896.02 Nm, p &lt; .001), Set 2 (Pre: 1753.3 ± 484.26 Nm, Post: 1892.78 ± 583.18 Nm, p &lt; .05), and Set 3 (Pre: 1642.35 ± 463.76 Nm, Post: 1745.7 ± 522.5 Nm, p &lt; .05) following creatine, but not placebo. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that 4 weeks of creatine supplementation, but not placebo, improves endothelial function and microvascular reactivity in older adults; however, there was no benefit for arterial stiffness. Creatine supplementation, in comparison to placebo, can also improve markers of short-term memory and isokinetic muscle endurance, but neither creatine or placebo  improved visuospatial awareness or isokinetic muscle strength. However, findings indicate that these improvements were not mediated by any creatine-dependent antioxidant effects. Further research is warranted to determine the mechanism in which creatine elicits these reported vascular benefits in older adults. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>ABSTRACTReligious communities find unity in a shared tradition, system of beliefs, and a determination to respond to those beliefs through active ethical engagement in the world. While these shared beliefs, often founded on sacred texts and nurtured through religious leadership and doctrine, have an important role in forming communal identity, lack of coherence between that shared language and how it is manifested in communal action can create instability. At the same time, intentional maintenance and development of such narratives in response to changing events, culture, contexts, or systems of oppression, can strengthen coherence and lead to a greater sense of purpose and understanding in the pursuit of faithful and moral lives. This dissertation examines two such narratives and why they were so effective in not only forming and maintaining communal identity, but also in initiating ethical responses that fostered impactful change. Both are examples of pastoral leadership in the Protestant tradition. Both rely heavily on themes of social engagement emphasized in the Reformed heritage. Yet, in their narratives of resistance, they advocated radically different means for change and operated in historical contexts a century and a continent apart. Henry Highland Garnet was a New York Presbyterian minister and black abolitionist leader, whose message of black empowerment and action in response to slavery encouraged armed resistance. Christian Führer was a Protestant minister in Leipzig, East Germany, who led a nonviolent protest movement that contributed to the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. This dissertation asserts that analysis of the complex interplay between hegemonic, legal, and resistance narratives helps to explain why one found success in advocating violence, while the other found unity in nonviolence, resulting in impactful change for both.
	Establishing narrative links between communal identity and ethical response requires taking into account other currents of influence, such as narratives of law and tradition. In so doing, it prescribes a narrative hermeneutic and ethical approach that imagines a living tradition that seeks to be grounded in sacred texts and traditions while also being subject to ceaseless interpretive conversation, attuning itself to the best insights of various theological traditions and the full wealth of nontheological interlocutors. This method, analysis, and the conclusions it offers seeks to add to the field of ethics by incorporating important layers of analysis to narrative comparative religious ethics, including law, race and gender studies, and human rights. Beyond the method itself, it shows how the maintenance of narrative coherence results in communal solidarity and singularity of purpose, it explains why some religious communities have disintegrated or faded into irrelevance at various times in their histories, and it can help us understand contemporary struggles related to the fields of human rights, racial strife, gender bias, and economic oppression. Finally, by illuminating the constant interplay of narrative worlds within structures of power, privilege, and repression, this project will make normative claims about the conditional nature of law and justice, and the necessity of negotiating particularistic concerns without relying exclusively on “rights-based” adjudication.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The winding number has proven to be a very simple and robust approach for inside-outside segmentation that can be applied both in the 2D and 3D realms for multiple purposes, including mesh cleaning, CAD design, 3D printing, among others. However, the error introduced by the floating point representation can lead to misclassification of points, what can in turn lead to further errors in the computation. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The potential scenarios for which the winding number could lead to misclassification are identified in this research both for 2D and 3D, and these faulty scenarios are explored by performing a series of experiments. These scenarios can be very particular or rare, but in which misclassification can lead to the wrong segmentation of a space subdivision. In addition, a solution to address these issues is proposed by implementing a more robust version of the 2D winding number using rational arithmetic and a slightly more robust version of the 3D winding number by using multi-precision representation instead of floating point.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This research also introduces a novel approach for inside-outside segmentation based on least squares that not only addresses the floating point misclassification issue in 3D, but also does it at a fast speed and with exceptional results, making it a great choice for mesh reconstruction and for extracting closed watertight meshes.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Emotional and behavioral related disorders are prevalent in both special education and mental health fields. Music therapists have been working with children and adolescents labeled as emotionally disturbed since before the Journal of Music Therapy (JMT) began in 1964. The purpose of this research was to gain an understanding of how music therapy has been used with children labeled as emotionally disturbed from 1964 through 2020, how it has changed over time, and the prevalence of the label versus other labels or diagnoses dependent on setting. A content analysis was conducted to identify all instances of the emotional disturbance label when applied to children and adolescents 21 and younger as the main subject of articles published in JMT from 1964 to 2020. Other articles matching criteria for emotional disturbance, but not using the label were identified and included separately from the study. 18 articles met inclusion criteria and 10 were excluded due to alternative labeling. 44% of the articles were from the 1970s prior to the distinction of many modern and separate diagnoses in research. Only 33% of articles included diagnoses or descriptors to indicate diagnoses more specific than emotional disturbance. Despite its continued use by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), emotional disturbance is appearing less in the JMT research literature while other labels have become more prominent and used in its place. This is likely due to the prominence of alternative labels for emotional disturbance and the rise in providing specific diagnoses in research. As a field, consistent labeling and specificity is needed in order to track the research being done on individuals with varying disorders and to make transfer of knowledge between the mental health and special education fields more accessible.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>ABSTRACTProfessional wrestling has been a special interest component of human culture since the early 20th century. A mesh between sport and theatre, it presents a unique combination of production elements to consumers. French theorist Roland Barthes wrote about such in his 1957 text Mythologies when he attended professional wrestling in Paris and coined the elements of professional wrestling in unison as what he called ‘the spectacle of excess’. What Barthes (1957) presented were socially constructed components of French bourgeoisie society that Barthes labeled as ‘myths’, popularized components of their society that prescribed acceptable behaviors and justifications for those behaviors, without necessary criticism of such. In line with the thematic of Mythologies, Barthes (1957) presents professional wrestling as a sensationalistic version of society, with societal themes guiding its production. Barthes observed themes such as the audience cheering the professional wrestler portrayed as the ‘good guy’ and hoping that the ‘bad guy’ is brought to justice. Barthes (1957) highlighted that professional wrestling’s production in France was not intended to invoke the response that a traditional combat sport like boxing would, but rather to present a theater like experience that evoked the emotion of audiences. The production of the spectacle of excess as seen by Barthes (1957) was one of rigid consistency and role. Wrestlers who portrayed the good would always portray the good, those who portrayed the bad would always portray the bad, such roles were often defined by the physical appearance of the wrestler, and the audience would never delineate their support from the ‘good’ to the ‘bad’, for that would demonstrate a deviation from the acceptable. 
Since its publication, Barthes (1957) chapter has been, and rightfully so, considered a seminal text in scholarly endeavors into professional wrestling. The ‘spectacle of excess’ has been popularized by scholars, journalists, historians, and in other literary disciplines as a calling card phrase to describe what professional wrestling ‘is’. Some have engaged with Barthes’ spectacle of excess and applied its components to professional wrestling events they observed, or to professional wrestlers of today (Webley, 1986; Rickard, 1999; Hainey, 2017). Yet, there remains a gap in the literature on reimagining how professional wrestling’s contemporary production has evolved or differs from the era of wrestling Barthes (1957) observed, specifically in the United States, a place that Barthes (1957) notes has different thematic elements such as politics than its French counterpart. In an interconnected world, with advents such as the internet, the modern-day professional wrestling consumer knows more about the sport than ever before (Toepfer, 2006; McBride and Bird, 2007; Wrenn, 2007; Koh, 2009). No longer is the professional wrestling consumer only concerned with what is immediately presented to them at the wrestling show as Barthes (1957) alludes, but rather is invested in understanding not just what is happening in the wrestling ring, but behind the curtains, and why (McBride and Bird, 2007). Professional wrestling consumers of today engage in conversation about the sport and offer immediate feedback, criticism, and opinions on virtually all aspects of the professional wrestling industry on the internet through social media outlets, message boards, and blogs within what is known as the Internet Wrestling Community (IWC). The IWC has emerged as a conversation line between professional wrestling consumers and professional wrestling producers such as companies and wrestlers themselves. Within IWC spaces, these parties engage in a two-way communication channel about professional wrestling producing narratives that could not have been envisioned during the time of Barthes (1957). 
In this study I utilized narrative analysis to observe and examine digital narratives of the production of contemporary professional wrestling through the digital social media and message board platform Reddit. Through doing so I demonstrate a reimagined version of Barthes’ (1957) spectacle of excess by analyzing the two-way communication between producer and consumers and how this communication has potentially altered the thematic elements and production of professional wrestling. The two-way communication on the production of professional wrestling was inserted into du Gay, Hall, Janes, Mackay, and Negus’ (1997) circuit of culture as means for visualizing its process. The potential implications and contributions of this study are insights into a unique sporting platform whose predetermined and produced nature offers potential for consumer influence on the production unlike any other domain of sport.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Carbon nanotubes (CNT) have shown very attractive mechanical properties, compared to current high-performance carbon fiber reinforcements. Recently, continuous CNT yarns (CNTy) have become commercially available and are becoming a promising choice as a reinforcement for composite applications. However, a fiber or yarn is only one piece of a puzzle that must work together in composite materials which is comprised of three key components – reinforcement, matrix, and the interface the reinforcement and matrix share. As such, CNTy materials must be proven to be effective not only as an individual constituent but its relationships with the matrix must be well characterized and understood. In this study, commercially available continuous CNTy and two modified versions with different their morphologies and mechanical performance were characterized. Results indicate that the neat CNTy variants could achieve specific strength of ~ 0.9 N tex-1. When the mechanical results were fit to statistical distributions, 2-parameter Weibull distribution can fit with a nearly 99% goodness-of-it. This indicates that a noticeable brittle failure mechanism to blame the large defects or voids existed in the CNTy materials.  With the efforts to improve CNT packing and reduce large voids through high pressure compaction, we observed the specific tensile strength degradation from 0.838 to 0.337 N tex-1 suggesting that degree of alignment was the governing factor for mechanical integrity.  Upon addressing the reinforcement properties, the interface was investigated. The commercially available continuous CNTy was modified using heat treatments and acid functionalization. The two treated CNTy and untreated CNTy were analyzed using dynamic contact angle tensiometry and Raman spectroscopy analysis. Two aerospace-grade resin systems were tested alongside to determine their surface tension polar and dispersive components. Together this information provides guidance for how to select CNTy/resin compatibility to maximize composite strength. Lastly, unlike carbon fiber, CNTy do not have a monolithic microstructure, so introducing resin between the CNTy bundles within the yarns aims maximize in-situ interaction subsequently improving mechanical performance. To investigate this effect, CNTy yarn microcomposites were fabricated, and a mechanical study like that of the neat CNTy was conducted. The results show that the combination of SCY/977-3 resin achieve the best mechanical properties over all tested combinations. These results conjointly agree with both the initial neat CNTy mechanical results and the CNTy/resin interface work. Jointly, this work provides a fundamental study of the CNTy materials and reveals great promise that CNTy potentially for reinforcement applications.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>My dissertation “Moral Rhetoric, Affective Polarization, and Direct Democracy” contributes to an emergent literature on the effects of affective polarization on political behavior by highlighting the role that moral rhetoric plays in political communication.  Within my focus on affective polarization, I address two primary questions: why do political elites decide to use moral rhetoric and how do average citizens respond to moral rhetoric? First, drawing from the morality politics literature on emotional activation and the party identification literature on partisanship as a social identity, I argue that at the elite-level, moral rhetoric is used as a strategic means of voter mobilization. Secondly, drawing from the affective polarization work on the role of values and perceptions, I argue that at the individual-level, exposure to moral rhetoric increases feelings of affective polarization in average citizens. 	I evaluate my first argument using campaign advertisement data from the 2004 and 2008 gubernatorial and U.S. federal congressional elections. In contrast to my theoretical expectations, I present evidence that there is not an apparent relationship in my data between electoral competitiveness and the use of moral language in candidates’ campaign advertisements. Consistent with my expectations, however, I also present evidence that Republican House candidates, particularly those in Southern states, are more likely to use moral rhetoric in their communications to voters. 
	I evaluate my second argument using an original survey experiment. I present evidence that exposure to moral rhetoric increases respondents reported absolute difference in feeling thermometer ratings for the two parties, indicating greater affective polarization. I additionally present evidence that the effect of exposure to moral rhetoric on feeling thermometer ratings is conditional on individuals’ strength of partisanship: for respondents with the strongest levels of partisan attachment, assignment to a moral language condition increased their absolute difference in feeling thermometer ratings by 15-points on a 100-point scale. 
	In addition to my work on moral rhetoric and affective polarization, I am also interested in state politics. My dissertation additionally contributes to the robust direct democracy literature by highlighting the role that federal factors play in influencing the actions of state policy advocates. The third question that I address asks how partisan control of state and national governments is related to patterns of direct democracy use within the states. My main argument is that policy advocates respond to partisan control of the various levels of government, such that liberal proposals are more likely to appear on the ballot under periods of Republican control, and conservative proposals more likely under periods of Democratic control. 
	I evaluate my third argument empirically using state-level data on direct democracy proposals that qualified for ballots between 2010-2020. I present evidence that partisan control of state government is associated with the introduction of both liberal and conservative ballot proposals. I additionally present evidence that, consistent with my expectations, there is a positive relationship between national Democratic control and the introduction of conservative proposals on state ballots. 
	The results of my dissertation have produced important insights into the broader implications and consequences of the use of moral rhetoric in political communication and campaigns. My research can move the field of state politics toward resolution of unsettled theoretical debates concerning the impacts of direct democracy on citizen representation by describing when direct democracy may be expected to lead the introduction of liberal and conservative policies. Finally, from a prescriptive standpoint, my work reinforces the need to include federal level variables in future analyses of state policymaking.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this dissertation, liquid chromatography and solid phase extraction – mass spectrometry (LC and SPE-MS) techniques are applied for rapid quantitation of four glucose-regulating hormones secreted from human islets of Langerhans. The four species monitored throughout are the peptide hormones of somatostatin, C-peptide, insulin, and glucagon. All four hormones have well-documented roles in islet biology which make them optimal targets for analysis. LC and SPE-MS offers a powerful quantitative methodology capable of simultaneous, multiplexed measurements of islet-secreted species in response to glucose stimulation. LC and SPE steps are necessary for clean-up of raw biological samples prior to MS analysis but are time-consuming. This limitation reduces LC and SPE-MS applicability for experiments monitoring the dynamic changes in biological systems. Integration of rapid LC or SPE steps using higher flow rates, gradient separations, or short columns enable faster measurement times. Detection sensitivity is often affected by the decreased analysis time but triple quadrupole MS instrumentation operating in multiple reaction monitoring mode has been shown to match immunoassay sensitivity at higher flow rates.  Rapid separation steps and MRM MS were therefore employed in our attempts to develop a fully automated, online LC or SPE-MS assay capable of multiplexed detection of glucose-regulating hormones secreted from islets of Langerhans. 
The second chapter of the dissertation describes the development of an LC-MS method capable of quantitation of somatostatin, C – peptide, insulin, and glucagon secretion from human islet populations. For rapid analysis, a 5 min separation was achieved with a 2.1 × 30 mm (i.d. x length) C18 column with 2.7 μm diameter core shell particles. A sacrificial protein hydrolysate was used with the sample. The hydrolysate was found to improve signal magnitude, repeatability, and to reduce carryover between runs. At optimized gradient conditions, the gradient run time was 4.55 min which produced an average peak width of 0.3 min, a minimum resolution of 1.2, and a peak capacity of 20. As a proof of concept, the method was used to measure secretions from static incubations of human islets. Insulin and C-peptide were quantified and matched well with literature values, but somatostatin and glucagon responses were not quantifiable, as they were secreted in lower amounts and fell below the calibrated range. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The third chapter of the dissertation features the integration of a microfluidic device as well as the switch from LC-MS to SPE-MS. Microfluidic devices enable improved analysis of glucose-regulating hormones due to improved recovery and minimal analyte dilution. SPE was chosen to further increase the speed of analysis.  Analysis was performed with a 1 x 8 mm (I.D. x length) SPE cartridge that contained C8 stationary phase particles with a 5 µL bed for analyte extraction. Method development with SPE was performed by means of response surface methodology (RSM) to identify a set of optimal load and elution conditions capable of enhanced responses for each of the analytes and internal standards in solution. Analysis of SPE-MS sensitivity did not match limits of the LC-MS method for all peptides (0.5 nM for LC, 0.5 nM for C-peptide and somatostatin on SPE, 2 nM for insulin and glucagon) but was still expected to encompass the concentration of peptides in secreted fractions. Dynamic glucose incubation of 30-35 islets was done with the microfluidic device and fractions were collected for SPE-MS analysis. Insulin was matched well with literature reported values for 1 of the batches analyzed. C-peptide and glucagon responded to the glucose stimulants outside of the quantifiable range. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The fourth chapter describes the integration and automation of the SPE-MS assay into an online microfluidic system. The system uses a 10-port HPLC valve to house multiple sample loops which will decrease sample loss to waste during fraction collection. Experiments performed with standards to evaluate the reproducibility of subsequent injections using the system as well as an evaluation of system dynamics are shown in this chapter. These experiments confirmed system capabilities to produce precise responses and respond to a stimulus change faster than was shown when the device was used offline. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Type II diabetes is a leading cause of death in the United States due to its high prevalence in adults with high blood pressure, obesity, other health problems. It affects ~10.5% of the U.S population, and this number continues to increase every year (projected to reach over 30% by 2025). Diabetes affects blood sugar regulation due to dysfunction in release patterns for insulin and glucagon. Currently, medication exists to help manage insulin concentrations in the body; however, no “cure” exists and much remains unknown regarding how processes go awry in a diabetic state. Specifically, a healthy human body releases insulin and glucagon in an oscillatory patten into the bloodstream in response to meals and periods of fasting to control blood glucose levels. However, in people with diabetes, the release of these hormones is disrupted, which can lead to a variety of symptoms and risk factors including seizers and death. The first steps in developing better therapeutics for people with diabetes is understanding the complex hormone release pattens in healthy human bodies as well as characterizing the disrupted release pattens in people with diabetes. 	Microfluidic devices have been introduced to characterize small concentrations of analytes (e.g., hormones) in liquid due to their ability to employ low-volume flow rates in highly controlled environments. Additionally, microfluidics can be coupled with highly sensitive immunoassay-based optical measurement systems to detect low concentrations of diabetes-related hormones such as insulin and glucagon. Microfluidics presents an unparalleled strength for understanding cellular function and communication because it allows determination of concentration changes for insulin and glucagon over very short time periods (e.g., 2-5 minutes), which gives insight into real-time hormone release within the body. The work described herein employs microfluidics coupled to various other analytical techniques to study glucagon and insulin release from healthy human pancreatic cells and provide increased understanding regarding their release pattens. 
	Chapter 1 presents an introduction to the physiology and function of pancreatic cells in the human body and explains how immunoassay techniques are employed for characterization of pancreatic hormones. Chapter 2 introduces a novel microfluidic system to study glucagon secretion from human pancreatic cells using a Forster-resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based assay, which provides temporal resolution for glucagon release traces from ~30 islets. Finally, Chapter 3 builds upon the previous chapter and provides a method to simultaneously detect insulin and glucagon released from pancreatic cells in real time to characterize the release relationship of the two hormones.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Despite years of attempted mathematics education reform, there is little evidence that prospective teachers entering the profession are significantly better positioned than their in-service peers to implement reform-based mathematics instruction. This study investigated the experiences and beliefs of prospective elementary and secondary teachers regarding mathematics, mathematics instruction, and future teaching practice to identify how their experiences and beliefs informed their overall instructional approaches and their readiness to implement current standards for reform-based mathematics instruction. Using a mixed-methods approach consisting of online survey responses and personal interviews (QUANT -&gt; Qual), I sought to answer the following research questions (RQ):(RQ1)	How familiar are prospective elementary and secondary teachers with current reform-based mathematics standards—the Mathematics Florida Standards (MAFS) and the Standards for Mathematical Practice?
(RQ2)	What type of mathematics instruction and mathematical epistemic beliefs do prospective teachers have, and what relationships do these beliefs have with each other across the different majors?
(RQ3)	What role do prior experiences, their teacher preparation, and beliefs play in prospective teachers’ understandings of reform-based mathematics standards and in their overall instructional approach?
Participants were 244 undergraduate students who indicated their plans to become school teachers after graduation and who were enrolled at a top public research university in Florida as either an elementary education major or a secondary double-major in mathematics and secondary education. As part of the study, a subset of students (n = 14) and their instructors (n = 5) were also interviewed. Findings showed that most prospective teachers did not have a thorough knowledge of reform-based mathematics standards in Florida. Additionally, there were no clear relationships between mathematics instruction and mathematical epistemic beliefs in elementary majors, whereas some moderate relationships between these beliefs were found in secondary double-majors. 
Follow-up interviews revealed that most prospective teachers came from a more traditional mathematics instruction background. In addition, although most prospective elementary and secondary teachers seemed to favor reform-based mathematics instruction beliefs and dynamic mathematical epistemic beliefs, variations of beliefs within each major were not uncommon. Finally, prospective teachers’ instructional approaches also varied, with some seemingly more prepared to teach reform-based mathematics standards in a manner congruous with the goals of reform-based mathematics instruction than others. Implications for future research on mathematics teacher education and the implementation of reform-based instructional policies are also discussed.

            <DISS_para>A pesar de años de intentos de reforma de la educación matemática, hay poca evidencia de que los futuros maestros que ingresan a la profesión estén significativamente mejor posicionados que sus compañeros en servicio para implementar la instrucción matemática reformada. Este estudio investigó las experiencias y creencias de los futuros maestros de primaria y secundaria con respecto a las matemáticas, la instrucción matemática, y la práctica docente futura para identificar cómo sus experiencias y creencias informaron sus enfoques generales de instrucción y su disposición para implementar los estándares actuales para la instrucción matemática reformada. Utilizando un enfoque de métodos mixtos que consiste en respuestas a encuestas en línea y entrevistas personales (QUANT -&gt; Qual), busqué responder las siguientes preguntas de investigación:</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>(1) ¿Qué tan familiarizados están los futuros maestros de primaria y secundaria con los estándares actuales de matemática reformada: los Estándares de Matemáticas de Florida (Mathematics Florida Standards) y los Estándares para la Práctica Matemática (Standards for Mathematical Practice)?</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>(2) ¿Qué tipo de instrucción matemática y creencias epistémicas matemáticas tienen los futuros maestros y qué relaciones tienen estas creencias entre sí en las diferentes especialidades?</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>(3) ¿Qué papel juegan las experiencias previas, la preparación docente, y las creencias de los futuros maestros en la comprensión de los estándares de matemática reformada y en su enfoque de instrucción general?</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Los participantes fueron 244 estudiantes de pregrado que indicaron sus planes de convertirse en maestros de escuela después de graduarse y que se inscribieron en una de las principales universidades públicas de investigación en Florida como una especialización en educación primaria o una doble especialización en matemáticas y educación secundaria. Como parte del estudio, también se entrevistó a un subconjunto de estudiantes (n = 14) y sus instructores (n = 5). Los hallazgos mostraron que la mayoría de los futuros maestros no tenían un conocimiento profundo de los estándares de matemática reformada en Florida. Además, no hubo relaciones claras entre la instrucción matemática y las creencias epistémicas matemáticas en estudiantes especializandose en educación primaria, mientras que se encontraron algunas relaciones moderadas entre estas creencias en estudiantes con una doble especialización en matemáticas y educación secundaria.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Las entrevistas de seguimiento revelaron que la mayoría de los futuros maestros recibieron una formación matemática más tradicional. Además, aunque la mayoría de los futuros profesores de primaria y secundaria parecían favorecer las creencias de instrucción matemática basadas en reformas y las creencias epistémicas matemáticas dinámicas, las variaciones de creencias dentro de cada especialidad no eran infrecuentes. Por último, los enfoques de instrucción de los futuros maestros también variaron, y algunos aparentemente estaban más preparados para enseñar estándares de matemática reformada de una manera congruente con los objetivos de la instrucción matemática reformada que otros. También se discuten las implicaciones para la investigación futura sobre la formación de maestros de matemáticas y la implementación de políticas de instrucción basadas en reformas.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Understanding how avian species richness relates to habitat structure, plant species richness, and seasonality is essential to improving management and conservation goals for declining bird species. During their annual cycle, birds migrate, breed, and overwinter in different habitats across different geographic locations. Therefore, identifying patterns of seasonal habitat associations at a local scale is essential to improving our current understanding of the annual avian cycle and migratory connectivity. This study investigates how avian habitat associations vary during the annual cycle by addressing two questions: (1) How does avian species richness vary between the edges and interiors of mesic flatwoods during fall, winter, and spring? (2) How does avian species richness relate to plant species richness on the edge and interior of mesic flatwoods during fall, winter, and spring? To assess these relationships, I surveyed 28 stands that included both mesic flatwood edges and forest interiors in the Apalachicola National Forest of North Florida. Vegetation surveys detected 17 plant species from 8 families of woody understory plants. Between October 2020 and May 2021, birds were surveyed once per season for three seasons. Surveys at these same stands detected 938 individuals, 567 detected in the edge habitat, and 371 detected in the interior habitat. Detections included individuals of 45 species from 17 avian families. Poisson distributed generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) revealed that avian species richness was lower in the interior forests of mesic flatwoods, especially during winter. Furthermore, the relationship between avian species richness and plant species richness differed across seasons. During the fall, avian species richness correlated positively with plant species richness. During the fall, avian species richness correlated positively with plant species richness, but this was not the case during winter and spring. These results suggest that both habitat structure and plant species richness play a role in avian species richness; however, seasonal influences may be more influential in habitat selection since the needs of birds are specific to the periods of their annual cycle and these varying needs may determine how, when, and where birds settle.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Chapter one provides an introduction. Chapter two seeks to answer the question of how the property tax affects the tax base. Cities are divided into four types as defined by the census. Principal, central, suburban, and rural cities. The reason for dividing the cities into these categories is to see how the impact of changing the millage rate differs between these different city types. Another question this research seeks to answer is how the millage rate affects different property types differently. To address, the sec- ond question, properties are divided into residential, commercial, and office buildings. Increasing the millage rate decreases property values when controlling for provision of public goods. Increasing the millage rate by one percent decreases tax revenue collected in 28 out of 40 Florida regions. The loss in tax revenue from the lower property values outweights the gain in tax revenue from the increased millage rate in these regions. This finding can help provide a local government playbook in times of financial stress.Chapter three seeks to determine the link between municipal surplus and the number of various land use types. The fiscal impact of alternative land uses are partially determined by existing residents. These residents are guided by self-interest to influence what is built within their community. The makeup of a community in terms of renters versus homeowners influences whether a new project will be built. Another determinant of the project approval condition is a community’s fiscal stress. Marginal impact for revenue, expenditure, and surplus are calculated for each land use type. The fiscal impact differs between central and suburban cities and in response to the housing market crash. Using a unique panel of Florida cities, systems of revenue and expenditure equations for each
xi
type of city are estimated before and after the crash. Results show fiscal tightening differs between central and suburban cities after the great financial crisis. This fiscal tightening can be perceived by comparing surplus effects in the pre- and post-crash time periods.
Chapter four seeks to answer the question of how city revenue and expenditure are sep- arately related to the spatial density of various property types. Theory suggests that forces work against one another to either raise or lower public services costs as build- ings spatially concentrate within a city. Concentration lowers costs through economies of density but raises costs due to harshness of the environment as found by Bradford et al. (1969), Ladd (1992), Ladd (1993), and Ladd (1994). There is little empirical evi- dence on how these opposing forces play out to affect the budgets of local governments. In this part of the project, empirical estimation addresses questions regarding the rela- tionship between the geography of land uses within cities and public services’ costs. Property types that, when becoming more concentrated from their mean level, increase revenues are single-family, offices, retail, other commercial, industrial, and institutional. Property types that, when becoming more concentrated from their mean level, increase expenditure are single-family, multi-family, condominiums, retail, other commercial, industrial, and institutional. In general, development has become more spatially dis- persed within cities over time. Three dimensions of this dispersal are to be considered. As the developed area of a city expands, how are municipal revenues and public ser- vices’ costs influenced? Second, as the spatial concentration of buildings within the developed area decreases, what is the impact on municipal revenue and public services’ costs? Lastly, how are municipal revenue and public services’ costs affected by the spa- tial de-concentration of alternative land uses (for example, single-family homes versus office buildings) within the developed area of a city?</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This paper evaluates whether economic uncertainty about the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) is associated with an increase in information asymmetry. I use key legislative events preceding the enactment of the TCJA as an exogenous shock to firms’ information environments to capture economic uncertainty. Overall, I find that economic uncertainty around the TCJA’s legislative events leads to greater information asymmetry between investors. From cross-sectional analyses of pre-passage TCJA event dates, I find that information asymmetry increases more for firms with higher exposure to TCJA policy change related to interest expense, while the increase in information asymmetry is less pronounced for firms with higher exposure to policy changes related to capital investments and tax rates. These results suggest that investors view the financial statement effects of policy changes resulting in increases to bonus depreciation and reductions to corporate tax rates as more transparent than those limiting interest expense deductions. Overall, this study identifies a significant cost (i.e., increased information asymmetry) to some investors that occurred during the development stages of the TCJA bill.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Polyethylene-like materials with in-chain acetal units (-O-CH2-O-) precisely spaced by long methylene runs (between 12 and 26 CH2) crystallize from the melt in four different crystallographic forms (polymorphs) depending on the depth of undercooling. Using a Fast Scanning Calorimeter (FSC) we determined the critical cooling rates needed to develop the lowest temperature polymorphs from the melt, the mesomorphic-like disordered and hexagonal structures. The crystallization kinetics of high-temperature polymorphs, Forms I and II were obtained by classical DSC, and the crystallization kinetics of the low-temperature polymorphs, disordered, and hexagonal have been studied in this work by FSC. Isothermal crystallization studies in a wide range of temperatures revealed minima in the temperature gradient of the overall crystallization rates at all transition temperatures between polymorphs. The minima in the crystallization rates and heat of fusion are attributed to differences in nucleation barrier between polymorphs, and effects of self-poisoning. There is a step increase of melting temperature with increasing structural stability and a continuous increase in melting during annealing at a fixed crystallization temperature. The disordered structure and hexagonal crystals are metastable and upon annealing transform to the next stable phase as shown by a change in WAXD patterns. These kinetics studies serve to identify processing rates and properties of sustainable polyethylene-like materials crystallized at industrially relevant conditions.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Every year, natural hazards such as hurricanes devastate entire regions, cause widespread major infrastructure damages (e.g., roadway/bridge closures, power outages, etc.), and claim lives in the U.S. The State of Florida, which is surrounded by subtropical waters from three sides due to its unique geography, is one of the southern states significantly vulnerable to hurricanes. In recent years, hurricanes Hermine (2016), Irma (2017), and Michael (2018) have caused substantial damages to the infrastructure such as roadway and bridge closures and power outages in Florida. Many Floridians had to evacuate to safer locations under mandatory or voluntary evacuation orders before these hurricanes hit. Massive delays and major congestion on the evacuation routes made the problem even more challenging for the residents of affected regions as they needed to evacuate in a timely manner. In 2017, Hurricane Irma, a Category 4 hurricane, took on the entirety of Florida, causing the state’s largest evacuation ever as 7 million residents fled the hurricane. Floridians fleeing the hurricane faced a unique challenge on where to go since Irma made an unusual landfall from the south, enveloping the entire state forcing evacuees to drive farther north, and creating traffic jams along Florida evacuation routes worse than any other hurricane in history. Therefore, there is no doubt that there is a need to extensively assess the spatiotemporal traffic impacts of hurricanes such as Irma on Florida’s major highways based on the real-time traffic data before, during, and after the hurricane made landfall.Furthermore, due to hurricanes, many Floridian communities and specifically those along coastal areas are required to evacuate to safer places such as emergency shelters. Therefore, shelters in Florida play a pivotal role in meeting the needs of their communities and providing services to the public. Ensuring spatial accessibility to these facilities is essential. Providing accessibility has been even more challenging since these communities were hit by the COVID-19 pandemic during the hurricane season, thereby restricting shelter capacity due to social distancing requirements. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also indicate that it is potentially hazardous to use congregate shelters. This capacity challenge can be addressed by the use of alternative non-congregate shelters (i.e., lodging establishments such as hotels and motels). These are recommended by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in order to protect public health and limit general population sheltering.
In addition to hurricane shelters, rapid population growth, urbanization, and economic development have been creating other challenges in providing transportation-based accessibility to other critical facilities over the last decade. This is especially critical when we consider ensuring the transportation-based accessibility to essential facilities such as healthcare providers since these facilities provide important services to people. During a disaster such as the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, this issue becomes more confounding since these facilities play crucial roles in helping their communities to better prepare and recover from this uncontrolled outbreak. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, a drastic increase in the number of coronavirus patients caused a shortage of healthcare resources such as Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds and ventilators in the U.S. The high demands for these services led to a reduction in the efficiency of the entire healthcare system.
This dissertation proposes several novel methodological approaches to help solve aforementioned problems with the following objectives:
•	to assess the spatial accessibility of different age groups to mental health facilities that offer mental and behavioral services to the people in the State of Florida.
•	to assess accessibility of COVID-19 patients to healthcare providers in Florida.
•	to assess the spatial accessibility of Northwest Florida communities to congregate and non-congregate shelters during a disaster such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
•	to spatiotemporally analyze Hurricane Irma’s traffic impacts on Florida’s major highways (I-95, I-75, I-10, I-4, and turnpike) based on real-time traffic data before, during, and after the hurricane made landfall.  
•	to develop a methodology to integrate evacuation and storm surge modeling with a case study analysis of Hurricane Irma hitting Southeast Florida.
Findings clearly showed that imperfect forecasts and the uncertainty surrounding Irma’s predicted path resulted in high levels of congestion and severe delays on Florida’s major evacuation routes. Moreover, the results revealed that many areas in the northwest and southern Florida have lower access to critical facilities such as shelters or healthcare facilities compared to other locations. The residents in central Florida (e.g., Tampa and Orlando cities) had the highest level of accessibility given their higher access ratios. In addition, the results indicated that people in coastal areas where a higher number of lodging facilities are located have better access. Considering the capacity of each facility shows that many areas in Northwest Florida have lower access to lodging establishments than emergency relief shelters.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Since their production in the early 1950s, plastics have become a big part of everyday life for people around the world. Plastics are found in nearly every sector of society from homes to businesses to the medical field and various industries. Unfortunately, with the ever-increasing rate of plastic production, there is also an increase in the amount of plastic pollution. These plastics over time begin to break down and degrade into even smaller plastics, called microplastics.  Microplastics have been detected in every part of the environment: in the air, in soil, and multiple bodies of water. Furthermore, microplastics have been found in everyday items such as honey, sea salt, water bottles, seafood, and many other human consumables. Their ubiquity in the environment and human food chain has caused great concern for human health. However, not much is known about how these tiny plastics affect humans. Therefore this work focuses on the impacts that microplastics have on humans on the cellular level. In this work, we looked at two of the major routes of exposure to humans which are inhalation and ingestion, and used cell lines as models to study the effects of microplastics. We chose 1 and 10 micron polystyrene spheres because this type and size of microplastics are one of the most common microplastic pollutants. Three human cell lines were chosen to serve as a cellular model to conduct these studies. A549 human carcinoma alveolar lung cells were chosen as the lung cell model, Hep G2 hepatocellular liver cells were chosen as the liver cell model and HEK 293 human embryonic kidney cells were chosen as the kidney cell model.
In this work, it was observed that microplastics did cause a significant reduction in cell proliferation in the lung, liver, and kidney cell lines. These findings were very interesting and proved that microplastics have a similar proliferation effect on very different cell lines. This study also revealed metabolic differences between the cell lines tested. Although the A549 lung cells showed a slight decline in metabolic activity over time, the HEK 293 kidney cells showed a greater decline in metabolic activity after 24h, while the Hep G2 liver cells showed an initial decline at 24h, but then showed very little change after this time point. Additionally, morphological changes were observed in all cell lines. The A549 lung cells exposed to microplastics showed filopodia and microspikes extending from the cellular membrane at 72h exposure. The Hep G2 liver cells exposed to microplastics, showed a complete declustering of cells while the HEK 293 kidney exposed cells at 72h remained in clusters, but a significant amount of blebbing was observed. These morphological changes serve as a visual indicator that these cells are not behaving in the same manner as their unexposed counterparts. Using phase contrast microscopy, the 1micron polystyrene microplastics were observed to be taken up, at time points of 24h-72h and it was observed in certain cells that particles uptaken centered around the nucleus in each cell line. Confocal fluorescent microscopy was used to confirm uptake of particles at 24h for the A549 lung cells and 72h for the Hep G2 liver and HEK 293 kidney cells. For the HEK 293 kidney and Hep G2 liver cells, the percentage of cells that uptook these particles at 24h, 48h, and 72h was analyzed using flow cytometry. The HEK 293 kidney cells had a higher percentage of cells uptaking the particles at the higher concentration of 100µg/ml at all time points. For the lower concentration tested, 5µg/ml the HEK 293 kidney cells had a higher percentage of cells taking up the particles at 24h, a lower percentage of cells taking up the particles at 48h, and about the same amount of cells taking up the particles at 72h when compared to the Hep G2 liver cells. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) studies were done using the Hep G2 and HEK 293 kidney cell lines. 1micron PS-MPs produced the most significant ROS response with the 5µg/ml concentration in Hep G2 liver cells across all time points while the 50µg/ml concentration produced the most significant ROS response at the majority of the time points. EdU studies were performed at 24h in Hep G2 liver cells and HEK 293 kidney cells. Both Hep G2 and HEK 293 Edu studies revealed that 1micron PS-MP exposed cells did have a lower percentage of cells synthesizing DNA as compared to their unexposed counterparts, which correlates with our proliferative studies that show unexposed cells have a higher proliferative rate than exposed cells. Cell invasion studies were performed in Hep G2 and HEK 293 kidney cells. Results from the 72h invasion studies revealed that Hep G2 liver cells are more invasive with the exposure of 1micron PS-MPs as compared to unexposed cells. However, results for the HEK 293 cells are inconclusive due to all cells (both exposed and unexposed) migrating to the bottom chamber at 72h. Endocytotic studies at 24h in both the Hep G2 liver and HEK 293 kidney cells did show a red fluorescence signal, suggesting that particles had been uptaken in the cells. However, with the images shown it is unclear whether particles were uptaken in the endosomes and whether the fluorescent signal is from the particles being localized in the endosomes. Further analysis is needed. These studies reveal that microplastics do have an effect on human cell lines and cause cell proliferative, cell stress, metabolic, and morphological changes in human lung, liver and kidney cells exposed to polystyrene microplastics. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>AbstractE-sports is one of the fastest growing entertainment genres in the world, with millions of viewers and ever-increasing revenue streams flowing into bigger and more impressive tournament displays. One of the ways that this revenue is utilized by e-sports producers and event managers is to engage audiences with musical events prior to large finals tournaments, events which are emblematic of the games being played and the competitive nature of the participating professional gamers. Within this thesis, I aim to deconstruct these events in their context, understanding the ways that these events provide a microcosm of the e-sports genre and move forward a legitimization of e-sports as a whole. I look closely at the 2019 League of Legends World Championship Finals Opening Ceremony (and other similar League of Legends opening ceremonies as necessary) as a particular example of this phenomenon, focusing on emergent themes such as virtuality, intersectionality in terms of race, class, and gender, and economic influences on e-sports. I draw on Bruno Latour’s actor-network theory as well as theories of music mediation developed by scholars such as Georgina Born to inform my analysis, and to determine how assemblages of physical and digital mediators influence and interact with one another in the opening ceremonies I analyze. These events are more than simply a precursor to the main event; they are themselves signifiers of the widely interconnected nature of e-sports which has only continued to expand into new markets, new audiences, and new platforms. By closely analyzing the themes introduced by these ceremonies and the ways that technologies are utilized by the individuals associated with these events, we can move closer to understanding why e-sports has undergone such a massive explosion of growth in such a brief span of time; further, this can also inform the ways that entertainment will continue to expand and evolve in an increasingly virtual landscape. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Portfolio managers faced with limited sample sizes must use factor models to estimate the covariance matrix of a high-dimensional returns vector. For the simplest one-factor market model, success rests on the quality of the estimated leading eigenvector ``beta". </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>When only the returns themselves are observed, the practitioner has available the ``PCA" estimate equal to the leading eigenvector of the sample covariance matrix. It is documented that this estimator performs poorly in various ways. To address this problem in the high-dimension, limited sample size asymptotic regime and in the context of estimating the minimum variance portfolio, Goldberg, Papanicolau, and Shkolnik (\cite{goldberg2018}) developed a shrinkage method (the ``GPS estimator") that improves the PCA estimator of beta by shrinking it toward the target unit vector$q = (1,\dots, 1)/\sqrt{p} \in \bR^p$. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We investigate what allows this shrinkage to present improvements. We reveal, incorporating the information that $beta$'s are finitely dispersed in the asymptotic regime, leverages the unit vector $q$ as a relevant target vector. In fact, the GPS estimator were using a systematic information inherited by the $beta$'s of the market. This invokes the question of how to pick a favorable shrinkage target in the possible settings that there is further information which promotes more unit vectors like $q$.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In that regard, we continue their work to develop a more general framework of shrinkage targets that allows the practitioner to make use of further information to improve the estimator. Examples include sector separation of stock betas, and recent information from prior estimates. We prove some precise statements and illustrate the resulting improvements over the GPS estimator with some numerical experiments.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Moreover, we perform an in depth analysis of  the asymptotics of the optimization bias term $\mathcal{E}_p$, the major driver of various error metrics of the estimators of $\beta$'s as pointed out in \cite{goldberg2018} , associated wit the GPS estimator. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Tight regulation of the cell cycle is essential to maintain genome integrity. Errors at any stage during cell cycle, including replication, chromosome segregation, and mitotic exit, can lead to genome instability, which has been shown to contribute to tumorigenesis or cell death. Despite the importance of these cellular processes, many of their molecular mechanisms are still not fully understood. We used budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism to investigate cell cycle regulation because this organism is genetically tractable and much of the processes during cell cycle are conserved from yeast to humans.    </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In budding yeast, Mcm10 is an essential DNA replication factor that interacts strongly with the Mcm2-7 complex, a conserved helicase in all eukaryotes. Within the Mcm2-7 complex, Mcm10 has been shown to interact with both the Mcm2 and Mcm6 subunits. We have been able to show that Mcm10 has DNA binding capability but the function of this binding has yet to be determined. Additionally, we have shown that Mcm10 is able to bind to RPA, the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding protein, and this interaction is strengthened in the presence of ssDNA. Assembly of the DNA replication machinery, replisome, at replication origins is largely driven by the phosphorylation imposed by Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK) and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK). Inactivation of DDK via a cdc7-1 mutant disrupts the interaction between Mcm10 and Mcm2, indicating a potential earlier role during replication for Mcm10 than previously anticipated. Selective depletion of Mcm10 via an iAID (auxin-induced degradation) system decreases Mcm2 chromatin association. Therefore, we speculate that Mcm10 functions during the early stage of DNA replication initiation by maintaining the stable chromatin association of the Mcm2-7 helicase. 	
DNA replication stress activates the S-phase checkpoint that arrests the cell cycle, but it is poorly understood how cells recover from this arrest. CDK and Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) with the B regulatory subunit Cdc55 (PP2ACdc55) are key cell cycle regulators in budding yeast. We found that yeast cells lacking functional PP2ACdc55 showed slow growth in the presence of hydroxyurea (HU), a DNA synthesis inhibitor, without obvious viability loss. Moreover, PP2A mutants exhibited delayed anaphase entry and sustained levels of anaphase inhibitor Pds1 after HU treatment. A DNA damage checkpoint Chk1 phosphorylates and stabilizes Pds1. We showed that chk1Δ and mutation of the Chk1 phosphorylation sites in Pds1 largely restored efficient anaphase entry in PP2A mutants after HU treatment. In addition, deletion of SWE1 that encodes the inhibitory kinase for CDK or mutation of the Swe1 phosphorylation site in CDK (cdc28F19) also suppressed the anaphase entry delay in PP2A mutants after HU treatment. Our genetic data suggest that Swe1/CDK acts upstream of Pds1. Surprisingly, cdc55Δ showed significant suppression to the viability loss of S-phase checkpoint mutants during DNA synthesis block. 
	
Cell cycle-regulated protein modifications, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, are critical for a successful cell duplication. Protein SUMOylation is a biochemical process that adds a small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) to protein lysine residues. Elimination of SUMOylation in yeast cells results in cell cycle arrest, indicating the essential role of this modification in the cell cycle. Protein poly-SUMOylation has been shown to trigger its ubiquitination, and the subsequent extraction and/or proteasomal degradation. Cdc14 phosphatase not only antagonizes the phosphorylation imposed by CDK but also triggers CDK inactivation. Therefore, Cdc14 is essential for mitotic exit, a process that inactivates CDK. Prior to anaphase entry, Cdc14 is sequestered within the nucleolus through two anchor proteins Tof2 and Net1. Interestingly, these two proteins are subjected to SUMOylation. Our results indicate that SUMOylation does not play a role in Cdc14 nucleolar localization, but polySUMOylation appears to promote nucleolar delocalization of Net1 and Tof2. Additionally, we found that Tof2 degradation is dependent on the ubiquitination mediated by both SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase (STUbL) and Anaphase Promoting Complex (APC), a E3 ubiquitin ligase essential for anaphase entry. These observations support a two-step ubiquitination model for the degradation of SUMOylated proteins as well as a potential role for polySUMOylation in mitotic exit by triggering Cdc14 release from the nucleolus.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Taken together, our results have identified Mcm10 as a potential scaffold protein ensuring chromatin association of the Mcm2-7 helicase during single strand extrusion, a process essential for the initiation of DNA replication. We have uncovered a PP2A-Swe1-CDK-Chk1-Pds1 axis that promotes recovery from DNA replication stress. Lastly, our results indicate that polySUMOylation may promote mitotic exit by delocalizing Cdc14 anchor proteins Tof2 and Net1 from the nucleolus. Furthermore, our results indicate that STUbL and E3 ligase APC are likely involved in proteasomal degradation of nucleolar protein Tof2, supporting a model that two-step ubiquitination of SUMO substrates promotes their proteasomal degradation. The findings presented in the thesis demonstrate several new layers of cell cycle regulations, which may provide new therapeutic strategies with regards to cancer and other cell-based therapies.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In the French Revolution, revolutionary legislators faced the problem of how to relate to the Catholic Church, to which the vast majority of citizens belonged. Inheriting theological, legal, and Enlightenment philosophical categories for thinking about religion and the Church, the legislators adapted to contingent circumstances by constructing a national church through a series of decrees motivated by different aims and partly conflicting in spirit and in their consequences. This reshaped version of eighteenth-century Gallican ideas of church reform created a problem faced by each successive regime, contributing to the escalation of violent conflict between the revolutionary governments and the Catholic Church.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Three studies investigated appearance self-schemas within the context of the appearance comparisons made on Instagram. It was expected that women with higher levels of appearance schematicity would be more likely to compare with, and be affected by, exposure to Instagram. Study 1 provided correlational evidence that the relationship between Instagram activity and negative body image was strongest for these women. Study 2 provided experimental evidence that direct exposure to the thin ideal on Instagram increased women’s body dissatisfaction, however appearance schematicity failed to moderate their impact. Finally, Study 3 tracked the within persons, day-to-day fluctuations of Instagram exposure and body dissatisfaction across nine days. Results showed that, on any given day, when women with higher levels of appearance schematicity were exposed to thin ideal influencers on Instagram, their body image suffered. Taken together, the findings suggest that Instagram is closely associated with negative body image, but that context matters. Future research should consider the relationships that the users form with idealized influencers on Instagram and its impact on the development of appearance self-schemas. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This study is a preliminary exploration of adoption of generative adversarial network (GAN)-derived avatar healthcare providers (HCPs). To our knowledge, GAN-derived avatars as de facto HCPs have not been investigated in relation to user trust and behavioral intention in a simulated telehealth setting. Therefore, drawing from the Computers are Social Actors (CASA) paradigm, this study focuses on how perception of GAN-derived avatar HCPs in a one-way video encounter impacts trust and behavioral intention. A pretest-posttest experiment was conducted to gain insight into participants’ trust and behavioral intention. A survey was used as the instrument to collect responses before/after viewing a brief video featuring an HCP (human or GAN-derived avatar) presenting information on a common medical condition. Hypotheses were that GAN-derived avatar and human counterparts would be (1) perceived as equally trustworthy and (2) associated with similar behavioral intentions (i.e., following provider advice, returning to provider, recommending provider). The analysis (N=147) offers evidence in support of both hypotheses, showing that avatar HCPs and human HCPs are not perceived significantly differently in terms of trust and behavioral intention. Although participant ratings of trust and behavioral intention were similar for both types of HCPs, findings indicated participant trust and behavioral intention declined for both types of HCP encounters over time (compared to pre-encounter beliefs/expectations). Additionally, participants were more willing to offer trust than behavioral intention for both types of HCPs. Findings lay groundwork for further inquiry of establishing novel roles for GAN-derived avatars in healthcare contexts such as telehealth. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The current study applied an intersectional person-in-environment theoretical framework to evaluate how belonging to multiple and varying micro-level social categories of gender, race, and disability affected employment and earnings. Accounting for multiple and varying social categories was found to be important in predicting employment and earnings outcomes. In addition, this study investigated the effects of SSI/SSDI, a mezzo-level program, and the ADA, a macro-level policy, on employment and earnings. Receiving SSI/SSDI and the implementation of the ADA were found to not have affected the study outcomes. All the findings demonstrate that there is a need for programs and policies that can adequately address issues of employment and earnings for people with disabilities with differing gender and racial social categories.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Multiple mating mediates how ecological and evolutionary forces affect populations and there are many explanations for why it is so common. Despite this, taxonomic biases and observational approaches have limited a full understanding of when certain causes and consequences should manifest in certain taxa and ecosystems. Therefore, in this dissertation I used the marine gastropod, the Florida crown conch (Melongena corona) to 1) quantify natural levels of polyandry (i.e., number of sires) across a reproductive season, 2) experimentally manipulated the number of males that mate with females to test the hypothesis that polyandry produces more offspring that are larger and more variable in size at hatching. I also used genetic markers to quantify paternity share after development at hatching. I found that females mated with more males did not produce more offspring at the embryo or hatching stage. Multiple mating also did not affect mean offspring size at hatching. However, multiple mating increased within-brood variation in offspring size at hatching, suggesting differences in intracapsular competition in mixed broods. Paternity share within broods at hatching was skewed, rather than evenly distributed, resulting in a lower effective number of sires relative to the number of mates. Overall, commonly hypothesized benefits of polyandry were not detected in our experiments. Instead, multiple mating is likely controlled by males in this system where mate order, male size, or male copulation all contributed to sire success.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The diversity and consequences of developmental mode in marine invertebrates has, for a long time, provided the opportunity to understand different evolutionary solutions to living in variable environments. In this dissertation, I report here novel behavioral variability in hatchlings of the marine gastropod Melongena corona, that has broad significance for understanding the correlated evolution of development, dispersal, and reproductive strategies in a variable environment. All hatchlings crawl-away from egg capsules after emergence as larval pediveligers. Many subsequently swim for a brief period (second to minutes) before crawling again. From detailed observations of 120 individuals over 30 days, I observed 28 (23.3%) hatchlings swimming at least once (8 – 50% per maternal brood). I manipulated hypothesized environmental cues and found that the proportion of hatchlings that swam was highest in the absence of cues related to habitat or food, and lowest when only habitat cues were present. The relative growth rate of hatchlings was highest when habitats contained a putative juvenile food source. About 44% of hatchlings were competent to metamorphose at emergence, but do not metamorphose. The rate of metamorphosis increased with age but depended on the presence of cues. Hatching from benthic egg capsules as crawl-away larvae, while also having the capacity to swim, may have evolved to maintain flexibility in balancing the benefits and risks of benthic versus pelagic mortality, and to maximize survival between reproductive locations and nursery habitat. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Despite the increasing use of pharmacotherapy, suicide and self-injury rates have continued to rise in the United States. There are at least four potential explanations for this pattern: (1) no medication is particularly efficacious for suicide and self-injury; (2) only a small proportion of psychotropic medications are highly efficacious; (3) most psychotropic medications produce non-zero but small-magnitude effects; and (4) many medications are highly efficacious, but their effects have not been reflected in suicide and self-injury rates due to other constraints (e.g., access, compliance). In order to empirically examine these possibilities, the present meta-analysis comprehensively summarizes all published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that have reported the causal effects of psychotropic medications on suicide and self-injury. A total of 251 papers comprising of 718 unique RCTs were included. A frequentist pairwise meta-analytic approach and a Bayesian network meta-analytic approach were adopted. Potential effect modifiers were examined via metaregressions, and potential biases were evaluated through sensitivity analyses. Results revealed that only a small number of medications were efficacious, and these effects were circumscribed to specific outcomes. Moreover, the most efficacious medications were not the most commonly studied. These patterns were largely consistent across potential effect modifiers, though certain study and sample characteristics (e.g., sample age, treatment length) did significantly moderate findings. Sensitivity analyses yielded consistent results. This study highlights two main opportunities for improvement in the development and refinement of psychotropic interventions. As the most effective interventions are likely to directly target causes of suicide and self-injury, future research is needed to (1) better understand the treatment mechanisms of psychotropic medications; and (2) identify the causal processes underlying suicide and self-injury.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Community-based participatory research (CBPR) is an approach to health research that prioritizes translation and community partner participation. The field of CBPR is multidisciplinary, so traditional definitions of communication within CBPR have focused on information transfer. However, communication is a dynamic and multifaceted process with multiple levels of influence. The goals of this dissertation are threefold: 1) to apply communication discipline’s perspective of communication to better understand how CBPR teams communicate, 2) to examine the factors that affect communication and participation within CBPR teams, and 3) to identify patterns that will contribute to the development of a theory of CBPR team communication and participation. Through a systematic review study of N=105 articles, patterns of communication and participation were identified. Logistics can communicate equity between the scholars and the community partners and facilitate effective communication. Frequent meetings and communication strengthen the communication of the team. Information sharing is imperative for work to be completed on these research projects. However, there was little evidence that transformation through the process of CBPR was valued as a goal by the CBPR teams. Communication and not simply information transfer should be a priority and a goal for CBPR teams. When starting new CBPR partnerships, creating clear expectations and a shared language can reduce miscommunication. Not many CBPR teams explain how they continue to ensure effective communication after initially discussion boundaries and duties, however. These early findings suggest that throughout the CBPR process, the intercultural teams of CBPR might be forming a new group, however more research is needed to explore the impact of interdependence and time on group identity. Community members frequently participate in CBPR as an expert in their community and local knowledge. Having teams train both in research practices and in local knowledge ensures that the team is co-learning. Boundaries to participation include university IRB and conflicting goals between scholars and community partners. Having community members involved in the creation of research questions for the project is related to higher levels of involvement in other stages of research. Community participation in the research process does not seem to be hindered based purely on the research methodology chosen, but non-traditional research methodologies did have higher levels of community participation than other research methods within conducting the research. Finally, indigenous community populations were more involved in the ethical approval stages of research than any other target population. These findings do serve as the first step in applying communication and group theory to CBPR teams, and do help us to better understand how teams are communicating and ensuring participation. Kurt Lewin (1951) said, “there’s nothing so practical as a good theory” (p. 169). The findings of this dissertation serve as the first step in attempting to understand the communication and participation practices within CBPR teams. A significant finding of this dissertation, however, is that the reporting methods for CBPR team communication and participation is lacking. Peterson (2010) argued that until CBPR scholars are able to define what true participation is, and change the perceptions of what rigorous research looks like, CBPR will continue to be used as a trendy term that will perpetuate the status quo of research practices. This will hurt the goal of CBPR, which is to create social change (through the reduction of health inequities) for marginalized. The field of CBPR should consider changing the reporting practices of CBPR reports to better facilitate reporting the process of CBPR. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Sexual minority individuals experience significant mental health disparities compared to the overall population, including significantly increased risk for suicide. This disparity is partially explained through the interconnected Interpersonal Theory-Minority Stress Model (IT-MSM). Disgust subtypes could further inform the IT-MSM. The current study seeks to validate the Disgust with Life Scale (DWLS) as a measurement of disgust subtypes, while simultaneously examining the relationships between the disgust subtypes, the IT-MSM variables, and suicidal ideation. Participants (n = 311), who all identified as sexual minorities, filled out self-report measures to assess the disgust subtypes, IT-MSM variables, and suicidal ideation. The psychometric properties of the Disgust with Life Scale (DWLS) were tested through Confirmatory and Exploratory Factor Analyses. Five linear regression models were used to assess the hypothesized relationships between the study variables. 
Results indicated that the DWLS was best described by a two-factor solution: Disgust with Self and Disgust with Society. Disgust with Self had a significant relationship with the Interpersonal Theory variables (β1 = .85, β2 = .36, p &lt; .001), strengthened the relationship between externalized and internalized homophobia (β = .10, p &lt; .001), and was uniquely associated with suicidal ideation (β = .46, p &lt; .032). The hypothesized relationships between Disgust with Society and study variables were not confirmed. Disgust with Society had a significant negative association with perceived burdensomeness (β = -.19, p &lt; .001). 
These findings indicate the disgust subtypes can inform the theoretical conceptualization of suicide risk in sexual minorities, which can inform future research and prevention strategies. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In two studies, I explored the relationships among regulatory focus and L2 self-guides (which are qualitative differences in motivation), L2 oral task emotions, and L2 oral performance. In Study 1, 133 second-year high school students in China 1) completed questionnaires measuring their background information, the self-reported L2 oral proficiency levels, L2 self-guides, and chronic regulatory focus,2) completed an oral task and 3) completed questionnaires measuring their anxiety and enjoyment levels in the oral task. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Each participant had a 10-minute break after completing Study 2 data collection. The participants were randomly and evenly separated into three groups by the research assistants. Participants in the first group answered some questions designed to induce their situational promotion focus orientation. Participants in the second group answered different questions designed to generate their situational prevention focus orientation. The control group participants did not answer any questions. After that, all the participants completed the second oral task. Finally, they completed questionnaires assessing their task anxiety and task enjoyment. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Multiple regression and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to analyze the data. The multiple regression results showed that, in Study 1, L2 learners’ oral performance was positively predicted by their chronic prevention focus and their level of enjoyment during the oral task, and negatively predicted by their ought L2 self/other. In addition, the L2 learners’ chronic promotion focus and ideal L2 self/own positively predicted their enjoyment during the oral task. In Study 2, ANOVA results indicated that the anxiety levels of the L2 learners who received situational promotion focus treatment was higher than the anxiety levels of the L2 learners who received situational prevention focus treatment and who did not receive treatment. There were no differences across the groups in terms of task enjoyment and performance. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The results of the study confirmed the importance of motivational variables related to L2 learners’ obligations and significant others (chronic prevention focus and ought L2 self/other) in influencing Chinese L2 learners’ task emotions and overall performance. Overall, the findings can enrich the understanding of L2 learners’ motivation and emotions in L2 oral performance, which can in turn help educators design more effective teaching methods and provide a more enjoyable learning experience for L2 learners. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Introduction: As the major allergen in finfish, parvalbumin is responsible for more than 90% of fish allergy. To reduce the occurrence of finfish allergy, on the one hand, food allergen characterization could assist in protein modifications to decrease allergenicity. One way to evaluate parvalbumin antigenicity under different conditions is to utilize monoclonal antibody (mAb). On the other hand, it is critical to develop assays for allergen residues quantification. Currently, many antibody-based immunoassays are available for finfish parvalbumin detection, while there is limited research on aptamer development against finfish parvalbumin.Objectives: (1) to purify and characterize parvalbumin from Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), striped mullet (Mugil cephalus), and tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus); (2) to characterize monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific to finfish parvalbumin; and (3) to develop and characterize ssDNA aptamers.
Methodology: For objectives 1 and 2, parvalbumin from each finfish species was purified using column chromatography. The purity and amino acid sequence were obtained using gel electrophoresis and LC-MS/MS, respectively. Effect of chelators, reducing chemical and oxidizing agent on antibody-antigen interaction was studied using immunoblot. For objectives 3 and 4, ssDNA aptamers were developed using systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). The obtained sequences and the published anti-parvalbumin aptamer sequences were commercially synthesized. Their target analyte, selectivity, structure and affinity were analyzed.
Results: Parvalbumin was successfully purified from four fish species with more than 97% purity. The yield of parvalbumin from cod, salmon, mullet, and tilapia was 1.1 mg/g, 0.4 mg/g, 3.4 mg/g, and 1.2 mg/g of wet muscle, respectively. It suggested that parvalbumin content and distribution were species-dependent. All purified parvalbumin was identified with a sequence coverage of at least 89%. PAS results showed that parvalbumin was not glycosylated. Parvalbumin from different fish species showed different electrophoretic mobility. Native parvalbumin contained both monomers and oligomers. In the presence of reducing agent (dithiothreitol) and detergent (sodium dodecyl sulfate), parvalbumin oligomers dissociated into monomers. As for the immunochemical properties, immunoreactivity of all four fish parvalbumin decreased when its calcium was chelated. By using the microplate SELEX, a total of 20 candidate aptamer sequences were obtained. All aptamers had a hair-pin structure, which occurred when two regions of the same strand are complementary to each other and form the Watson-Crick base pairs. It is noted that at different temperatures, the same candidate sequence may have different structures. The developed and published aptamers all showed reaction with several finfish proteins.
Conclusion: This study (1) investigated the purity, conformation, and immunoreactivity of parvalbumin from four finfish species; (2) characterized the mAbs specific to finfish parvalbumin; and (3) developed and characterized the ssDNA aptamers. In summary, parvalbumin is a mixture of monomers and oligomers due to covalent and non-covalent interaction under the native condition. Its immunoreactivity is affected by calcium chelation. The purified parvalbumin has the potential to be used in the development of capturing agents such as antibodies and aptamers, which can be further utilized in the assay development for the detection of undeclared fish allergenic residues in foods.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The prevention of substance use disorders (SUDs) is of utmost societal importance due to their debilitating impact on affected individuals and their family members (Rehm et al., 2009). In seeking to identify risk factors for SUDs that can serve as targets for preventative efforts, it is important to distinguish between liability characteristics that predate SUDs and consequences stemming from heavy substance use. One novel method for addressing this issue is the co-twin control (CTC) model, allowing for estimation of the quasi-causal effect of one variable on a clinical outcome of interest (Begg &amp; Parides, 2003; Joyner et al., 2020). While this innovative modeling method has yielded important insights into the nature of causal effects, all current implementations of the CTC method dictate effects to be invariant across participants. However, this need not be the case. Using univariate quantile behavioral genetic models, researchers have demonstrated that certain phenotypes are differentially heritable depending on the level at which the phenotype is expressed (Logan et al., 2012; Schwartz et al., 2017). The current project extended this analytic approach to the case of the CTC model through the use of quantile multilevel modeling. This new quantile CTC (“qCTC”) modeling method permitted inferences to be made regarding the extent to which adolescent substance use causally affects outcomes in adulthood at different levels of the outcome variable. The value of this new variant of the CTC model for clarifying the role of adolescent substance use and personality characteristics in the etiology of SUDs in adulthood was demonstrated using existing data from two large twin-study samples. Results indicated differential heritability of SUDs at different points along its distribution, but not addiction-related traits. Furthermore, there were not variant CTC effects of adolescent substance use across the distribution of addiction-related traits. This study sets the groundwork for examination of other phenotypes in the qCTC framework.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study used mixed methods to investigate the relationships between parental leave policy components and academic achievement measured by TIMSS and PIRLS. Qualitative document analysis was used to analyze the policy documents and available literature on all the parental leave policies that had been implemented early enough to potentially affect the children who were assessed by the TIMSS and PIRLS in the countries under study. Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) was then used to categorize countries based on the components of their parental leave policies, and to identify potential causal pathways to see whether and how these policy components contribute to academic achievement. Exploratory descriptive and correlational statistical analyses were then used to help evaluate the QCA results and investigate the quantitative relationships between the policy components and student achievement in reading, mathematics, and science. The study found that the potential causal pathways identified in the fsQCA differed for each of the three outcomes of interest, with stronger evidence of set relationships between the components of parental leave policies and achievement in science than for achievement in reading. The fsQCA failed to find evidence for a unique relationship between the policy components and achievement in mathematics. However, the results did reveal ways that certain policy components can contribute to mathematics achievement under certain contextual conditions, particularly when combined with high rates of female employment and a high-quality alternative to parental care in the early years. The results of the exploratory regression analyses found statistically significant relationships between maternity leave and the three academic outcomes. It also found smaller but statistically significant correlations between the other types leave and reading and science, but not for mathematics. Broadly speaking, the results of this study provide support for the assumption that paid parental leave policies can contribute to academic achievement in reading, mathematics, and science. However, the study did not provide support for the assumption that more paid leave is necessarily better, and may provide evidence that other contextual factors, such as female employment rates and a high-quality alternative to parental care, are just as important, if not more, for academic achievement.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>BACKGROUND: Exposure to weight stigma increases food consumption in individuals who are—or perceive themselves to be—overweight, and such exposure predicts greater odds of binge eating. To date, however, no study has experimentally tested if exposure to stigmatizing anti-obesity public health campaigns elicits key components of binge-eating behavior: increased food consumption and loss of control (LOC) over eating.  The current study sought to elucidate the association between weight stigma and binge-eating components via experimental design and examine whether increases in shame account for these associations.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>METHOD: Nonsmoking women (N= 92) with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 25 kg/m2 were randomized to either a weight stigma condition [public service announcement (PSA) about harms of obesity] or a parallel control condition (PSA on smoking). After viewing PSAs, participants were invited to freely consume snacks in an ad lib meal and then provide immediate ratings of LOC eating. Participants completed momentary ratings of shame and other affective states before and after the PSAs.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>RESULTS: Participants in the weight stigma condition consumed significantly less food than those in the control condition but had greater increases in shame. Although conditions did not differ significantly in the experience of LOC eating, the weight stigma condition indirectly elicited LOC eating in the ad lib meal via increased shame.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>DISCUSSION: Findings provide support that weight-targeted health campaigns are experienced as stigmatizing by women with high BMIs. In the short-term, weight stigma PSAs may produce the intended effect of reducing food intake, but the cost to the emotional and psychological health of the viewer likely outweighs the benefit.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Mstislav Rostropovich (1927-2007) was one of the preeminent cellists and musical pedagogues of the twentieth century. He brought the art of cello technique and musical interpretation to new heights, but perhaps his greatest contribution to the cello community was his advocacy for new cello repertoire, which led to many new works for the cello from a wide variety of composers. As he traveled the world Rostropovich was constantly forming friendships with his colleagues. Many of these relationships with composers bore fruit in the form of new works for cello. A very few of Rostropovich's relationships and their resulting works command the majority of scholarly and pedagogical attention. This treatise seeks to broaden this discussion through the exploration of two lesser-known pieces written for Rostropovich, Improvisation for Violoncello Solo (1994) by Alfred Schnittke and Suite for Solo Cello (1960) by Boris Tchaikovsky. The paper presents a thorough analytical and pedagogical study of each piece in its biographical context. This treatise is intended to introduce cello students and teachers to new repertoire as well as help them overcome the analytical and technical challenges each piece poses to the potential performer.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Occupying a significant share of the urban landscape in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), informal settlements are the home to nearly one-quarter of the urban population in this region. Mapping land cover and informal settlement patterns is crucial not only for supporting urban planning efforts but also for developing a better understanding of informal settlement distribution and development. My dissertation integrates remote sensing, machine learning, and spatial analysis to achieve two major goals: (1) to advance mapping techniques for informal settlements and urban land cover from satellite imagery and (2) to explore the linkage between urban settlement patterns and crime incidents. The study area covers the municipality of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, the third-largest South American city with a complex urban landscape, diverse demography, long-standing development of informal settlements, and crime issues. The city stands out as a challenging mapping case and a special area to explore the nexus between urban layout and crime incidents.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The dissertation consists of six chapters. Chapter 1 introduced the background of informal settlement and research design. Chapters 2 to 4 discussed three informal settlement mapping methods with the use of ancillary data fusion, multiple classifier systems (MCS), and deep learning, which could be adopted for different situations in terms of data availability and computational resources. Specifically, Chapter 2 examined the relative merits of a textural metric, road density, slope, and thermal infrared information in relation to the complexity of urban land cover classes. Chapter 3 introduced the design of a concatenate MCS with a training sample refinement mechanism to enhance the urban settlement mapping accuracy without using ancillary data. Chapter 4 proposed a patch-based fully connected neural network (PB-FCN) customized for a limited number of manual-collected training data from medium-resolution satellite imagery. Chapter 5 discussed the relationship between the areal percentage of two urban built-up types and reported violent crimes, robberies, and thefts, and examined whether their relationships would be conditioned by socioeconomic factors, both spatially and aspatially. Finally, Chapter 6 discussed the significance and the broad impact of this research.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The major novelties of this dissertation include: 1) revealing the role of thermal information in resolving class ambiguity, 2) examining the impact of training data for the combiner upon the MCS performance, 3) demonstrating the strength of deep learning for remote sensor data mining and addressing some critical issues in designing deep learning models for remote sensor data, and 4) examining crime issues in a Latin-American city combining both structure and environmental factors from a spatial perspective.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Overall, this dissertation took the initial steps in data inventory and spatial analysis to address the housing challenges faced by one-third of the urban population. For the discipline of geography, this study improves the understanding of the distribution and coverage of informal settlements spatially and reveals the urban structure of a large Latin-American city. For crime studies, this study provides spatial insights into the link between urban patterns and criminal incidents. Transferrable mapping methods have been developed based on a global dataset for urban settlements and land cover types, which is significant for informal settlement management, resource allocation, and impact analysis of planning policies. Future work can be prospected in examining spatiotemporal patterns of informal settlements across regions and environmental inequalities among different urban settlement types.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>As capacitors age, the likelihood of failure increases. Electrolytic capacitors typically failwhen their electrolyte layers evaporate, resulting in an open-circuit fault which is minimally
dangerous to other circuit components in the system. However, in recent years, film capacitors
have become a common choice for DC-link capacitors in rectifier and inverter circuits, owing to
their superior durability and lifetime to electrolytic capacitors. The drawback of film capacitors
is that their failures are typically short-circuit faults which occur when the capacitor dielectric
wears through. Short-circuit faults create high current stresses on neighboring circuit components
such as MOSFETs and IGBTs, which can in turn propagate component failures throughout the
entire system. Therefore, capacitor health monitoring is of utmost importance for DC-link
capacitors.
In this thesis, the current state of capacitor health monitoring is analyzed. Two novel
capacitor health monitoring techniques which utilize an artificial neural network (ANN) are then
proposed to estimate the current capacitance of a DC-link capacitor. The present capacitance is
compared to the initial capacitance to gauge the health of the capacitor. The first method uses the
RMS values of the DC-link voltage ripple and load current. The second method utilizes the
magnitude of the line frequency harmonics present in the DC-link voltage. The two methods are
verified via simulation. Finally, the potential for further research and improvements are
discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Over the past few decades, Southeast Australia has experienced severe regional climatic events, including devastating floods and some of the most extreme droughts on record, linked in part to influences from both the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). In this manuscript, the extent to which ENSO-IOD driven rainfall anomalies are communicated specifically through variations in atmospheric fronts is quantified. Consistent with previous studies, the most extreme wet (dry) conditions result from the co-occurrence of La Niña-Negative IOD (El Niño-Positive IOD). With maximum anomalous wet and dry conditions in southeast Australia during Austral winter, it is found that most of these precipitation anomalies result from changes to the frontal precipitation associated with the passing of atmospheric fronts. These anomalies accompany changes in both the frequency of atmospheric fronts as well as the precipitation rate associated with those fronts. Interestingly, the distribution in the dynamic strength of individual fronts remains relatively unchanged. Instead, the variability in atmospheric fronts and their associated precipitation appears to be related to latitudinal fluctuations in the eddy-driven jet.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>One of the core pathogenic mechanisms for schizophrenia is believed to be dysfunction in glutamatergic synaptic transmissions, particularly hypofunction of N-methyl D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). In addition, previous genetic and postmortem studies have identified several 14-3-3 isoforms as potential candidate risk genes for schizophrenia. 14-3-3 proteins are a family of homologous proteins involved in many biological processes, including signaling, neurite outgrowth, and ion channel regulation. To investigate the association between 14-3-3 dysregulation and schizophrenia, our lab has previously generated 14-3-3 functional knockout mice. These mice exhibited schizophrenia-associated behaviors accompanied by reduced synaptic NMDARs in forebrain excitatory neurons. These findings suggested that 14-3-3 proteins may act as a key component of the postsynaptic NMDAR complex with a positive role in regulating synaptic levels of NMDARs. Here we focus on NMDARs as one of the molecular substrates of 14-3-3 protein signaling at the glutamatergic synapses. In addition, 14-3-3 functional knockout mice exhibited lowered hippocampal and cortical dendritic spine density, reduced dendritic complexity from the cortex, and significant reduction of Ser3-phosphorylated cofilin levels from the hippocampus. These findings suggested that 14-3-3 proteins may play a crucial role in dendritic spine density and dendritic complexity, possibly through their role in the actin signaling pathway.  Chapter 1 reviews animal models of NMDAR hypofunction and the importance of studying the molecular mechanism for NMDAR hypofunctionality. Chapter 2 describes how 14-3-3 proteins regulate synaptic localization of NMDARs by examining changes in levels of synaptic NMDARs upon 14-3-3 inhibition in primary neurons. This work found that 14-3-3 protein inhibitor (difopein) expression in primary glutamatergic cortical and hippocampal neurons resulted in decreased numbers of synaptic puncta containing NMDARs, including the GluN1 GluN2A, or GluN2B subunits. In heterologous cells, 14-3-3 proteins enhanced the surface expression of these NMDAR subunits. Furthermore, this work identified that 14-3-3ζ and ε isoforms interact with NMDARs via binding to GluN2A and GluN2B subunits. Chapter 3 examines the role of 14-3-3 proteins on dendritic spine density, dendritic complexity, and actin dynamics and shows that inhibition of 14-3-3 proteins decreased dendritic spine density and dendritic complexity in glutamatergic cortical and hippocampal neurons. In addition, 14-3-3 proteins enhance dendritic spine density and dendritic complexity in only glutamatergic hippocampal neurons via the actin signaling pathway. Taken together, these results demonstrate that 14-3-3 proteins play a critical role in NMDAR synaptic trafficking by promoting surface delivery of NMDAR subunits GluN1, GluN2A, and GluN2B. 14-3-3 proteins also play a role in dendritic spines and dendritic structure dynamics by acting on the 14-3-3/cofilin signaling pathway, with alterations reported to be hallmark features of schizophrenia. As NMDAR hypofunctionality is known to act as a convergence point for the progression of symptoms of schizophrenia, further studies on these signaling pathways may help understand how dysfunction of 14-3-3 proteins can cause NMDAR hypofunctionality and lead to schizophrenia-associated behaviors. In addition, understanding how 14-3-3 proteins may also act on neuroanatomical changes related to schizophrenia, possibly through its role in actin dynamics, will help determine novel therapeutic targets for schizophrenia. The work presented contributes to the development of animal models and novel therapeutic targets to further understand the importance of glutamatergic neurotransmission as modified by the interaction between 14-3-3 proteins and NMDARs and how it relates to neuropsychiatric disorders. Collectively, these data provide a potential link between 14-3-3 dysfunction, NMDAR synaptic trafficking, NMDAR hypofunctionality, actin dynamics, and schizophrenia-associated behavioral deficits.

            <DISS_para>Bayesian additive regression trees(BART) provides flexible approach to fitting a variety of regression models while avoiding strong parametric assumptions. The sum-of-trees model is embedded in a Bayesian inferential framework to support uncertainty quantification and provide a principled approach to regularization through prior specification. This dissertation presents two extensions of BART. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The first extension builds a Bayesian nonparametric model for conditional density regression. The generative model used is based on rejection sampling from a base model. Like other BART models, this model is flexible, has a default prior specification, and is computationally convenient. To address the distinguished role of the response in our BART extension, we further introduce an approach to targeted smoothing of BART models which is possibly of independent interest. We study the proposed model theoretically and provide sufficient conditions for the posterior distributions to concentrate at close to minimax optimal rate adaptively over smoothness classes in the high-dimensional regime in which many predictors are irrelevant. To fit our model, we propose a data augmentation algorithm which allows for existing BART samplers to be extended with minimal effort. We illustrate the performance of our methodology on simulated data and use it to study the relationship between education and body mass index using data from the medical expenditure panel survey(MEPS).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The second extension is a Bayesian nonparametric estimation of a survival time subject to right-censoring in the presence of potentially high-dimensional predictors. We argue that several approaches, such as random survival forests and existing Bayesian nonparametric approaches, possess several drawbacks, including: computational difficulties; lack of known theoretical properties; and ineffectiveness at filtering out irrelevant predictors. We propose two models based on the Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) framework. The first, Modulated BART (MBART), is fully-nonparametric and models the failure time as the first occurrence of a non-homogeneous Poisson process. The second, CoxBART, uses a Bayesian implementation of Cox’s partial likelihood. These models are adapted to high-dimensional predictors, have default prior specifications, and require simple modifications of existing BART methods to implement. We show the effectiveness of these methods on simulated and benchmark datasets. We also establish that, for a simplified variant of MBART, the posterior distribution contracts at a near-minimax optimal rate in a high-dimensional sparse asymptotic regime.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>  Ionizing radiation detection including X-rays and Gamma rays have widely applications on clinic diagnostic, security check, industrial inspection, and cosmic exploration. The core idea of sensing these “invisible” photons is transferring the incident photons into readable signals by semiconductors. Semiconductor photoconductors and scintillators such as amorphous selenium (a-Se), cadmium telluride (CdTe), and thallium doped sodium iodide (NaI:Tl), etc. are predominantly used in commercial ionizing radiation detectors. These materials are generally obtained through a high temperature, vacuum, and time-consuming producing processes that limits the scalable-processibility and contributes to the relatively high cost of such detectors.   In last decade, halide perovskite, a semiconducting compound (linear formula: ABX3, where A=Cs or MA; B=Pb; X=Cl, Br, I) with astounding optoelectronic properties and low-cost nature, has attracted a lot of attentions. Such compounds can be dissolved into certain organic solvents and its precursors can further be crystallized into single crystals and polycrystal thin films. Most importantly, high atomic number elements such as cesium and lead contained make the perovskite a potential candidate for ionizing radiation detection purpose. Therefore, this dissertation focusses on the perovskite-based radiation detectors.
  To develop a new semiconductor detector which consisting combined properties of scalable-processibility and high detection sensitivity, the idea of produce perovskite-polymer semiconductor composites is firstly introduced in this dissertation. Pre-synthesized perovskite microcrystals and various polymers (polystyrene, polylactic acid, polystyrene-polyisoprene-polystyrene) are evenly mixed to fabricate the semiconducting composites. The positive impact of polymer-assisted composite on its mechanical properties can be summarized from the results. Subsequently, the scalable manufacturing processes, which include but not limited to hot-molding, melt-extruding, and 3D printing methods, are discovered to fabricate the customized-shape composite devices.
  On the other hand, improving the optoelectrical properties of perovskite-polymer composite is another crucial task. A unique method is demonstrated in this dissertation to modify perovskite microcrystals’ surface for better dispersity of the perovskite microcrystals in composite. Followed by this, the perovskite/polymer ratios are also discussed for higher photon detection sensitivity. It is necessary to investigate charge carrier’s behavior in our composites, which include but not limit to charge carriers’ generation, separation, and transportation, within physical, chemical, and electrical interphases. Therefore, the mobility and lifetime of charge carriers (electrons and holes) are measured by Time-of Flight (TOF) technique. The mobility-lifetime product reaches to 10^(-4)~10^(-3) cm^(2)V^(-1), which can be compared with CdZnTe (CZT) based X-ray detectors. The Space Charge-Limited Current (SCLC) method and Many’s equation was used to support the data from the TOF technique, these mobility and lifetime values extracted by different methods are showing strong consistency.
  Finally, as a proof of concept, a lead-free halide double perovskite, where one Ag+ and one Bi3+ replace two neighboring Pb2+ sites in the unit cells of haloplumbate perovskites without destroying the corner-sharing metal-halide octahedral networks of perovskite crystals, is used to fabricate the X-ray detection device to eliminate the toxicity of lead halide perovskite. The composite processing method introduced previously is also employed to halide double perovskite, for achieving solution-processed and flexible X-ray detectors and imagers with higher sensitivities.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>As the standard formalism and powerful abstraction of networked data, graphs have been used to model and interpret structured information from protein interaction and program dependence, to business coordination and Internet topology. The proliferation of graphs has sparked a growing interest in enabling efficient accessmethods and flexible, structure-aware querying capabilities on large
graphs. 
In order to account for noisy and distorted information arising unavoidably
in real-world graphs, and to virtually any graph management tasks,
it is essential and highly desirable to enable locating user-specified graph patterns
on large graphs.
In this thesis, we worked on subgraph query and similarity search problems on large graphs.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In our first project, we worked on subgraph query problem. We consider subgraph querying with the availability ofquery workload information,  $W = \{w_1, \ldots, w_n\}$,
where $w_i \in W$ is a previously issued query with all its subgraph-isomorphic embeddings
identified and cached beforehand.
%
Given a new query $q$, our goal is to exploit $W$
for subgraph query processing and optimization of $q$ in $g$.
We introduce a new, workload-aware subgraph querying framework, \wasq\
(\textbf{W}orkload-\textbf{a}ware \textbf{S}ubgraph \textbf{Q}uerying),
built upon key insights that query workload can be
effectively leveraged for subgraph query rewriting, search plan refinement, partial results reusing,
and false-positive embedding filtering
toward expediting the whole subgraph querying process.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In our second project, we worked on the single-query based similarity search problem.Formally, given a graph database $\mathcal{G} = \{g_1, g_2, \ldots, g_n\}$
and a query graph $q$, we aim to search the graph $g_i \in \mathcal{G}$
such that the graph edit distance between $g_i$ and $q$, GED$(g_i, q)$,
is within a user-specified GED threshold, $\tau$.
We propose a \emph{parameterized}, partition-based GED lower bound
that can be instantiated into a series of tight lower bounds
towards synergistically pruning false-positive graphs from $\mathcal{G}$
before costly GED computation is performed.
We design an efficient, \emph{selectivity-aware} algorithm
to partition graphs of $\mathcal{G}$ into highly selective subgraphs.
They are further incorporated in a cost-effective, multi-layered indexing structure,
\mlindex\ (\textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{L}ayered \textbf{I}ndex),
for GED lower bound crosschecking and false-positive graph filtering
with theoretical performance guarantees.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In our third project, we consider the \textit{multi-query optimization} problem,where a set of graph similarity queries,
modeled by the well-known graph edit distance (GED) constraint,
are posed against a graph database.
We examine a new approach to enhancing \emph{collective} pruning and querying capabilities
for graph similarity search in a \textit{multi-query} scenario.
In light of the key observation that relates varying-size frequent and rare subgraph patterns to
(mis)matching partitions, we select in a principled way salient features
to enable \emph{selectivity-aware, feature-based} graph partitioning, leading to
enhanced filtering capabilities for multi-query optimization.
Furthermore, we propose multi-query grouping and ordering techniques to further
speedup multi-query processing.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Background: Individuals with schizophrenia are at increased risk for suicide, with research showing insight into one’s schizophrenia to elicit depression and hopelessness, both established risk factors for suicide. The present study hypothesized that insight into one’s schizophrenia may lead to suicidal ideation by way of demoralization. Namely, a hopeless awareness of functional deterioration post-illness-onset may prompt a threat to one’s previous sense of identity, thereby causing suicidal ideation. Methods: 119 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder completed self-report measures of insight into their illness, demoralization, and suicidal ideation. Additionally, premorbid and current cognitive functioning were assessed. We predicted that demoralization, insight into one’s schizophrenia, current cognitive functioning, and cognitive deterioration (i.e., the difference in cognitive performance before and after illness-onset) would each relate to increased suicidal ideation. Next, three separate models explored the mediating role of demoralization on suicidal ideation: with suicidal ideation entered as the dependent variable and demoralization entered as the mediator in each model, the first model included insight into illness (i.e., a relatively subjective measure) as the independent variable, the second included current cognitive functioning (i.e., a relatively objective measure) as the independent variable, and the third included shift in cognitive functioning (i.e., the difference between premorbid and post-illness-onset cognitive functioning) as the independent variable. Results: Consistent with our hypothesis, greater demoralization led to increased suicidal ideation (B= .028, SE= .01, p &lt;.01). However, contrary to our prediction, insight into illness did not lead to demoralization (B= -.86, SE= 1.81, p=.64), nor was insight correlated with suicidal ideation (r= .159, p=.238). Additionally, greater cognitive functioning predicted decreased demoralization (B= -.78, SE=.36, p=.04), rather than the hypothesized increase. Similarly, a relationship between cognitive performance and suicidal ideation represented a non-significant trend (r -.259, p=.052). Finally, shift in cognitive performance did not lead to either demoralization or to suicidal ideation. Demoralization did not mediate any relationships. Conclusions: In the present sample, insight into illness did not predict either demoralization or suicidal ideation. Additionally, while previous work has found increased cognitive performance to be a risk factor for suicidal ideation in schizophrenia, in our sample, cognitive performance was associated with both decreased demoralization as well as decreased suicidal ideation. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this dissertation, we introduce a model that we call the Bayesian wavelet neural network (BWNN) for variable selection in the sparsely observed spatio-temporal data setting. Our first attempts were motivated by a process augmentation approach and forward selection, and also included an approach based on the use of credible intervals. Simulation studies indicated several drawbacks of these methods, which motivated many components of the BWNN. The BWNN's first layer models an initial representation of the latent process with a spatial mixed effects model (SME). Then, the BWNN includes a layer defined by the Spike-and-slab (SS) method, which is a well-known Bayesian variable selection method. The SS method represents an initial selection of basis functions and covariates in the  BWNN. An additional layer is included to select the final set of features (i.e., basis functions and covariates). This layer is another motivating component of BWNN since the SS (by itself) does not use a single set of selected features for modeling. The final layer of the BWNN uses the selected features in a SME model. We demonstrate how to construct the BWNN, and test its prediction accuracy and variable selection ability through various examples. We then fit the BWNN model to GPA data, a motivating dataset of BWNN development, where the data is highly sparse over space and time. Motivated by the BWNN's use of wavelets, we consider BWNN as a new type of wavelet threshold method, which we investigate empirically. Specifically, we make comparisons between BWNN and existing wavelet threshold methods and show empirical results.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Modern technology demands new materials with superior properties and novel functionalities. Porous materials have great potential in applications with functionalities, such as energy absorption, sound absorption, thermal insulation, catalysis, molecular separation, and emerging energy and health monitoring technologies. Conventional porous materials have been studied for many decades. In recent years, they have also emerged as novel functional materials with unique properties. This dissertation focused on both three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) porous materials as functional materials. New functional porous materials will focus on the function-led design of the porous structures, including auxetic materials, flexible porous sensors, and flexible porous thermal protection materials. Also, the raw materials of porous structures are another critical parameter to affect the performance of foam materials. The methods of fabricating different kinds of porous materials are described later in detail. The experimental and modeling results focus on the mechanics of the porous structures, tunable mechanical properties, and functional performance, including extraordinary energy absorption capabilities, ultralight thermal insulation capabilities, and flexible sensing properties. Applications in industrial areas and future prospects were also discussed. 
Followed by a brief introduction (Chapter One) and literature review (Chapter Two), 3D porous materials were explored as novel pseudo-piezoelectric materials in Chapter Three. A low-cost fabrication method was developed to produce hybrid cyclic olefin copolymer (COC) / polypropylene (PP) piezoelectric foams. The hybrid piezoelectric foam was shown to maintain excellent piezoelectric properties. At the same time, the hybrid piezoelectric foams also exhibited markedly improved thermal stability. The mechanics of the hybrid foam was studied and discussed in this chapter. The hybrid piezoelectret combines the advantages of both components, namely, COC’s superior charge-storage properties and PP’s good flexibility and low cost.
In Chapter Four, a new class of 3D hybrid porous materials, auxetic foams, has been designed and fabricated. Here, hybrid auxetic foams with buckling porous architectures were made with polyurethane and phenolic resins. The hybrid foams combine extraordinary mechanical properties, e.g., substantially improved strength, modulus, and energy dissipation. The hybrid foams exhibited a unique near-zero Poisson’s ratio behavior. The hybrid foams have superior functions due to the dual-material 3D systems that show high stiffness of the phenolic resin and flexibility of polyurethane-based auxetic porous foams. Finite element analysis (FEA) showed that the near-zero Poisson’s ratio behavior resulted from the mismatch of the mechanical properties of the two constituent polymers and the change of the deformation mechanism.
Carbon nanotubes (CNT) are advanced materials with extraordinary mechanical, thermal, and electrical performance. In this dissertation study, 2D CNTs porous networks are explored as force sensors (Chapter Five) and thermal protection materials (Chapter Six). Chapter Five describes a flexible piezoresistive strain sensor integrated by carbon fiber and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) porous thin films. Flexible sensors with tunable Poisson’s ratio were designed and validated through different carbon fiber stacking sequences. By varying the fiber layup, flexible carbon fiber composites showed a Negative Poisson’s ratio (NPR). The result shows that the negative Poisson's ratio of substrate composites enhances the sensor's sensitivity. The hybrid composite - CNT sensor shows a linear signal response, and the response is highly repeatable and reproducible with excellent sensor performance. This work provides valuable guidelines to design the negative Poisson’s ratio of carbon fiber composites. It demonstrates that flexible sensors with negative Poisson’s ratio have great potential for use in pressure sensing, health monitoring, and even human-computer interaction.
The CNT porous network also exhibits extraordinary thermal conductivity. Chapter Six discusses a systematic design of a porous CNT/phenolic thermal protection layer (TPL) with heat shield functionality while maintaining designed mechanical strength compared to traditional CFRP composites. These TPLs were integrated onto the surface of carbon fiber/bismaleimide composites. Hybrid composites with different TPL volume fractions were produced. The porous CNT network resulted in a 17% decrease in the through-thickness thermal conductivity for hybrid composites. A flame torch test was used to evaluate the thermal shield effectiveness. The hybrid composites showed a noticeable increase in residual flexural strength and modulus compared to the control samples under a heat flux of 20 W/cm2. It also discusses the effects of porous CNT networks’ coefficient of thermal expansion and protection mechanisms.

            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study is to answer the call for studies on the well-being of parents with adolescents and to gain further understanding of its influential mechanisms in family systems. Guided by family systems theory (Minuchin, 1974) and the ecological model of co-parenting (Feinberg, 2003), I proposed a conceptual path model linking co-parenting, parenting stress, marital problems, and parents’ mental health problems. Using a sample of 116 parents of adolescents from cross-sectional data (Parenting and Adolescents’ Well-Being project), I conducted Structural Equational Modeling to test the hypothesized model. Results supported my hypothesis that lower co-parenting quality was positively associated with parents’ mental health problems through parenting stress and marital problems. This study contributed to the field by raising awareness of parents’ psychological well-being, emphasizing the central role of co-parenting of adolescents in its relation to parents’ mental health problems, and examining parenting stress and marital problems as essential linking mechanisms. The findings from the present study could inform clinicians and therapists regarding the design of prevention and intervention programs aiming to promote better psychological health of parents of adolescent children.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Low retention of school-based speech-language pathologists (SLPs) is a growing problem that can have drastic consequences at the school and student levels. Factors contributing to this shortage include features of the work environment, role ambiguity, low salaries, and a demanding workload with higher caseloads, which can result in limited time for paperwork and lesson planning for optimal service delivery models. Over time, these factors can lead to job stress and burnout in the profession. Although self-care and self-awareness techniques are viable sources of stress reduction, social support is a work-level resource that has an established effect on occupational stress and burnout with direct implementation in the work setting. Social support can serve as a valid buffer for job-related stressors. However, it is still unknown if social support can reduce stress and burnout symptoms specifically for school-based SLPs. The aim of the current study was twofold: (1) to determine the current levels and predictors of occupational stress and burnout SLPs are experiencing, and (2) to determine the effect of social support on SLPs’ reported occupational stress and burnout symptoms. Using a cross-sectional survey design, 453 school-based SLPs from across the United States reported their workload manageability, career intentions, access to social support, and their stress and burnout levels. Results indicated that SLPs, on average, reported overall stress levels in the somewhat noticeable range, moderate access to social support, high levels of emotional exhaustion, low to moderate feelings of depersonalization, and moderate to high feelings of personal accomplishments. Using a subsample of participants from the survey and a randomized control trial design, forty-six participants participated in a weekly social support group program called PSSST! Let’s Talk. They were randomly assigned into two groups: a treatment group and a delayed treatment group. The data did not reveal significant post-test differences between the treatment and delayed treatment groups. However, change across post-and delayed post-intervention for the treatment group was observed. Implications, limitations, and future directions of this work are discussed.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Health outcomes within the United States continue to widen showing an ever-growing gap between states when it comes to population health. Over the past three decades research conducted on population health primarily focused on individual characteristics and attitudes that affect and influence health. The role that the state plays in population health mortality is largely absent in research. A more complete picture is needed to understand the variability in health outcomes from a lens considering both individual and state level influences. This dissertation utilizes the social determinants health framework and the World Health Organizations Healthy People 2020 to identify three major themes, each uniquely assessing key social determinants at the state level to provide insight into the role that states play in population health regarding key cardio-metabolic conditions of interest. This dissertation provides results suggesting that the role that place plays in cardio-metabolic conditions is dependent upon a complex system of social determinants characteristic of the state in which individuals interact. This complex system impacts health to varying degrees and while individual educational attainment can moderate the impact, the state still plays a key role in overall population health. Results highlight that for some state level characteristic variables education matters more in areas that are more resource deprived, but for other state characteristics, education matters more in areas with greater resource potential. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Stem cells have been proven to be an essential part of the human body when it comes to growth, development, maintenance, and repair. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are programmed to behave and differentiate with the simialr capabilities as embryonic stem cells, which are known to be able to differentiate into all cell types and can be cultured for an extended amount of time. Research has led to the concept that hiPSCs can be used for medical purposes directly through injection, but there are possible serious difficulties including immune rejection and teratoma formation. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are now shown to be the mechanism and machinery behind stem cells repairative properties. Loaded with proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids, EVs contain cargo that affect the cells that are targeted by them and diseases like cancer use EVs to propagate the growth of tumor cells.           Today, one of the most difficult areas of the body to repair with medicine or treatment is the central nervous system (CNS). A few specific CNS disorders include Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s diesease, stroke, and others. A common factor that is seen in all these cases is that there is damage to the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the only major protection that the CNS has from the blood in your body. It separates the conditions of blood from the CNS as the physicological changes that occur in the blood would be damaging to nerve cells. EVs have been shown to have positive effects on damaged CNS cells, specifically when using EVs derived from the same cell type. The main issue with using EVs is that there is little data explaining their targeting capabilities in vivo as tracking has been proven difficult. Iron oxide nanoparticles have gained much interest due to their biocompatibility and can be visualized with magnetic resonance imaging. Now EVs need to be studied to see if they have the ability to transmigrate across the BBB through specific mechanisms.
It is essential that a BBB model can be constructed in vitro in order to examine EV transmigration. The BBB is made up of four cell types that construct what is called the neurovascular unit and includes brain microvascular endothelial cells and pericytes (and astrocytes and neurons). Together, these two cells work together to maintain the structure and barrier properties of the BBB. These cells are differentiated from undifferentiated hiPSCs and co-cultured to form the BBB phenotype. This project derived and characterized brain pericytes and endothelial cells from hiPSCs as well as co-cultured the derived cells. A good in vitro BBB model that exhibits proper trans endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) that are comparable to in vivo BBB along with EVs loaded with iron oxide allows for an acceptable representation of how this interaction would occur in vivo. Overall this project should further our comprehension of how EVs interact with the BBB and if they indeed transmigrate across the BBB, leading to advances in medicine and EV-related therapy and drug delivery.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>During the twentieth century, American literature witnessed a transformation in representations of apocalypticism and nature. The apocalypse changed from a theological, divine force to a secular, manmade crisis and nature was no longer an active agent as evil menace or nurturing mother but was rendered wholly indifferent. In both modernist representations of apocalypse and nature what became noticeably missing was God and the soul. In works of Southern literature that portray eco-catastrophe, however, God and the soul were never lost. In looking at the ecological tropes of Southern literature during this period, I find that writers access the immaterial world through the particularities of the Southern environment. Whereas the Transcendentalists of nineteenth-century New England considered nature as a medium for transcendence or a place of spectral visitors, the focus remained on our material world—how the immaterial encroaches upon the material. Representations of theological forces within the South at the turn of the twentieth century represented Southern nature as creating a portal into the underworld—Southern grotesque material fading into the immaterial. As part of the larger discourse on environmental apocalypse, this dissertation outlines an ecotheology of the South. Through this ecotheological lens, I analyze eschatological events in Southern literature to steer current ecocritical and Southern Studies discourse away from the spectacle of disaster and toward a narrative of resilience during times of environmental devastation and revelation. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become a prevailing technique at the interface of structural and cell biology. The current resolution revolution in cryo-EM has led to a surge of structures determination at near-atomic resolution. The advancements have allowed to visualize the small-molecule ligands bound to the macromolecules and provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of complex biochemical processes. Chapter 1 reviews the cryo-EM single-particle analysis along with the recent advances of this technique. In Chapter 2, we have used single-particle cryo-EM to determine the Escherichia coli 70S ribosome structure bound to small molecule inhibitor KKL-2098. KKL-2098 has shown to have antibiotic properties, and it inhibits the trans-translation activity of bacteria seen in many pathogenic strains, including antibiotic-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The structure is resolved at a global resolution of 3.1 Å, and the map reveals the positioning of the L-27 N-terminus in an unprecedented ribosomal site (Movie1: Conformational Change of bL27). The map and the model of the bacterial ribosome bound to the KKL-2098 allow a deeper analysis of the antibiotic-resistant activity of ribosomes and ultimately improve drug design. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>One limitation of cryo-EM is its restriction to visualize relatively thin samples. This limitation leaves the molecular organization of eukaryotes largely unexplored. Cryo-focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) milling is a cell thinning method implemented in cell biology in less than a decade. Cryo-FIB significantly expanded the range of samples that can be analyzed by cryo-EM. The technique is at the early stages of development and is prone to several limitations. Chapter 3 reviews cryo-electron tomography and the application of cryo-FIB milling.  Chapter 4 discusses how cryo-EM has advanced the field of the structural biology of vesicle trafficking complexes and membrane remodelling. This chapter highlights the remaining questions and future applications of cryo-FIB milling on the horizon to determine the structure of vesicle trafficking macromolecules in situ. Finally, in Chapter 5, we have implemented a cryo-FIB milling approach to visualize the in situ organization of the Trk-fused gene (TFG). TFG is involved in the process of COPII-mediated vesicle transport. Besides, it has been reported that TFG has a vital role in glucose homeostasis, and it controls insulin secretion in β-cell in vivo by multiple mechanisms. Despite challenges associated with the set-up of cryo-FIB milling on site, we have successfully established a workflow of milling 200-nm thin lamella and demonstrated that these lamellae are applicable to provide insight into various cellular pathways. Our tomograms are rich in showing the featureful structure of early secretory pathways and components of vesicle trafficking, including vesicles coats (COPI, COPII), endoplasmic reticulum exit sites, ER bound ribosomes, Lysosomes (Movie 2: Tomogram Revealing the Cellular Landscape of RPE Cell Line) and Golgi stacks. In addition, we observe phase-separated regions near the ER-exit site, which is consistent with the earlier studies demonstrating the meshwork structure of TFG. We have further observations, including the hypertrophy of mitochondria and more extensive membrane recruitment when TFG is overexpressed compared to the wild-type strain. This can explain the additional functional impact of TFG in regulating cell metabolism. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This work proposes that the biodiversity crisis that has been documented in recent years in the Amazon is directly related to the ideas about the use of nature that the first European explorers, conquerors, and settlers proposed about the region. Chapter 1 studies the first European descriptions of the Amazon and the way in which they focused on highlighting the abundance and diversity of nature as a source of resource extraction and implementation of exogenous production models. It is proposed that these explorers, who described the indigenous people as passive entities that did not have the knowledge or the character to make the land produce, acted as prospectors of nature, in search of species and ecosystems that they could appropriate. This idea assumes that humans are separated from nature, and justifies the exploitation of biodiversity for the benefit of capital accumulation.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapters 2 and 3 study the initiatives that have emerged in two National Reserves of the Peruvian Amazon, where the State, communities, and businessmen have partnered to face the loss of biodiversity, and to approach nature in apparently different. In these communities, natural resource co-management programs have been implemented that show encouraging results in terms of the recovery of biodiversity and the generation of direct and indirect economic benefits for some sectors, through the conservation and controlled exploitation of species with commercial value. However, at the end of Chapter 3 it is shown that these conservation strategies are based on the principles of exploitation of the land and its inhabitants imposed by European explorers and conquerors, thus questioning the sustainability of these systems, and proposes that these strategies are a remnant of some of the productive models that were violently proposed on Amazonian species and communities.In Chapter 4, other perceptions and practices of the original Amazonian inhabitants are exposed and analyzed, reflected in their symbolic narratives, and in radical contrast with the Eurocentric vision. These visions, mostly rooted in the economic narratives of modernity, actually constitute variations of systems of exploitation of people and natural resources, such as empowerment and patronage, where a few people benefit at the cost of work and the oppression of communities. Amazonian.
  The conclusions explore the separation between the human species and other species, and highlight the importance of listening to indigenous peoples as a way of responding to the current bi-diversity crisis. It highlights the importance of biodiversity as a whole and of each species in particular, and argues that it is imperative to relate to Amazonian nature in a different way than we have been doing to implement new forms of environmental protection and restoration.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This thesis will discuss the increasing threat that climate change poses to archaeological sites through sea level rise and erosion. This will provide background on the effects climate change will have on site preservation and destruction. It will assess specific risks that climate change poses to the Hog Island Spit site (LV00087) and how the site has changed over time. Previous records of the site will be shown in comparison to the present state of the site. I will be using GIS to conduct shoreline mapping of the site presently and discuss the changes that may or may not have occurred, and possible causes if change is present. Finally, I will explain the relevance of the work done at Hog Island to other barrier island sites in the area. I will conclude with a call to bring greater attention to at risk sites, which will need to be documented in the coming years or we risk losing them altogether.

            <DISS_para>In two previous studies, Folstein et al. (2017) and Folstein and Monfared (2019), we trained participants to categorize a set of novel cartoon alien animals based on their visual features. After training periods of different length, they performed a target detection task on the trained stimulus set and an untrained stimulus set in an EEG session. Previous analysis focused on ERP components including the selection negativity (SN) and the N250, which are thought to represent attentional selection of stimulus features and formation of new representations of learned stimuli. Findings from both studies suggest that category learning did not have much impact on how selective attention, as reflected by the SN, was applied to stimulus features. The effect of training, however, differed between the two studies. In Folstein et al. (2017), training enhanced the N250, whereas in Folstein and Monfared (2019), two separate components, the N200 and the N320, were enhanced by training.In the current study, we reanalyzed the existing EEG data using a Multivariate Pattern Analysis (MVPA) decoding approach, which allowed us to examine the temporal characteristics of the training and attentional effects with greater sensitivity. We found that the training effects and the attentional selection of target features were independent processes. Although training-related ERP components were different between the two previous studies, MVPA findings suggest that the training effects had similar time courses between the two studies but differed in scalp distributions. Moreover, the pre-200 msec training effect from MVPA results suggest the possibility of an N170 in the EEG, which was not detected in previous studies. Current findings also support that the N200 and N320 represent distinct neural processes indexing the training effect.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Studying of relativistic particles in the condensed matter system became possible after adiscovery of graphene in 2004. What follows from graphene was search for other materials
hosting relativistic particles, such as Dirac semimetals and Weyl semimetals. Low energy
fermionic excitations of such materials show linear energy-momentum dispersion relationship, which can be described by the Dirac and Weyl Hamiltonians. In this dissertation, we
utilize low temperature magneto-infrared spectroscopy to obtain detailed understanding of
band dispersion of the Dirac and Weyl semimetals.
Low energy electronic band structures of Weyl semimetals consist of two non-degenerated
linear bands with crossing points, which is called Weyl bands. Weyl semimetals can be categorized into type-I and type-II depending on degree of tilting of the Weyl bands. In the first
part of this dissertation, we present magneto-optical spectroscopy experiment on a archetypical type-I Weyl semimetal, NbP. We observed a complicated structure of inter-Landau level
transitions, which only can be satisfactorily explained by a newly proposed Weyl Hamiltonian model, which includes tilting effect. Our work demonstrates that Weyl band of NbP is
strongly tilted from ideal type-I case and a theoretical model with effect of tilting can give
accurate information of Weyl band structures.
A zinc-blende crystal of HgCdTe has been known to have highly tunable band structure
as a function of cadmium content and temperature. At optimal concentration and temperature, band structure is predicted to show linear band dispersion. Band structures of
HgCdTe have been successfully described by Kane model, thus, quasiparicles in the system are called Kane fermions. Here, in the second part of the thesis, we study chemical
composition and temperature dependent band structure evolution of Hg1−xCdxTe through
magneto-optical spectroscopy. Our observation proves that the Kane fermions in HgCdTe
become true massless quasiparticles at a specific condition.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Precast prestressed concrete members are widely used in civil engineering structures around the world with growing demand in the last few years due to the rapid urbanization and industrialization driving an increase in infrastructure projects. Precast pre-tensioned concrete members are especially beneficial for accelerated bridge construction (ABC) methods because of the reduction of cost, less traffic interference, and faster project development that are enabled by precasting the elements off-site. New technologies and emerging materials (e.g. high strength stainless steel strands) have recently been introduced to the construction industry as an alternative to corrosion resistance prestressing. However, the detensioning procedures during the load transfer in the precasting yard have not yet been studied for the implementation of such materials.
In the casting beds, once the strands have been tensioned to the desired prestressing force and the concrete has been placed and achieved the necessary compressive strength, then the detensioning of strands takes place. This process transfers the prestressing force from the bulkhead of the precasting bed to the concrete member. This detensioning procedure can be accomplished by saw cutting the strands with a hydraulic pump, or by means of a flame torch. If the strands are abruptly cut using the saw cut method, the sudden release of pretensioning force may cause damage at the end of the member, slippage, and an increase in strand development length. Therefore, it is generally recommended to gradually detension the strands using a torch while following a symmetrical pattern to guarantee that the force is being transferred to the member with no damage. For efficiency reasons and to improve the economy of the process, multiple concrete members are usually cast in series using a long casting bed, in which all strands are placed along the length of the bed and tensioned. Once the concrete has reached the required strength for transfer (in some cases 24h after casting), the strands are cut in between and at the ends of the members. This transfers the load to each concrete member.For large members with multiple layers of prestressing strands, the strands sometimes break between the end of the concrete member and the bulkhead during the detensioning process. The strand rupture occurs due to the accumulation of elastic shortening of the concrete member as each strand transfers its force into the concrete. In consequence, the successively increased shortening of the concrete member amplifies the tensile strain in the remaining uncut strands.
For concrete elements in harsh environments, high-strength stainless steel (HSSS) prestressing strands are being implemented with the goal of producing longer lasting structures. However, HSSS strands have some disadvantages compared to the generally used carbon steel strands. HSSS strands elongate more compared to regular carbon steel strands and have a much lower ultimate breaking strain.The risk of yielding leading to breakage during the detensioning process needs to be studied, as precasters are unfamiliar with this new material. The reduction in ultimate yielding strain significantly affects the pretensioning properties of the stainless steel strands, and it may increase the risk of rupture arising from the elastic shortening of the concrete member. This study aims to evaluate the yielding of the remaining uncut strands during the detensioning process based on the properties of both carbon steel strands and high strength stainless steel strands in large precast prestressed concrete members. Characteristics such as the number of strands, free length between the member and bulkhead, detensioning procedures, and the concrete member span length are considered the driving factors for the potential yielding and failure of strands during the load transfer process due to the additional tensile strain in the uncut strands caused by the shortening of the concrete member. A parametric study was created to extensively analyze the elastic shortening of the concrete using different beam sizes and number of strand. Finally, the strains in the uncut strands were compared to the yielding strain of HSSS strands to determine how many strands could be cut before the uncut strands yield. The yielding strain was chosen as the limiting strain, because thereafter strains are in the nonlinear range and cause permanent deformation, and because relatively little strain capacity remains after yielding until breakage occurs -- compared to carbon steel strands. Ultimately, this study provides conclusions and recommendations to improve the practices during the detensioning process to help ensure a smooth implementation of high-strength stainless steel strands in the precast prestressed concrete industry.	</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Background: Undernutrition and anemia are comorbid conditions. The anemia associated with undernutrition is often attributed to increased rates of infection; however, iron deficiency is also common in areas where undernutrition is prevalent. A limited number of studies have shown that undernutrition reduces dietary iron absorption, which may be mediated by increases in the iron regulatory hormone hepcidin. Findings from these studies suggest that increases in hepcidin with undernutrition are independent of the traditional signaling pathways involved in the control of hepcidin synthesis (dietary iron intake and infection/inflammation) and occur in response to gluconeogenic signals. In situations of undernutrition, gluconeogenesis may be activated as glycogen stores are depleted and hepcidin-mediated declines in ferroportin may inhibit iron recycling and dietary iron from entering portal circulation. 
Objective: The primary objective of the current study was to determine the effects of varying severities and durations of energy restriction on hepcidin and iron homeostasis in male and female mice. 
Methods: Fourteen-week-old male and female C57BL/6 mice (n=180) were randomized
into 7 diet groups: ad libitum and varying levels of energy restriction (10%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%,100% energy restriction, n=10/diet). Feed was split into 2 meals provided in the morning and evening and was calculated based on the feed consumed by the ad libitum males or females, respectively. Mice were fed their respective diets for up to 3 weeks. 
Results: At 48 h, liver hepcidin mRNA increased 4-fold (P&lt;0.01) and serum hepcidin increased by 55% (P&lt;0.005) with 100% energy restriction compared to mice fed ad libitum. At 3 weeks, there was a similar 4-fold increase in liver hepcidin mRNA with both 10% (P&lt;0.01) and 20% (P&lt;0.01) energy restriction, and serum hepcidin increased by 30% with 10% (P=0.083) and 20% (P=0.099) energy restriction. Exploratory analyses revealed sex differences where serum hepcidin increased by 55% (P=0.01) and 63% (P&lt;0.01) with 10% and 20% energy restriction, respectively, in male mice but not female mice. Serum iron declined with energy restriction at 48 h (P=0.04), but there were no post-hoc differences. At 3 weeks, serum iron was reduced with both 10% (P&lt;0.05) and 20% (P&lt;0.01) energy restriction compared to mice fed ad libitum. At 48 h, serum hepcidin was positively correlated with liver hepcidin mRNA (R=0.361, P=0.005) and c-reactive protein (R=0.286, P=0.031), but was not correlated with liver gluconeogenic enzymes. At 3 weeks, serum hepcidin was positively correlated with liver hepcidin mRNA (R=0.539, P&lt;0.0001), and the liver gluconeogenic enzymes Pck1 (R=0.461, P=0.003), Creb3l3 (R=0.590, P&lt;0.0001), Pygl (R=0.569, P&lt;0.0001), and Ppargc1a (R=0.357, P=0.026); and negatively correlated with change in bodyweight (R= –0.436, P=0.006), lean mass (R= –0.408, P=0.010), fat mass (R= –0.414, P=0.009), liver weight (R= –0.502, P=0.001), and gastrocnemius weight (R= –0.382, P=0.017). 
Conclusions: These findings provide support for gluconeogenesis as a physiologically significant stimulator of hepcidin, even with mild-to-moderate energy restriction of 10-20%. If mild-to-moderate undernutrition increases hepcidin similarly in humans, these findings may provide a possible mechanism for the increased rates of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia observed in undernourished populations.

            <DISS_para>Escherichia coli NADPH-dependent assimilatory sulfite reductase, SiR, provides reduced sulfur for assimilation into biomass. The ability of SiR to perform its high-volume electron transfer reaction without the release of partially reduced sulfur-oxygen intermediates is hypothesized to be the result of its unique stoichiometry and inherent flexibility that enable a cis/trans electron transfer mechanism. SiR is comprised of an octameric flavoprotein, SiRFP, and four copies of a hemoprotein, SiRHP, that assemble in an 8:4 complex. NADPH donates electrons to SiRFP, where they are stored and transferred between domains before being transferred to SiRHP, the site of sulfur reduction. The flavin-binding domains of SiRFP, known as the FNR and Fld domains, are connected by a flexible linker, whereas the N-terminal domain is responsible for octamerization. Sulfite is reduced by six electrons before being released from SiRHP’s active site as sulfide. How this metalloflavoprotein performs its reaction with such efficiency is incompletely understood. This dissertation analyzes the structure and function of SiR using a combination of structural, biochemical, and biophysical techniques in order to better understand this dynamic oxidoreductase. Thus, Chapter 1 serves as an introduction into what is currently known of SiR.Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) features prominently throughout this dissertation and will be discussed at length in Chapter 2. This technique is used to elucidate the solution structures of SiR proteins, showing monomeric SiRFP to have an extended conformation as oxidized, counter to its diflavin reductase. The extended conformation of SiRFP is conducive to productive electron transfer to neighboring subunits in its higher-order complexes. Previous studies show that an internal truncation of SiRFP’s flexible linker diminishes sulfur-reducing activity in SiR heterodimer but not in the holoenzyme. Anaerobic reduction assays on SiRFP variants are analyzed by UV-Visible spectrophotometry and show that its flavins are capable of being reduced by both dithionite and NADPH in the face of the internal truncation, which supports the notion that electron transfer may occur inter- and intramolecularly between SiRFP domains. These studies are described in detail throughout Chapter 3. In Chapter 4, SANS of reduced SiRFP monomer reveals a novel conformation, placing its Fld domain close to the binding interface with SiRHP. The transition between open and closed conformations by SiRFP upon reduction is not unprecedented, as demonstrated by its diflavin reductase homologs.
Chapter 4 also includes neutron scattering studies that provide the first solution structure for a SiR heterodimer with assignments for the positions of each subunit and their domains. To confirm subunit and domain assignments within those structures, neutron contrast variation is used to further elucidate each subunit. In this approach, deuterium labeling of SiRHP, in vitro reconstitution of complexes with partially deuterated SiRHP and hydrogenated SiRFP subunits, and alteration of solvent H2O:D2O ratios allow for the manipulation of neutron contrast and the obtainment of isolated scattering profiles for each component of SiR. These experiments also show that SiRFP adopts an extended confirmation upon binding SiRHP and SiRHP becomes more compact.
Structural details of higher-order assemblies of SiR, namely, octameric SiRFP and the dodecameric holoenzyme, have proven challenging to obtain. Chapter 5 presents the results of  SANS measurements of these complexes, combined with contrast variation, that yielded the overall size, shape, and conformation of SiR in solution. Combined with analytical ultracentrifugation, the long-hypothesized stoichiometry of SiR is confirmed to be 8:4. The SiR dodecamer exhibits flexibility, adopting a heterogeneous ensemble of subunit orientations and domain conformations. SiRFP’s structure undergoes a global compaction upon complex formation with SiRHP and SiRHP subunits that exist in a dynamic range of positions. SiRHP exists in peripheral locations about the complex as well as positions that may approach one another. The centers of mass of SiRFP and SiRHP are separated from one another in the holoenzyme, suggesting SiR is an asymmetric complex. Together, these results represent an initial mapping of SiR’s structure and indicate a model for electron transfer in SiR that occurs in a cis and trans manner that may be further tested by studies informed upon the results described herein.
Moving forward, as described in Chapter 6, SANS of anaerobically reduced SiR may reveal redox-sensitive structural rearrangements not immediately obvious from measurements of oxidized enzyme. Additionally, high-resolution structures of SiR may be obtained by affinity capture using streptavidin monolayer electron microscopy grids, where biotinylated SiRFP octamer or SiR dodecamer become immobilized on 2D streptavidin monolayer-crystals before their analysis with cryogenic-electron microscopy (cryo-EM).

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The 4f and 5f electron states from the lanthanide (La - Lu) and actinide (Ac - Lr) elements area deep reservoir for novel physics. A variety of emergent states are seen in different f-element
containing materials including complex magnetism, strong hybridization between the f and conduction
electron states, unconventional superconductivity, and the coexistence of magnetism and
superconductivity. The f-state also has the potential to impact other fundamental characteristics
such as the crystal structure, melting temperature, and durability of a material, and this is especially
true for actinide elements. Indeed, it is these combined behaviors that cause f-element
materials to be so useful in everyday life where many technologies depend on them. Computers
and cell phones contain most of the lanthanide elements, while actinide materials help generate
power. New materials (e.g., topological insulators, thermoelectrics, and unconventional superconductors)
that contain f-elements are synthesized every day and may lead to further advancements
like quantum computers, more effcient energy storage, and more economical power generation and
transfer.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this dissertation, we present results from studies of several distinct families of f-electroncompounds including, (i) the growth and characterization of an europium{based compound that
forms in the ubiquitous ThCr2Si2 structure, (ii) a new uranium containing high entropy alloy
that exhibits superconductivity at low temperatures, and (iii) a study of the first NpTe1.75 single
crystals, which are related to the recently discovered `Lazarus' superconductor UTe2. For (i), we
find that changes in the immediate environment around an f state atom creates different magnetic
ground states and field induced effects. In (ii) we show that actinide elements can be incorporated
into high entropy alloys, and note (given the physical strength and chemical robustness of high
entropy alloys) that such inclusion may open the way towards new and safer nuclear waste forms.
Additionally, the high critical field superconductivity is explored. Finally, our work on NpTe1.75
reveals its structure and bulk magnetic properties, which we contrast with those of UTe2. This
work opens paths towards producing orthorhombic NpTe2 which might have similar properties to
orthorhombic UTe2. Taken together, each of these studies show how the interplay between crystal
structure and the f-state can influence material properties, further opening up materials study, where it remains an ongoing challenge to understand how to systematically produce interesting
behaviors in these materials.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation will be mainly exploring the relationship between polymer topology and ion transport properties of single-ion conductors (SICs) in lithium-ion battery application. Specifically, we strive to understand the impact of precise 5-carbon spacing on ion transports behavior of precision single-ion conductor.In chapter 2, the investigation was conducted on blending lithium sulfonate salt of precise 5-carbon spacing polymer electrolyte (p5PhS-Li) with poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), a popular solvating polymer. The highest ionic conductivity of this type of SIC was achieved on the order of 10-7 S/cm at 90 °C. Results from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) also indicated that polymer blends are at least partial miscible. The conclusion was made due to strong ionic interactions between sulfonate anions and lithium cations that lead to small magnitude of interaction parameter as well as melting point depression in PEO with complicating interpretation of transference number.
We were strived to improve the ionic conductivity of single-ion conductors by altering the chemical structures of anions from sulfonate to trifluoromethylsulfonylimide salt (TFSI) that has been shown to increase electrochemical, thermal stabilities and ionic conductivity in chapter 3. Upon characterizing with 1H NMR, 19F NMR and 13C NMR, the efficiency of post polymerization reaction was obtained as high as 90 %. The conversion of sulfonated into TFSI-containing SIC (p5PhTFSI-Li) was shown to improve thermal stability as well as plasticize by an appearance of glass transition temperature (Tg) with higher TFSI content corresponds to lower (Tg). The ionic conductivity of true SIC p5PhTFSI-Li was lower than previously studied p5PhS-Li which contradicted to our hypothesis. The improvement in ionic conductivity was only observed when p5PhTFSI-Li was doped with PEO. Study by DSC also revealed that no crystallinity in PEO was detected, and these blends exhibited a single Tg which is attributed to the miscible behavior of the components. X-ray scattering also complemented with DSC study as ionic aggregates are diluted by the introduction of PEO.
Realizing the immediate effect of PEO addition on the ionic conductivity of SICs, chapter 4 of the thesis further expands wider range of blend composition between PEO and p5PhTFSI-Li. Study by DSC reveals one single Tg for every blend composition which is consistent with results obtained from chapter 3. The addition of p5PhTFSI-Li retarded crystallization kinetics of PEO until it fully disrupted the crystalline phase of PEO, which proves that these two components provide greater compatibility than PEO/p5PhS-Li. Highest ionic conductivity of 6.37 x 10-4 S cm-1 was also obtained at 42 wt% of p5PhTFSI-Li, which is on par with that observed in literature TFSI-based SICs. Transference number was also observed to approach unity for experimented compositions. The future of p5PhTFSI-Li is wide open as the material will be investigated in block polymer as well as electrochemical stability.
Last but not least, a side project was researched on catechol-containing precision polymer in underwater adhesion applications in chapter 5. Even though the research was not timely done, the synthesis of catechol-containing precision polymer was investigated on monomer synthesis, thermodynamics of polymerization, efficiency of polymerization and copolymerization with a similar comonomer structure. This project will leave opportunities for incoming graduate student to take over and analyze the adhesion performance the catechol-containing precision polymer.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Mesoscale precipitation bands were investigated in 38 winter storms that impacted the northeast US between 2004 and 2015 in the GridRad reflectivity mosaic dataset and compared to simulated bands in the 12 km North American Mesoscale Model (NAM) at all forecast times. A total of 921 band timesteps were identified in GridRad and 3681 band timesteps were identified in NAM. Bands were classified by their appearance into embedded, isolated, broken, merged, fine scale, or heavy precipitation band types. These band types were further classified into multi-bands if two or more bands occurred alongside each other with similar band orientation angles and appearances. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Embedded bands were the most common band type, representing 72.4% of all bands in the radar dataset and 87.7% of all bands in the NAM for all storm cases. The remaining band types were well-represented in the radar mosaic but were captured less often in the NAM, likely due to the coarse model grid. The composite thermodynamic environment of the observed bands was studied using the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR), but the band types contained overlapping confidence intervals and did not significantly differ from each other. However, band angle and time relative to occlusion featured weak and moderate significant correlations with slantwise convective available potential energy (SCAPE). These relationships suggest that large values of SCAPE are more likely in northeasterly tilted bands compared to northwesterly tilted bands as well as bands that occur before occlusion. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The performance of NAM was evaluated against the observed bands in GridRad. NAM poorly resolved the observed bands at the analysis time and had even lower performance at greater lead times. By forecast hour 72, the threat score (TS) values fluctuated around 0, suggesting that almost all model skill regarding the prediction of mesoscale bands is lost. Model performance also varied according to the stage of cyclone development. TS values improved in the 5-20 hours following occlusion compared to the hours before and during occlusion. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To better understand the factors that affect model performance, the environment composing low and high skill events was investigated. The low skill environment consists of a single upper-level jet south of the surface low, while the high skill environment consists of a surface low favorably positioned within the ascending branch of two robust upper-level jet streaks. A case study of a low skill event demonstrated rapid error growth in the strength, position, and amplitude of the upper-level trough at forecast hours as early as 30 hours prior to the banding event. In comparison, a case study of a high skill event achieved similar levels of error growth as late as 60 hours prior to the banding event, with smaller error growth at earlier lead times. This would suggest that low and high skill banding events are characterized by short- and long-range predictability windows, likely due to biases in the positions of troughs and ridges within the large-scale synoptic flow. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation aims at contributing to conceptual debate about good lives by offering a framework for understanding the concepts that concern us here. I present a theory of the good lives in terms of well-functioning. A life that functions well is one that instantiates FAST processes. This name, “FAST,” is an acronym that stands for the four categories of elements that these processes are composed of: positive Feelings, positive Attitudes, Successful interactions with the world, and positive Traits. In such processes, these elements causally interact in a way that they create a self-maintaining process. When someone’s life instantiates this type of process, they have a good life. There are many ways of instantiating these processes, and therefore there are many ways one can have a good life. First, I will present some studies I conducted about the folk concept of well-being as an empirical effort to make progress in the debates. The results offer a diagnosis of the problems that beset the traditional approach to studying good lives: its exclusive reliance on intuitions. As a result, I adopt an interdisciplinary approach, in which attempts to make sense of our intuition as well as the science that investigates good lives. The resulting framework makes sense of Positive Psychology and its object of study. It understands good lives in terms of well-functioning lives and provides criteria to evaluate the plurality of normative categorizations  that have been used to understand good lives. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this thesis is to research and compile the five major religions in the United States in order to provide hospice music therapists with informative material on how the philosophies of those religions may affect a patient and family’s quality of care at end-of-life. Music and spirituality have intrinsic connections that are valuable in the field of hospice music therapy, where music may be used to accomplish a clinical, therapeutic, or spiritual goal. There is a high demand for culturally competent healthcare with the increasingly diverse cultures and ethnic populations in the US. The five major religions in the United States include Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Islam, and they will be analyzed according to the death system model described by Kastenbaum in 1977, which breaks down a death system into the places, people, times, objects and symbols that surround death philosophy in that system. Additional information was categorized for each religion in terms of overview and general beliefs, beliefs about death, end of life care, mourning and grieving, and hospice music therapy implications. The results provide an informative foundation for hospice music therapists to work with patients from one of the five major religions in the US and prompt music therapists and other professionals to seek cultural competency and cultural humility both professionally and interpersonally. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Purpose: Adequate skeletal perfusion is necessary to maintain bone remodeling processes and bone health. Natural aging leads to progressive bone loss, which may be associated with impaired bone vasomotor function and impaired perfusion. Although these age-related changes can be ameliorated by exercise training, the specific mechanisms underlying exercise-induced alterations of bone vasomotor function in advanced age remain unknown. The purpose of this study was to elucidate whether the exercise-induced vasomotor effects on the femoral principal nutrient artery (PNA) as well as bone blood flow are associated to bone structural adaptions in old age.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Methods: Young (4–6 mo old) and old (20–22 mo old) male Fischer-344 rats either did treadmill endurance exercise training (15 m/min, 15° incline, 60 min/day, 5 days/week) for 10–12 weeks or remained sedentary (SED) in cages. Multiple vasomotor functions were evaluated in femoral PNAs: 1) Endothelium-dependent vasodilation to acetylcholine (ACh) alone, or in the presence of eNOS inhibitors (L-NAME). 2) Endothelium-independent vasodilation was tested using the nitric oxide (NO) donor, Dea-NONOate. 3) Receptor-dependent vasoconstrictor responses was tested using the α-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine (PE). 4) Receptor-independent responses were examined using potassium chloride (KCl). 5) Finally, the pressure-induced myogenic responses (0 up to 100 mmHg) were also examined. Protein expression of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD1) were examined in femoral PNAs. Regional blood flow to the femur was also assessed at rest and during treadmill exercise. Lastly, trabecular bone structures of the distal femoral metaphysis were determined by micro-computed tomography.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Results: NO-mediated, endothelium-dependent vasodilation (ACh) and endothelium-independent relaxation (Dea-NONOate) were impaired by advanced age, but exercise training enhanced the response to ACh in femoral PNAs from both young and old rats. Age did not alter α-adrenergic receptor-dependent (PE) or independent (KCl) vasoconstrictor responses, whereas exercise training showed enhanced vasoconstrictor response to PE in old rats. In addition, advanced age impaired the pressure-sensitive myogenic response, while there was no alteration following exercise training in both young and old groups. Exercise training restored the age-induced decline of eNOS expression in femoral PNA by 55% from old rats, whereas age and exercise training had no effect on SOD1 expression (p&lt;0.05). Regional femur blood flow to the proximal and distal metaphysis and epiphysis, as well as diaphyseal marrow, were lower in old rats than in young rats at rest (-38%, -39%, and -39%, respectively), while exercise training led to increased blood flow (42%) to distal metaphysis and epiphysis in old rats. Moreover, exercise-trained old rats showed significantly increased regional blood flow during exercise compared to old SED rats (proximal distal metaphysis and epiphysis and diaphyseal marrow: 114%, 135% and 119%, respectively). This increased blood flow to the proximal and distal metaphysis and epiphysis was even higher in older exercise-trained rats than in young exercise-trained rats. Trabecular bone structures, including BV/TV, trabecular connectivity density, number, and separation (-30%, -66%, -35% and 68%, respectively) (p&lt;0.001) were deteriorated in the distal femoral metaphysis in old rats compared to young rats, while these bone properties were not altered with exercise training.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Conclusion: Taken together, the findings of this study demonstrated that vasomotor responses are impaired in the femoral PNAs of old rats, which are closely associated with age-induced alterations in bone structures. However, exercise training in old rats reversed the diminished vasomotor regulation, including vasodilator responses and enhanced regional bone and marrow blood flow. However, these exercise training-induced improvements in bone and marrow perfusion and vasodilator responsiveness do not appear to enhance the structural properties of trabecular bone in aged rats. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>An accurate understanding of the affective state people experience within the immediate suicidal context carries far reaching implications for how we conduct risk, as well as how we devise intervention strategies. Despite the limited evidence for affective pattern preceding suicidal behavior, the notion that most people feel intense negative affect (e.g., Baumeister, 1990; Shneidman, 1993) is largely accepted in the field. The present study aims to examine how people feel in the immediate context of suicidal behavior. Method: A total of 538 participants (179 past attempters, 231 past/current suicide ideators, and 128 participants with no past suicidality) were recruited. Past attempters were asked to rate their affective state during the most recent suicide attempt on three 0-100 visual sliding scales, each assessing positive and negative valence, and arousal.  We also tested whether prior suicide attempt-related factors—frequency and recency-- influence the individuals’ recalled affective experience. Finally, we explored the link between past suicidality and affective forecasting for future suicide context by comparing past attempters, ideators, and nonsuicidal participants in how they predicted to feel before a future suicide attempt.  Results: Overall, notable individual variabilities were found in how past attempters recalled feeling negative affect (M=84.43, SD= 20.27, range: 0-20); arousal (M=49.22, SD= 33.10) intensity between 40-60; and positive affect under 40 but above 0 (M=12.71, SD= 19.11). Attempters with more recent attempt history recalled significantly higher positive affect, while multiple attempters (vs. single attempters) recalled significantly higher arousal. Regarding forecasted affect for future suicide attempt, we found that attempters, ideators, and nonsuicidal individuals predicted similar intensity of negative and positive affect in a future suicidal context; only significant group difference emerged in arousal ratings with ideators predicting to feel higher intensity level of arousal than both past attempters and participants without past suicidality. Discussion: Implications and limitations of our study are further discussed. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Predictive modeling can help researchers tackle challenges such as detection, prevention, and treatment for diseases with high mortality rates such as cardiovascular diseases. These diseases involve multiple risk factors that make traditional risk score systems insufficient for an accurate and effective outcome prediction especially in the context of analyzing large multimodal heterogeneous data.  A significant increase in computational power has enabled researchers to investigate the benefits of applying artificial intelligence to predictive modeling for medicine and healthcare. Nevertheless, in medical practice, predictions made by a complex artificial intelligence-based model have to be validated by a human expert. Thus, the necessity of explainable artificial intelligence in medicine is increasing. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation accomplishes four research objectives. First, a systematic scoping review of explainable artificial intelligence models based on real-world electronic health records data is produced. The necessity of explainable artificial intelligence for medicine requires such a review of the state-of-the-art research in the field. The main goal is to provide insights into the current research trend by categorizing machine learning methods, explainable artificial intelligence methods, and machine learning prediction tasks. Also, reproducibility and interpretability evaluation of the reviewed papers are discussed. Challenges and opportunities are presented from the perspective of medical professionals and potential gaps and issues in the field are discussed. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The second objective entails enhancing the performance of predictive models. In the case of either intrinsic explainable artificial intelligence or post-hoc methods, the underlying predictive model should be accurate. Long-term and short-term mortality risks in patients with cardiovascular diseases are modeled using machine learning and deep learning methods. These models are built based on multimodal electronic health records data. Structured data (fixed and longitudinal) and unstructured data in the form of discharge summary notes are used. The predictive performance of models based on machine learning and deep learning methods on various data and architectures are compared. It is shown that incorporating a richer set of features enhances the predictive performance of deep models. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The third objective is to investigate the impact of imputation techniques for handling missing values in electronic health records data on the prediction performance and interpretation results of the predictive models. Missingness is recognized as a major data quality issue of electronic health records and its impact on the interpretations of predictive models warrants more investigation. The performance of imputation methods on missing values as well as the impact of imputation methods on 1) the performance of predictive models and 2) the interpretations of predictive models are examined. It is observed that the imputation methods for handling missing values impact the performance and interpretation results of the predictive models. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The fourth objective is focused on the interpretability enhancement of the predictive model based on longitudinal data. Few studies have investigated the application of Shapley additive explanations, a state-of-the-art explainable artificial intelligence method, on longitudinal medical data. Longitudinal laboratory test measurements and vital signs data is modeled using recurrent neural networks. Shapley additive explanation is applied to the model. Global and local interpretations of the model are presented. Also,  a new representation is proposed to enhance the interpretation results of the explainable artificial intelligence method. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>A Season in Hell with Rimbaud forms an allegorical travelogue that chronicles two brothers’ mutual descent into hell. When the older brother runs off by himself, the younger brother begins roaming Hell’s different landscapes in search of him. As he searches, the younger brother ruminates on their now fractured relationship. In the tradition of Virgil, Dante, Milton, Swift, Shelley, Joyce, Sarte, and Arthur Rimbaud, Pearson leads his speakers on a speculative, epistolary journey through the nether realm inspired by Christian beliefs and tradition. Drawing on the works of French Symbolists and the literary traditions of the American South, A Season in Hell with Rimbaud guides readers through an intimate rendering of one brother’s journey to find his lost and estranged brother, perhaps recovering a part of himself in the process.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In recent years, high-resolution seismological studies have documented anomalously low shear wave velocity in the middle of the lithosphere, referred to as mid-lithospheric discontinuity (MLD). In contrast to the low seismic velocity, MLD does not show any anomalous electrical conductivity based on available magnetotelluric (MT) observations. This is a perplexing observation since low shear wave velocities are usually associated with partial melts. This plausible inference of partial melts contradicts the observed stability and longevity of cratons. A partially molten layer is rheologically weak and might lead to the erosion of the cratonic root by the convecting mantle over geological timescales. Instead, mantle metasomatism might provide a plausible and alternate explanation for such a low shear wave velocity layer in the middle of the lithosphere. The metasomatized mantle is likely to stabilize secondary mineral phases, such as amphiboles. To evaluate whether mantle metasomatism or the presence of amphiboles can explain the geophysical observations of MLD, we need good constraints on the thermoelasticity and electrical conductivity of amphiboles at conditions relevant to MLD depths. However, pertinent data on the thermoelasticity and transport properties of amphiboles and how they vary as a function of pressure, temperature, and chemistry are currently lacking.To bridge this gap, in my Ph.D. dissertation work, I provided better constraints on the thermoelasticity of amphiboles using first principles simulation. To benchmark the simulation-based data, I calculated fundamental thermodynamics such as heat capacity and compared it with the heat capacity derived from the vibrational spectroscopic data using a Raman spectrometer. The excellent agreement between the theoretically predicted and experimentally derived thermodynamic data validated the simulation methods used in my Ph.D. dissertation. Next, I predicted the thermoelasticity of end-member amphibole tremolite and compared my predicted data with experimental results available at ambient conditions. Again, the agreement between simulations and ambient experimental data was excellent, rendering further confidence in predictions based on first principles simulations. I then explored the thermoelasticity of pargasite amphibole relevant for MLD. In addition, I complied and updated the thermoelastic database of other hydrous minerals that are likely to be stable at MLD, such as chlorite and phlogopite. Based on the modal abundances of mineral assemblages from cratonic xenoliths and experimental petrology, I predicted the aggregate shear wave velocity of the metasomatized cratonic mantle. Our updated thermoelastic database on hydrous phases showed that the hydrous minerals can only explain a fraction of the observed velocity reduction at MLD depths. We found that explaining the 100% of velocity reduction would require an unrealistic amount of hydrous minerals in the metasomatized cratonic mantle. 
I supplemented my thermoelasticity study with an in-depth examination of the electrical conductivity of an amphibole-bearing rock at MLD conditions. The results from high-pressure and temperature experimental studies showed that the electrical conductivity of amphibole is relatively high compared to volumetrically dominant mantle minerals such as olivine and pyroxene. Our results indicated that the electrical conductivity of amphiboles is quite sensitive to the alkali content. The pargasitic amphibole end-member likely to be stable in the metasomatized mantle tends to have a high alkali content. Thus, based on my results, I anticipated a high electrical conductivity for the alkali-rich amphiboles. However, high-electrical conductivity in MLD regions is not observed, and thus only a small fraction of alkali-bearing amphiboles can be allowed to explain the observed electrical conductivity profiles observed at MLD. Thus, our results indicated that the presence of amphiboles cannot simultaneously explain the seismological and MT observations at MLD. Hence, mantle metasomatism is unlikely to be the sole mechanism to explain MLD. Additional mechanisms need to be explored in addition to mantle metasomatism. These additional mechanisms may include seismic anisotropy and rheological changes, i.e., elastically accommodated grain boundary sliding, at MLD depths.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>People’s long-term partner ideals are functional in that they guide adaptive mate-selection decisions and thus people should be more satisfied with, and consequently, have more positive interactions with their romantic partners to the extent that those partners match their ideals (i.e., demonstrate high ideal-partner consistency). Very little research, however, has examined the behavioral implications of ideal-partner consistency and no research, to our knowledge, has examined the extent to which relationship satisfaction mediates this association. Moreover, some scholars have challenged the broader validity of ideal-partner consistency. Thus, the present research aimed to test the predictive validity of long-term ideal-partner consistency for relationship satisfaction and downstream relationship behaviors by using (a) three different studies comprising four independent samples, (b) the strongest methods available, and (c) four commonly used metrics of ideal-partner consistency (to rule out the possibility that results are unique to a single metric). Results demonstrated that people whose partners more (versus less) closely match their ideals were more satisfied with their relationships, which was associated with increased positive partner interactions (Studies 1 and 2) and decreased negative partner interactions (Studies 1 and 3). Notably, these associations emerged across all metrics of ideal-partner consistency and using both self-report and observational measures of partner interactions. Together, these findings provide the strongest empirical test to date of the ideal standards model, suggesting that ideal-partner consistency is indeed associated with people’s relationship evaluations and subsequent interactions with their partners. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study investigated the strategies that change management practitioners use to promote organizational change. Organizations implement change management plans to avoid losses in productivity and employee motivation (Bakari et al., 2017). Although there is an abundance of literature suggesting how change managers should implement a successful organizational change, practitioners and theorists approach change management differently (Saka, 2003). Practitioners may ignore the popular change literature (Bamford &amp; Forrester, 2003) by relating their implementations to the context of the change instead of a prescribed model. There is a lack of empirical evidence in change management research that supports the theories mentioned in publications (Bakari et al., 2017; Bamford &amp; Forrester, 2003; Brown, 2014; By, 2005; Cinite et al., 2009). The popular literature commonly states that 70% of organizational change fails (Balogun &amp; Hope Hailey, 2008; Beer &amp; Nohria, 2000; Burnes, 2015; Cinite et al., 2009; Washington &amp; Hacker, 2005), but does not describe why the change fails (Decker et al., 2012). Although popular literature identifies numerous models and strategies to promote change, the field lacks empirical evidence that explains what strategies practitioners use and how they determine that their change was successful. 
The purpose of this research was to examine the choices that change managers make and how change managers promote organizational change. I collected survey data through questionnaires (n = 49) and interviews (n = 20) to answer the following four research questions:
1.	What strategies do change managers use to facilitate organizational change?
2.	How do change managers implement change management strategies to promote organizational change?
3.	How do change managers measure the effectiveness of their change implementations?
4.	How has the current global pandemic impacted the strategies used by change management professionals?
The questionnaire results identified how frequently participants used the strategies found in six popular change management models. I used the interviews to determine how the change managers used the strategies in their implementations, how they measured their change implementations, and how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the strategies that they used. 
By triangulating the data from the questionnaire and interviews, I identified ten strategies that change managers often used when they implemented a successful organizational change. The strategies were (1) communicate with the employees about the change, (2) receive open support and commitment from administration, (3) focus on organizational culture, (4) use managers and supervisors as change agents, (5) include employees in change decisions, (6) listen to the employees’ concerns about the change, (7) reward new behavior, (8) use training to prepare employees and leaders for change, (9) help clients relate the organization’s vision to the change, and (10) build trust to increase buy-in. Most strategies contained sub-strategies that described how the participants implemented the change. Findings revealed that change managers used the strategies contextually based on the individual needs of the organization. This suggested that a linear prescriptive change model did not align with every change implementation. Communicating with members of the organization expanded across numerous strategies and promoting the change through leadership was an essential component of the change instead of an individual strategy.   
The participants measured the effectiveness of the change with both formal and informal feedback. They based the success of their change implementations on pre-defined goals set by the organization’s administrators. Open support and commitment from administration was essential to promote a successful organizational change. The participants created short-term, mid-term, and long-term goals to show that the change was on-task, and they used informal assessment such as water cooler talks to determine how the employees viewed the change. 
Although the participants had not completed a change implementation during the COVID-19 pandemic, they discussed the effects of promoting organizational change in an online environment. The change managers were unable to use informal assessment through water cooler talks or observe non-verbal cues about how participants perceived the change. The pandemic also required change managers to adapt employees to online work before the change manager could implement the pre-determined change.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Conceptual pacts are agreed-upon ways of talking about things that are specific to a conversation and a conversation partner. Most research focuses on conceptual pacts with participants being co-present in some way. However, we do not know if what has been found still applies when participants are not co-present. Along similar lines, Krauss and colleagues found that participants do still take their partner into account in asynchronous studies by examining the differences in written letters made by participants with different people in mind – themselves, a friend, and a stranger (Fussell &amp; Krauss, 1989; Krauss, 1987; Krauss, Vivekananathan, &amp; Weinheimer, 1968). However, these studies did not look at conceptual pacts. The present series of studies aimed to deepen the areas understanding of conceptual pacts and asynchronous conversations by expanding on Krauss’ work to include conceptual pacts in asynchronous settings. Overall, our data did not support that conceptual pacts are made during asynchronous conversations. These findings suggest follow-up studies to clarify in what settings conceptual pacts are made.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The aim of this study was to explore the effect of antioxidant-like drugs, Resveratrol and MitoQ, on erectile function and gene expression in a castration model of erectile dysfunction (ED) and to see if these changes were mediated via nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). ED is one of the most common sexual dysfunctions in men and is associated with hypogonadism, obesity, and diabetes mellitus. These conditions exhibit oxidative stress-induced endothelial dysfunction. C57BL/6 mice were separated into four group: sham, castrate-only, cast + resveratrol, and cast + MitoQ. DMT myograph system was used to assess erectile function and RT-PCR was used to assess relative gene expression. Upon castration, erectile function significantly declined. Castrate-only had impaired acetylcholine-, sodium nitroprusside-, and nonadrenergic noncholinergic-mediated relaxation when compared to sham. Also, castrate-only had a significantly higher contractile response to neurovascular stimulation and PE. Next, Nrf2 targeted genes: Hmox1, Gclc, Nqo1, and antioxidant genes were significantly lower when compared to sham. Resveratrol and MitoQ treatment partially improved antioxidant genes. There were significantly higher levels of SOD1, Gstm1, and CAT when compared to castrated-only groups. These improvements did not translate to improvements in erectile function. In summary, our results show that castration does lead to erectile dysfunction by increasing oxidative stress-induced endothelial dysfunction. Specifically targeting oxidative stress through Nrf2 induction did not mitigate the physiological changes seen with castration.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Statistical data models based on the deep learning paradigm have shown remarkable performancein many domains, surpassing human performance in a set of tasks under restricted settings. However, the fundamental reasons enabling these achievements have not been well understood. The
understanding of the underlying mechanisms of modern deep learning models is paramount for the
following reasons. First, we would like to properly use the models for downstream tasks; for this
purpose we need to identify and understand the failure modes of the models. Second, we would like
to identify and quantify the biases the models exhibit to facilitate the fair use of the models when
protected groups of population are involved. However, illuminating the underlying mechanisms is
very challenging due to their size and complexity.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this dissertation, we study intrinsic properties of two publicly available deep learning models,BERT in the domain of natural language processing, and Glow in the domain of computer vision.
Both models have achieved the state of the art for their respective tasks at the time of their
publication, and such remarkable performance makes them attractive study subjects. While the
natural language processing and computer vision domains are drastically different, common analysis
techniques can be applied to both models; the observation also implies that similar techniques could
be used in other domains not covered by the current dissertation. In both cases, we analyze the
geometric properties of the embeddings and quantify the layer-by-layer transformations through
correlations and other analyses. The results lead to novel insights on how the models generate
intermediate representations and give rise to their performance, and enable better understanding of
the underlying mechanisms.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>ABSTRACTNumerical weather prediction and ensemble forecasting have improved the skill of medium range forecasts.  However, multi-model ensembles can be computationally expensive and difficult to interpret so post-processing techniques are often employed.  One such technique, analog forecasting, involves scouring a back-catalog of forecasts to find ones similar to a target forecast.  This can enhance forecast skill by accounting for flow-dependent error growth because the accuracy of past forecasts provides context for the current one.  However, questions remain as to how one can best determine if a past forecast is ‘similar’ enough to be a useful analog.  
This research develops a new analog method, the ‘RetroEnsemble,’ that integrates existing (but previously uncombined) analog search techniques with novel strategies to look retrospectively in order to generate guidance for an operational ensemble forecast.  The search algorithm compares spatial forecasts around a target location (van den Dool, 1989) for several variables across a temporal window (Delle Monache et al., 2011) and optimizes their variable weights (Junk et al., 2015).  This method also (a) allows for temporal offsets to consider additional potential analogs (synoptically similar forecasts), and (b) identifies analogs independently for the different members of an ensemble forecast system.  
The RetroEnsemble is optimized for local application and provides bias correction for a multi day precipitation forecast from the Short Range Ensemble Forecast (SREF) system.  Rainfall verifications corresponding to the best analogs are combined into a historically derived probability density function for a new SREF forecast.  Four years of data are used as a training set to determine how to best find analogs; then, the RetroEnsemble was tested against an independent year of forecasts to serve as proof-of concept for this post-processing technique. 
The RetroEnsemble demonstrates improved skill across a range of spatial resolutions. The technique was most useful for the forecast of summer rainfall and for forecast conditions where the SREF had lower skill (e.g. underperforming ensemble members, or when the SREF predicted isolated rainfall).  Results from the testing period show similar trends, but lower skill improvement and less absolute skill.  
A fully developed RetroEnsemble methodology could allow forecasters to harness ‘big data’ by calibrating nationally provided ensemble output for local needs.  Further, as is initially explored here, it may provide a better understanding of which combinations of parameterization schemes yield more accurate forecasts under certain atmospheric states.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The goal of this thesis is to develop rigorous foundations for octonionic structures for their potential use in theoretical physics.I begin by defining the octonions and exploring some of their algebraic properties.
In particular, they are endowed with a Hopf algebra like structure, laking only associativity.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Next I turn to octonionic linear algebra.We show that all octonionic Hilbert spaces have a basis, define octonionic $L^2$ spaces and show they produce an orthomodular form.
Solèr's Theorem is then generalized to include these spaces.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>My attention then shifts to the split signature composition algebras, starting with Hopf fibrations and the closely associated projective spaces. For the associative split composition algebras we get families of Hopf fibrations for each dimension.
The octonionic cases fail to allow projective spaces beyond the plane.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>I then consider analysis on octonionic functions, leading to Cauhcy integral forumula over both the split and proper algebras.This result over the split octonions is novel, and completes the list of Cauchy integral formula over the composition algebras.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Finally, I consider a broad generalization of the octonions, discussed by Albequerque and Majid, and highlight some of the issues that emerge once we extend past the composition algebras.In particular, I define doubling algebras and attempt to classify the doubling algebras of small dimension.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation is focused on NMR studies of phase transitions in perovskite-like Metal-Organic Framework Multiferroics. The materials studied are [(CH3)2NH2]Mg(HCOO)3 and [(CH3)2NH2]Mn(HCOO)3. Dimethylammonium magnesium formate, [(CH3)2NH2]Mg(HCOO)3] shows a dielectric transition around (T = 270 K), the mechanism behind this phase transition is explored in detail using high-resolution solid-state NMR on 13C (γ = 10.7054 MHz/T, I = 1/2), 15N (γ = 4.3143 MHz/T, I = 1/2), 25Mg (γ = 2.6055 MHz/T, I = 5/2) found in the compound. The chemical shift and spectral changes with varying temperatures indicate the onset of phase transition which agrees with the previous dielectric constant measurements. We found evidence for a mixed behavior of order-disorder and displacive type phase transition by analyzing the chemical shift of the 13C and 15N in the compound. In addition, we quantified the timescale of the dynamics of nitrogen and dimethylammonium cation in the cavity by carrying out spin-lattice relaxation (T1) measurements and fit it to BPP theory to calculate the correlation time (τc). Near the phase transition, we also observed a co-existence of high-temperature and low-temperature phase peaks evident from the 13C spectra.Dimethylammonium manganese formate, [(CH3)2NH2]Mn(HCOO)3] (Mn-MOF) is one of the first materials in the class of metal-organic framework multiferroics. It shows a ferroelectric transition at (T = 185 K) and an antiferromagnetic phase transition at (TN = 8.5 K). We carried out wideband NMR measurements on 1H (γ = 42.5774 MHz/T, I = 1/2) and 14N (γ = 3.0752 MHz/T, I = 1) to explore both the magnetic and electric ordering using a single characterization technique. The measurements were carried out on 12 T and 17 T wideband NMR instruments with a homemade probe. The 1H spectra, 14N spectra, T1, and T2 relaxation measurements indicated both antiferromagnetic and ferroelectric phase transition, the values obtained for Tc (Ferroelectric) and TN (Antiferromagnetic) using NMR agree with the previously reported values. Angular dependence measurements were used to label the protons present in the compound. The nitrogen hopping mechanism above and below the phase transition temperature is observed with the help of 14N NMR. T1 relaxation for the central methyl proton exhibited an anomalous behavior with double exponential curves of T1 for the same temperature. We also found that the interaction between the Mn ions is stronger than the mean-field theory using the critical scaling fit. The dissertation also includes a project on using a triple pulse scheme to eliminate background signals and acoustic ringing in both spin 1/2 and quadrupolar nuclei. With the appropriate changing of pulse phase in subsequent scans, one can suppress the acoustic ringing effects and by introducing an additional flip-angle dependent scaling the background signal coming from outside the probe is eliminated. We have successfully shown a new pulse technique to obtain a clean spectrum for nuclei with low NMR sensitivity and with high acoustic ringing.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Most mega-biodiverse countries have low to upper middle incomes (Fisher and Christopher 2007), resulting in a shortage of funding and expertise to implement conservation actions in these biodiversity hotspots. Creating conservation guidelines can help developing countries comply with international conventions and, in some cases, result in poverty reduction by ensuring the protection of natural resources (Fisher and Christopher 2007). Distinguishing species that require immediate conservation actions to prevent extinction of species that are rare but demographically stable can help make conservation decisions when resources are scarce. To date, only 5% of all species known to science have been evaluated for risk of extinction (IUCN 2016), and of those listed as critically endangered, endangered, or vulnerable, a greater proportion are plant species than animal species (IUCN 2016). Generating data to evaluate extinction risk based on data on population dynamics for all species under these categories would take too much time, and decisions must often be made quickly. However, there are databases that contain demographic and functional trait data for hundreds of species of plants, that can, in principle, be used to identify traits that characterize species that are demographically stable and distinguish them from species in danger of imminent extinction. Yenni et al. (2012) proposed that strong self-limitation would enable some rare species to persist at low abundance (Yenni et al. 2012). Focusing on low abundance and its natural causes could help identify key characteristics that would help direct conservation efforts to the species at greatest risk of extinction. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>I conducted intraspecific competition experiments in the field for related pairs of common and low abundance but persisting herbaceous plant species in the understory of longleaf pine savannas to test the hypothesis that low abundance persisting taxa experience stronger self-limitation. I found that low abundance species were taller and experienced less herbivory damage than their respective closely related common species. However, I did not find evidence of stronger self-limitation in low abundance species compared to closely related common species.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To further examine the hypothesis that some low abundance species can persist naturally at low abundance due to strong self-limitation, I took advantage of global databases of demographic and trait data. I used information from these databases to designate 336 herbaceous plant species as common or low abundance. For species with trait data, I classified them as either demographically stable or increasing (50 common, 17 low abundance) or declining (31 common, 11 low abundance). I compared trait values for these groups focusing on those expected to be related to competitive ability. I was expecting traits associated with strong competitive ability could provide a tool to identify rare taxa that are at lower risk of extinction. I found that low abundance species regardless of their population growth rates had trait values consistent with greater competitive ability when compared to common species. However, I was unable to identify any trait that could distinguish low abundance herbaceous plant for which stable or increasing population growth rates were measured. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the face of projected human population growth, an alternative approach for preserving biodiversity is to preserve entire communities that encompass substantial biodiversity rather than assessing individual species. For this approach, there are different ways to assess biodiversity, one of them is to measure phylogenetic diversity, these measures can determine which areas will maximize future options for diversification. I examined the effects of human activities on phylogenetic diversity and structure in the longleaf pine savannas. I found that even after 100 years of continuous restoration efforts after plowing, phylogenetic diversity does not recover to the overall evolutionary history of undisturbed plant communities. Species that did not return after anthropogenic disturbance were not a random subset of species. One explanation for this clustering is that abiotic filtering influences recovery after disturbance. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Although I did not find a successful way to distinguish species at higher risk of extinction from those that are not, I wouldn’t discourage the approaches I used because species representation was small for the field experiments, and the overlap of species for which both demographic and trait data were available was limited. Natural history information in species descriptions was brief and sometimes non-existent in many demographic papers, which limits the power to identify plant traits that are associated with risk of extinction. There is potential for more synthetic approaches to help conservation decision making, however those efforts would be more successful after we address this data deficit. An initial step towards resolving this data gap would be to prioritize the collection of trait data for species for which demographic data already exist.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The graph is a data structure that exists widely around us, including traditional fields like physics, biology, and cosmology, as well as emergent fields like social networks, software engineering, and financial trading platforms. The graph-structured data contains objects (nodes) information and reflects their relationships (edges). The learning tasks become more challenging when considering the nodes and edge information simultaneously. Traditional machine learning methods focus on nodes' attributes but ignore the structural information. We are now in an era of deep learning, which outperforms traditional machine learning methods in a wide range of tasks and has a significant impact on our daily lives. Driving by deep learning and neural networks, the deep learning-based graph neural networks (GNNs) become convincing and attractive tools to handle this non-Euclidean data structure. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The dissertation thesis includes my research works throughout the Ph.D. research in two directions of graph data mining. The first direction is about the innovation and improvement of graph neural networks. A large number of GNNs have appeared, but as a general representation learning model, there are still some difficult topics worth delving into. I focus on three questions: Unsupervised/self-supervised Learning of GNNs, GNNs for heterogeneous graphs, and Training larger and deeper GNNs. Concerning unsupervised/self-supervised learning of GNNs, the dissertation introduces my research works contributing to it in Chapter 3 and Chapter 4. In Chapter 5, I introduce a mutual information maximization-based GNN for heterogeneous graph representation learning. Chapter 6 discusses my contributions to training larger and deeper GNNs through a subgraph-based learning framework.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The other direction is the Application of GNNs in Real-world Topics. As an effective tool for processing graph data, GNNs being applied to solve real-world graph mining problems can further verify the effectiveness. Meanwhile, the application of GNNs requires a combination of domain knowledge and specific data modeling, which is also a challenge that needs to be addressed. In Chapter 7, I apply GNNs to the emerging and non-trivial topic of fake news detection. When dealing with the fake news detection topic, I innovate the GNNs model to handle the challenges of the fake news detection problem, which is critical for GNNs to exert the best effect. Experiments with real-world fake news data show that the novel GNN can outperform text-based models and other graph-based models, especially when using less labeled news data.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the last chapter, I provide concluding thoughts about this dissertation thesis.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Although domestic violence against women is a global issue that subjects them to harmful consequences, very little research has been conducted on the furniture features and characteristics in domestic violence shelters that can have an influence on residents’ sense of dignity. Using a dignity framework, this study examined furniture features that may influence four aspects of human perception supportive of personal dignity: control, privacy, safety, and community. The study used mixed methods that include a survey distributed to two shelters residents, and in-depth interviews with the shelters’ management staff. Furniture style and placement were explored in three shelter areas: the commons, the dining area, and the sleeping area.Gathered responses from shelters’ residents and staff members gave rise to several design considerations. Findings indicated that providing multiple seating options for users based on their personalities or their situation can enhance their sense of control. Individual chairs, built-in partitions, lockable storage, and curtains over beds may reduce the ability to see users and their belongings. Also, furniture placement can keep users away from each other, which can support the sense of privacy. The safety notion can be reinforced in furniture features by providing locks on lockers and storage spaces, providing armrests, and using specific materials. Lastly, furniture has an impactful effect on enhancing people’s social skills. Three important factors in furniture features that encourage residents to socialize are size, location, and arrangement. These design considerations were then applied in a hypothetical domestic violence shelter in Atlanta, GA.
This study is intended to help designers make design decisions that may help victims of domestic abuse who reside in shelters preserve or rebuild their self-worth, recover from their past, and plan for the future.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Today’s students will face issues and problems that are global scale and require a collaborative global effort to resolve effectively. To help prepare students to resolve these global issues, students must learn to participate in the global democratic process as part of their citizenship education. In particular, scholars argue students need to engage in authentic examinations of actual real-world global issues in the classroom to better prepare them for the roles as democratic global citizens. In the U.S., the world history course serves as an ideal curricular space to incorporate teaching about global issues in the classroom. However, there is little empirical research exploring how high school world history teachers are actually teaching about global issues in their classrooms. To fill this gap, this study examines how nine high school world history teachers in Florida think about and describe teaching about global issues within the context of their world history classrooms using a qualitative interpretative interview design with elicitation tasks. Based on the data collected the participants believe that the world history course serves as an ideal curricular space to incorporate teaching about global issues and help students develop the civic tools needed for future global citizenship. The study also reveals the challenges that teachers face when attempting to teach the civic aims of the course. Namely, political polarization and the official standards. This study’s findings provide empirical evidence that incorporating issue-centered instruction in the world history classroom can be used as a pedagogical tool to help prepare students to be active and caring members of a global democratic community.    </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The current study evaluates the 6-month Modesto Police Department’s Domestic Violence Initiative.  This is a police intervention with goal of reducing domestic violence cases within Modesto, CA. With a quasi-experimental approach, the program focused police interventions in a single area of the city and used a different, similar area as a control. The interventions included in-person and telephone follow-ups, text messages, and educational flyers given to couples who experienced domestic violence crime, noncriminal verbal only fights, and other types of crime that involved an issue between a romantic or ex-romantic couple. There were three modes that were measured for success: the amount of domestic violence incidents per couple, the duration between repeat events, and the change in the level of violence (measured by the Cambridge Crime Harm Index) between initial events and repeat events. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	By using a negative binomial regression and controlling for suspect sex, it was found that if a couple received a follow-up or all three interventions then they had more reported repeat domestic violence incidents. Through the use of a Mann-Whiney U Test, there was no difference in days between repeat incidents whether the couple received an intervention or not. Another Mann-Whiney U Test found that if the couple received any form of intervention except for text message there was a suppression effect on the increase of violence between repeat domestic violence incidents. In addition, there are key findings of the surveys that the officers took when conducting the follow-ups.  Overall, the current study found mixed results on the effectiveness of the police interventions on domestic violence. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Vortex asymmetry develops on slender bodies at high angles of incidence, leading to large side-forcesand yaw moments even in symmetrical flight conditions. This unexpected side force can be large for
the control surfaces to produce a restoring moment, thereby affecting the vehicle’s trajectory, maneuverability,
and performance. Previous studies suggest that the presence of random micro-surface
imperfections near the forebody tip, incurred due to the conventional machining process and its coupling
with incoming freestream turbulence are the cause for vortex asymmetry. Vortex asymmetry
and its control studies have been the subject of numerous experimental and numerical investigations
beginning with simplified canonical configurations such as cones and cone-cylinders followed
by slender bodies with fins resembling a typical projectile configuration. While previous studies on
vortex asymmetry have provided a substantial knowledge base, several fundamental questions about
the flow topology and characteristics of the vortices remain unanswered. The key knowledge gaps
in the form of a few questions are: what is the effect of aftbody on the initiation and development of
vortex asymmetry? What is the role of imperfections on the aftbody, and how do they enhance or
suppress vortex asymmetry? What is the role of forebody to aftbody transition junction on vortex
initiation and development? How does the forebody vortex-fin interaction alter the control surface
effectiveness? To answer some of these questions as research objectives and improve the understanding
of flow physics associated with slender bodies at high angles of incidence, a comprehensive
experimental and numerical investigation was carried out and the results are presented here.
The test configuration involves a long slender body with two interchangeable forebodies (a
cone and a tangent ogive). To study the vortex-fin interactions, Army Navy Basic Finner (conecylinder
with fins) and ogive-cylinder with fins were designed and tested. Experiments include
force measurements using a six-component strain gauge balance, oil flow visualization, velocity and
vorticity field measurements using particle image velocimetry. Results show that a pair of counterrotating,
nearly-symmetric vortices develop over a polished cone but those become asymmetric over
the cylinder. Several secondary shear-layer vortices form at the cone–cylinder junction and over the
aftbody due to sharp turn angle (a change on pressure boundary), surface imperfections, and various
surface joints. These secondary shear-layer vortices then merge with the primary forebody vortex
pair, leading to the flow asymmetry. The flow characteristics and side-forces vary significantly when the conical forebody is rotated about its axis of symmetry and set to different azimuthal positions.
The results strongly suggest that a change in the geometry at the cone–cylinder junction and surface
imperfections present on the cylindrical aftbody plays a critical role in determining the overall flowasymmetry
and the side force magnitude. The effect of forebody change has a significant impact
on the flow field development. The peak vorticity, circulation, and trajectory of primary vortices
for ogive-cylinder configuration indicate a notable change in both magnitude and location when
compared to cone-cylinder configuration. The results show that the formation of secondary shearlayer
vortices can be minimized by eliminating the sudden change in geometry and smoothing the
surface imperfections. The absence of secondary shear-layer vortices resulted in relatively low levels
of side forces for the ogive-cylinder configuration as compared to the cone-cylinder.
In the case of vortex-fin interaction investigations, results show that the basic aerodynamic
characteristics remain invariant with roll orientation at low angles of incidence. At high angles of
incidence, fin orientation plays a significant role in dictating the body’s aerodynamic forces. At
low angles of incidence, the forebody vortices are symmetric and remain close to the body, and
interact with the control surfaces. The forebody vortex interaction seems to be influenced by the
body roll orientation. The pressure distributions over the fin surfaces, and in turn, the fins’ control
effectiveness is significantly affected by the interaction of forebody vortices. At high angles of
incidence, the vortices become highly asymmetric, where one vortex is closer to the fins and the
other vortex lifted away from the fins. Under such an instance, the resulting pressure distribution
is uneven and lead to the generation of side forces and adverse yaw moments.
To summarize, the present study has significantly improved the fundamental understanding
of vortex flows on slender bodies at high angles of incidence. In particular, it has answered the
role of secondary vortices on the development of overall vortex asymmetry and its interaction with
control surfaces. The outcome of this study will help guide the design of next-generation projectiles
expected to perform maneuvers at high angles of incidence. The high-fidelity experimental database
generated over a range of test conditions will be very useful to validate physics based simulation
tools being developed at Army Research Laboratory. The present study was focused at low-speeds
and incompressible flows and therefore it is suggested that future studies must investigate the effect
of compressibility on vortex asymmetry. Also, time-resolved measurements are recommended to
understand the role of vortex dynamics on the slender body.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study addresses a gap in language learning regarding the relationship of teacher well-being with different aspects of instruction, namely, teaching practices and student learning (Turner &amp; Thielking, 2019). Specifically, the study explores the link between second language (L2) teachers’ well-being levels, the L2 teachers’ instructional practices and the relationship between instructional practices and a precursor of learning, L2 students’ engagement. The study was conducted with Colombian teachers of English as a foreign language who work in secondary schools and have different years of teaching experience and academic degrees (N = 203). The study also included students from 6th to 11th grade enrolled in English classes in the 2021 school year (N = 1544). The data were collected in March, 2021. In this cross-sectional study the research questions sought to identify the well-being levels of L2 teachers, the factors that make up well-being in the sample, the relationship between L2 teachers’ well-being and L2 instructional practices, and finally whether these instructional practices served a mediating role between L2 teachers’ well-being and the levels of L2 learners’ classroom engagement reported by the secondary students. The PERMA-Profiler measured L2 teachers’ well-being levels. The frequency of occurrence of the L2 teachers’ instructional practices teachers was identified through a 24-item self-report survey, and L2 learner’s classroom engagement was measured through a 14-item survey. EFA &amp; CFA analyses showed that one factor made up well-being in the sample and that the items could be categorized in the same dimensions identified in previous studies (Butler &amp; Kern, 2016). Data also showed that Colombian L2 teachers had normal functioning levels of well-being (M = 7.7) according to Kern’s (2020) categorization. Demographic factors like age, experience and academic degree did not seem to affect or interact with teacher well-being. In addition to this, regression analyses indicated that the well-being levels of L2 teachers had a significant relationship with their instructional practices (p &lt; .001). Finally, two competing models, one including direct pathways between teacher well-being and learner engagement and the other including only mediation pathways were compared. A Sobel test conducted to examine the mediation suggested that the model including only mediation was more suitable to explain the data. It also showed that L2 teacher well-being and L2 student engagement were mediated by instructional practices, and that the relationship was significant (p &lt; .01). It can be concluded that L2 teacher well-being levels are associated to the use of effective L2 instructional practices, which, in turn, are linked to the L2 students’ classroom engagement. 
The study contributes to a better understanding of the construct of L2 teacher well-being as it shows that teacher well-being interacts with other aspects of teaching such as instruction. This study is the first one measuring L2 teachers’ well-being in Colombia and it makes a theoretical and methodological contributions by linking the data of L2 teachers and students. The study has pedagogical implications for teacher education and professional development programs that support the well-being of teachers (Ončevska &amp; Mercer, 2019).

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Pulses play a significant health role in the human population,  specifically some pulses contribute to low postprandial glycemic response. Although the commercial utilization of pulse protein is rapidly growing due to the demand for alternative meat protein, healthy food choices, and the need for clean label foods, commercial pulse protein production generates approximately 35-60 percent starch. The utilization of commercially produced pulse starch from pulse protein production poses a demand for starch utilization. Consequently, the innovative development of novel functional food ingredients for human health will promote the application of unused starch. Therefore, this study purified starch using the wet-milling method, characterized and investigated the functions of pulse starches from commonly consumed pulses on food and health with a potential application as an alternative healthy ingredient. Starches were isolated and characterized from adzuki, baby lima, black bean, black-eyed pea, cranberry bean, field pea, garbanzo, great northern bean, large lima, lentil, light red kidney bean, navy bean, Nigerian honey bean, pink bean, pinto, small red bean, small white bean, and whole moth. The laboratory purified pulse starches were comparable in color, residual lipids, residual fiber, and total protein, morphology, amylose and amylopectin ratio, oil absorption capacity, water absorption capacity, water absorption and solubility indexes, swelling power, bulk density, turbidity, least gelation concentration, pastin properties, and thermal properties to corn and rice starch. Pulse starches had a different granular morphology under light and scanning electron microscope (no surface pores) compared to corn and rice. Pulse starches had higher bulk density (0.81 - 0.95 g/mL) and higher amylose (28 - 41 w/w). Similarly, pulse starches had comparable/better water and oil absorption capacities, water absorption index, water solubility index, turbidity, solubility, least gelation concentration, swelling power, pasting, and gelatinization profile when compared to starch from corn. Pulse starches showed a rapid retrogradation due to the higher amylose content andcrystallinity. These two properties contributed to a higher percentage of slowly digestible starch (SDS) and resistant starch (RS) in pulse starches. The  applicability of pulse starch was tested by incorporating garbanzo starch for making fortified bread. The fortified bread with garbanzo starch showed an increase in SDS and RS contents. The resistant starch content of purified pulse starches was characterized after upper-GI digestion and fecal fermentation studies. Pulse-resistant starches  fermented differently with fecal samples from three healthy donors. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to report the use of pulse RS from pulse starches as a fermentable substrate by gut microbiota. Pulse RS significantly promoted the growth of specific endogenous microbiota (Bacteroides) and caused a significant reduction in phylum Firmicutes. The findings suggest that pulse starch as a novel food ingredient with slowly digestible properties and resistant starch that promotes beneficial gut microbiota.

            <DISS_para>While strategic self-talk interventions’ positive effects on sport performance and performance-related processes are well documented, little is known regarding naturally occurring self-statements, or organic self-talk. Previously, eight discrete organic self-talk functions were identified, yet research concerning contextual and personal factors relating to these functions is still lacking. It is imperative to explore such factors to establish a holistic sport-specific self-talk model that determines the organic self-talk use in sport. Thus, the aim of the study was to explore the relationships between sport-related stress and coping, athletic identity, demographic and sport-related factors and the eight organic self-talk functions of psych-up, anxiety control, confidence, instruction, worry, disengagement, somatic fatigue and irrelevant. Thus, 216 NCAA student-athletes were recruited to participate in a two-wave internet survey. The PSS-Sport, AIMS and ASTQS questionnaires were used to measure sport-related stress and coping, athletic identity and the organic self-talk functions respectively. Eight linear multiple regressions were conducted to determine the relationship between the aforementioned variables and organic self-talk functions’ frequencies. RM MANOVAs and moderation tests were conducted to compare stress, coping and self-talk functions in and out-of-season. Results indicate that stress was associated with all self-talk frequencies except confidence. Coping was associated with psych-up, confidence and worry. Athletic identity was associated with psych-up, confidence, instruction and disengagement frequencies. Age was associated with anxiety control and instruction self-talk. Lastly, sport type and division level were associated with disengagement and instruction self-talk respectively. No changes were recorded in and out of season. Implications and limitations are discussed. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The iron regulatory hormone hepcidin mediates the hypoferremia of inflammation by binding to, occluding, and signaling for the degradation of ferroportin, the only known cellular iron exporter. A regulator for the hypozincemia observed with inflammation and infection is not known; however, recent in vitro evidence indicates that hepcidin reduces intestinal zinc export by downregulating the zinc exporter ZnT1. The objective of the current study was to determine whether hepcidin attenuates molecular indicators of zinc status and intestinal zinc absorption in mice. Six-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were fed a modified AIN-93G diet containing 30 ppm zinc and 10 ppm iron for 2 weeks. After a 3 hour fast, mice were injected with 10, 50, or 100 µg/mouse hepcidin or 10, 25, or 50 µg/kg interleukin-6, an upstream regulator of hepcidin. Mice were then immediately given an oral gavage containing 67Zn isotope and sacrificed 3, 6, or 24 hours later. One-way and two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post-hoc comparisons were used to assess the effects of treatment, time, and their interaction. Data are represented as means ± standard deviations. Plasma iron concentrations were decreased by up to 26% following IL-6 injections and 24% following hepcidin injections. IL-6 injections resulted in hypozincemia (P = 0.035), with 50 µg/kg IL-6 injections showing the greatest decline (1.05 ± 0.16) compared to control (1.18 ± 0.16). There were no treatment effects for plasma zinc for mice injected with hepcidin (P= 0.366). Liver and plasma appearance of 67Zn did not differ with hepcidin or IL-6 injection. Collectively, these findings indicate that acute injection of IL-6, but not hepcidin, result in a hypozincemia in mice. Future studies should confirm these findings and perhaps examine the chronic effects of hepcidin on zinc homeostasis in mice. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>BACKGROUND: Approximately 5-6% of older individuals ≥75 years of age will develop aortic stenosis and require aortic valve replacement via transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Due to most patients not surviving ≥5 years post-TAVR the reduction of morality risk and maximization of quality of life (QoL) in the post-procedural setting are crucial. As high as 70% of TAVR patients may develop low muscle mass which will remain post-TAVR and can increase mortality risk and reduce QoL. The combination of resistance training (RT) with protein supplementation is an effective modality for maintaining and gaining muscle mass. However, their effectiveness is unexplored in TAVR patients. PURPOSE: To determine the effects of a 12-week home-based digitally supervised progressive RT program combined with protein supplementation (RT+PRO) vs. protein supplementation only (PRO) on body composition, inflammation, strength, physical function, and QoL measures in post-operative TAVR patients. METHODS: Twenty-two TAVR patients participated in study (75.7±6.5 years). Measurements included anthropometrics, body composition via hand-foot bioelectrical impedance analysis, blood draws to measure serum levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and C-reactive protein (CRP), muscular strength assessments via handgrip dynamometer, leg dynamometer, 30-second chair stand, and 5-repetition chair stand, and physical function via short physical performance battery (SPPB), 8-foot Up-and-Go, 2-minute step test, and 30-second arm curl, and subjective QoL. After completion of testing participants were stratified by gender and arm curl performance into one of two groups: digitally supervised home-based RT+PRO (n=11) or PRO (n=11) for 12 weeks. Participants in RT+PRO completed a whole-body RT program of 12 exercises, 2x/week of 8 to 15 repetitions for up to 3 sets and both groups consumed an additional 75g (37.5 g twice a day) of whey protein per day. All baseline tests were immediately repeated at the conclusion of 12 weeks. A two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate differences in variables between groups. In the case of significance, a post hoc one-way ANOVA was used to identify significant differences. Significance was accepted at p≤0.05. RESULTS:  Participants in PRO (Height: 1.69±0.13 m, Weight: 92.2±21.6 kg, 74±6 years of age) had significantly lower diastolic blood pressure at baseline compared to RT+PRO (Height: 1.70±0.09 m, Weight: 86.4±15.4 kg, 77±7 years of age; 68±6 vs. 73±7 mmHg). No other significant differences were observed at baseline. All participants in RT+PRO completed all RT sessions (24 session per participant) and adherence to PRO consumption was 91% for RT+PRO and 95% for PRO. Compared to PRO, participants in RT+PRO experienced a significantly greater improvements in 30-second chair stand repetitions (RT+PRO Pre: 11±3 vs. Post: 13±3; PRO Pre: 12±2 vs. Post: 12±3 repetitions;), time to complete 5 sit-to-stands in a chair (RT+PRO Pre: 12.3±3.8 vs. Post: 9.6±2.7; PRO Pre: 11.2±2.4 vs Post: 10.9±2.9 seconds), SarQoL score (RT+PRO Pre: 63.7±12.9 vs. Post: 74.0±14.6; PRO Pre: 69.7±13.6 vs. Post: 69.2±16.1 points), and serum levels of CRP (RT+PRO Pre: 3.1±2.1 vs. Post: 2.0±1.5; PRO: Pre: 2.5±2.1 vs. Post: 2.2±2.0 mg/L). RT+PRO (9.5±2.3 vs. 9.5±2.0 kg/m2) and PRO (9.3±2.3 vs. 9.1±2.3 kg/m2) maintained SMI from baseline to follow-up. CONCLUSION: Digitally supervised home-based RT+PRO significantly improved measures of strength, inflammation, and QoL in TAVR patients over 12 weeks.  The convenient nature of home-based RT should be pursued as a method for cardiac rehabilitation to increase both patient participation and benefits from exercise. Protein supplementation should be taken in unison with RT to ensure retention of muscle mass. High protein consumption for periods of &gt;6 months may elicit a benefit for the retention of muscle mass.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Embedded in the history of the arid Western U.S., water conflict seems out of place in the Southeast’s oozing landscape of humidity, swamps, and Spanish moss (Manganiello, 2015). Yet throughout Georgia, Alabama, and Florida’s shared Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River (ACF) watershed, flows have faltered, ecosystems have suffered, negotiations have failed, and lawsuits have emerged and been put to rest, only to reappear under new guises in a cycle that continuously churns but moves no closer to resolving the issues that plague the basin. These conflicts, known collectively as the “Tri-State Water Wars”, have marred the basin for over 30 years. A resolution to the protracted war seemed imminent in 2016, when the Tri-State conflict reached the U.S. Supreme Court in the form of Florida v Georgia. Although the Supreme Court ruled on the case five years later, little was settled, with lawsuits and ecological damages continuing to proliferate in the wake of Florida v Georgia. A changing climate and increasing water consumption are unquestionably key drivers in the Tri-State conflict that deserve careful examination. However, I argue that, below the surface of the water wars, there is an important history of discursive and material transformations which must also be examined to achieve a more complete understanding of water governance and conflict in the ACF basin. This dissertation contributes to an improved understanding of current issues in the ACF by analyzing an understudied topic in the region: the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE or the Corps) and their production of knowledge. The Corps has intervened in the ACF waterways since the mid-nineteenth century and today operates a system of five dams that profoundly impacts the flow regime of the Chattahoochee and Apalachicola Rivers. However, most studies of the ACF either ignore the engineers or consider them adjacent to water politics, existing only as apolitical technicians deployed by Congress and other powerful interests. I analytically recenter the Corps in the ACF, demonstrating the agency’s influence in the Tri-State region extends beyond the role of expert builders typically ascribed to the engineers within the ACF literature. 
Drawing upon USACE ACF surveys and water control manuals from 1870-2017, I use a Foucauldian framework to track continuities and ruptures in the Corps’ knowledge, logic, and modes of intervention across three eras: navigation, dam building, and ecopolitical. I show that across each era the Corps did not merely implement projects handed down from political and economic elite, but also shaped the course of river policy and interventions in the ACF through their own internal logic and conceptualization of the waterways. The historical approach I adopt additionally reveals how legacies of forgotten engineering visions continue to haunt current conflicts and modes of river governance throughout the ACF. In showcasing the ways in which the Corps have and continue to impact the ACF, I call for an analytical and political reengagement with experts and technical knowledge that have for too long remained hidden below the surface of grand political battles in the region.  </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Tornadoes are one of the most dangerous natural hazards on Earth that often occur in clusters commonly known as an outbreak. On average, tornado outbreaks are getting larger and more productive with more tornadoes occurring per cluster. As a result, tornado outbreaks pose an increasing risk to life and property annually. For example, the February 5, 2008 outbreak produced 85 tornadoes over 14 hours and 482,000 sq. km. which resulted in 482 casualties. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Tornado outbreaks can be difficult to forecast. Dynamic and statistical models highlight areas of severe weather potential, but these models do not yet specify the risks and characteristics associated with outbreaks. Additionally, they do not account for the projected influence of climate change on tornado outbreaks. To date, limited research has focused on climate change and environmental factors that influence tornado outbreak characteristics (e.g., cluster severity, tornado counts, casualty counts, and spatial domain). This dissertation addresses two main questions: (1) Do environmental factors statistically explain tornado outbreak characteristics such as accumulated tornado power, tornado counts, and casualty counts? (2) Do climate variables 15 days prior to an outbreak statistically explain environmental factors that are known to enhance tornadogenesis? </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>I situate my research in the sub-disciplines of Physical Geography and Hazards Geography. My work falls within the four traditions. These traditions include the spatial tradition (spatial analysis is crucial to understand geometry and movement of phenomena), man-land tradition (relationships between humans and the inhabited land), earth science tradition (study of Earth's processes), and area studies tradition (in-depth study of an area's unique characteristics). My research falls within the spatial tradition and earth science tradition by using statistical methodologies to understand the physical processes that influence natural hazards (specifically tornadoes) in the United States from 1994 to 2020. Keeping that in mind, the \textbf{goal} of this dissertation is to understand the role of climate change on the environmental factors that influence tornado outbreak characteristics, including cluster severity, tornado counts, casualty counts, and spatial extent of the outbreak. This research’s \textbf{intellectual merit} is the quantification of the change in tornado outbreak characteristics for changes in the environmental conditions at the synoptic scale, which is commensurate with the scale of the outbreak. The \textbf{broader impacts} of this research are quantitative methods for addressing the link between climate change and hazards, and the potential to use these methods to better anticipate future severe weather outbreaks. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The dissertation is outlined as follows. I describe the foundations of tornado dynamics and formation in Chapter 1. I provide a brief historical description detailing the tornado climatology in the United States in Chapter 2. Then, I develop an objective clustering methodology to group tornadoes into their respective outbreaks using distances between tornadoes in both space and time in Chapter 3. I evaluate and assign values of the environmental factors that are present three hours before the initiation of the cluster with at least ten tornadoes in Chapter 4. I create a cluster severity metric called Accumulated Tornado Power (ATP) to understand the relationship between tornado and casualty counts for clusters with at least ten tornadoes in Chapter 5. I fit regression models to quantify the relationship between tornado and casualty counts for clusters with at least ten tornadoes in Chapter 6. Then, I develop a series of regression models to predict convective available potential energy, deep-layer bulk shear, and shallow-layer bulk shear using sea surface temperatures and sea level pressure conditions averaged over the 15 days prior to the occurrence of a cluster with at least ten tornadoes in Chapter 7. Finally, I provide a summary and highlight future work in Chapter 8. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The findings in this dissertation quantify the relationships between cluster severity, tornado counts, casualty counts, environmental factors, and climate variables. The regression model in Chapter 5 indicates that cluster severity increases by 33% for a 1000 J/kg increase in convective available potential energy and by 125% for a 10 m/s increase in bulk shear. The regression models in Chapter 6 indicate that tornado counts increase by 4.7% and casualties increase by 28% for a 1000 J/kg increase in convective available potential energy. Additionally, tornado counts increase by 13% and casualties increase by 98% for a 10 m/s increase in bulk shear. The regression models in Chapter 7 indicate that sea surface temperatures and sea level pressure 15 days prior to a tornado cluster can be used to predict the convective available potential energy, deep-layer bulk shear, and shallow-layer bulk shear on a day with at least ten tornadoes. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Plants regulate gene expression at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels to produce a variety of functionally diverse cells and tissues that ensure normal growth, development, and environmental response. Although distinct gene expression patterns have been characterized between different plant tissues, it is unclear if transcriptional regulation drives the development of these plant tissues. Additionally, transcriptional gene silencing pathways, like the RNA-directed DNA Methylation (RdDM) pathway, regulate the transcriptional silencing of a variety of loci across the genome influencing gene expression. However, the effects of the RdDM pathway on genes are not always direct or immediate and need to be explored further. RNA-seq, while widely used to assay for changes in transcript abundance, does not discriminate between differential expression caused by mRNA degradation and active transcription. Recently, the presence of intron sequences in RNA-seq analysis of libraries constructed with total RNA has been found to coincide with genes undergoing active transcription. In one study, I adapted the intron RNA-sequencing (iRNA-seq) analysis to determine genome-wide transcriptional activity in two different maize (Zea mays) tissues: husk and V2-inner stem tissue. A total of 5,341 genes were predicted to be transcriptionally differentially expressed between the two tissues, including many genes expected to have biological activity relative to the identity of each tissue. Correlations with transcriptional enhancer and transcription factor activity support the validity of iRNA-seq predictions of transcriptional regulation. A subset of transcription factors were further analyzed using gene regulatory network analysis to determine the impact of their tissue-specific activation. The predicted regulatory patterns between these genes were used to model a potential tissue-specific gene regulatory network of transcription factors and regulatory targets. 
In another study, iRNA-seq analysis was used to determine genome-wide transcriptional activity in two maize RdDM mutants: mop1-1 and mop3-1. MEDIATOR OF PARAMUTATION 1 (MOP1) is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase required for the progression of the RdDM pathway and MOP3 is the largest subunit of RNA polymerase IV (Pol IV), the initiating polymerase of the RdDM pathway. The loss of RdDM machinery seen in RdDM mutants illustrates the influence of RdDM activity on gene expression. However, due to the nature of silencing activity, a cascade of gene regulatory effects could be influenced, making the characterization of RdDM protein coding gene targets challenging. Genes predicted to undergo changes in transcriptional activity via iRNA-seq analysis in these RdDM mutants have the potential to be RdDM gene targets. In some cases, these changes in transcriptional activity were found to associate with RdDM produced small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Differentially expressed genes with an siRNA association were further evaluated for additional regulatory activity using a gene regulatory network analysis, leading to the development of a model for RdDM activity that describes RdDM immediate and secondary gene regulatory effects. 
These studies provide a new maize bioinformatic tool, increasing the resources available to maize researchers, and increase our understanding of gene regulation in maize through the prediction of various regulatory mechanisms and their targets.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>  The main topic of this dissertation is phase transitions and their unique dynamical behavior.  Among the various manifestations of phase transitions, spatial ordering of magnetic moments
  (spins) as in a ferromagnet is of special interest. Lessons learned in spin systems are also enormously useful in the study of more complicated systems with discrete states, which may display universal behavior near the phase transition. When the ``spin” states are mapped onto
  the presence of certain kinds of particles, these models are known as ``lattice-gas models.” For example, “nuclear pasta” shapes, assumed to exist in the crust of neutron stars, can be modeled as a spin system with the up-spin population corresponding to neutrons and the down-
  spin population to protons interacting via attractive short-range nuclear interactions and repulsive long-range Coulomb forces. Other examples include the adsorption of molecules onto crystal surfaces or even models of voter opinions. The specific models studied here, are the $S
  = 1/2$ (two-state) and $S = 1$ (three-state) Ising models. A short introduction to the former and its
  lattice-gas equivalent is given in Ch.~1
  
  In Ch.~2 we introduce the general $S = 1$ Ising model with spin states $\{ +1, 0, -1 \}$ or
  equivalent lattice-gas states $\{ A, 0, B \}$. This model has five parameters: two fields ($H, D$)
  in spin language and three interaction constants ($J, K, L$).The complete catalog of fifteen topologically different ground-state diagrams 
  (zero-temperature phase diagrams), which show the regions of stability of the different ground states in the full parameter space of the model in two dimensions (2D),
  is obtained and discussed in both lattice-gas and Ising-spin language. 
  [D. Silva and P. A. Rikvold, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2019, {\bf 21}, 6216-6223].</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>  In Ch.~3 we study the Blume-Capel model ($S = 1$ Ising model with $K = L = 0$) at both zero  and positive temperatures. The antiferromagnetic ($J &lt; 0$) Blume-Capel model possesses surfaces of second-order phase transitions between ordered AFM phases and a disordered phase at high temperature, and one of first-order transitions separating the ordered phase from a uniform phase of mostly 0 at large $D$. These surfaces join smoothly along a line of tricritical points. In 3D this line bifurcates into a line of critical end points and a surface of weak first-order transitions [J. D. Kimel and Y.-L. Wang, 1991, {\it J. Appl. Phys.}, {\bf 69}, 6176-6178].
  Analogous bifurcation behavior is not observed in 2D [J. D. Kimel, P. A. Rikvold and Y. L. Wang, 1992, {\it Phys. Rev. B}, {\bf 18}, 7237-7243].
   We consider the bifurcation region for 3D in detail by standard Monte Carlo simulations of lattices up $32^3$ sites. 
  Phase transitions were identified using finite-size scaling of order-parameter histograms, susceptibilities, and fourth-order cumulants. 
  We identify the two phases separated by the first-order surface as two AFM-ordered phases, one with low vacancy density at temperatures below the transition, and one with higher vacancy density above the transition. 
  The density changes abruptly across the transition.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para> Megaripples are large ripples with wavelengths ranging from 5-50 m and heights from crest to trough of 0.3-1.5. They are common current-generated structures on the continental shelf and in marine environments where bottom current velocities exceed 0.4 m s-1. Although megaripples have been described from numerous sites, very little is known about their ecological functions and their role in the carbon and nutrient cycles. This thesis research therefore investigates megaripples with focus on their function as sites for rapid organic matter mineralization. Small ripples, occurring commonly on beaches, have been observed to facilitate enhanced levels of biological degradation and mineralization as a result of advective pore water exchange. This exchange occurs when water collides with the slope or crest of a bedform and creates a zone of high pressure, forcing water into the bedform. A zone of low pressure existing downstream typically pulls pore water back out of the bedform. This exchange in small ripples has been observed to cause them to act as a sink of oxygenated compounds and a source of reduced compounds. This phenomenon, termed biocatalytic filtration, has not been studied in megaripples, but has been theorized to scale up in intensity with bedform size. A megaripple field in a tidal channel (Choctawhatchee Bay, Florida, USA) was selected for study by characterizing the sediments, bedforms, and waters of the site. We found highly concentrated pools of nutrients within the pore waters of the megaripples, with crests (outwelling zone) being richer in reduced compounds while troughs (inwelling zone) had relatively lower levels of these. Distinct pore water temperature profiles indicate the presence of enhanced pore water transport velocity due to topography. Additionally, oxygen minima corresponded with rapid outwelling of megaripple pore water caused by intruding waters from the Gulf of Mexico during flood tide, indicating that the megaripples are acting as sinks of oxygenated compounds and sources of reduced compounds which may then be imported back into the Bay, resulting in enhanced chlorophyll-a levels. This indicates that megaripples can indeed be sites of active biocatalytic filtration that may scale up with size to megaripples.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Suppression of the J/psi nuclear modification factor has been seen as a trademark signature of final state effects in large collision systems for decades.  In small systems, the nuclear modification was attributed to cold nuclear matter effects until the observation of strong differential suppression of the psi(2S) state in p/d+A collisions suggested the presence of final state effects.  Results of J/psi and psi(2S) measurements in the dimuon decay channel are presented here for a collection of different small systems at the same collision energy.  These small systems include: p+p, p+Al, p+Au and 3He+Au at collision energy square root s_NN = 200 GeV.  The results are predominantly shown in the form of the nuclear modification factor, R_AB, the ratio of the J/psi or psi(2S) invariant yield per nucleon-nucleon collision in collisions of projectile A on target B to that in p+p collisions.  Measurements of the J/psi and psi(2S) nuclear modification factor are then compared with shadowing and transport model predictions, as well as to complementary measurements at LHC energies.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>	Many secondary students in the United States are struggling to find success in math creating a preparation gap in the U.S. STEM workforce. Based on national and international assessments, little improvement has been made over the past several decades in U.S. secondary students’ knowledge and skills in higher-order math tasks like translating and modeling real world scenarios into the symbolic language of math. Digital game-based learning may hold the key to filling this knowledge and skill gap of U.S. secondary math students. Research on digital-game based learning has found it to be an effective tool for increasing higher-order skills. Digital game-based learning has also been used successfully with secondary math students to increase both cognitive and affective outcomes. The current study examines the cognitive and affective impacts of playing the digital learning game, Function Fighters. Function Fighters was designed to be supplemental practice focused on the conceptual knowledge and skills needed to translate algebra word problems to systems of equations. Students were recruited from geometry classes to ensure the math content in the game was not new content to the students. The study took place in the students natural learning environment. Students were assigned five online research assignments to complete through their math class Google Classroom—a pretest, a posttest, and 3 practice activities. For the practice activities students were randomly assigned to either the gameplay group or the text-based practice group. Students completed the study assignments after completing their in-class math activities and after school hours. Of the 103 students recruited for the study, 29 students completed all five of the study assignments. The low number of participating students meant the study did not have the power needed to detect a difference between the two groups. However, students’ performance on the pretest and posttest revealed a knowledge and skill gap on translating algebraic word problems to equations and on the prerequisite skills of translating one-variable equations, two-variable equations, and graphs to an equation. The relationship between math achievement and math attitudes has also been documented through national and international testing. Therefore, measuring students’ math attitudes was another focus of the study. Similar to national and international testing results of secondary students, students in the study reported low attitudes towards math scores, specifically in math self-concepts and math interest. Implications of the findings for future use of Function Fighters and other digital learning games is discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Keloids are disfiguring, painful and itchy but benign fibrotic skin lesions characterized by excessive dermal fibroblast proliferation and collagen deposition. They occur in susceptible individuals due to abnormal wound healing. Keloids are understudied and predominantly affect dark-skinned individuals, suggesting that genetic and/or epigenetic factors contribute strongly to keloid disease. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in driving keloid formation in susceptible individuals are unclear. Furthermore, currently there are no standardized treatments available for keloids and they have very high recurrence rates upon surgical resection alone. Although ionizing radiation is emerging as one of the most effective post-surgical adjuvant therapies to prevent recurrence, there are no systematic studies on the range of effective radiation doses for keloid therapy. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>My studies have revealed that a single 3Gy dose of low energy (50kV) X-ray radiation inhibited the proliferation of keloid fibroblasts by ~80% due to a combination of apoptosis, necrosis and senescence. Further, a single 9Gy dose at 50kV completely blocked the outgrowth of fibroblasts from keloid explants. Collagen levels were reduced independently of the cell death triggered by radiation. This suggests that additional treatments which block excessive collagen production in keloids can be used synergistically with radiation in keloid management. More importantly, a single 8Gy dose of superficial 50kV radiation delivered an average of 34 days after keloid excision was effective in minimize recurrence following surgical excision, including in individuals resistant to steroids. Higher radiation energies, doses, or fractions may be unnecessary for keloid therapy and in fact could increase the potential for harm.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Keloids are commonly treated using steroids, although the response in patients is highly variable. I developed minimally invasive and non-invasive methods for testing steroid response in patients prior to initiating steroid therapy. To better understand the molecular mechanisms that drive keloid formation and determine their response to therapy, I have used a combination of genomic sequencing-based approaches including RNA-sequencing, microRNA-sequencing, and Enzymatic Methyl-sequencing. Using these, I have identified several potential molecular pathways that contribute to keloid pathogenesis and their differential response to steroid therapy. I found that altered expression of specific miRNAs are likely to regulate their target genes such as IGF2 (hsa-miR-100-5p), PLOD2 and FN1 (hsa-miR-615-3p), and SERPINE1 (hsa-miR-10a-5p). I have confirmed the observed alterations in the expression of several dozens of genes from my transcriptomics data using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analyses, and many of these genes have been previously implicated in keloid or other fibrotic diseases. Furthermore, I have identified many differentially expressed genes between steroid sensitive and resistant keloid fibroblasts. These include the EYA4 and IGF1 genes that are downregulated, while the MCAM, WFDC1, IGFBP2, and RBM24 genes are upregulated in steroid resistant keloid fibroblasts. The expression levels of these genes can potentially be used as molecular biomarkers to screen for steroid resistance in patients. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Finally, based on my genomic studies, I have identified new molecular targets for keloid therapy. Since IGF related pathways are reported to promote cell invasion and metastasis, blocking IGF2 can be a promising target to inhibit keloid progression. I have shown that inhibiting IGF2 using Chromeceptin significantly reduced keloid fibroblast proliferation in vitro. I have also shown that Tiplaxtinin, a SERPIN1 inhibitor, can selectively inhibit the proliferation of keloid fibroblasts over normal fibroblasts. I have confirmed that Minoxidil, an FDA approved over-the-counter topical drug for treating hair loss and a known PLOD2 inhibitor, also inhibits the proliferation of keloid fibroblasts. Since PLOD2 is known to promote collagen remodeling and induce cell migration, minoxidil may be helpful in reducing keloid severity and recurrence as a topical ointment. I have also tested the effect of different HAT and FDA approved HDAC inhibitors on keloid fibroblasts and both classes of inhibitors have shown the significant effects in blocking keloid fibroblast proliferation. These results suggest that keloid fibroblasts may need very precise levels of histone acetylation and altering the levels of this histone modification can result in keloid cell death. These data also suggests that further studies are required to assay additional histone modifications to fully understand the epigenetic contribution in keloid pathogenesis.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Taken together, the studies described in this dissertation provide a wealth of genomic and cell biological data that greatly improve our understanding of keloid pathogenesis and response to steroid therapy at the molecular level. The studies also provide several molecular targets for keloid therapy using existing FDA approved and pre-clinical drugs, as well as potential biomarkers for determining keloid susceptibility and response to steroid therapy.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This treatise seeks to examine the history and performance trends of the percussion section of The U.S. Army Band “Pershing’s Own.” As no formal research has been done about the percussion section as a whole and the band is approaching its centennial celebration, this is the perfect opportunity to explore a vital segment of the band. Through analysis of early records presented in dissertations about The U.S. Army Band along with interviews with current and past members of the percussion section, this treatise will provide a glimpse into the changes of the section from the perspective of the band today.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In the sixteenth and seventeenth century, a curious phenomenon spread throughout France. Credit contracts, drawn up by notaries, began to include a short clause which leveraged “all of the debtor’s movable and immovable property, present and future” as collateral on the loan. The purpose of the “hypothèque clause” was two-fold: it greased the wheels of personal credit obligations by granting creditors a claim to their debtor’s property, and it satisfied the Catholic Church’s criteria for non-usurious loans. The inclusion of the hypothèque clause underwrote a rise of credit, commerce, and capitalism in early modern France. At the same time, it created private ties of obligation which existed alongside the public hierarchies of the seigneurial system. New conceptions of property rights fostered by l’hypothèque were ultimately inhospitable to traditional seigneurie. Seigneurs adapted to these changes, as did the monarchy. But the crown’s attempted reforms of l’hypothèque could not succeed without defeating the logic of its own existence. While revolutionaries undid seigneurie, they also replicated the monarchy’s strategy of backing the debts of the state with an expanded portfolio of nationalized properties (biens-nationaux). Only after the paper bills of the assignat were recognized as a failure did revolutionaries return to reforming l’hypothèque. Revolutionary legislation on 9 Messidor, Year III, and 11 Brumaire, Year VII, redefined l’hypothèque as the listing of specific assets as collateral in public registries. Trust between debtors and creditors—nearly destroyed by fraud and the repayment of loans in worthless assignats—could now recover. The Napoleonic code, by standardizing and harmonizing the different legal regimes of France, further clarified l’hypothèque. With procedures in place for tracking and securing the repayment of loans, France could complete the process of economic modernization begun during the ancien régime and accelerated by the Revolution. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>    The goal of this treatise is to provide an in-depth examination of the selected arrangements of Francisco Tárrega. The intent is to provide classical guitar students information on the music of Tárrega that can be used for research and making decisions on performing the selected arrangements. Transcriptions and arrangements were a major part of Tárrega's output. Tárrega's use of transcriptions and arrangements helped broaden the music available to be performed on the guitar. This and other achievements will be discussed in the introductory chapter. 
	Eight selected arrangements of Tárrega are included in this annotated guide. It includes the music of Robert Schumann, Joaquin Malats, Juan Emilio Arrieta, Felix Mendelssohn, Johann Strauss Jr., Richard Wagner, and Jean-Delphin Alard. The arrangements to be discussed include Tárrega's Reverie de Schumann, Serenata Española, Estudio de Cramer, Fantasia de Marina, Preludio sobre un tema de Mendelssohn, Isabel (vals), Estudio sobre un tema de Richard Wagner, and Estudio Brillante.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Older adults with amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI) can experience daily Prospective Memory (PM) challenges that can affect their ability to manage day-to-day tasks, maintain their health, and sustain relationships with family and friends. Voice-activated assistants (VAAs) are a hands-free, convenient tool that have the potential to help older adults with PM-related tasks. Unfortunately, there are barriers to adoption of VAAs by this population. In this study, 15 older adults (4 with and 11 without aMCI) were given an Echo Dot device to use for a 10-day period. A Tip Card provided guidance on how to use the device to perform three PM-related tasks: setting reminders, creating lists, and setting timers. This Tip Card was designed with a human-centered design approach, incorporating the input of a subject matter expert on the needs of this population. Over 10 days, usage logs were extracted remotely from the device and each interaction was coded according to its purpose. After the use period, a semi-structured interview was conducted to assess each participant’s experiences and ratings of both the device and Tip Card individually, and a thematic analysis was used to extract common experiences. On average, PM-related tasks made up 67% of total uses. Usability scores for the device were “A” on average, corresponding to a rating of “excellent”; scores for the Tip Card were also “A” on average. The most commonly mentioned interview themes were Device Usefulness and Tip Card Usefulness, and other themes revealed specific benefits of the device/Tip Card system, as well as provided insight into the barriers still faced by this population in using VAAs. Taken together, the findings support that VAAs can help older adults with and without aMCI to complete daily memory-related tasks. These findings also suggest that a Tip Card system designed with the target population in mind can provide a starting point of baseline confidence for all users and serve as a return point for users who have difficulty remembering how to use the device. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The works of Alvin Ailey have been largely overlooked by musicologists interested in studying the intersections between music and dance. This is true despite his overrepresentation in dance scholarship in large part because of the sustained popularity of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater (AAADT). Even though he was not a musician, Ailey was an enthusiastic listener of music with eclectic tastes and a sensitivity to musical structure and phrasing that make his works a rich site for musicological study.The dissertation makes a case for a deeper study into Ailey’s interactions with music, composers, and musicians using the three major goals that Ailey had for his company: to carve out a space for Black performance art; to provide job opportunities for Black artists; and to promote the work of Black artists. Three case studies, his ballets Revelations, The River, and Mary Lou’s Mass represent the manifestation of each of these goals in different ways. Revelations places African-American spirituals into their cultural context and reveals the blend of Africanist and Western European elements that form an African-American aesthetic. Ailey and Duke Ellington’s collaboration on The River for the American Ballet Theatre (ABT) reveals the systemic racist structures that were and continue to be in place to exclude and discourage Black performers from participating in Western classical performance. Mary Lou’s Mass was a collaboration with jazz pianist and composer, Mary Lou Williams. Ailey intended to create an artistically fulfilling representation of the Catholic Mass and demonstrate the appropriateness of jazz music in the liturgy. Analyzing these three ballets highlights both Ailey’s preferred methods of musical collaboration and the strategies Black artists from across disciplines used to cope with institutional racism especially as it was practiced in areas considered high art.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The northern Australian rainy season is part of the Asian-Australian monsoon system and occurs during the Austral summer across the northern regions of the continent.  The Australian monsoon is responsible for most of the annual rainfall budget for the region, thus having a comprehensive understanding of the rainy season is of vital importance for socio-economic and environmental considerations.	In this dissertation, we objectively define onset and demise of the rainy season, locally (at a given grid point of the observed rainfall analysis) from the definition of aggregate northern Australian rainy season. This definition allows to account for the variations of the length of the rainy season in addition to the variations in the daily rain rate, which together contribute to the seasonal variability of the rainfall. We further analyze the variations of the local onset and demise dates, length and seasonal rainfall anomaly of the northern Australian rainy season from the intraseasonal to the secular scales. The results from this study uniquely highlight the spatial heterogeneity of the seasonal evolution of the rainy season and its variability.  The spatial distribution of the frequency of local demise of NARS during the various phases of the ISO exhibit coherent areas of high frequency during dry phases of ISO around the Gulf of Carpentaria.  
	This study then examines the fidelity of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project version 6 (CMIP6) models from their historical simulations to simulate these observed features. The analyzed CMIP6 simulations over the northern Australian region have shown promise in some of the features of the rainy season that we identify in this study.  For example, the onset and the demise dates of the rainy season are reasonable and its association with El Niño and the Southern Oscillation is also verifiable. The CMIP6 model projections for Shared Socio-economic Pathway SSP126 (or green pathway) and the high emission SSP585 (or fossil-fueled pathway) scenarios towards the end of the 21st century were independently analyzed to show the impacts of anthropogenic climate change on the northern Australian region. Our broad conclusion from this analysis is that the impact of the anthropogenic change on the northern Australian rainy season is statistically insignificant. However, it should be noted that these CMIP6 models displayed poor fidelity in simulating the observed linear trends of the 20th century northern Australian rainy season.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study introduces a longitudinal diagnostic classification model, called the LTA+HDCM, which is a fusion of latent transition analysis (LTA; Collins &amp; Flaherty, 2002; Collins &amp; Wugalter, 1992) and the hierarchical diagnostic classification model (HDCM; Templin &amp; Bradshaw, 2014).  The primary goals in this study are (1) to evaluate the adequacy of the LTA+HDCM to recover the order of theoretical levels  of learning progressions (LPs) with attributes in a linear hierarchy, and (2) to recover measurement model parameters (item and person parameters) and structural model parameters (latent status prevalences and transition probabilities) under different study conditions in which the LTA+HDCM is employed.   
A simulation study is used to achieve the study goals.  The design factors are selected to reflect aspects of the measurement model that can be manipulated to infer learners' statuses on LP levels: number of measurement occasions T = (2, 3), test lengths consisting of J = (12, 18, 24) items, Q-matrix designs consisting of Q = (3, 6) item types, and sample sizes N = (500, 1000, 1500).  Convergence rates, X2 goodness-of-fit statistics, classification accuracy statistics, and graphical displays are used to evaluate the adequacy of the model to achieve the study goals.  An empirical study using data from the Mathematization in Science (MTS; Jin et al., 2019) LP is then conducted to recover LP levels.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The simulation study identified three important design factors which impacted the ability of the LTA+HDCM to recover LP theoretical levels and evidence and competency growth parameters.  These factors are test length J, sample size N, and Q-matrix design. Of the three factors, complexity of Q-matrix design is most influential in recovery of LP theoretical levels and evidence and competency growth model parameter. In study conditions in which the Complete Q-matrix design (Q = 6 item types) was implemented, the LTA+HDCM fully recovered LP theoretical levels and provided ignorable bias of parameter estimates.  In contrast, LP theoretical levels and parameters were only partially recovered in study conditions with the Partial Q-matrix design (Q = 3 item types).    </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Patients in palliative care have many different medical and psychosocial needs that encompass the whole person. A family-centered approach is conducive to this population due to the immense emotional and psychological burden impending death of a loved one can impose. It is especially important to keep this in mind when working with pediatric palliative care patients since their family, including parents and siblings, is often involved. Research has indicated the breadth music therapy can encompass in treating the whole person as well as incorporating family members into the therapeutic process.The purpose of this study was to identify and analyze existing research by conducting a systematic review of research-based studies to determine validity of music therapy practice within this population as well as implications for future research. While this review showed some research-proven effectiveness of music therapy on this population, it also identified the need for more extensive research to better understand the role of music therapy within the pediatric palliative care setting.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Evidence on the efficacy of music interventions for patients with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (PD) is actively developing within and outside of the music therapy profession. The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review of replicable research on music interventions utilized with patients diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease (PD) with the intent of creating a comprehensive collection of evidence for music therapists and other clinical professionals to cite in treatment planning. A literature search identified 46 publications that met the inclusion criteria. The 46 studies were categorized into five domains related to symptoms treated: motor functioning, psychological health/emotion, communication, cognition, and social functioning. The majority of studies (72%) addressed motor functioning while only 1 study cited social functioning as its primary measure. Of the 183 authors included in the review, the most represented professions were neurologists (23%), physical therapists (16%), and psychologists (14%), respectively. The most cited interventions were rhythmic entrainment (36%), group singing (24%), and receptive music listening (12%). The current body of quantitative literature on music interventions in patients with PD calls for further research on implications involving non-motor symptoms of PD and a greater participation of board-certified music therapists in the provision of music with the population.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The successful growth of colloidal lead halide perovskite nanocrystals has generated tremendous interest in the community, due to the unique properties and the promise PQDs offer for use in applications involving light-emitting devices and solar cell technology. However, tangible progress in probing their fundamental properties and/or their integration into optoelectronic devices has been hampered by issues of colloidal and photophysical instability. In this dissertation, we aim to understand the surface chemistry of all inorganic perovskite nanocrystals, exploring several different strategies to address the stability issues. We successfully developed sets of polymer ligands exhibiting strong binding affinity towards perovskite NC surface and endow them both enhanced stability and optical properties. In Chapter 1, we provide a summary of basic physical and chemical properties behind semiconducting quantum dots (QDs). A though introduction of metal halide perovskite is also provided, which include their crystal structures, growth method, shape control, ion exchange and phase transformation features. At the end, we summarize all the common strategies that have been reported to enhance the stability of perovskite NCs. 
In Chapter 2, we introduce a promising surface coating strategy relying on a polyzwitterion polymer, where high-affinity binding onto the QDs is driven by multicoordinating electrostatic interactions with the ion-rich surfaces of CsPbBr3 PQDs. The polymer ligands were synthesized by installing a stoichiometric mixture of amine-modified sulfobetaine anchors and solubilizing motifs on poly(isobutylene-alt-maleic anhydride), PIMA, via nucleophilic addition reaction. We find that this coating approach imparts enhanced colloidal and photophysical stability to the nanocrystals over a broad range of solvent conditions and in powder form. This approach also allows easy phase transfer of the PQDs from nonpolar media to an array of solutions with varying polarities and properties. Additionally, the stabilization strategy preserves the photophysical and structural characteristics of the nanocrystals over a period extending to 1.5 years under certain conditions.
In Chapter 3, we detail the synthesis of a new family of multi-coordinating, bromidebased polysalt ligands and test their ability to stabilize CsPbBr3 nanocrystals in polar solutions. The ligands present multiple salt groups involving quaternary cations, namely ammonium and imidazolium as anchors for coordination onto PQD surfaces, along with several alkyl chains with varying chain length to promote solubilization in various conditions. The ligands provide a few key benefits including the ability to repair damaged surface sites, allow rapid ligand exchange and phase transfer, and preserve the crystalline structure and morphology of the nanocrystals. The polysalt-coated PQDs exhibit near unity PLQY and significantly enhanced colloidal stability in ethanol and methanol.
In Chapter 4, we report the surface ligand-engineering strategy to enhance the photoluminescence quantum yields and stability of perovskite NPLs using a PbBr2-complexed polysalt ligands. The polysalt ligand contains either ammonium bromide or imidazolium bromide salt as anchoring group and alkyl chain with different length as solubilizing blocks. The presence of the quaternary ammonium salt could facilitate the dissolution of PbBr2 in organic solvents, forming polysalt-[PbBrx] complexes. The L-PbBr2 complex could simultaneously eliminate the surface defects on the pristine NPLs as well as improve their stability to maintain color purity and anisotropic morphology. This strategy enables us to obtain pure blue-emitting NPLs with PLQY up to 80% at ~460 nm and with significantly enhanced stability to resist long-term storage, UV irradiation and dilution.
In Chapter 5, we provide a summary on the work presented in this dissertation focusing on the surface functionalization of perovskite NCs. At the end we discuss the future direction based on expanding the structure of the multi-coordinating polymer ligands and their applications on other perovskite NCs.

            <DISS_para>This dissertation examines the needs, preferences, policies, programs, and institutions surrounding localfood systems to better understand how they align with sustainability principles and goals. Both food system
governance at the local level and the promotion of locally sourced foods are moored to sustainability goals,
especially in urban areas, because of their impacts on environmental and health characteristics like green
space, fresh food access, pollution reduction measures, and storm water mitigation efforts. The questions
posed here use local food systems, as they are still underrepresented in the literature, but are vitally important
to further our understanding of all three pillars of sustainability: economy, environment, and equity. The
theories and analytical techniques I use here can be applied to investigate a variety of economic development,
land use, and sustainability policies and programs at the local and regional levels, as I discuss throughout.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Previous studies have suggested that students’ classroom engagement (i.e., their involvement in a class, Lin, 2012) is one significant factor that could explain their academic achievement (Skinner et al., 2009). Both students’ individual factors and classroom environmental factors play important roles in explaining their classroom engagement (Bundick et al., 2014). The present study integrated and analyzed both types of factors to provide a comprehensive understanding of Chinese undergraduate English-as-a-Foreign-Language students’ classroom engagement.Students’ individual factors in the present study included their learning-motivations at different levels of proximity to their classroom engagement (i.e., distal motives and proximal motivations). The distal motives included four dispositional tendencies, i.e., their hope for success (i.e., the desire to achieve success, Thrash &amp; Eliot, 2002), fear of failure (i.e., the tendency to avoid failure, Thrash &amp; Eliot, 2002), growth-seeking tendency (i.e., a tendency towards self-improvement and self-growth, Dykman, 1998) and validation-seeking tendency (i.e., a tendency to prove basic worth, self-competence, and likability, Dykman, 1998). The proximal motivations were domain-specific, specifically including students’ subjective value of learning English and their self-efficacy (i.e., perceived abilities) for accomplishing English tasks). Two classroom environmental factors were also involved in the present study, including students’ perceptions of mastery goal structure (i.e., a classroom in which mastery of skills and self-improvement are emphasized, Diseth &amp; Samdal, 2015) and performance goal structure (i.e., a classroom in which achievement and performance-comparisons among students are emphasized, Diseth &amp; Samdal, 2015). 
Using online surveys, the present study included Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) analysis to investigate 1) individual and classroom environmental factors as antecedents, 2) academic achievement as the important outcome of students’ classroom engagement, and 3) the classroom environmental factors as moderators of the relationships among students’ proximal motivations (i.e., examples of individual factors) and classroom engagement. A total of 2,982 freshmen and sophomores from six universities in China participated in the present study.  
The results revealed that students’ proximal motivations (i.e., the subjective value of learning English and self-efficacy for accomplishing English tasks) directly predicted their classroom engagement. Students’ distal motives did not directly predict their classroom engagement. Students’ subjective value of learning English fully mediated the relationship between their hope for success and classroom engagement as well as the relationship between their growth-seeking tendency and the classroom engagement. Students’ self-efficacy for accomplishing English tasks completely mediated the relationship between their hope for success and classroom engagement and the relationship between their fear of failure and classroom engagement. Students’ validation-seeking tendency did not predict their classroom engagement, neither directly nor indirectly. Furthermore, students’ classroom engagement positively predicted their academic achievement. In addition, the two classroom environmental factors (i.e., students’ perceptions of classroom goal structures) directly explained their classroom engagement. However, the relationships of students’ proximal motivations and classroom engagement were not significantly different when comparing students who rated classroom goal structures (mastery goals, performance goals) high and those who rated classroom goal structures low.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Lately, there has been an increased focus on the role that certification plays in the long-term performance of classroom teachers. In short, does certification matter? Many studies have analyzed the specific components and requirements of certification programs to determine which might be more predictive of long-term teaching success. This study focuses on the Florida Teacher Certification Examinations/Florida Educational Leadership Examination (FTCE/FELE) program, which is a component of the process of becoming a certified education in the state of Florida. Using the test results from the middle and high school FTCE mathematics certification examinations, as well as value-added model (VAM) scores for Florida teachers, this study establishes a link between specific features of these credentialing examinations and teacher performance, as measured by VAM scores. The findings indicate that changes in the assessment construct and criterion had no significant impact on the measured performance of teachers who took a mathematics certification examination. The paper also discusses observed trends for various teacher- and district-level characteristics.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Polyelectrolytes are highly charged polymers compensated by small counterions. Based on the type of charge, a polyelectrolyte can be either polycation or polyanion. When mixing two oppositely charged polyelectrolytes in aqueous solution, entropy driven polymer-polymer interactions will occur, which results in a solid precipitant or liquid-liquid phase separation. Based on the viscoelastic properties of the resulted material, it is either called a “polyelectrolyte complex” (solid-like) or a “polyelectrolyte coacervate” (liquid-like), PECs. PECs have a wide range of applications, such as drug delivery, anti-reflective coatings, separation membranes and under-water adhesives. PECs are also considered for bio-medical applications since DNA, RNA and proteins are all charged macromolecules. Understanding the dynamics and compositions of these materials can guide the potential applications and processing conditions of these materials, help to build physical theories behind sticky ionic pairing interactions. Thus, it is highly desirable to investigate the fundamental aspects of PECs to enhance their applications.In Chapter 3, the dynamics of PECs were studied. We prepared a series of PECs made of polycation poly(methacrylamidopropyltrimethylammonium chloride) (PMAPTAC) and polyanion poly(sodium methacrylate) (PMA-Na), which containing five PEC pairs of different molecular weight with matched polycation/polyanion chain lengths. Rheology experiments were carried out for all PEC pairs at different temperatures and salt concentrations. Time-temperature (TTS) and time-temperature-salt (TTSS) superpositions were achieved with a satisfactory fit to sticky association theory. Relaxation times for polymer partnering (τb), entanglement (τe) and reptation (τrep) were revealed directly from the TTS data. All these characteristic lifetimes were slowed by the sticky dynamics of Pol+Pol- pairs. We found that the relaxation kinetics of temperature showed Arrhenius dependence, whereas changing the salt concentration impacted the lifetime of Pol+Pol- pairs, the number of stickers per chain and the volume fraction of polymer.
In Chapter 4, the compositions of PECs were studied, specifically the ion distribution inside and outside the PECs. The compositions of poly(diallydimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC)/poly(4-styrenefulfonic acid, sodium salt) (PSSNa) PEC were investigated with five different salt types. A radio-labeling technique was used to precisely determine the salt content of PDADMA/PSS PEC at different salt concentrations. The water/polymer content was obtained by weight. Enthalpy of complexation (ΔHPEC) would influence the doping equilibrium constant. Thus, isothermal titration calorimetry experiments were carried out to determine ΔHPEC for each salt type. The Donnan equilibrium predicted the correlation between [salt]PEC and [salt]s by considering the PEC composition and ΔHPEC: if ΔHPEC &lt; 0, [salt]PEC &lt; [salt]s and if ΔHPEC &gt; 0, [salt]PEC &gt; [salt]s.
In Chapter 5, the doping behaviors of PECs at higher ionic strength and how the glass transition temperature was correlated to their compositions were further investigated. Hydrated poly(diallyldimethylammonium) (PDADMA) and poly(styrene sulfonate) (PSS) PEC with a Tg near room temperature was radio-labeled with 22Na isotopes along a Hofmeister series. A slope change in the doping level versus salt concentration was observed for all five salts studied in this work. This transition was correlated to the free volume expansion of the PECs at the temperature passed through Tg. Before Tg, a majority of the ions compensated the polyelectrolytes and played role of “counterion”, whereas after Tg, both counter- and co-ions co-existed in the system. Tg of PECs at the same doping level of each salts were collected and correlated to their compositions.
In Chapter 6, a series of quaternized poly(vinyl pyridine) with different side chain lengths were prepared to study how the hydrophobicity of the polyelectrolytes could influence its rheological properties and compositions. Complexed with poly(methacrylic acid, sodium salt), an unexpected anti-hydrophobicity effect was discovered: with a longer carbon side chain, the PECs were more hydrophilic. Radiolabeling and radiocounting techniques were used to precisely determine the ion content in PECs. Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments were carried out to obtain the enthalpy of complexation. Using Donnan equilibrium, a satisfactory fitting was achieved between [MA]s and [MA]PEC by varying the ratio of counter-ion to co-ion, f. Instead of the nature of the materials, the apparent hydrophobicity was rooted in the molar volume of the PEC. 
In Chapter 7, the minimum number of charges required to initiate the complexation or coacervation behavior was investigated. By complexing a sulfonic acid system bearing different number of charges with PDADMAC, it was found that from 3 to 4 charge the rheological and mechanical properties of the resulted sample enhanced dramatically. This phenomenon was also examined using polypeptides complexed with phosphate salts. This unprecedent viscoelastic transition might be relevant to those aspects of disease states that are characterized by abnormal mechanical property. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Due to the greater attention on child-centered and creative pedagogies, the Reggio Emilia approach (REA) has become a famous and favored approach worldwide since 1991. More and more educators apply REA to foreign contexts and realize the adaptations are necessary outside of Italy. This study investigates the possibilities of implementing REA with concerns of adaptations in Taiwan, especially in art education. Studying the roles of art and the story of becoming Reggio-inspired are the primary foci for the REA adaption investigation.  	REA is an intra-active pedagogy that emphasizes material engagements and the agential flow between humans and non-humans. In line with the intra-active disposition, this study employs a diffractive ethnography to inquiry a Reggio-inspired preschool, Little Heart (LH), in Taiwan. This study was conducted from August 2018 to July 2019. The participants were three classroom teachers in the kindergarten class and the principal in LH. Observation, intraview, and diffractive journaling are the applied research methods in this diffractive ethnography. 
	The investigation can divide into two phases. The first phase was mainly to understand the LH’s Reggio-inspired history through observing the teachers’ teaching, intraviewing the stories of being LH teachers, and creating artworks about their teaching philosophy. The investigation shows that LH marks the learning values on child-centeredness, emergent curriculum, learning autonomy, collaboration, and reflection. Among the values, LH manifests the roles of art in documentation, experiential learning, and reflective thinking. Nevertheless, the researcher discovered several conflicts about knowledge examination and material usages in a hierarchical relationship between adults and children, verbal and graphics.
	To ease the conflicts, the researcher, as an art education consultor, co-worked with the three classroom teachers to search for the possibility of being Reggio-inspired at the subsequent investigation. The co-working experiences were the entangled efforts between the three teachers and the researcher working in a dialogical situation. The entangled efforts discovered that when teachers treat the examined concept as an open question, both the teacher and the students can construct knowledge by learning from others in the project. Moreover, materials could be implemented for improving knowledge examination by serving materials as communicating and connecting relations instead of only documenting the learning results. 
	The space that the researcher, the principal, and the three teachers created can inform several possibilities of becoming Reggio-inspired. A space for becoming Reggio-inspired can build a sense of belonging and a two-way relationship, meet others, and welcome to become different. Moreover, the visual diary practices positively influenced for teachers to become Reggio-inspired through involving in concepts, materials, and emotion. The inventive findings at the second phase indicate a grassroots model as feasible to adapt REA in Taiwan. Building a flexible and dialogical environment is significant for the leaders to consider the school operation. Individual teachers could keep mind-open toward being Reggio-inspired by questioning the concept and innovating material usages. Further studies are required to go deep and wide for the REA adaptations in Taiwan or other contexts.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this treatise is to provide a close examination of the compositional styles of two pianist-composers, Robert Chumbley (b. 1954) and Lera Auerbach (b. 1973), as well as critical analyses of selected solo piano works. It expands upon two doctoral lecture recitals I gave in the spring semesters of 2020 and 2021. The treatise is divided into two parts: the first part focuses on Robert Chumbley’s Brahmsiana II (2011) and Three Etudes (…by any other name…) (2015) and the second focuses on Lera Auerbach’s Diabellical Waltz (2019) and Il Segno: Piano Sonata No. 2 (2006).	Both Chumbley and Auerbach began their careers as pianists and have performed in concerts across the globe. Their compositional aesthetics are rooted in the Western musical tradition from the seventeenth to the twentieth centuries; however, the particular stylistic idioms they each have drawn from these musical roots have manifested differently in their work. Thus, their music provides listeners with distinctive musical vignettes of the past, viewed through unique lenses. My intention is to illustrate how Chumbley and Auerbach fused specific stylistic idioms with their individual compositional approaches. The first chapter, which focuses on Chumbley, investigates the influence of Beethoven, Chopin, Brahms, Debussy, Scriabin, Shostakovich, and Copland on his creative approach, as demonstrated in the two selected piano works. Specifically, it focuses on motivic treatment, harmonic color, and textural placement that render the characteristic atmosphere, mannerisms, and material in each piece. The second chapter highlights Auerbach’s particular brand of polystylism and synthesis of past and present. Using Schnittke’s two principles of polystylism—citation and allusion—my analysis demonstrates the way in which Auerbach perceives and incorporates musical idioms and materials from the past in an organic way, remaking them in new contexts. Brief performance guides to the works are provided at the end of each chapter.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The geological and hydrological contexts of the Wakulla River Drainage Basin may present the conditions needed to host potentially significant archaeological deposits associated with intact stratigraphy. To date, there is no in-depth study of submerged and nearshore sites or geologic features where sites could be found in this drainage basin. Submerged karst features and their associated archaeological sites dating to the Paleoindian and Archaic periods in this region appear to be the only geologic features that contain secure stratigraphic sequences and the conditions required for organic preservation (Halligan 2019). Organic preservation at submerged karst features is important in these contexts for radiocarbon dating sites, as well as preserving more and different types of cultural materials from past peoples than can be found in terrestrial sites in the region. 
By applying LiDAR mapping, GIS layers and tools, and other modern geoarchaeological approaches to known sites and newly identified areas of interest, this thesis compiles and synthesizes what we know of the submerged landscape in this drainage basin. This thesis presents a localized model for assessing the parameters in which archaeological deposits might exist within one of Florida’s numerous rivers. This approach could be utilized by appropriate researchers, land management agencies, and other stakeholders across Florida’s karstic rivers with submerged archaeological site potential to successfully implement long-term management and research objectives.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-encapsulated structures released by cells which carry signaling factors, proteins and microRNAs that mediate intercellular communication. Accumulating evidence supports an important role of EVs in the spread and pathogenesis of infectious diseases. Viruses have been reported to usurp host EV biogenesis pathways to package viral products, which are capable of modulating tumor microenvironments. In addition, EVs have been shown to cross blood-brain and placental barriers, thus viruses may utilize normal EV biology to gain access to previous impassable barriers. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter 2 of the thesis focuses on how Zika virus infection exploits host EV biogenesis pathways to increase infectivity, evade the host immune system and possibly alter tropism of the virus. We demonstrate that Zika virus infected cells secrete distinct EV sub-populations with specific viral protein profiles and infectious genomes. Zika virus infection resulted in the enhanced production of EVs with varying sizes and density compared to those released from non-infected cells. We also show that the EV enriched tetraspanin CD63 regulates the release of EVs, and Zika viral genomes and capsids following infection. Overall, these findings provide evidence for an alternative means of Zika virus transmission and demonstrate the role of EV biogenesis and trafficking proteins in the modulation of Zika infection and virion morphogenesis. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In chapter 3 of the thesis, the role of ceramide in Latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) EV secretion and signaling is explored.  Recently, the tetraspanin protein CD63 has been found to form a complex with LMP1 and knock-out of CD63 in epithelial cell lines results in reduced exosomal LMP1. In certain cell lines, CD63 is trafficked to EVs through a ceramide-dependent manner. Therefore, we hypothesized that ceramide is required for efficient packaging of LMP1 into EVs. Following treatment with GW4869, a compound that inhibits the enzyme important for ceramide synthesis, EVs from Epstein-Barr (EBV-infected lymphoblastoid (LCL) and HEK293 cells carrying doxycycline-inducible LMP1 were analyzed by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) for particle numbers and immunoblotting for EV content. EVs were further purified on density gradients to examine vesicle subpopulations. LMP1 was determined to be secreted in small EV populations by gradient purification. NTA of EVs from the cells treated with GW4869 demonstrated a significant decrease in particle secretion. LMP1 localization was disrupted in the treated cells and immunoblotting of EV lysates revealed a significant reduction in extracellular LMP1. Electron microscopy of density fractions illustrated morphological disruptions to CD63- and LMP1-enriched vesicle subpopulations. Additionally, ceramide inhibition resulted in enhanced LMP1-mediated Nuclear Factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFkB) activation in exosome producing cells. Taken together, these data reveal a critical role for the lipid ceramide in LMP1 exosomal trafficking and the oncogenic signaling properties of the viral protein.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>We introduce PPCA-Xnorm, a method we developed to perform cross platform normalization ofgene expression values across two or more gene platforms. PPCA-Xnorm is based on a Probabilistic
Principal Component Analysis (PPCA) model. The approach to cross-platform normalization can
be summarized into the following steps. First, we define the model and its parameters. We
assume proportional measurement errors, which is necessary to derive closed-from solutions of the
correlation matrix, its inverse, and its derivatives. These expressions are later used in the grand
log likelihood function. We also propose solutions to identifiability issues in our model. Next, we
derive the grand log-likelihood function of the model and derive their gradients with respect to
the parameters of interest. For some parameters, we are able to solve their gradient equations to
arrive at a closed-form solution of their maximum likelihood estimators. For other parameters, we
solve their gradient equations iteratively using the process of gradient descent. Lastly, we derive
the model-specific, Multivariate Normal based, conditional expectation of the gene expressions
platforms. We use the conditional expectation equation to normalize gene expression values across
the multiple platforms.
We apply our method to simulated data and achieve improved results over MatchMixeR, a cross
platform normalization method for two platforms previously developed in our group that is based
on a mixed effects linear model. We apply our method to real-world RNA-seq and microarray
data, obtained from GEO, and once again achieve improved performance against MatchMixeR, the
competing method. We use correlation and MSE to evaluate model performance. We then discuss
the beneficial statistical properties of PPCA-Xnorm.
Lastly, we expand upon our methodology so that it is able to perform cross platform normalization
in the case of missing or mismatched samples (i.e. cell lines) across different platforms.
We are able to extend this capability to the extreme case where the platforms contain completely
different cell lines such that there is no explicit link between the platforms. To do this, we use a
method of weighted averages for most parameters. Since taking the average of correlation matrices
is more challenging because they live on a manifold, we develop an approach using the distribution
of the mean of a standardization of the observed gene expression matrix and its singular value
decomposition (SVD).</DISS_para>
