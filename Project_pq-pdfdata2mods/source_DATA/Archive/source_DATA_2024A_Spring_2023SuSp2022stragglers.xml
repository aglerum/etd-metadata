         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In the past century, the concept of resilience has emerged as a critical element in sustaining the performance of critical infrastructure systems amidst various challenges. Traditionally, resilience has been practiced through a risk-based utility maximization approach, where strategies and investments for resilience are evaluated against the likelihood and intensity of potential threats. This approach, while effective in certain contexts, has recently come under scrutiny due to the rapidly evolving frequencies and intensities of threats. These developments have prompted the scientific community to reevaluate the effectiveness of the conventional resilience approach in safeguarding critical infrastructure systems. In the past decade, a novel school of thought emerged, advocating for the concept of adaptation as the foundation of resilience management efforts within critical infrastructure systems. Proponents of this paradigm distinguish between adaptive resilience and traditional practices by designating the latter as embodying the principles of reliability and risk management. The advocates of the adaptive resilience school emphasize the necessity of adaptation in the face of complex, unpredictable challenges (of which deep uncertainties and surprise shocks are the focus of this work). These recent developments have led to a variety of pathways in resilient practice, precipitating an already existing divergence in the conceptualization of the resilience of complex systems. Moreover, a notable gap exists in the literature regarding how these pathways can be effectively organized to optimize resilience outcomes, particularly in situations where knowledge is limited. This dissertation investigates multiple resilience management pathways to understand the role of adaptation in the management of critical civil infrastructure systems. The dissertation is guided by the question: How can adaptive resilience be applied to macro-level complex infrastructure systems to facilitate the decision-making and planning of infrastructure assets and ensure the provision of sustainable and resilient systems? This work employed a set of qualitative and quantitative research methods to achieve the following:  (1)  define what adaptive resilience is, categorize existing planning efforts, and develop a framework that facilitates  future efforts in  the field of adaptive resilience research, (2) investigate the emerging challenges that require adaptive resilience measures, and the implications that hinder the adaptation of these measures, (3) analyze current trends in adaptive resilience practice, and investigate the gap between  the acknowledged need for adaptive resilience and the practical adoption of such practices, (4) investigate the implications emerging challenges have on the current practices and the risks associated with neglecting such challenges, (5) determine the capacities of  adaptive resilience, and (6) provide a future direction for efforts directed towards fostering an adaptive resilience culture within organizations committed to the resilience of critical infrastructure systems.
This research expands the existing infrastructure resilience theory by investigating its limitations and redefining a number of critical concepts that -in our view- facilitate resilience efforts within these complex systems. The work provides a framework for agencies invested in resilience development to enhance their efforts, and provide a clarification about various misconceptions which result in efforts that may be counterproductive to the objectives that motivate them. Overall, the resilience research of critical infrastructure systems is at a developmental stage where agreements on foundational concepts that guide a unified commitment for resilience  are required to advance this important field of study, and  create efforts that are not outpaced by the intensities and frequencies threats that  motivate them.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>At the center of this project is the question of origin and citizenship in the geographical, emotional, and spiritual sense. A subterranean pursuit of the idea of home through a series of questions. If home, “the measurement of rootedness is typically expressed in harmonious stability rather than dynamic progress” as argued by Frank McAndrew in the Journal of Environmental Psychology, what kind of home can possibly be available to someone, like myself, no longer rooted in the geographical enclave of my ancestors, but living instead in a liminal in-between, in a caesura between borders and countries, oceans and continents, airport terminals and foreign cities, memory and exile, language and prayers. If as the poet Safia Elhillo argued, “All our dead in the ground makes this land ours” what kind of home then can possibly be available to someone who dwells across the ocean away from where all his forebears—including his father— are buried. Are journeys a form of betrayal, a flight away from the zone of origin? Is return promised? Are farewells eternal? Is departure a simulacrum of death, a degree of dying? Is journey a category of death? Is death itself a crossing of borders? </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>To date, no research has examined female Masters Divers' motivation to participate in diving or how body image affects them. Through ethnographic experience and interviews with nineteen female Masters divers, this project aimed to understand the motives for participation and deterrents for participation while simultaneously understanding how the body is affected by Masters Diving and how one’s perception of body image affects them. Utilizing a Reflexive Thematic Analysis to understand the findings, five themes emerged: Motivation, The Body, Body Image, Social Interaction, and Masters Diving. Based on these findings, this research project developed suggestions for future research and recommendations to create praxis.  </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Terrain is one of the most important parameters affecting wind loads on buildings. Current building codes such as ASCE 7-16 consider uniform upwind exposure to estimate the wind loads and recommend wind tunnel testing for complex upwind terrain. There is a need to understand the distribution of pressure on the buildings facing a nonuniform upwind terrain. This study aims to investigate the effect of heterogeneous simulation of terrain on wind characteristics and pressure in wind tunnel testing. The knowledge gap in our research, includes a) a limited number of tests of heterogeneous terrain, b) a limited number of tests on mid-rise models, c) dealing with the simulation of heterogeneous terrain in the wind tunnel tests, and also d) difficulties in producing the dataset for heterogeneous terrain will be addressed. In the first task we validated the wind tunnel testing. We also prepared a dataset of heterogeneous terrain using a deep neural network (task 2). In task 3, first, we investigated terrains with simple transitions and small openings. Then, using the results of the previous step and the heterogeneous terrain database, we performed a series of wind tunnel testing on the generic heterogeneous terrain. Analytical and computational models will also be developed to explain the observed terrain effects in task 4. In order to simulate the heterogeneous terrain, a staggered array of 1116 individually controlled roughness elements called Terraformer in the Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel Experimental Facility at the University of Florida was used. In this study, we proposed a Convolutional Neural Network that can classify images in a way it can be used in wind tunnel testing. Landsat-8 images and National Land Cover Database were introduced to the neural network as an unlabeled and labeled dataset, respectively. Unsupervised machine learning algorithms will be used to find representative images among all images in the dataset. Before testing the generic heterogeneous terrain configurations modeled after real terrain, we tested simple heterogeneous terrains. A series of testing has been performed in the wind tunnel to investigate the effect of simple nonuniform terrains such as smooth to rough change, rough to smooth change, and small opening fetch. In this testing, two different building models (low-rise and mid-rise) were located at the center of the turntable. The wind pressure was measured on the walls and the roof of the models using pressure taps connected to the Scanivalve ZOC33 pressure scanning system mounted under the turntable. The three wind speed components were also collected using Turbulent Flow Instrumentation Cobra Probes. The wind speed profile over simple nonuniform terrains was compared with known theories. Then, using the results of the previous testing, and the heterogeneous terrain database in task 2, we performed a series of wind tunnel testing on the generic heterogeneous terrain. The results of wind speed profiles and pressure coefficient distribution in the wind tunnel tests were analyzed and compared for the nonuniform and uniform upwind terrain cases.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>   Situated in the growing body of task-based language teaching research, this quasi-experimental study explored whether different types of written corrective feedback and task planning jointly influence 115 English as a foreign language learners’ development in target structure accuracy and linguistic performance in L2 writing. In response to the increased need to examine the roles of learners’ individual differences in second language acquisition research, the study further investigated how multiple individual characteristics variables—executive working memory, phonological short-term memory, L2 writing anxiety, and L2 writing self-efficacy—moderated the effectiveness of written corrective feedback and task planning. Additionally, the variation in learners’ task-specific anxiety and self-efficacy across time points and treatment conditions was explored.   The participants were from six intact classes in a public high school in South Korea, and they were assigned into six experimental groups. The groups were first divided into two feedback groups: Direct Correction (DC) and Metalinguistic Explanation (ME). The two feedback groups further diverged into three planning groups: Pre-task Planning (PTP), Within-task Planning (WTP), and No Planning (NP). During the treatment sessions, the participants received and studied different types of corrective feedback on their essays from a preceding session and subsequently engaged in a picture-based narrative writing task under the various planning conditions. The feedback targeted two linguistic structures: English articles and past tense. In the testing sessions (pretest, immediate posttest, and delayed posttest), all students were given the same picture prompt and asked to write a narrative essay describing what happened in the picture strip. The essays collected from the testing sessions were assessed in terms of their accuracy in target structures and linguistic performance (complexity, accuracy, and fluency; CAF). The students were also asked to respond to general L2 writing anxiety and L2 writing self-efficacy questionnaires (at the onset of the study) as well as task-specific anxiety and self-efficacy questionnaires (after finishing each writing test). Learners’ executive working memory was measured by an Operation Span test, while the phonological short-term memory was assessed via a Digit Span test.
  The study aimed to answer three research questions: i) What are the main and interaction effects of written corrective feedback and task planning on EFL learners’ development in target structure accuracy and linguistic performance of CAF?, ii) What is the role of learners’ individual differences in executive working memory, phonological short-term memory, L2 writing anxiety, and L2 writing self-efficacy in predicting the development of target structure accuracy and linguistic performance of CAF under various task conditions?, and iii) How do learners’ task-specific L2 writing anxiety and L2 writing self-efficacy vary from their initial writing experience to the final experience in different task conditions?
  Regarding the effects of feedback and planning, two-way ANCOVA revealed that Metalinguistic Explanation was slightly more effective than Direct Correction for the immediate past tense accuracy, but only when the learners engaged in Within-task Planning. The development of English articles, which was one of the targeted structures, was not influenced by the treatments. Regarding the performance of CAF, Pre-task Planning served as a playing field discerning the superior effects of Direct Correction over Metalinguistic Explanation on immediate and delayed syntactic complexity.  Under the No Planning environment, the learners exhibited higher immediate lexical complexity when they were treated with Direct Correction, while they demonstrated enhanced general morphosyntactic and lexical accuracy upon receiving Metalinguistic Explanation. When it came to L2 writing fluency, Within-task Planning notably decreased writing speed in the immediate posttest, especially when compared to Pre-task Planning. Moreover, Direct Correction was found to be less disruptive than Metalinguistic Explanation.
  In examining the impact of the individual difference variables on the development of the diverse outcome measures across task conditions, two-way ANCOVA was employed, with interaction terms between treatments and individual difference factors. It was found that the impact of executive working memory on immediate outcome measures was observed across several domains, including the accuracy of articles and past tense, syntactic complexity, and overall morphosyntactic accuracy. Furthermore, this cognitive device exhibited varying influences across different treatment conditions. On the other hand, L2 writing self-efficacy emerged as a significant predictor of immediate past tense accuracy across all treatment conditions (without interaction with feedback or planning types). Other individual difference factors, namely phonological short-term memory and L2 writing anxiety, were not shown to play significant roles. It is important to highlight that the notable findings regarding the role of executive working memory and L2 writing self-efficacy were limited to the immediate posttest performance, suggesting the transient nature of individual difference factors’ effects. 
  With regard to the changes in task-specific anxiety and self-efficacy, the mixed design repeated measures ANOVA showed that learners’ anxiety level toward the given writing task generally decreased from the pretest (Time 1) to the delayed posttest (Time 3), while their self-efficacy increased over time. In relation to the impact of different interventions, the combination of Direct Correction and Pre-task Planning proved beneficial in enhancing task self-efficacy during the L2 writing task performance.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In the modern information era, graphs have been ubiquitous in numerous high-impact areas, including social media, bioinformatics, artificial intelligence, and critical infrastructures. The sets of nodes and edges within graphs can effectively represent and preserve information of entities and the sophisticated relationships among them. With the prevading and increasing trends of graph data, numerous graph-related tasks and techniques have been proposed and deeply studied. For example, graph representation learning extracts graph information into vectors for downstream tasks; graph similarity computation task quantifies the distances between two graphs, which is utilized in pattern recognition and drug creation; graph summarization task compress the sizes for representing large-scale graphs to assist more efficient graph storage. Due to the unique structures and increasing scales of graphs, graph-related tasks and algorithms still face many challenges from both effectiveness and efficiency aspects, especially when the scales of graph data (either the sheer size of a single graph or the number of data graphs in a graph database) explode. Meanwhile, nowadays we have witnessed the prosperity and advantages of deep learning models in many applications. With its unprecedented inference ability, it is intuitive to consider applying deep learning methods for dealing with graph-related tasks and also enhance the performance of existing graph computational methods.In this dissertation, I summarize three representative topics of my research works throughout the Ph.D. study that emphasize the problems mentioned above. The first topic is graph representation learning with graph neural networks (GNNs) on large-scale graphs. As the graph’s scale increases and higher-order neighbors are considered, the recursive neighborhood aggregation within GNNs can cause the number of neighbors to explode when computing node representations. We name this problem as neighbors explosion. Besides, graphs have the characteristics of node dependence, which means neighboring nodes affect each other in the learning process. When GNNs go deeper and learn on the full graph, it is unavoidable for the problem of oversmoothing that node representations from different clusters mix up. The problems of neighbors explosion, node dependence, and oversmoothing hinder the effectiveness and even feasibility of GNNs. In the dissertation, I introduce a subgraph- based GNN training framework that lowers the space complexity during the running process and also addresses the above problems on large graphs. The second topic in the dissertation is deep learning-based graph similarity computation. Existing graph similarity computation methods suffer from severe performance issues due to the NP-hardness of exact computation of the graph edit distance (GED) metric. Graph edit distance (GED) is defined as a minimum number of graph edit operations between a pair of graphs, and it has by far been the most well-studied graph similarity metric. There are four types of graph edit operations for labeled graphs: Node-relabeling (NR) that changes the label of one node; Node-insertion/deletion (NID) that inserts or deletes one isolated node; Edge-relabeling (ER) that changes the label of one edge; Edge-insertion/deletion (EID) that inserts or deletes one edge. Inspired by the success of deep learning techniques, we propose a type-aware graph similarity learning and computation framework that estimates GED in a fine-grained approach w.r.t. different graph edit types. The third topic is learning policy-based lossless graph summarization to generate more concise graph storage formats. The lossless graph summarization aims to identify a compact representation of a large graph consisting of a summary graph and an edge correction set. We reformulate the problem of graph summarization as a policy learning and optimization problem, where summarizing a graph can be considered as making a sequence of supernode selection and merging decisions under the guidance of an optimized supernode selection policy.
The contents of this dissertation are organized as follows: In Chapter 1 I introduce the preliminary concepts of graphs and existing solutions for graph representation learning, graph similarity computation, and graph summarization problems. In Chapter 2 I list the core definitions and related works for graphs and graph neural networks. In Chapter 3, I introduce the subgraph-based GNN training framework. In Chapter 4, I introduce the type-aware graph similarity learning and computation algorithm. In Chapter 5, I introduce the framework of graph summarization solutions, then propose a learning-enhanced graph summarization approach that can achieve cost-effective graph storage. In Chapter 6 I list the potential research extensions based on the my existing projects and the upcoming research plan, and conclude the dissertation and my research works during my Ph.D. study in Chapter 7.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) has risen to alarming levels such that in 2020 CVD accounted for over 19 million deaths. Risk factors for CVD are advanced age, excess body mass and adipose tissue, and the frequent consumption of high carbohydrate (HC) meals that induce hyperglycemia. One of the key contributing mechanisms to the development of CVD is the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are highly unstable molecules that when in excess, overpower the body’s natural antioxidant defense system and induce a state of oxidative stress. A prominent source of ROS generation in the vasculature is derived from the enzymatic activity of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidases (NOX), a group of multi-subunit transmembrane proteins. Furthermore, with rates of CVD so high it is crucial to find novel interventions to reduce the risk of CVD. Creatine monohydrate (CM), a popular performance supplement, has shown promise in reducing ROS concentrations and enhancing blood flow. Therefore, the aim of the dissertation is twofold, first to determine the impact of NOX produced ROS on skeletal muscle microvascular blood flow (SMBF) in older individuals with overweight/obesity. Second, to determine the effect of five days of CM supplementation on ROS concentrations and SMBF at rest and in response to a HC meal in individuals with overweight/obesity. Nine individuals had two microdialysis probes placed (control (CON) and apocynin (APO): NOX inhibitor) in skeletal muscle to measure in vivo ROS (Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2)) concentrations and SMBF (ethanol outflow/inflow ratio, inversely related to blood flow) at rest and four hours post-meal consumption. Procedures were performed both before (PRE) and after (POST) five days of CM supplementation and PL supplementation (20 g/day). APO perfusion locally into skeletal muscle via microdialysis served as a potent suppressant of NOX-produced H2O2 concentrations following the consumption of a HC meal. However, this did not affect SMBF, dialysate glucose, lactate, or glycerol concentrations at rest or following the consumption of a HC meal. Furthermore, five days of CM supplementation had no effect on in vivo H2O2 concentrations or SMBF. Five days of CM supplementation did not lower skeletal muscle dialysate lactate concentrations at rest or following the administration of a HC meal. These data suggest that CM supplementation may not act as an antioxidant, elicit changes to SMBF, or improve metabolism via lactate reductions at rest or following the consumption of a HC meal in older adults with overweight/obesity. However, longer clinical trials are warranted to fully assess the effect of NOX and CM supplementation and on oxidative stress, vascular health, and metabolism in older adults with overweight/obesity.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation is comprised of three related projects, each of which explore the difficulties associated with information problems and imperfectly aligned incentives in dynamic organizational settings.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The first chapter, co-authored with Luke Boosey, investigates coordination between parties who lack a common language through which to communicate their specialized procedures and, consequently, understand how to coordinate. We introduce a model of dynamic coordination with costly switching, where two players are in search of compatible platforms. In the efficient symmetric equilibrium, players remain on their current platforms with certainty if their common belief about compatibility lies above a cutoff belief (that depends on the switching cost) and otherwise mix between switching platforms and remaining on their current platforms. In the presence of switching costs, the equilibrium switching probability increases as the common belief converges toward zero, but remains below 0.5 for all beliefs. We conduct an experiment to test whether behavior supports the equilibrium predictions of the model, varying (i) whether success occurs deterministically or stochastically when players are on compatible platforms and (ii) the cost of switching platforms. Behavior is mostly in line with comparative statics predictions, especially for the Deterministic treatments, although subjects display a tendency to switch less (more) often than optimal when their common belief is low (high).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Next, the second chapter examines how a decision maker optimally uses temporary and permanent disciplinary instruments to influence the quality of advice she receives from an adviser over time. I consider an infinite-horizon, repeated advice environment, where an adviser of privately known expertise, either competent or incompetent, recommends one of two options to a decision maker in each period. The decision maker chooses whether to "check" the adviser's recommendation prior to implementation in every period and then, following the public outcome, either continues or terminates the relationship. When checking is too costly, termination is the only instrument used in equilibrium, resulting in inefficient termination of competent advisers. When checking is sufficiently cheap, the decision maker never terminates the relationship, but frequent (costly) checking may occur. If competent advisers receive fully informative signals, an efficient, cooperative equilibrium can be supported through the use of continual checking (for low checking costs) or termination (for high checking costs), but this is no longer possible under a partially informative signal structure. In this case, the welfare of both competent advisers and decision makers can be improved when checking is cheaper, as this enables the use of probation periods following bad outcomes.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Finally, the third chapter, co-authored with Luke Boosey, explores how the potential for misunderstanding between parties in a repeated interaction affects the informal relationships that evolve over time. We develop and analyze a principal-agent model with perfectly observed (but unenforceable) actions. In each period, the principal chooses a wage to advance to the agent, who then chooses to exert either high effort or low effort. Although high effort is more costly to the agent, it also increases the probability that the principal obtains a high project payoff. In this environment, we consider three types of unexpected shocks, with each shock increasing the expected total surplus in a high-effort equilibrium. The occurrence of such a shock raises the question of how an increase in surplus should be divided between the parties. Assuming the parties are only concerned with their own material payoffs, unexpected shocks that favor (or harm) one of the parties have no impact on the equilibrium constraint of the other party. Yet, considerations of fairness, equality, envy, or guilt may influence the way in which the parties adapt the terms of an established relational contract after an unexpected shock. To accommodate these kinds of considerations, we propose a model that uses a variation of the inequity-averse preferences of Fehr and Schmidt (1999) and show that, in the presence of inequity aversion, a high-effort equilibrium can be supported for a wide range of discount factors, provided that the equilibrium wage is sufficiently high. Moreover, the equilibrium wage range increases as the players become less patient and the principal becomes more sensitive to guilt.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Recent advancements in the field of deep learning have dramatically improved the performance of machine learning models in a variety of applications, including computer vision, text mining, speech processing and fraud detection among others.Deep learning algorithms automatically learn a set of informative features from a given dataset and have depicted commendable performance on a variety of computer vision applications. However, efficient training of deep learning architectures with a large number of hidden layers is mostly dependent on high-end GPUs and distributed computing infrastructures. Training a deep neural network often involves significant computational overhead. Some applications (such as those running on mobile platforms) are severely limited in terms of memory and computational resources.  
They have limited access to computational resources and face a fundamental challenge in handling large-scale training data. Cloud services can be leveraged for training but involve challenges with data privacy and cost. Such applications necessitate a subset selection algorithm to identify the informative samples from a large amount of training data, so that the deep network can be trained using only the selected subset. 
In the 2nd chapter we describe a novel subset selection algorithm, DeepSub, to address this practical challenge. Our framework is computationally efficient, easy to implement and also enjoys nice theoretical properties. Our extensive empirical studies on three challenging computer vision applications (face, handwritten digits and object recognition), using three popular deep learning architectures (AlexNet, GoogleNet and ResNet) corroborate the potential of DeepSub over competing baselines. We propose two novel frameworks to address this important and practical challenge in a slightly different configuration. We pose a budgeted subset selection problem as an NP-hard integer quadratic programming (IQP) problem and derive two convex relaxations to solve the same. Our extensive empirical studies on two challenging vision datasets, using four common deep learning models corroborate the potential of our framework for real-world, resource-constrained applications.
Mini-batch gradient descent is the standard algorithm to train deep models, where mini-batches of a fixed size are sampled randomly from the training data and passed through the network sequentially. In the 3rd chapter, we present a novel algorithm to generate a deterministic sequence of minibatches to train a deep neural network (rather than a random sequence). Our rationale is to select a mini-batch by minimizing the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between the already selected mini-batches and the unselected training samples. We pose the mini-batch selection as a constrained optimization problem and derive a linear programming relaxation to determine the sequence of mini-batches. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research effort that uses the MMD criterion to determine a sequence of mini-batches to train a deep neural network. The proposed mini-batch sequencing strategy is deterministic and independent of the underlying network architecture and prediction task. Our extensive empirical analyses on three challenging datasets corroborate the merit of our framework over competing baselines. We further study the performance of our framework on two other applications besides classification (regression and semantic segmentation) to validate its generalizability.
In the 4th chapter we discusss a subset selection framework to determine the best testing subset when the training domain may or may not be same with the testing domain. We exploit the geometry of the unlabeled data to identify a batch of representative samples which can reconstruct the target data with minimal error. We pose the sample selection as an NP-hard optimization problem and solve it efficiently using an iterative algorithm, with global convergence. Our extensive empirical results on three benchmark image datasets, with several pre-trained deep neural networks, corroborate the promise and potential of our method for real-world applications.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Dimensions and measurements other than the viola’s size are not generally discussed among viola players, even though they significantly impact playability and comfort. The dimensions and measurements of the string length, upper shoulders shape, middle bouts, lower bouts, neck thickness, fingerboard curvature, rib and arching height, and the instrument’s weight are crucial in determining if an instrument is comfortable and will ergonomically suit the violist. The issue also is that the majority of viola players prioritize the instrument’s tone when searching for a new viola, overlooking many dimensions and measurements that can substantially affect playability and, consequently, the player’s performance and health. Moreover, the notion that “the bigger, the better” still permeates the minds of some viola players and luthiers alike, and it is commonly associated with the outdated concept that the viola should have the largest possible acoustic box to produce a darker and deeper sound.Part of the problem relies on the viola never being standardized, primarily because the viola was designed not as one instrument but as two different ones: a smaller alto, and a larger tenor. Moreover, the music of the middle 1500s, for which the violin-family instruments were designed, was quite simple. However, after centuries, the repertoire is now far more complex, and playing standards have evolved considerably, requiring the contemporary violist to have an instrument that would meet their needs in terms of sound but, equally importantly, playability. Fortunately, contemporary makers are becoming increasingly aware of the viola’s dimensions versus playability and have been successfully finding solutions for this issue. Nevertheless, viola players still have limited information about the interaction of instrument and player, and generally rely on subjective perspectives when shopping for or commissioning a viola.
This study aims to explore the dilemma of viola size versus playability and objectively discuss how specific viola dimensions and measurements directly impact playability, technique, and comfort. Another goal of this study is to guide the advanced viola player by establishing criteria for what could be considered an ideal viola. This involves examining the relationship between the performer's physical characteristics and the instrument itself in order to formulate parameters that will determine which specific measurements and dimensions of the non-standard viola impact playability. Such discussion can be particularly relevant since finding a professional-level instrument can be challenging, time-consuming, and financially risky.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x (Bi-2212) is a promising candidate for ultra-high field magnets (&gt;25 T) because of its round wire geometry, twisted multifilamentary architecture, and macroscopically isotropic electromagnetic properties. However, in composite superconductors, the local critical current may vary due to variable vortex pinning interactions and variations in filament connectivity arising from filament shape variation and grain-to-grain connectivity variations, particularly in high-temperature superconductors. The critical current density (Jc) in Bi-2212 round wires is high [Jc (30 T, 4.2 K) = 4600 A/mm2], but can fluctuate by 30–40% between wires, due to a complex interplay of powder quality, filament uniformity, and the conditions of overpressure heat treatment (OP-HT), especially the highest temperature of the OP-HT. We here report on an extensive study of the critical current distributions in ~1.5 m long samples of wire manufactured in km lengths by Bruker-Oxford Superconducting Technology (Bruker-OST) using d2V/dI2 analyses of the V-I curves measured on ITER-like barrels. The transitions are well-fitted by Gaussian distributions characterized by their relative standard deviations (σ/μ). This dissertation details experiments characterizing the influence of OP-HT parameters, filament separation, powder quality, and oxygen doping on the supercurrent path connectivity. We show that the highest Jc values occur for minimum time-in-the-melt (tmelt) and lower maximum temperature (Tmax) during OP-HT and they also correspond to significantly lower σ/μ values. We attribute the degradation of properties that occurs with higher Tmax to decreasing filament connectivity associated with deteriorating texture due to filament merging during the melt step of the OP-HT. Having obtained systematic results on the variation of σ/μ as a function of heat treatment conditions, we then applied this analysis to short sections cut from both ends of test magnets wound with about 200 m of wire, to understand the extent of systematic variations in the ~1 km length wires being delivered by Bruker-OST. We found that recent Engi-Mat fine-particle powder wires have significantly higher Jc and significantly lower σ/μ than found in earlier Bruker-OST wires made with milled Nexans granulate powder. We find it interesting that (i) there are clear trends that Jc rises as σ/μ declines and (ii) that the σ/μ values are only about twice as high as fully optimized Nb-47 wt.%Ti wires, which unlike Bi-2212 are isotropic, fully connected and with only one single value of irreversibility field (Hirr). Furthermore, our investigation into the long-length uniformity of a 10 Kg Bi-2212 billet reveals that a kilometer-length conductor is macroscopically uniform with a σ/μ ratio almost independent of position along the ~1.2 km conductor. We attribute this to good fabrication practice by Bruker-OST and by the averaging effects of ~1000 filaments that render the complex critical current path functionally uniform along the wire length, in spite of many local percolation paths within each filament. 
Finally, we report on the nature of the current path after deoxygenation of an initially overdoped wire in its highest Jc state. We find that the current path did not change significantly by deoxygenation, at least at the relatively high and broad range of electric field (E) accessed by d2V/dI2. However, gradual deoxygenation reveals two separate current paths that become evident in transition temperature (Tc) measurements. We attribute these two transitions either to dissipation due to flux flow within the ab-planes and also to flux flow at grain boundaries.  Within a model that ascribes high Jc in polycrystalline Bi-2212 to its strong biaxial texture, we see the current-limiting obstacles as either occurring at grain boundaries obstructing ab-plane supercurrent or to the c-axis current flow required to transfer supercurrent from grain to grain when the ab-plane paths are blocked. The very special microstructure of Bi-2212 in which long [100]-oriented grains stack with other well-oriented [100] grains confers a large grain boundary (GB) area for c-axis current flow. A plausible interpretation of our deoxygenation experiments is that this c-axis transport is markedly degraded by underdoping that drives the c-axis from the SNS or even SS’S state when overdoped into a strongly Josephson-coupled SIS state, with degraded c-axis Ic. These experiments show that much can be learned about current flow in complex Bi-2212 wires even though we believe that many independent characteristics control the current flow. We are hopeful that having such analytical tools for identifying the distribution of critical currents and the way that the dominant dissipation mechanisms change with doping will enable further Jc enhancement in what are already very high Jc conductors.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The expansion and development of extended techniques for horn have greatly increased since its invention. Many composers today continually push the advancement of these techniques through modern music. It is in these advancements that the physical capabilities of hornists and their instruments have been forgotten, as much of new music today is impractical for the instrument. Composers must study the instrument, its limitations, and the limitations of performers to better understand best practices to push the advancement of extended techniques. Through surveying several works by composers such as Gustav Mahler, Richard Strauss, and others, modern day composers will have a better understanding of the physical limitations of the instrument and how to compose in a practical manner for its performers. This treatise will provide important information regarding these techniques, examples of the ideal and unideal musical lines demonstrating these techniques, and interviews with several composers who both play and  write well for the modern horn.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Vally Weigl was an Austrian-American composer who lived from 1894-1982. She and her husband Karl Weigl, also a composer, fled Vienna in 1938 after the Nazi annexation of Austria due to their Jewish heritage. The Weigls were aided as refugees by the Quakers; upon arriving in America, the Weigls converted to the Quaker faith, and Vally in particular spent the rest of her life working tirelessly towards the Quaker goals of peace, equality, and tolerance. Vally believed in the power of music to make the world a better place and lived out this value in her work as a music therapist, political activist, and composer of pacifist music. This treatise seeks to introduce Vally’s music to a wider audience as she remains widely unknown to twenty-first century musicians. A comprehensive biography shows how Vally overcame numerous challenges, often by turning to music and its healing, communicative, and professional facilities. A literature review explains how the author found primary and secondary source information on a composer about whom little has been written or published. The pacifist views Vally embraced in the later part of her life became central to her musical work as a concert organizer, composer, and performer. This treatise examines a number of Vally’s politically involved compositions she wrote for choir or vocal chamber ensemble as well as Vally’s other activist work with various Quaker and pacifist organizations. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>With just 43% of community college students graduating within six years (Causey et al., 2022b), low graduation rates have been the defining, animating issue for community colleges for over a decade (Cutler &amp; White, 2022). Concurrently, high-impact practices (HIPs) have proven enormously successful in improving student outcomes at higher education institutions throughout the country (Hu et al., 2008; Kilgo et al., 2015; McDaniel &amp; Van Jura, 2022). Undergraduate research (UR) is an especially impactful HIP, with prior studies showing increases in academic performance, retention, graduation rates, and self-efficacy (Crews, 2013; Henkel, 2006; Linn et al., 2015). More importantly, UR has shown promise in improving outcomes for traditionally underrepresented minority students, who make up much of community college enrollment nationwide (Awong-Taylor et al., 2016; Milem, 2005; Santos &amp; Reigadas, 2004). Yet in spite of these impressive outcomes, UR remains rare at community colleges. A small number of institutions, however, have implemented UR successfully (Awong-Taylor et al., 2016; Hensel, 2021; Nerio et al., 2019), but few studies have examined how and why these programs have grown to become so successful within the unique context of the American community college. This qualitative multiple case study sought to fill that gap, exploring the implementation processes of highly successful UR programs at three geographically diverse community colleges, one located in a large city in the Northeast, one in a suburban community in the Pacific Northwest, and one in a rural community in the Great Lakes region. Data were drawn from interviews with faculty and administrators involved in the implementation of each institution's UR program, as well as from analysis of program documents, such as internal reports, labor contracts, and marketing materials. Findings indicated that national organizations provided critical support to these three community colleges as they implemented UR. Additionally, it was found that two UR models, course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) and community-based undergraduate research (CBUR) dominated all three institutions’ UR implementations. And findings indicated that these three institutions sustained their UR programs through a combination of faculty-led administration of the programs, support from system-level administrators, and strategies aimed at managing the costs of UR in the specific context of the community college.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Interpersonal conflict is inevitable as college students live together in residence halls with new and different people (Bresnahan et al., 2009; Ferguson &amp; Lareau, 2021; Fosnacht et al., 2020; Harwood et al., 2012; Morgan et al., 2019; Shook &amp; Fazio, 2008). Whether the conflict stems from small miscommunications to mismatched value systems, microaggressions, or bias, unresolved conflict can result in loss of sleep, lack of focus, a decreased sense of belonging, as well as lower retention and graduation rates (Acquah, 2016; Ferguson &amp; Lareau, 2021; Fosnacht et al., 2020; Hawken et al., 1991; McClain &amp; Perry, 2017; Morales, 2021; Sanchez et al., 2018). Traditional modes of conflict resolution prioritize White, middle-class norms and can impact first-generation and students of color more negatively at Historically White Institutions (HWIs) (Bresnahan et al., 2009; Chua &amp; Gudykunst, 1987; Ferguson &amp; Lareau, 2021; Hammer, 2005; Harwood et al., 2012; Wing &amp; Marya, 2013). The goal of this exploratory critical narrative inquiry (Merriam &amp; Tisdell, 2016) was to understand how first-generation, Pell-eligible, and students of color experience and manage interpersonal conflict in the residence halls at an HWI. Using participatory action research methods during a scaffolded, interactive focus group, the study’s participants engaged in counterstorytelling, identified themes, and generated solutions to help students navigate future conflict more effectively (Baum et al., 2006; Delgado &amp; Stefancic, 2017; Fine et al., 2021; Martinez, 2020; Rutledge et al., 2021; Seaman, 2008). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this study, participants experienced interpersonal conflict and felt disrespected when others crossed cultural boundaries related to communication and community living. Only half of the participants communicated directly regarding the conflict, even fewer reached out for help, and only 25% of students were able to effectively resolve the conflict. Instead, participants utilized coping skills that prioritized relationships, as well as avoiding or deescalating the conflict. Participants desired deeper relationships with the students around them and intentional university strategies to build their confidence, communication, and relationship building skills. Additional recommendations included enhancing culturally responsive conflict resolution education for students and Resident Assistants, improving the roommate assignment and agreement processes, and utilizing personal outreach measures to boost the use of campus resources.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The study of symphonic excerpts plays a pivotal role in the education and development of brass players, offering valuable musical contexts for refinement of essential skills. For tuba players, mastering excerpts is crucial for showcasing proficiency and readiness in audition settings, particularly for premier military bands. However, while extensive resources exist for orchestral excerpt preparation, there is a notable gap in guidance tailored specifically to military band audition excerpts. This treatise aims to address this disparity by investigating effective preparation strategies for premier military band audition excerpts, comparing them to the more widely studied orchestral tuba excerpts. Through interviews with six current premier military band tubists, technical challenges and common audition pitfalls specific to military band excerpts are identified. Prescriptive practice approaches are then delineated, targeting fundamental issues while emphasizing their application to the execution of each excerpt. By bridging the knowledge gap between orchestral and military band audition excerpts, this study provides tuba players with a comprehensive framework for effective preparation. Through systematic practice and informed strategies, aspiring tubists can enhance their readiness and proficiency in premier military band auditions, ultimately fostering greater success and confidence in their musical endeavors.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>An examination of the world through the eyes of a cinephile, Splice is a collection of lyrical and intertextual poems that meditate on identity, artistic inspiration, the evocative power of the visual image, and the paradox of living in a body that is both confining and liberating. Expanding on the ekphrastic tradition, these poems translate the silver screen to the poetic line, using linebreaks, formal topography, and musicality to analogize cinematic elements and celebrate the lasting influence of Hollywood icons like Alfred Hitchcock, Terry Gilliam, Martin Scorsese, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton, and Bill Murray. At the same time, they narrate the poet’s personal journey as he navigates the physical and mental effects of a rare neurological condition called Chiari Malformation. Bringing attention to this overlooked condition and likening the space of the poem to both the cinematic and surgical theater, Splice celebrates the transformative power of poetry and its penchant for provocative recombinations.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>SWAMPSHINE is a 70,000-word alternative history novel following two families of alchemists and remote-viewers who get pulled into a plot to keep the U.S. out of World War II.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Rat Kersey’s alchemy has left the island of Kure polluted. His patented method for bromine extraction gets halted after the flora and fauna of the swamp start to mutate. He squats in the flooded remains of his factory, brewing moonshine that brings literal spirits to life. His work catches the interest of the Locklears. Wanda is a remote viewer possessed with the ghost of Billy the Kid and all twenty-one of his victims; her monster-hunting husband Art makes taxidermies of his kills and displays them in a boardwalk museum. Wanda sees the drink as a way to scare the spare ghosts out of her head, and Art sees a potent business opportunity. He teams up with Rat to distribute the hooch through dry counties, concealing it in his hollowed-out taxidermies. When Wanda gives birth to a mismatched set of twins, they fall out of business. One child looks just like Art, but the other is a dead-ringer for Rat. While Art rages, Rat steals away with his bastard. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The boys Fisher and Lazarus are both raised without knowledge of the other. Fisher is forbidden from entering the swamp, but sneaks in to search for monsters. He runs into Lazarus and they strike up a risky friendship. When a speechless pair of conjoined twins wash ashore in a hurricane, everything changes. Fisher and Lazarus’s search for the girls’ origins incites the attention of Wanda’s oldest rival, bringing judgment for crimes from both sides of their divided family. The truth drives them apart from their parents and each other, leaving them with no one to trust but themselves.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The marketing literature on consumer responses to environmentally friendly programs, products, and communications (together referred to as “green initiatives”) is widely diverse in operationalizations and definitions, varied in outcomes and moderators, and limited in comparable characteristics. The three essays proposed for this dissertation offer a reconciliation of this broad literature stream and empirically test a new conceptualization of green perceptions, developed with a grounded theory approach. This dissertation offers three contributions to the literature. First, a comprehensive model based on a systematic review of the existing literature is offered. Second, a new conceptualization of green perceptions, the first to be multidimensional, is developed and tested. Third, this new conceptualization is nomologically validated across different types of green initiatives.  </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The transition to college represents a pivotal period in the lives of young adults, marked by the promise of growth and new opportunities. However, it is also a time when students commonly experience mental health challenges. This dissertation explores the intricate dynamics of Florida State University faculty members' knowledge, attitudes, and willingness to support students confronting mental health issues. The study is anchored in the recognition that faculty members play a critical role in students' academic and personal development. This research explored the relationships between FSU faculty's knowledge, attitudes, and willingness to support students dealing with mental health concerns. Employing a quantitative approach, the study gathers data to illuminate faculty experiences and perceptions. Key findings indicate that most faculty members at FSU engage in frequent face-to-face interactions with students, highlighting their pivotal roles in academic instruction and overall student support. A notable 98% of participants reported having taught a student with mental health concerns, underscoring the prevalence of these issues within classrooms. While the study reveals high scores in faculty knowledge, positive attitudes, and willingness to support students, opportunities for continuous professional development persist. The recommendations from this research advocate for ongoing investments in faculty training and preparedness, emphasizing the importance of collaboration between faculty and student support services. The study concludes by acknowledging FSU's commendable efforts and offering concrete recommendations for further improvement. By implementing these recommendations, FSU can create a more supportive and informed faculty better equipped to meet the diverse needs of students experiencing mental health concerns. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Six Sonatas for Solo Violin, Op. 27, are the most successful and widely performed compositions of Belgian violinist and composer, Eugène-Auguste Ysaÿe (1858–1931). Not only did Ysaÿe use highly innovative techniques and revolutionize the way of writing for the instrument, but he did so with exceptional artistic and conceptual creativity. Ysaÿe dedicated each sonata to a prominent violinist of his era: Joseph Szigeti, Jacques Thibaud, George Enescu, Fritz Kreisler, Mathieu Crickboom, and Manuel Quiroga. The dedications serve not only as a testament to the composer's admiration for these musicians but also play a crucial role in shaping the composition of the set. This treatise seeks to highlight the creative process that brought this innovative set of sonatas to light. It is widely acknowledged that each sonata is intended to suit the performing and compositional style of its dedicatee. However, very little has been written about how such a process is carried out or in what aspects it manifests itself. Neither Ysaÿe nor his family, friends, and biographers revealed sufficient information in regard to this compositional process. For this reason, each sonata will be systematically analyzed with the intent of uncovering the most significant connections between them and their dedicatees. Other analytical elements that do not serve this particular purpose will not be included or will not be examined in detail for the sake of clarity. These analyses will prove that Ysaÿe’s approach to each sonata differs significantly based on the characteristics of the dedicatees, their artistic predispositions and predilections, and the type and nature of their relationship with Ysaÿe himself. When the dedicatee is also a composer, as seen in the case of Enescu and Kreisler, Ysaÿe adjusts his approach accordingly, considering their compositional style and even specific works with which he was familiar. 
	The first and third chapters of this treatise will also delve into the matter of organicity and structural coherence, providing reasons to support Ysaÿe’s ability to impart an overall sense of unity to the set despite its inherent eclectic and stylistically diverse nature.

            <DISS_para>This dissertation traces the history of the Confederate Episcopal Church and its subsequent historiography to untangle the relationship between the Episcopal Church, white supremacy, and the Lost Cause. I begin in the 1850s and work to track the history and historiography of this short-lived denomination through to 1915. The Confederate Episcopal Church only existed from 1861 until 1865 but counted many Confederate leaders among its ranks and had Confederate general as one of its bishops. The bishops argued that its creation was due to political necessity, but that argument ignores the personal economic investment many in the denomination had in the protection of slavery. I employ a large source base of letters, journals, manuscripts, institutional records, and sermons to track how the Confederate bishops understood their relationship to slavery publicly and privately. I then follow how those bishops obscured those views during the Civil War and early Reconstruction. After, I investigate how later historians and biographers contributed to a Lost Cause view of this denomination through hagiographic writing and intentional editing of sources. This dissertation contends that white supremacy has always been a part of the Episcopal Church in the American South, but that it went unremarked within church histories due to a lack of critical engagement by scholars. This is a history that draws on the insights of Civil War scholarship, slavery studies, Black feminist thought, histories of Southern religion, and church history. I offer it both as a corrective to the history of the Episcopal Church in the nineteenth century American South and a case study for how church history might confront the underlying white supremacy within our scholarly roots. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The field of speech language pathology has made continuous efforts to center cultural responsivity in clinical practice in order to adhere to systematic shifts aimed at centering equity for all individuals. However, it is necessary to examine how speech-language pathologists (SLPs) manage the demands of culturally responsive practice when assessing writing quality for students with diverse linguistic profiles; especially given the general requirements for written works to use “standard” English. As such, the present study sought to examine how narratives written by Black second grade students are rated by Black and White SLPs. Forty-two SLPs were presented with a total of four narratives written by two Black students in the second grade. One of the students had a linguistic profile more consistent with African American English dialect (Student A) and the other student had a linguistic profile more consistent with General American English (Student B). SLPs were provided with the Common Core writing standards for second grade and rated a personal and fictional narrative written by each of the students using a seven-point rating scale. SLPs also completed a demographic questionnaire to provide more information about their clinical background and previous experiences. Results found that Student B’s fictional narrative was rated the highest, whereas Student A’s personal narrative was rated the lowest. Comparative analyses were conducted to examine group differences based on SLPs’ previous training experience, previous experience working with written language, years of experience and by the dialect the SLPs’ reported speaking. None of the group differences yielded statistically significant results, except for SLPs who reported being bidialectal favoring Student B’s personal narrative. Results from a two-level mixed effects model also found that the child’s linguistic profile and the type of narrative told had a significant influence on the ratings, however, SLP race did not. Implications of these findings suggest the presence of a pervasive language ideology that upholds the notion of language standardization in writing. Continued work is needed to promote equitable practices that would address the presence of this ideology in writing, and to redefine ideals of “quality” so that they include speakers with diverse linguistic repertoires.  </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This case study explored the stories and lived experiences of BIPOC choral music faculty. Eight participants took part in the study. Four participants were assistant rank professors, four participants were associate rank professors, four identified as Black, three as Asian, and one as Latinx. Three participants identified as male, four as female, and one as gender fluid. A case study design helped highlight individual experiences while finding commonalities within participant stories. I selected Critical Race Theory (CRT) and the Fanonian theory of ‘safety’ as the conceptual framework for this study. Three themes emerged from the data: (1) Engaging in (un)safe spaces, (2) Diversity tax, and (3) Identity intersectionality. The theme Engaging in (un)safe spaces described frustration participants felt towards perfunctory DEI initiatives. Participants described invisible labor and psychical violence that resulted from BIPOC individuals’ diversity tax. Lastly, identity intersectionality played an integral role in the participants’ lived experiences because participant identities were influenced by notions of tokenism, authenticity, and impostor phenomenon. The findings of this study can provide music units with the knowledge needed to surpass perfunctory diversity initiatives and truly honor the lived experiences of BIPOC individuals. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation contends that scholars should incorporate a concern for the suffering of those most vulnerable as a criterion for evaluating the merits of works of theological ethics. It does so by considering four case studies in which works of Christian theology and ethics are evaluated using this criterion within their sociohistorical, traditional, and philosophical contexts. It contends that each of these four positions possess lacunae that could have been avoided by a closer attention to the lived experiences of vulnerable people, especially the poor, women, BIPOC individuals, and LGBTQ+ individuals. This dissertation serves as a work of liberation theology that asks ethicists, scholars of religion, and theologians alike to attend to the material impacts of their work upon vulnerable communities and to treat these communities, ultimately, as theologically innovative and as sources for theological and moral reflection.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Religion and spirituality are associated with many positive outcomes for partners in committed relationships. Couples with a greater religiosity and spirituality have better relationship quality and greater relationship stability. However, research highlights a paradox in which these findings do not translate the same for African American couples in that though they report greater importance and prevalence of religion and spirituality, these couples have poorer relationship outcomes, particularly related to marriage. Scholars have found that consequences of historic and present-day racism and discrimination create unique challenges for African American couples in the formation and maintenance of committed relationships. This is of significance because partnership, especially marriage, offers individual and systemic benefits to those within it. Spirituality consistently appears as a significant factor for this population and an increasing number of studies have found it to be associated with positive relationship outcomes for African American couples. Hope is related to spirituality and has been found to be protective against the negative effects of racism and discrimination for African American individuals. This study sought to investigate how hope moderates the relationship between spirituality and relationship outcomes and qualitatively explored African American couples’ views of the impact of spirituality and religion on their relationship satisfaction. The Relational Spirituality Framework was used as a guide to discuss how the interplay of spirituality and relationship outcomes operates for African American couples. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>ABSTRACT</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Concerto for Piano and Strings presented herein is a single-movement opus for piano and string orchestra that delves deep into the labyrinth of human emotion. Drawing inspiration from a diverse array of sources, with a particular nod to Alfred Schnittke's evocative Concerto for Piano and String Orchestra, this composition embarks on a visceral journey through the complexities of the human psyche.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>At its core, this concerto is a study in contrasts—an exploration of the tension between Romantic lyricism and uncompromising dissonance, between the ethereal beauty of soaring melodies and the haunting stillness of static textures. Much like the human experience itself, the music traverses the heights of passion and the depths of despair, weaving together a tapestry of emotions that resonate with raw intensity.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The influence of Schnittke's masterwork is present throughout, infusing the composition with a sense of urgency and existential weight. A language of dense, tortuous harmonies and angular melodies is employed to evoke a world teetering on the brink of chaos—a world where beauty and brutality intertwine in a delicate balance.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Yet, the concerto is not beholden solely to Schnittke's aesthetic vision; rather, it draws from a rich tapestry of musical influences, including Christopher Rouse's visceral piano concerto "Seeing," Rachmaninoff's iconic Second Piano Concerto, the bold, angular compositions of Sergei Prokofiev, and the wildly expressive piano works of Michael Finnissy. These influences manifest in the concerto's multifaceted approach to orchestration, its juxtaposition of contrasting themes and textures, and its relentless pursuit of emotional authenticity.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Concerto for Piano and Strings is, at its heart, a meditation on the human experience—a testament to the complexity of our inner worlds and the myriad emotions that course through our veins. It is a journey through the darkest recesses of the soul and the soaring heights of transcendence—a symphony of joy and sorrow, hope and despair, love and loss.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>I examine the effect of the change from incurred loss model to the current expected credit loss (CECL) model on mortgage lending. I find that the extent that the CECL model under ASC 326 exacerbates the lending disparities for low-income and minority (LIM) borrowers is dependent on banks’ choice of relief. I find banks who opted for regulatory relief that defers CECL’s effect on regulatory capital, but not net income, decreased lending to LIM borrowers in preparation for and after enactment of ASC 326. In contrast, banks who opted for statutory relief that defers CECL’s effect on both regulatory capital and net income did not reduce lending to LIM borrowers. Banks who opted for no relief decreased lending to LIM borrowers after enactment of ASC 326. This study highlights how the choice of relief (regulatory, statutory or no relief), which is heavily influenced by investor pressure, can have real consequences for LIM borrowers.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This research delves into the lived experiences of individuals with mixed/multicultural backgrounds in the United States, spurred by the researcher's introspection during the COVID-19 pandemic and a personal journey navigating systemic oppression. Employing a hermeneutic phenomenological methodology, the study aims to not only elucidate the experiences of mixed/multicultural individuals through the medium of art-making but also to probe the researcher's own identity. The investigation centers on the transformative efficacy of art-making, with the objectives of addressing and mitigating anxiety and confusion, challenging prevailing power dynamics, establishing a sense of place and belonging, and fostering self-acceptance among those with mixed/multicultural identities. This exploration yields valuable insights into the intricate intersections of identity, lived experiences, and the therapeutic dimensions of artistic expression. The utilization of response art and epochs assisted myself as the researcher in navigating personal biases and beliefs, enabling me to bracket these factors aside to maintain curiosity and focus. This aspect of hermeneutic phenomenology contributes to a clear understanding of the interpretation of data that informs other scholars on the necessity of exploring their own experiences to uphold objectivity. Furthermore, this study invites fellow therapist-researchers to incorporate art as a tool for cultural humility practice and to explore shared intersections, not solely with participants but also with clients.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This treatise explores selected compositions by the contemporary Russian composers Mikhail Kollontay and Valery Arzoumanov. Each of the two chapters is based on a lecture recital given at Florida State University. The first chapter examines three of Kollontay's Ballades from Op. 2 bis, specifically No. 3 “Mourning Chant,” No. 6 “The Medium,” and No. 7 “Guillotine,” which were chosen owing to their reference to literary works by Ivan Turgenev. I will explain how Kollontay expresses through music unique emotions in response to narrated events from Turgenev’s literary works. The second chapter examines Arzoumanov’s Op. 74, “27 Easy Pieces.” I will document and explain the musical references embedded in these work that draw upon Arzoumanov’s personal experience living in Russia during the Soviet era and his educational journey. Both composers demonstrate a keen awareness of their Russian cultural background, and creatively present observed cultural elements in their music.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are recognized as an excellent alternative to embryonic stem cells in the fields of regenerative medicine, in vitro model construction, and drug discovery. Given the challenge of limited passages to primary cells from patients, the use of hiPSCs has greatly facilitated diverse studies aiming to recapitulate physiological and pathological mechanisms. This approach has led to the development of more precise disease modeling platforms. Furthermore, the investigation of the interaction between hiPSCs and extracellular matrix(ECM) at the 3D level, and subsequently modeling the central nervous system, such as the blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) and blood brain barrier (BBB), has been investigated to a limited extent. Therefore, the first objective of this study is to investigate the interaction between hiPSC-derived organoid differentiation and 3D scaffold or hydrogel network. The second objective is to utilize hiPSC-derived organoids to construct a 3D in vitro model that can recapitulate structures and functionalities similar to those in the human body, such as the BSCB. Models of the BBB have been explored for decades, and the transition from 2D to 3D modeling methods has been well-established. However, the authentic BBB involves fluid blood, exerting shear stress on the endothelial cell layer. Thus, there is a need for the development of a dynamic BBB structure to enhance BBB modeling.Auxetic materials are those capable of displaying a negative Poisson’s ratio, which indicates the degree to which a material contracts or expands transversally when axially strained. Human stem cells are sensitive to the mechanical properties of their microenvironment, including surface properties, stiffness, and Poisson’s ratio. In this study, six different auxetic polyurethane (PU) foams with varying elastic moduli (0.7-1.8 kPa) and Poisson’s ratios (-0.1 to -0.5) were fabricated to investigate lineage specification of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). The cells exhibited differential adherent density and differentiation capacity on different auxetic foams. Surface modification with chitosan and heparin promoted hindbrain and hippocampal markers, but not forebrain markers, during neural patterning of hiPSCs. Furthermore, properly surface-engineered auxetic scaffolds could enhance vascular differentiation of hiPSCs. This study presents a versatile and multifunctional scaffold fabrication approach that could lead to the development of a suitable system for establishing hiPSC culture models for applications in neurovascular disease modeling.
The spinal cord is also a important components of central nervous system (CNS) and controls the different motions of the human body. The injury of spinal cord (SCI) also cause disability with less effective repairing method. Hence, the development of specific spinal cord organoids(hSCOs) for SCI treatment is necessary. Based on methylacrylated (MA) hyaluronic acid (HA), different HA hydrogels for generation and vascularization of spinal cord organoids derived from hiPSCs. In particular, the effects of viscoelasticity of the HA hydrogels on spinal cord organoid patterning were investigated. The morphogenesis, regional patterning, and vascularization of human spinal cord organoids (hSCOs) were influenced by different hydrogels. Dorsal marker expression was evaluated where more viscoelastic hydrogels can promote dorsal marker expression, while softer hydrogels resulted in higher interneuron marker expression. This study also found differences when generating the blood-spinal cord barrier with the coculture of hSCOs and human blood vessel organoids. In addition, Yes-associated protein nuclear translocation was determined to reveal the mechanism of cell-ECM mechano-transduction. Moreover, the hiPSC-derived blood vessel organoids were cocultured with hSCOs and pericytes for making transwell and 3D micro fluidic BSCB models. 
Lastly, hiPSCs exhibit multipotency, allowing them to differentiate into various cell types or tissues, making them valuable for applications in tissue engineering and injury repair. Nevertheless, hiPSCs pose significant challenges due to low consistency in target cell differentiation and a tendency for cancer-like infinite proliferation. [Furthermore, the impact of shear stress on the secretion and cargo profiles of hiPSC-derived organoids, particularly extracellular vesicles (EVs) such as the subset 'exosomes,' is recognized. [Comment: Consider clarifying how shear stress impacts the secretion and cargo profiles of hiPSC-derived organoids for greater clarity.] Exosomes show promising potential as an alternative in stem cell therapy to some extent. Additionally, encapsulating them with different hydrogels can be explored to control the rate of EV release.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Collegiate athletes are at risk of exposure to crises-like outcomes when transitioning out of their sport. These outcomes include anxiety (Alfermann, 2000), depression (Brewer et al., 1993), reduced self-worth, identity confusion (Park et al., 2013), and social dysfunction (Blakelock et al., 2016; Brown &amp; Potrac, 2009; Gouttebarge et al., 2016). This study involved the development and testing of an intervention aimed at reducing these outcomes. Specifically, the intervention was developed to educate collegiate student-athletes about the potential challenges and psychological changes they could expect to experience when retiring from their sport, and to offer strategies that the student-athletes can employ when navigating these retirement difficulties. Participants recruited for the study were current NCAA collegiate student-athletes in the United States. Measures included participants’ knowledge of the retirement process, their behaviors in preparation for the retirement process, their perceptions of social support, and athletic identity. Participants completed a pre-test comprising these measures. Participants were then randomly assigned to a control or treatment group. Participants in the control group viewed a 14-minute sport retirement video presentation about facts about NCAA retirement (e.g., advanced education attainment among NCAA student-athletes) that were not theorized to be related to the key challenges of retirement or relevant coping strategies. The treatment group viewed a 14-minute sport retirement education video presentation that concerned concepts theorized to be related to the key challenges of retirement and relevant coping strategies. Participants then completed a post-test and a four-week follow-up test comprising the study measures. Findings revealed that, in relation to the control condition, the intervention significantly increased participants’ perceived knowledge about sport retirement challenges, but had no significant effect on the remaining variables. In conclusion, this study has provided some evidence that the intervention developed for this study might be useful in raising awareness in student-athletes of the retirement process. Applied implications of this research study are considered for student-athletes, coaches, parents, and sport organizations including the NCAA. Recommended avenues of future research are also outlined.  </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Pre-service science teachers develop their teaching practices within and across the university and school contexts of their teacher education programs. The practices and visions of teaching and learning emphasized in each context are often disjointed, a problem referred to as the “two-worlds pitfall.” Responding to the call for teacher education programs to better support pre-service teachers’ work towards teaching that is responsive to students' thinking, this study is situated within the university and subsequent school contexts of a teacher education program. Taking an asset-based approach to pre-service teachers’ learning, this study understood pre-service teachers as agentive sense makers as they appropriated teaching practices across contexts. Three pre-service science teachers participated in this qualitative case study, and the research question about how pre-service teachers appropriated teaching practices across the school and university contexts relied on the development of case narratives from analysis of interview materials, lesson planning documents, and teaching observation. These case narratives distilled central teaching practices through which pre-service teachers processes of appropriation could be understood. 
The findings highlight how pre-service teachers’ appropriation of practices across contexts aligned with their orientation to students’ thinking as problems or as resources, and that their appropriation and orientations to students’ thinking were consistent across the contexts of the two-worlds pitfall. Pre-service teachers’ experiences with tensions in their school contexts highlighted their agency to maintain, re-envision, and reject the visions of teaching that did or did not align with their patterns of appropriation and orientations to students’ thinking that were consistent across contexts. 
As such, this study challenges traditional models of the two-worlds pitfall that anticipate significant shifts in pre-service teachers’ practices across contexts.  Rather, this study highlights the availability of productive ideas about responsive and rigorous instruction in pre-service teachers’ thinking, and missed opportunities for teacher educators to draw out and leverage those ideas to support pre-service teachers’ development of teaching that capitalizes on students' thinking. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This comprehensive study explores the experiences of underrepresented students who have participated in informal science education programs at the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH). Using qualitative methods, including interviews and participant observations, the research uncovers transformative insights shaping the educational landscape.The study focuses on 10 students who have participated in the AMNH Lang Program, an Informal Science Education (ISE) initiative for New York City students starting in the fifth grade and ending in the twelfth grade. Semi-structured interviews provided data, which was analyzed using a combination of a priori, in vivo, and values coding.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A central finding reveals the holistic impact of these programs on students' academic trajectories, acting as catalysts for broadening horizons and discovering, and in some cases reaffirming STEM passions. The holistic influence of out-of-school time learning through ISE challenges conventional notions of informal education's impact on a student’s entire educational journey. Emphasizing the tangible role of hands-on experiences, participants of this study highlighted the significance of physically engaging with scientific concepts by bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world applications.Beyond academics, the study uncovers the profound role of ISE programs in shaping the identity of underrepresented students within the STEM community. These programs become pivotal in forming a STEM identity, dispelling stereotypes, and empowering students to see themselves as integral members of the scientific community.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Mentorship emerges as a powerful force, with mentors sharing similar backgrounds crucial in guiding students through academic and career complexities. Tailored mentorship programs for underrepresented students serve as inspirational anchors beyond immediate educational contexts. Intrinsic motivation derived from enjoyable science-based experiences within the programs is emphasized, suggesting that incorporating enjoyment into STEM education enhances long-term commitment.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The development of a supportive community among participants and peers is highlighted as a motivational ecosystem, contributing to sustained motivation and shared commitment to success. Participants draw a clear link between program involvement and the decision to pursue STEM-related degrees and careers, emphasizing the enduring impact on long-term career trajectories. These insights contribute to the discourse on the effectiveness of informal science education programs, promoting diversity and inclusion within STEM. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Recommendations for administrators, leaders, practitioners, and researchers include expanding hands-on experiences, strengthening mentorship programs, promoting diversity, and facilitating collaborative efforts between formal and informal education. Implementing these recommendations can create more inclusive, impactful, and effective informal science education programs for underrepresented students, both locally and within the larger educational landscape. This study serves as a roadmap for transformative action, ensuring that underrepresented students not only enter but thrive in the dynamic STEM landscape that fuels U.S. innovation.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation implements three studies related to understanding the impacts of groundwater-surface water interactions on both the aquatic geochemistry and water quantity of karst spring systems. The first study examined aquifer and spring geochemistry following a series of sinkhole lake dry-downs in the Wakulla Springshed of north Florida, where lake water was injected into the aquifer. Geochemical data showed groundwater values in a down-gradient monitoring well varied widely on the daily time scale with evidence that lake water weathered the aquifer confining unit as it recharged. No long-term impacts were seen at the well, and no impacts were seen at the spring. The second study aimed to model spring stage at Wakulla Springs using spatially distributed groundwater, surface water, and meteorological data from a monitoring network within the springshed. Different combinations of input variables were tested, and the model that considers a conceptual understanding of meteorological, groundwater, and surface water process was seen to perform the best. The final study trained a complex, interpretable neural network model using meteorological and springshed data from multiple springsheds of the Outstanding Florida Springs to create a universal model of eogenetic karst spring flow. The results were limited by the small number of springs used to train the model but were largely positive as it made accurate springflow predictions and could explain which input variables were impacting springflow predictions. These three studies show successful applications of applying established and new techniques to study groundwater-surface water interactions in the eogenetic karst environments to provide insight on Florida’s karst spring systems and provide future directions for additional work in this field. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In three essays, this dissertation explores how marketing strategies, both in the development and marketing of food and media, influence consumer well-being. Chapter 2 explores maladaptive consumption and the future of food, examining new consumption trends and phenomena. Specifically, I study emerging trends in the marketplace related to (1) sustainability and alternative protein sources and (2) technology in food production and the supply chain. I explore the emerging trends in terms of implications for marketing theory and research, managers, and public policymakers, as well as their connections with the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals. In Chapter 3, I explore the consumers’ preference for snacks. Specifically, I explore how an emerging labeling and promotion strategy for “fuel snacks” impacts consumer evaluations and perceptions. Furthermore, I study how snacks labeled in such a way appeal to consumers with certain characteristics – namely, consumers under caregiving stress. In doing so, I propose a dynamic effect of fuel snacks, such that the effects of snack perceptions differ by labeling and promotion strategies, and how they appeal to certain consumer segments. Finally, in Chapter 4, I explore how various labeling strategies and characteristics affect consumers’ beliefs about mis- and disinformation. I theorize how the timing of warning labels, the content of the misinformation, and consumers’ alignment with the content impacts perceptions about the mis- and disinformation and subsequent downstream behaviors. I present five studies demonstrating that some warning labels successfully reduce the belief of misinformation while others backfire. Taken together, this dissertation seeks to provide insights into when and why labeling and promotion might undermine or support consumer well-being.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>There is a plethora of articles and documents by scholarly figures articulating their views on what constitutes “good” art. Whether it’s Halbert Britan  or Milton Babbitt , the common strategy within aesthetic discourse is to claim that “certain objects or forms please us ‘naturally’ by virtue of certain human universals” and assert “the belief that a norm and thus ‘standard’ of correct and defective taste can be derived accordingly.”  In other words, those attuned to a given community’s sensibilities are morally sound, have “good taste,” and are superior to the flawed individuals in opposition to the community’s proclivities. The saxophone, invented in 1838, found itself at a point in history where classical music in the twentieth century became increasingly splintered, allowing for different aesthetics to exist simultaneously, resulting in greater stratification of taste between laymen and professional musicians.  This document will use the saxophone and its repertoire in a case study that will explore the saxophone’s history, how it can influence the development of a saxophonist’s identity, and how our identity influences our artistic palate and sense of musical value.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Spatial learning is impaired in humans with preclinical Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and we’ve previously reported similar impairments in a mouse model of AD. Spatial navigation impairments are one of the earliest symptoms to appear in this disease, and could be the result of impairments in navigational computations, memory encoding or retrieval, or some combination of navigational and memory impairments. Both cortex and hippocampus are important for memory encoding and navigational computations, with interactions between these two regions supporting these processes. Memory reactivation during sleep is critical for learning related plasticity, and memory formation is correlated with hippocampal (HPC) sharp wave ripple (SWR) density, cortical delta waves (DWs), cortical spindles, and the temporal coupling of these events - postulated as physiological substrates for memory consolidation. Further, HPC-cortical dyscoordination is prevalent in individuals with AD. Thus, we hypothesized impaired memory formation mechanisms in HPC-cortical networks could account for spatial memory deficits. We assessed sleep architecture, SWR/DW dynamics and memory reactivation in a mouse model of tauopathy and amyloidosis (3xTg-AD) implanted with a recording array targeting parietal cortex (PC) and HPC. Mice underwent daily recording sessions of rest-task-rest while learning the spatial reorientation task. We assessed pattern reactivation by matching activity patterns from the approach to the unmarked reward zone to patterns during slow wave sleep (SWS). AD mice had more SWS, but reduced SWR and spindle density. The increased SWS compensated for reduced SWR and spindle density so there was no reduction in SWR or spindle number. In control mice hippocampal SWR-PC DW coupling was strengthened in post-task- sleep and was correlated with performance on the spatial reorientation task the following day. However, in AD mice SWR-DW and spindle-DW coupling were impaired. Thus, reduced SWR-DW coupling may cause impaired learning in AD and spindle-DW coupling during short rest-task-rest sessions may serve as a biomarker for early AD related changes in these brain dynamics. Previously, various forms of 40 Hz stimulation have been shown to clear AD pathology in mice and improve functional connectivity in preclinical AD patients. Thus, we assessed HPC-cortical coordination in 40 Hz or Sham stimulated 3xTg-AD/PVcre mice learning the spatial reorientation task. We implanted a 16-tetrode recording array targeting PC and HPC and an optical fiber targeting HPC. Daily recording sessions of rest-task-rest began as mice learned the VM, followed by HPC optogenetic stimulation, either 40 Hz or Sham. We assessed sleep quality metrics, DWs in cortex, and SWRs during SWS. Only 40 Hz stimulation increased 40 Hz power in HPC and to a lesser extent also PC. In SHAM stimulated mice SWR-DW cross-correlations were reduced, similar to 3xTg-AD mice. In 40 Hz stimulated mice, this phase-locking was rescued. Furthermore, the 40 Hz stimulation restored performance on the VM compared to Sham mice. However, this rescued HPC-cortical coupling no longer predicted performance as in NonTg animals. Instead, SWRs and DWs independently predicted performance in 40 Hz mice only. We also found reduction of amyloid beta (Aβ) in PC and ventral CA1, but no reduction in dorsal CA1, synaptically closer to stimulation. Thus, 40 Hz stimulation of HPC rescued learning and memory related functional interactions in the HPC-PC network during sleep and as a consequence rescued impairments in spatial navigation, despite a decoupling between HPC-cortical coupling and learning and memory. Furthermore, the observed effects seems to be mediated by direct 40 Hz impacts on brain dynamics (or another yet uncovered mechanism), due to an absence of robust glia, Aβ, and tau effects, contrasting previous reports. In addition to sleep, HPC-PC interactions are important in active navigation computations. In navigation, HPC is involved in creating a cognitive map-like representation of the environment. PC is involved in the translation of this cognitive representation based on body-centered location into the appropriate navigation decision. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that impaired HPC-cortical interactions during navigation underlie deficits in spatial navigation in a mouse model of AD. We decoded correct and incorrect trials from HPC and PC neural data on the spatial reorientation task. 3xTg-AD mice showed a different cross-region pattern compared to control, indicating that HPC-PC coordination impairments during active navigation may contribute spatial navigation deficits. Additionally, 3xTg-AD mice showed a shift in how the HPC mapped the spatial-reorientation-task, indicating underlying dysfunction in HPC may also contribute to spatial navigation deficits. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This treatise offers educators a graded selection of violin compositions by Latin American composers, serving as a supplemental selection alongside the Suzuki repertoire. The research highlights these compositions and advocates for their inclusion in pedagogical instruction and performance repertoire. It provides a brief historical context about the composers and their works, delving into each piece’s technical and musical aspects. Then, it highlights and suggests teaching points while comparing them to the Suzuki core repertoire and determining their suitable placements. Chapter One presents context information about violin literature, Latin American music production, and information on Suzuki’s philosophy and repertoire. Chapters Two, Three, and Four provide the detailed content of each piece and separate them into three levels: beginner, intermediate, and advanced pieces. Appendix A provides a table for easy reference of the findings presented in the previous chapters. By integrating these compositions with the widely known Suzuki method, this research expands pedagogical possibilities and broadens the options for musical instruction. This treatise provides a useful pedagogical resource, encouraging teachers and performers to include alternative works and fostering further exploration of Latin American music.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>High entropy oxides (HEO) are the oxides containing five or more metals in a single lattice andthe large composition space suggests that properties of interest can be readily optimized. Magnetic
correlation in HEOs that inherently depend on the coordination geometry, valence, spin state, and
type of metal cations that are hybridized with the bridging oxygen, are naturally affected by an
extreme diversity of neighboring ionic configuration. In this dissertation, we synthesized the bulk
target of high entropy vanadium oxide, as the spinel vanadate and ferrite is a magnetically frustrated
system an interesting non-collinear spin textures at low temperatures. We report the epitaxial
growth of AF e2O4,(where A site contains five elements MgO, Fe2O3, NiO, CuO, CoO) thin films
on the substrates spanning a range of strain states. We successfully grew the single crystalline thin
films on different substrates of MgO, MgAl2O4, and STO where the crystal structure changed from
its bulk cubic to a tetragonal unit cell which is confirmed by the Rigaku X-ray diffraction. These
films show smooth surfaces, high crystallinity, and strong magnetic responses at room temperature.
The perturbations in the crystal structure lead to interesting magnetic properties in the AF e2O4
thin films. We investigated the magnetic behavior in the material as the temperature-dependent
magnetization measurements performed on AFe2O4 film show a magnetic transition onset above
the room temperature regardless of the strain state. Strain effects have a strong influence on
magnetization responses. For the tensile strained AFe2O4 film grown on MgO substrate, out-
of-plane shows the hysteresis with the higher coercive field which indicates the easy axis on the
out-of-plane direction. But in the case of slightly compressed film on a-axes and strained on c-axes
strained AFe2O4 film on MAO substrate the out-of-plane shows slightly smaller hysteresis with a
smaller coercive field which moves the easy axis towards an in-plane direction. The differences in the
magnetic behavior between the bulk and thin film, in both the magnetic structure and anisotropy,
provide insights on tuning the compositionally complex materials that may be applicable in the
next-generation memory devices.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>With the current priorities and challenges surrounding equity in higher education, many institutions are looking for new resources to support diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) goals at their institutions. One resource that has been shown to be underutilized across social justice development in higher education are peer leaders. While some institutions may have peer leader groups that specialize in supporting social justice initiatives, peer leaders, unless it’s their primary function, are not being trained on social justice or utilized at most institutions of higher education to support social justice development. However, peer leaders have been found to be very impactful on the development and experience of their peers throughout college, but because peer leaders are not exploring social justice in training, it limits their ability to support their peers in the topic. Throughout this, a qualitative exploratory study is explored that was facilitated with peer leaders at Stetson University to understand how peer leaders serve as socially just leaders within a campus community and what support institutions can provide to develop peer leaders to serve as socially just leaders. Individual interviews and focus group interviews were conducted to gain perspective from peer leaders, their understanding of leadership and social justice, their application of socially just leadership, and areas of support they looked for from the institution. The culturally relevant leadership learning model served as the theoretical framework for this study which supported the development of interview questions, analysis of data, and development of recommendations from the study. 
Research within this study found common trends from the peer leaders in the ways in which they supported their peers as socially just leaders through common themes and sub-themes. And the study also found commons trends in the ways in which the peer leaders were looking for further support from the university to be socially just leaders. Results in the study suggest that peer leaders, no matter the focus of their peer leader role, have the ability to serve as socially just leaders and peer leaders are looking for support from their institutions to help them in serving as socially just leaders in their peer leader roles. Results also breakdown different ways in which peer leaders are serving as socially just leaders within the campus community.   </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this qualitative exploratory multiple-case study was to explore how school-based teams make decisions and implement a Multi-Tiered System of Support for students exhibiting problem behavior (MTSS-B). Mandates require the use of MTSS to support both academic (MTSS-A) and behavioral needs (MTSS-B) of K-12 students. The definitions, guidelines, and structures for MTSS-A are more consistent and well-researched than those for MTSS-B. Little is known about how school-based teams make decisions about implementing MTSS-B and the factors they identify as influencing those decisions. It is important to learn how MTSS-B team members engage in the process at each tier (1, 2, and 3), how they develop interventions of increasing intensity, and what factors influence individual and team decision-making. Chapter One introduces the importance of understanding the history of disproportionate discipline and identification for special education services and provides a brief literature review of research previously conducted about how teams, fidelity, and culture are related to MTSS-B and how Contingency Theory and contingent decision-making have been connected to systems including schools. Chapter Two is the methods section where the rationale and details of this multiple case study are provided including how I increased trustworthiness and how the data was collected and analyzed. Chapter Three provides findings of the analyzed data both within and across cases. The themes developed are evidenced using invivo codes provided by participants. Overarching themes reflect some significant differences in how MTSS-B is implemented at each school. Differences are attributed to the factors considered by teams such as the home life of students, poverty, drug use, students’ exposure to domestic violence, lack of supervision, homelessness, and the violent neighborhood where School 2 is located. School 1 identified factors such as the poverty experienced by their students and the often-unrecognized need for academic support. The types of behaviors exhibited by students were described as mainly classroom disruptions at School 1 and as physical aggression at School 2, requiring different approaches to consequences.  Chapter Three concludes with a synthesis of how the elements of the exploratory framework are represented in how teams report implementing MTSS-B, how fidelity may contribute to the current operations of the teams, and how culture is represented by the factors influencing decision-making. Chapter Four’s discussion ties components of the exploratory framework and collected data to previous research. Teams both report using a wide variety of factors, variables, and contingencies both subjective and objective to guide decision-making. This use of additional contextual and environmental variables indicates the likelihood that while teams report the use of traditional data-driven decision-making additionally, they are engaging in the contingency theory of decision-making. The chapter concludes with limitations and implications for future research.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Elite private institutions, renowned for their exceptional academic offerings and rigorous selection processes, attract top-tier students and faculty; however, exclusive private schooling has perpetuated social and economic disparities by granting unequal advantages to select groups, deepening educational gaps in society. This dissertation investigated the integration of social justice principles in the educational framework of an elite private Episcopal institution in a major Florida metropolitan area. Guided by the ethos of the U.S. Episcopal Church and its commitment to inclusivity and social justice, the study delved into how teachers at the study site navigated the implementation of social justice-oriented themes in their classrooms. Drawing upon critical theory, the research explored the challenges and approaches of seven selected teachers known for their dedication to social justice values. Through purposeful sampling and multiple data collection methods—including semistructured interviews, focus groups, classroom observations, and participant equity walkthroughs—the study elucidated the complexities and nuances of integrating social justice into classroom practices in an elite educational setting. Key research questions examined teachers’ definitions, approaches, enactments, and negotiations of social justice, shedding light on the ways these principles are manifested and challenged in the school community. This single-case study offered an in-depth exploration, unraveling the intricate interplay between social justice values and educational practices in the context of an Episcopal school committed to fostering diversity, equity, and inclusion. Key findings suggested that some educators found their motivation in spiritual or religious themes, (a) emphasizing service and philanthropy as a way to give back to others, (b) drawing inspiration from various world religions, and (c) aligning efforts with the school’s Christian mission. Conversely, another group expressed focus on promoting equality, catalyzing social transformation, and empowering marginalized voices by prioritizing systemic change over mere acts of service. Despite these differing perspectives on social justice, both groups acknowledged the privileged status of their students and described their aims to instill a sense of responsibility toward serving others, whether through direct assistance or empowerment. The participants viewed socially just classroom environments as inclusive spaces that fostered trust and belonging, where students could make mistakes, engage in critical analysis, and receive differentiated support. Conversely, educators also discussed facing challenges in implementing social justice principles due to Florida’s social climate, lack of organizational mission alignment, and time constraints. Despite these obstacles, the research aimed to uncover the underlying causes of inequity by examining how teachers conceptualized and enacted social justice in their classrooms amid external pressures. The study identified three key themes: (a) the role of elite private Episcopal schools in perpetuating social reproduction and elitism, (b) the crucial role of teachers in fostering Episcopal values and social justice advocacy, and (c) the potential of the Episcopal identity to serve as a powerful force for promoting justice in various forms. Overall, the findings and recommendations provide guidance for elite Episcopal schools seeking to reaffirm their commitment to justice and equality, emphasizing the importance of instilling Christian values of democracy and egalitarianism while raising awareness of students’ privileges and moral obligations to contribute to a fair society.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The shipping industry is one of the significant sources of pollution and global warming. About 2.5% of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions in 2018 came from the shipping industry. Conventional tugboats are viewed as one of the contributors towards the overall amount of emissions produced from maritime transportation. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) estimates that tugboats account for 2% of global shipping emissions, including nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), and particulate matter (PM). Electric tugboats could be a promising alternative to these issues because they don’t emit any harmful gases. Furthermore, electric tugboats do not produce as much noise as conventional tugboats. However, certain aspects should be carefully considered before the wide deployment of electric tugboats would be feasible, including financial viability of using electric tugboats, impacts on society, legal framework for using electric tugboats, and the overall practicality of deploying electric tugboats.This research mainly focuses on a comprehensive assessment of advantages and disadvantages from electric tugboat deployment in maritime transportation. First, all the basic background information associated with the development and deployment of electric tugboats is reviewed in detail. Second, a thorough literature review is conducted focusing on different aspects, including safety issues associated with tugboats, tugboat scheduling, electric tugboats versus conventional tugboats, environmental issues, salvage tugboats and other types of tugboats. Third, a comprehensive evaluation of electric tugboats is performed based on all the information acquired along with the interviews that were performed with the leading experts in the tugboat industry. Last but not least, the financial viability and economic performance of electric tugboats using econometric techniques is assessed as a part of this thesis research as well.
Electric tugboats consistently demonstrate a greater initial capital outlay, although offer substantially reduced ongoing operational expenses owing to their enhanced efficiency and diminished maintenance needs. Consequently, they emerge as the most economically appealing alternative for long-term planning. On the other hand, conventional tugboats may seem more economically advantageous in the short term, but they ultimately accumulate significantly more expenses over time, especially in the face of increasing annual costs (e.g., unexpected increase in the cost of diesel fuel, unexpected increase in maintenance costs). Hybrid tugboats present a viable compromise, exhibiting certain cost benefits in comparison to the conventional and electric tugboat options. Therefore, the existing obstacles related to electric tugboat deployment have to be further investigated and addressed in the following years. The conducted research would be of essence to researchers and industry practitioners and can serve as a valuable reference for the relevant future studies.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Due to the rapid development of imaging acquisition techniques, a large amount of large-scale biomedical studies on  neuro-related diseases have been established, such as Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study, the Human Connectome Project (HCP) study and the UK biobank (UKB) study. These databases have myriad data types, including genomic data, phenotypic data, imaging data, clinical outcomes, and many others. Among the studies on biomedical data, functional regression has received the most attention in functional data analysis (FDA). However, existing statistical methods in this field still face challenges while considering unknown confounders caused by imaging heterogeneity, non-Euclidean imaging data, or imaging data with jump discontinuities. To tackle these challenges, we propose several functional regression models for biomedical data with different structures. 		
First, the function-on-scalar regression model is a powerful tool for building the relationship between the functional responses and covariates of interest. Although it has been widely applied in many large-scale neuroimaging studies, most existing approaches fail to take into account the nonlinear relationship and the unknown confounders caused by imaging heterogeneity. In particular, the potential heterogeneity may be caused by the differences in the study environment, population, design, protocols, and other unknown factors. To address this challenge, we develop a single index function-on-scalar regression model to investigate the nonlinear relationship between functional responses and covariates of interest while adjusting for unknown confounding factors caused by potential imaging heterogeneity. Both estimation and inference procedures are established for unknown quantities in our proposed model. In addition, the asymptotic properties of estimated functions and detected confounding factors are also systematically investigated. The finite-sample performance of our proposed method is assessed by using both Monte Carlo simulations and a real data example on the diffusion tensor images from the ADNI study.	
Second, causal mediation analysis is widely utilized in neuroscience to investigate the role of brain image phenotypes in the neurological pathways from genetic exposures to clinical outcomes. However, it is still difficult to conduct a genome-wide mediation analysis with the shapes of brain regions as mediators due to several challenges including (i) large-scale genetic exposures, i.e., millions of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs); (ii) nonlinear Hilbert space for shape mediators; and (iii) statistical inference on the direct and indirect effects. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a mediation analysis framework with high dimensional genetic exposures and shape mediators. First, to address the issue caused by the high dimensionality in genetic exposures, a fast genome-wide association analysis is conducted to discover potential genetic variants with significant genetic effects on the clinical outcome. Second, the square-root velocity function representations are extracted from the shapes of the subcortical brain structure, which fall in an unconstrained linear Hilbert subspace. Third, to identify the underlying causal pathways from the detected SNPs to the clinical outcome implicitly through the shape mediators, we proposed a framework consisting of a shape-on-scalar model and a scalar-on-shape model. Furthermore, the bootstrap resampling approach is adopted to investigate both global and spatial significant mediation effects. Finally, our framework is applied to the ADNI corpus callosum shape data, and we successfully identify the mediation effect of a subset of candidate SNPs on Alzheimer’s Disease through some specific subregions of the corpus callosum. 
Finally, most existing methods in functional data analysis assume the smoothness of the functional responses and the coefficient functions or require some smoothing techniques before fitting the functional responses into the statistical models. However, this is often violated in biomedical imaging data, which usually contains spatially contiguous regions or effect regions with relatively sharp edges due to the physical or biological reasons. Thus they tend to blur the image data near the edges or jumps. While the pixel or voxel based methods ignore the spatial information of imaging data, they fail to characterize the spatial correlations.Thus, it is essential to propose an appropriate framework to reveal the relationship between imaging responses and the covariates of interest, while taking the discontinuous property and spatial correlation into account simultaneously. To address these challenges, we proposed a Bayesian hypothesis testing framework on image-on-scalar regression model with mixed effects, and consider wavelet basis decomposition to account for the sudden transitions in the imaging responses. To depict the spatial correlation between grids for each observation, a conditional auto-regressive (CAR) model is utilized. Due to the advantage of Bayesian analysis in hypothesis testing, we propose a Bayesian framework for an image-on-scalar CAR model using a set of Normal - Inverse-Gamma - Uniform priors, introducing the local indicators to conduct block-wise hypothesis tests efficiently and flexibly.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Inorganic nanocrystals have garnered significant attention due to their unique physical and optical properties, spurring extensive research into their development for technological applications like electronic devices, solar cells, and biomedical diagnostics. Tailoring these nanocrystals for specific environments requires precise control over their photophysical, mechanical, and chemical properties. Particularly in bio-related applications, engineering the surface of these nanomaterials to be hydrophilic, biocompatible, and amenable to further bioconjugation while maintaining stability in challenging conditions is crucial. This dissertation aims to explore new ligands to passivate the surfaces of inorganic nanomaterials, preserving their structural and optoelectronic integrity and ensuring long-term stability. Additionally, the dissertation investigates the formation of protein corona on metallic nanocrystals, focusing on understanding the factors governing corona formation and strategies for prevention through ligand design. Furthermore, we explore leveraging the optical properties of gold nanoparticles to design biosensing tools with high sensitivity, specificity, and rapid assay times.	In Chapter 1, fundamental optical, physical, and chemical characteristics of plasmonic, semiconductor, and magnetic nanomaterials are described. Synthetic chemistry and surface coating techniques are briefly outlined, with recent advancements in surface engineering and ligand design being highlighted. Various effective methods for bioconjugation on nanoparticle surfaces are explored. Additionally, "protein corona" is defined, its composition is examined in terms of factors influencing it, and its implications for biology and the environment are discussed. Finally, notable examples of bio-applications involving inorganic nanomaterials are discussed.
	Chapter 2 presents a novel series of polymer ligands with multi-coordinating sites, which were designed using the hydroxamate anchoring motif. These ligands were subsequently employed for coating luminescent quantum dots, gold nanoparticles, and iron oxide nanoparticles. The synthesis of the ligands involved a nucleophilic addition reaction between poly(isobutylene-alt-maleic anhydride) and amine-terminated moieties, including the hydroxamate precursor (NH2OH-HCl) and short polyethylene glycol hydrophilic blocks. This synthesis method allowed the architecture and stoichiometry of the final compound to be adjusted. It was found that these hydroxamate-based polymers were strongly coordinated with ZnS-overcoated quantum dots (QDs), Au nanoparticles (AuNPs), and iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs), resulting in stable dispersions for all three systems. 
	Chapter 3 examines the non-specific adsorption of proteins on AuNPs by strategically altering the structures of a series of DHLA-based ligands. Electrophoretic mobility is employed to monitor potential corona formation on AuNPs when exposed to bovine serum albumin (BSA) or serum samples, allowing the kinetics of binding to be determined. It is indicated by our findings that AuNPs capped with hydrolipoic acid (DHLA), a small alkyl-COOH, are susceptible to size-dependent interactions with proteins. Insight into the deposition of proteins on the surface of nanomaterials is provided by theoretical calculations using a close-packed model. Corona formation is significantly reduced by coating AuNPs with polyethylene glycol- or zwitterion-appended DHLA. Furthermore, protein adsorption is further characterized using UV-Vis spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering. The significance of surface chemistry and nanomaterial size in corona formation, and potentially preventing it, is underscored by our results.
	In Chapter 4, the application of plasmonic nanoparticles for sensing purposes is explored. A charge-mediated diagnostic tool for detecting early-stage cancer biomarkers is developed by leveraging the sensitivity of AuNPs' localized surface plasmon resonance to interparticle distance. Three sets of peptides, each with three specific segments, featuring oppositely charged amino acids at their ends to balance the overall peptide charge, are designed. Two of these peptides are used as substrates for matrix metalloproteinase-14 (MMP-14), a cancer biomarker, while the third is utilized as a negative control. When the cleaved peptide undergoes enzymatic digestion, its interaction with negatively charged AuNPs triggers their assembly in a concentration- and time-dependent process. The assay is investigated to determine how varying the size of the nanoparticles affects it, different peptides are explored, and enzyme kinetics are tracked. It is demonstrated by our results that the sensor has a nanomolar range Limit of Detection (LoD) and minimal cross-reactivity with other abundant proteins in serum. The rapid assay time suggests promising applications for the design of future diagnostic tools for cancer and other diseases.
	In Chapter 5, the findings and implications detailed in this dissertation are summarized, accompanied by a discussion of the future prospects in corona science and biosensor design.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Across the United States a significant number of individuals find themselves incarcerated each year. For the state of Florida, this number represents one of the highest in the country (Carson, 2021). Prior research has indicated that incarcerated populations across the country tend to have a lower literacy level and less education experience than most (Bender et al., 2016; Cho &amp; Tyler, 2010; Dewey et al., 2020; Lockwood et al., 2015; Pompoco et al., 2017). The addition of education to one’s experience while serving their time in prison can not only improve these things but also their post-release job opportunities and the individual’s quality of life while serving their time (Cho &amp; Tyler, 2010; Courtney, 2019; Lockwood et al., 2015; McCorkel &amp; DeFina, 2019; Pompoco et al., 2017). Knowing the benefits education can bring, this study looks to understand access to education programs for those housed in a Florida Department of Corrections facility. Specifically, this study examines what community and institutional factors may predict the offering of career and technical education (CTE) programs and academic and special education (ASE) programs and why. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Through a series of logistical regressions, this study found that there are several factors that can predict certain education offerings both at the county and facility levels. For CTE programs, positive factors predicting that a facility will offer CTE include location in a rural county, the number of facilities within an area, being privately run, and potentially new legislation. For ASE programming, the size of the correctional facility population as well as the gender served were positive factors on the probability of program offering. Within both areas, there are also factors that can reduce the probability of program offering. For CTE programs these include increased enrollment within post-secondary education within the county, the race of the county population, the custody classification level of the correctional facility, gender served at the facility, and the percentage of residents committed to a correctional facility each year. For ASE programming, institutions in rural counties have a lower likelihood of offering ASE coursework. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>There are several study implications that focus on increasing access to education programs for those currently incarcerated in Florida. First is evaluating the connection between rural communities and correctional education offering. For CTE programs, location in a rural county is a positive relationship, while for ASE programs it is not. Understanding the support and value the rural community is bringing to CTE education can not only help to expand it, but also address what challenges may come to offering basic education in the same way. Additionally, the population of both the county and facility were significant in the odds of program offering. For counties with an increased diversity, odds of CTE program offerings declined. For every 1% increase of Black residents, the probability of CTE programs were lower by 10.4%. A similar trend was seen for those classified as Other showing 25.9% lower odds. Looking at the population of residents, it is important to dive deeper into this analysis, breaking down the population into further subgroups to truly understand the outcomes. Additionally, correctional facilities serving male residents showed a higher probability of ASE programs, but a lower probability of CTE programs. Focusing on the facility itself, both those locations with a highest custody classification of community or maximum saw lower odds of CTE program offering as compared to other custody classifications. In contrast, privately run facilities saw higher probability of CTE programs.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para> While the study did conclude that education access was present for those incarcerated within Florida, several factors were identified that could hinder the offering of these programs in certain facilities and areas. The thing found most impactful was the location where an individual was housed. Focusing on both the physical location as well as the custody designation given to the facility, the likelihood of CTE and ASE program offerings differed. With a goal of expanding programming to all, knowing why both the opportunities and challenges exist provides context to expand partnership and legislation within the state system. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>I proceed according to a skeptical, Pyrrhonist inspired metaphilosophy to address two perennial issues: the nature of human agency and our culpability in acting. After unpacking this approach, as well as offering some initial remarks that lay out the playing field, I work to accomplish two things. First, I problematize a picture of human beings and their agency in which they amount to the independent sources of what they do—such that they can be held accountable in a fashion that presupposes such things. Second, I offer a replacement intended to fill the void left by critique: a different orientation toward action, free will, and moral responsibility. By pursuing these tasks, I follow the skeptic way as it shows itself to me—in which one is to offer both a skeptical critique and a skeptical solution to philosophical problems.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>HBCUs have contributed to the formation of strong leaders who have challenged many assumptions of our nation's founders, defended our sovereignty when attacked by internal and external enemies, and sacrificed for the betterment of their communities. HBCU campuses include opportunities for Black students to engage in religious and community service and to identify with cultural strengths that are expected to help them succeed (Albritton, 2012). HBCUs have higher retention and graduation rates for Black students, and “African American students attending HBCUs are up to 33% more likely to graduate than African American students attending a similar non-HBCU” (Gordon et al., 2021, p. 333). HBCUs are known to provide students with faculty mentors, supportive learning experiences, and a sense of belonging on campus (Kim &amp; Conrad, 2006). Students Although some HBCUs offer MSW programs, participants’ decision to attend graduate school at FSU was motivated by the need for a clinically oriented program, internship opportunities, and a desire for new experiences. Following undergraduate studies, 74.8% of graduate social work students attend predominately White institutions (PWIs). However, Black students at PWIs reported that discrimination, isolation, and a lack of support services negatively affected their experiences and served as a distraction to learning (Banks, 2020; Beasley, 2020; Person &amp; Christensen, 1996). Additionally, research exploring Black students' experiences transitioning to a PWI for graduate studies has focused on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) careers (Allen &amp; Dika, 2020; Charleston et al., 2014; McGee &amp; Martin, 2011). While there is a benefit in understanding the experiences of these students, the increase in the number of Black students pursuing careers in social work and other behavioral sciences warrants research (Bowie et al., 2011). Also, while Rasheem and Brunson (2018) added valuable research contributions focused on Black women and HBCU graduate social work programs, this study expands the conversation to address the unique experiences of Black HBCU graduates seeking MSWs at PWIs. The literature included in this study expands Black students' voices and provides diverse approaches to understanding how to create educational environments that meet their needs (Allen &amp; Dika, 2020; Ladson-Billings, 2013). Deconstructing deficit-based paradigms and elevating the voices of researchers engaged in developing culturally relevant pedagogy provides educational systems with an opportunity to create academic environments that value the intellectual and cultural strengths that students possess (Ladson-Billings, 2017; Royal &amp; Gibson, 2017; Yosso, 2005). 
Using a qualitative case study design, this study examined the experiences and perceptions of 17 Black Master of Social Work (MSW) students enrolled in the Florida State University (FSU) College of Social Work (CSW) who obtained an undergraduate degree from an HBCU. According to data from the FSU Office of Institutional Research, Black MSW student enrollment increased from 539 students in 2019 to 875 in 2023. 
The study findings are extricated through brave conversations filled with candor, wit, and resilience as participants recounted the cultural dissonance between their HBCU and PWI experiences. As a result, the study findings identify the cultural strengths and expectations HBCU graduates bring to PWI graduate social work programs, the environmental challenges Black students contend with, and the differences they encounter in faculty and peer relationships. 
The findings from this study provide implications that advance inclusive academic experiences for Black HBCU graduates attending Predominantly White Institutions (PWIs) for their MSW. To provide comparable levels of support Black students receive at HBCUs, PWIs must better meet the needs of Black students (Banks et al., 2020; Beasley, 2021). Credle and Dean (1991) noted that PWIs must create policies and practices that better meet African American students' culture and academic expectations if they are committed to retaining them. In accordance with the ADEI standards, CSWE’s EPAS, and the FSW CSW DEI Plan, this study directly implicates aspects of social work education at PWIs that address implicit and explicit curricula, utilizing inclusive strategies that emphasize student identity, faculty development, and student engagement (Banks et al., 2020; Beasley, 2021; Herzig, 2004).

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This thesis is a qualitative analysis of the framing used in President Donald Trump’s 2020 election-related tweets from April 2020 through January 6, 2021, the day of the attack on the U.S. Capitol, from the perspective of political communication theory. The tweets were analyzed using Fairclough’s Critical Discourse Analysis to allow for examination of the text, the discursive practices, and the social practices within the former president’s tweets. Analysis, which included textual analysis, as well as consideration of the historical resources of the Final Report of the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol and contemporaneous news articles, revealed that Trump framed his election-related tweets in five interconnected narrative frames: (1) rigged election, (2) making the Red Mirage look real, (3) us v. them, (4) media bias, and (5) stop the steal. Through these frames, communicated to his supporters via his Twitter account, Trump was able to direct, participate, and ultimately end the attack on the U.S. Capitol. Further, implications of the research for communication theory, social media, and United States government are discussed, limitations are presented, and areas of future research are suggested.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Research on self-efficacy and how it is developed in K-12 educational spaces has primarily focused on traditional classroom spaces and activities. Little research has focused on self-efficacy development in the context of outdoor experiential learning. Through this study, I use focus groups, in-depth interviewing, and on-line journal prompts to explore how junior and senior high school students participating in a co-curricular leadership program describe their experiences of self-efficacy development through the program’s outdoor learning experiences. Using a thematic analysis approach, I developed three core themes common to the experiences: inspiration from others, growth and transformation, and emotional resilience. Consistent with previous research on self-efficacy, participants identified performance accomplishment as the major pathway by which self-efficacy developed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Many venom proteins have presumably been convergently recruited by taxa from diverse venomous lineages. These toxic proteins have characteristics that allow them to remain stable in solution and have a high propensity for toxic effects on prey and/or potential predators. Despite this well-established convergent toxin recruitment, some toxins seem to be lineage specific. To further investigate the toxic proteins found throughout venomous lineages, in chapter one we performed venom proteomics and venom-gland transcriptomics on two individual red bark centipedes (Scolopocryptops sexspinosus). Combining the protein phenotype with the transcript genotype resulted in the first in-depth venom characterization of S. sexspinosus, including 72 venom components that were identified in both the transcriptome and proteome and 1,468 nontoxin transcripts identified in the transcriptome. Ten different toxin families were represented in the venom and venom gland with the majority of the toxins belonging to metalloproteases, CAPS (cysteine-rich secretory protein, antigen 5, and pathogenesis-related 1 proteins), and -pore-forming toxins. Nine of these toxin families shared a similar proteomic structure to venom proteins previously identified from other centipedes. However, the most highly expressed toxin family, the adamalysin-like metalloproteases, has until now only been observed in the venom of snakes. We confirmed adamalysin-like metalloprotease activity by means of in vivo functional assays. The recruitment of an adamalysin-like metalloprotease into centipede venom represents a striking case of convergent evolution. In chapter two, we investigated the evolution of venom proteins and we tested two different hypotheses of venom evolution. Whole gene duplication followed by nucleotide differentiation is one of the simplest mechanisms to develop new functions for genes. However, the processes underlying multigene family evolution remain controversial. We utilize multigene families found within the diversity of toxic proteins in venom to test two separate hypotheses related to venom evolution, the two-speed mode of venom evolution and the rapid accumulation of variation in exposed residues or RAVER model. The two-speed mode of venom evolution proposes that different types of selection impact ancient and younger venomous lineages with negative selection being the predominant form in ancient lineages and positive selection being the dominant form in younger lineages. The RAVER hypothesis states that instead of different types of selection acting on different ages of venomous lineages, the different types of selection will selectively contribute to amino acid variation based on whether or not the residue is exposed to the solvent. This follows the longstanding understanding of protein evolution that suggests that residues found within the structural or active regions of the protein will be under negative or purifying selection, while residues that do not form part of these areas will be more prone to positive selection. To test these two different hypotheses, we compared the venom of 26 scolopendromorph centipedes from six currently recognized species from across North America using both transcriptomics and proteomics. First, we estimated the phylogenetic relationships of the centipedes used in this study and then characterized the diverse the venom components from across the identified clades. From this diversity of venom family proteins, we conducted selection-based analyses and compared them with the three-dimensional properties of the venom proteins. We found support for both venom evolution hypotheses through the prevalence of negative selection across all proteins and found evidence of positive selection occurring on residues that were exposed to the solvent, while the structural and less solvent exposed residues corresponded with higher rates of negative selection. Through the use of phylogenetics, proteo-transcriptomics, and selection-based analyses, we were able to describe the evolution of venom from an ancient venomous lineage and support principles of protein evolution that directly relate to multigene family evolution. In chapter three, we examined how a phenotype and the corresponding genotype of one species can affect the phenotype and genotype of a coevolving species. Coevolution, or the reciprocal selection between two interacting species, is a key mechanism for the generation and maintenance of adaptive variation. To understand the genetic mechanisms of coevolution, we first need to establish the genotype-by-genotype interactions that contribute to reciprocal selection. However, linking a singular complex trait to its genotype is one of the most difficult challenges in biology, and that difficulty increases when linking the genotypes of two traits that are acting interspecifically. To disentangle the genetic mechanisms behind coevolving traits, we investigated the interaction between two complex traits, venom and venom resistance. To connect the genetics mechanisms behind venom and venom resistance, we performed an extreme quantitative loci mapping study to uncover the genetic mechanisms underlying venom resistance through injecting two distinct centipede venoms into Drosophila. Through injecting a mainly proteolytic venom and a mainly neurotoxic venom, previously described through proteo-transcriptomics, we revealed a unique genome-wide response to venom resistance. We identified a unique genetic response to both venom types, where the mainly proteolytic venom was associated with biological processes relating to cell adhesion, cytoskeleton organization, synapse organization and nervous system development, while the principally neurotoxic venom was only associated with synapse organization. This comparative approach also uncovered a sex-specific response to venom resistance, which has not yet been described in the literature. To verify the function of the causal genes from our genotype-to-genotype map of venom and venom resistance, we performed an RNAi knockdown study which implicated genes and genetic pathways already described in the literature and uncovered novel pathways that could lead to venom resistance. Through an experimental approach, we comparatively characterized the genetic basis of complex traits and molecularly linked interspecific traits, adding to our understanding of venom and venom resistance and how organisms can coevolve.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>A new algorithm that hybridizes massless marker particles with the coupled level set moment-of-fluid method to improve the interface reconstruction in multiphase flow problems is proposed. This new method aims to take advantage of both near-interface and on-interface Lagrangian marker particles in a similar fashion to the Particle Level Set (PLS) Method, first introduced by Enright et al. [28]. In contrast to Enright et al. who used particles to improve the mass conservation of the level set method, in this thesis the utility of the particles are studied to improve the slope reconstruction for the multimaterial moment of fluid (MOF) method [54]. Additionally, prior to this, PLS methods have not been implemented on N-phase flow problems involving more than two materials. The proposed method is volume-preserving. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Furthermore, we hypothesize that deriving slopes from particles overcomes the surface tension checkerboard instability of the MOF method first discussed by Ye et al. [116].  Ye et al. developed the ``Continuous Moment of Fluid'' (CMOF) method in order to overcome this checkerboard instability. It is asserted in this thesis that augmenting the interface representation with meshless particle produces similar results to that of the CMOF method, at a lowered computational cost. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The new coupled particle level set and moment of fluid method (PLSMOF) is demonstrated on benchmark tests in 2d, 3d axisymmetric ``R-Z", and 3d problems including rigid body motion, two phase flow, and incompressible multiphase flow problems undergoing phase change involving several different materials with `triple-points'. Comparisons are made between the new PLSMOF method proposed herein, the CMOF method, and the MOF method for multimaterial multiphase flows.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>ALL YOU CAN EAT centers queer-femme expression within a cis/hetero-normative patriarchal male gaze. Its poems explore identity via an eclectic, pop-culture-informed, and thoroughly gurlesque self-portraiture of its speaker, presented in slam-style monologues as well as formal and experimental verse. True to the implication of its title, this manuscript further caters its craft and styles to a wide range of poetic tastes, as ALL YOU CAN EAT balances narrative, music, image, and form within a contemporary confessional poetics: There are cows and aliens in this manuscript, as well as Emily Dickinson and Meryl Streep. There are tastebud-based superpowers, tattoo wish lists, and the desire to start a band with one’s dead high school friends. There are dysfunctional family dynamics compounded by a mother’s cancer diagnosis, struggles with the body and self-image, and there are bagel and vegan cake-related accidents. Meanwhile, ALL YOU CAN EAT’s speaker seeks to reclaim themself from objectification and fetishization in their quest for self-development. Within the combination of these ingredients, ALL YOU CAN EAT contrasts dichotomies of hunger and indulgence, realism and surrealism, sincerity and humor, trauma and joy, as well as girlhood safety and the perils which accompany feminine sexual maturity. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Mobile Homes Drive is the story of a mother, Nessa, raising a teenage daughter alone in a trailer park in the mid-nineties. When Nessa discovers neighbor Justin’s dead child in a hot car, she finds herself amid a culture war. The town’s sympathies do not extend to Justin, a recovering drug addict, though Nessa believes the child’s death was an accident. At the front of the movement against Justin is Shelby Fuller, pastor of the local church and Nessa’s boss. Nessa’s testimony as witness to the incident is challenged as Shelby uses the child’s death to kick off a bid for town mayor. Months later, participation in Justin’s defense prompts Shelby to fire Nessa. Meanwhile, Shelby plans to demolish Mobile Homes Drive, where Nessa lives, to appease his constituents’ prejudices against poverty. To legally outmaneuver the powerful clergyman, Nessa consults Justin’s attractive attorney, Brent. Just as Nessa’s new relationship blooms, her estranged husband Dale returns with a pregnant fiancé in tow. When Dale discovers an inappropriate relationship between his daughter and Pastor Shelby’s adult son, Dale threatens jobless, homeless Nessa’s custody of their daughter. Mobile Homes Drive contemplates the subtleties of a small-town class system, the role of Christianity in Southern politics, and the tangle of familial relationships. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>According to research from FSU's Hate Crime and Policy Institute, since early 2010, print journalists have been deadnaming (i.e., calling a transgender person by their birth name when they have changed their name as part of their gender transition) and misgendering transgender victims of violence in fatal crime reporting across the U.S. These are hateful acts toward the LGBTQ+ community, and affected transgender people have been repeatedly misrepresented in mainstream media now for over a decade. Though the LGBTQ+ movement has progressed immensely, there are concentrated geographic regions that showcase high numbers of transgender murder victims, and even higher numbers of offensive journalistic practices regarding trans lives and deaths. In order for researchers, journalists, and activists to eliminate such journalistic practices, they must first understand the recent landscape of journalism and how news content on anti-transgender violence has changed in the last decade. In the master’s thesis, “Are Journalists Still Deadnaming? Journalistic Practices and Rhetorical Choices in Reporting on Murdered Transgender People," I utilize quantitative research methods to explore first, the foundation for this media phenomenon by collecting basic statistics on news coverage from 1980-2010; then, I utilize qualitative methods based on political economy of media and rhetorical criticism to deeply analyze the structure and copy of articles written on transgender murder cases from 2016-2022. My research questions include 1) How, if at all, has the use of deadnaming and pronouns changed from 2016-2022 in journalistic reporting on murdered transgender people? 2) What themes are present in journalistic writing that communicate a political or ideological viewpoint on transgender people in relation to their murder? 3) Are the life narratives of murdered transgender people featured in the news reporting on their deaths? Using this data, I draw conclusions and recommend changes to newspaper journalism to avoid media misrepresentation of murdered transgender people in the future. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The topic of sustainability, in regard to cruelty-free and sustainable efforts from brands, has become growling popular with the younger generations, specifically in the cosmetic industry. This study investigated the impact of cosmetic companies’ regarding branding cruelty-free and sustainability on consumer engagement by looking at likes, followers, comment numbers and other Instagram metrics. The literature review highlighted important studies about animal testing theories, legitimacy theory, corporate social responsibility, customer relationship management, sustainability, and cruelty-free branding, and Kolter’s 5 A’s of Marketing. Overall, there were no significant differences between cruelty-free and non-cruelty free brands regarding their branding of cruelty-free and sustainability on consumer engagement.  Although, the findings show that posts that include cruelty-free hashtags had higher (or more) likes than cosmetic brands that do not include cruelty-free hashtags The findings of this study indicate that cruelty-free brands used voice overs on videos, while non-cruelty-free brands used music or a model speaking to you. Another significant finding was that cruelty-free brands will use the later stages of the 5 A’s of Sales Marketing, like act and advocate which encourage consumers to use and purchase their products. The findings of this study also indicate that cosmetic brands that post about their CSR initiatives use the later stages of the 5 A’s of Sales Marketing.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Thermoelectric materials hold tremendous promise for advances in fundamental science and practical applications; particularly for robust electricity generation in extreme and remote environments. However, for most materials, the energy conversion efficiency is limited by the proportionality between the electrical and thermal conductivities and small values of the Seebeck coefficient for metals. Despite these limitations, promising thermoelectric properties have been reported forsome Yb-based heavy-fermion compounds. In this dissertation, I explore the hypothesis that the thermoelectric properties of those family compounds, due to their novel structure with exotic electronic and magnetic properties, can be further enhanced through chemical substitution. Additionally, I elaborate on the manufacturability of thermoelectric devices using these compounds and their possible application for cooling probes.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In the 1983 publication, Frames of Mind, Howard Gardner presented his Theory of Multiple Intelligences, which challenged the notion of a quantifiable single general intelligence, g, often measured as IQ. Gardner determined the criteria for the selection of various individual intelligences present in all humans and used these criteria to suggest the existence of seven intelligences: linguistic intelligence, musical intelligence, logical-mathematical intelligence, spatial intelligence, bodily-kinesthetic intelligence, and two personal intelligences; i.e., intrapersonal and interpersonal intelligences. This theory rapidly gained traction in the field of education due to its potential for aiding in the development of adaptable methods of teaching and learning. In his 1999 publication, The Disciplined Mind: What All Students Should Understand, Gardner applied his Multiple Intelligences Theory to an educational framework for facilitating understanding. Gardner’s work on cognition and pedagogy has been successfully applied in many disciplines, and the present treatise aims to utilize this framework to create and label a variety of approaches to fundamental tuba pedagogy and inspire others to do the same in this and other contexts. In the pages below, the reader can expect to learn about the tenets and justification of Gardner’s Theory of Multiple Intelligences, his framework of teaching for understanding, and be introduced to different methods of teaching the fundamentals of breathing, sound production, intonation, range, dynamics, and articulation in tuba pedagogy from the lens of Gardner’s framework of teaching for understanding and his Theory of Multiple Intelligences. This research can be expanded into other concepts within tuba pedagogy, and the contents herein may prove useful to teachers seeking to diversify their teaching.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to assess music therapists’ knowledge of music therapy research for treatment for persons with diabetes mellitus (DM). Participants (N = 236) for this study were music therapists who were members of the Certification Board of Music Therapists. Participants were emailed a link to an online survey and results were sent to the researcher after completion. Results indicated a significant difference between how well music therapists who are working with persons with DM know music therapy research for treatment of DM (M = 1.1, SD = 0.30) compared to music therapists not working with persons with DM (M = 1.47, SD = 0.76), t (167) = 4.14, p &lt; .05, d = 0.64. There was also a significant difference regarding how comfortable music therapists felt working with persons with DM (M = 3.8, SD = 1.13) compared to their wiliness to work with persons with DM (M = 4.4, SD = 0.92), t (364) = -4.75, p &lt; .05, d = 0.49. Results suggest that, while music therapists working with persons with DM know music therapy research better than those not working with persons with DM, they still do not know music therapy research well. Music therapists are, however, comfortable, and very willing to work with persons with DM.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>A simplified model of the Great Plains Nocturnal Low-level Jet (NLLJ) is formulated to include the classical inertial oscillation (Blackadar) and baroclinic (Holton) mechanisms. Time and height dependent solutions are analytically obtained with and without baroclinic forcing. Solutions are shown to be consistent with results from previous literature and observations. A novel application of this model is that it is applied to evaluate the temporal evolution of storm-relative helicity (SRH) overnight. That is, the NLLJ evolution is analytically linked to SRH_{0-1 km} to gauge its impact on magnitudes of environmental shear favorable for supercells and tornadoes. It is found that the NLLJ can contribute to sustaining SRH_{0-1 km} &gt; 100 m^2 / s^2 for more than eight hours of the nocturnal period, provided there is sufficient baroclinic forcing to drive stronger amplitude oscillations of the winds.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Preceramic polymers (PCPs) offer advantages in producing ceramics due to their processability and ability to tailor their chemical structure. However, challenges such as volume shrinkage and mass loss during pyrolysis often result in pores and cracks. PCP-grafted ceramic nanoparticles (PCPGNP) have been proposed and studied as a solution to volume shrinkage and mass loss problems. PCPGNPs also help to reduce aggregation and to control the nanoparticle arrangement. The neat state of these PCPGNPs has been characterized with respect to thermal properties and rheology. Dispersing PCPGNPs in commercial preceramic polymer matrices is another attractive, but unexplored, route to control the rheological and char yield properties of the matrices. In this work, a systematic rheological study of well-defined mixtures of a commercial PCP, SMP-877, and PCPGNPs (silica with poly(1,1-dimethylpropylsilane) corona) was executed to develop design rules for the processing of such mixtures. A rheological study demonstrated the effect of increasing particle concentration on network formation with percolation occurring between 50-60 wt%. Samples above the percolation threshold also exhibited higher viscosities and rapid shear thinning thus demonstrating their printability. X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) corroborated the rheology and showed two diffusive modes when the material was above percolation. Mixtures of PCPGNPS and SMP-877 had synergistically higher char yields upon thermal treatment and pyrolysis. XPCS and rheological measurements during thermal treatment identified thermal jamming of the polymer grafts as a key factor in improving the char yield.  With the insights gained here we expect these mixed systems to provide advanced inks for additive manufacturing of ceramics for aerospace applications.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Through three independent essays, this manuscript addresses improving civic engagement, gender equity, and diversity within organizations through three unique lenses. The first paper explores the experiences of participants from a national leadership training organization providing the type of training and network building connections that those who are typically removed from the privilege to power pipeline fail to access. Ensuring a diverse workforce is often listed as an organizational goal or achievement, but aside from being understudied, it is also not utilized to its max capacity for organizational performance. Developing human capital among a diverse workforce remains critical for a representative and responsive public service, yet evidence-based recommendations for public training and development programs remain understudied. The second paper is based on a mixed methods gender equity study of a large police department and highlights opportunities for continued growth and improvement to allow masculine organizations to attempt to reach gender parity among their workforce and subsequently, their workforce’s interactions with the residents they serve. The third paper is an exploratory descriptive case study investigating how an advocacy group, a public sector union, can influence voter turnout and voter registration and contribute to an uptick in civic engagement through voting. Implications for future coalition building and the need to expand future literature to study public sector labor unions in the field of public administration beyond focusing on collective bargaining activities.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Research on language and cognitive processes in bilinguals over the past few decades has underscored the activation of words in the first language (L1) during comprehension and production of the second language (L2) (e.g., Dijkstra, Van Jaarsveld, &amp; Ten Brinke, 1998; Van Heuven, Dijkstra, &amp; Grainger, 1998; Hermans, Bongaerts, De Bot, &amp; Schreuder, 1998;Lemhöfer, et al., 2008). This activation extends bidirectionally, with words from the L2 also influencing the processing of the L1 (e.g., Van Hell &amp; De Groot, 2008; Linck, Kroll, &amp; Sunderman, 2009; Schmid &amp; Jarvis, 2014; Schmid &amp; Keijzer, 2009), leading to cross-linguistic interference (CLI) in bilinguals’ language processing. However, the nature and extent of this interference may vary depending on the bilingual’s dominant language and immersion context. L1-dominant bilinguals may struggle to control interference from their L1s, while the opposite may hold true for L2-dominant bilinguals, even when their L2 is not their native language. Consequently, the formerly dominant L1 of some bilinguals may exhibit signs of attrition.
This dissertation explores the relationship between attrition and L2 acquisition, addressing two key questions: (1) to what extent does context (place of residence) and nature of bilingualism influences the amount and direction of cross-language interference? and (2) to what extent (if any) is the activation of form and meaning modulated by the nature of the lexical relationships and individual differences measures? And, if effects are found, how does sentence context modulate those effects? The contribution of this study stems from the novel examination of two types of semantic extensions: a) new meanings or words that share form but do not share any semantic relationship across languages; and b) extended meanings or words that share form and at least one semantic sense across languages. Additionally, synonyms, unrelated words, cognates, interlingual homographs and translation pairs are also included to explore form-meaning interactions.
The comprehension of words with varying degrees of form-meaning relatedness is evaluated in two tasks: (1) a semantic-relatedness decision task (SRDT) within and across languages and (2) a self-paced reading task (SPR). Sentence cues in unilingual language contexts are manipulated in congruent and incongruent conditions to assess interference effects. Participants also complete a flanker task as a measure of cognitive control and a battery of proficiency measures. These tasks are implemented across five participant groups:

(1) monolingual speakers of English in the U.S, (2) monolingual Spanish speakers in Argentina, (3) L1 Spanish-L2 English bilinguals in the USA, (4), L1 Spanish-L2 English bilinguals in Argentina and (5) L1 English- L2 Spanish learners in the USA.
Results from this study indicate that immersion context influences the direction of language interference, with more L2 to L1 effects observed for immersed bilinguals compared to non-immersed counterparts, and with both groups being vulnerable to CLI effects compared to monolinguals. Despite extended exposure in an L2 dominant context, bilinguals can maintain their L1 proficiency, contradicting L1 attrition views. The activation of form-meaning relationships is directly related to the nature of the lexical relationships, with orthographically and semantically related words (e.g., cognates; extended meanings) showing processing advantages over orthographically related but semantically unrelated words across languages (e.g., false friends, new meanings). Within-language semantic competitors cause more interference during processing compared to unrelated words. Inhibitory control mechanisms or language dominance do not significantly attenuate CLI effects from form-meaning competitors in the non-target language. Results from the SPR revealed that sentence context can modulate interference effects, facilitating the resolution of lexical ambiguities and form-meaning relationships. However, language cues from a sentence alone are not sufficient to constrain CL competition, highlighting the importance of semantic information conveyed by the sentence context for language non-selectivity to occur. Overall, bilingual characteristics, including the type of bilingual, linguistic exposure/experience and levels of L1-L2 proficiency all seem to influence language processing.
This dissertation contributes to the field of psycholinguistics of bilingualism, language attrition and second language acquisition. It highlights the importance of understanding language-attrition as a bridge between first- and second-language lexical processing.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this dissertation was to extend the literature base for teaching students with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) mathematics and self-determination skills using an evidence-based practice called modified schema-based instruction (MSBI). Chapter one provides the rationale for teaching both mathematics and self-determination skills to students with IDD, highlighting the correlation between both skill sets and positive post-secondary outcomes. This chapter presents the rationale for conducting this dissertation, which extends from prior MSBI research and is grounded in educational theory. To answer the five proposed research questions, this dissertation uses a mixed methods embedded experimental design. This dissertation follows mixed methods publishing recommendations by presenting the findings across multiple manuscripts (i.e., chapters). Chapter two presents the findings from the quantitative single-case design exploring the effects of teacher- and paraprofessional-delivered MSBI targeting personal finance mathematics word problems by students with IDD in a small group setting. Results indicate a functional relation and strong effect sizes between MSBI and learned mathematics skills of students with IDD, further adding to the extant literature base of positive student outcomes produced during MSBI instruction. Chapter three presents the findings from the integrated mixed methods results exploring how, why, and under what conditions MSBI works for teaching mathematics to students with IDD through a rigorous evaluation of fidelity of implementation. Findings provide important contextual information for how differentiated instructional delivery of MSBI can impact student outcomes; additionally, results identified six influences impacting instructional delivery and student outcomes, adding novel information for under what conditions MSBI is effective in teaching mathematics to students with IDD.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Iberian city of Seville offers a case study of motif and iconographic transference in the late Middle Ages and Early Modern era. Previous scholars have addressed the idea of transference through a formal lens without consideration for the cultural and historical contexts that surround it, and have previously noted, though rarely explicated, a Sevillian school of painting. The limited foundational studies on late fifteenth- and early sixteenth-century artworks in Seville, most published in the early twentieth century, focus on stylistic categorization and the indiscriminate application of terms such as Hispano-Flemish and mudéjar. My dissertation nuances these terms through an investigation of the artworks’ place and development in a Sevillian context, specifically parsing local and global stylistic and iconographic influences apparent in the works. My work addresses the local outside of the simple framework of mudéjar, the stylistic qualification meant to designate ornamentation, architecture, and motifs showing Islamic stylistic influence but created within a Christian Iberian context. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A close study of how prints and printing in general functioned in Seville and Granada clarifies how iconographies were transferred across media as well as how specific motifs were deployed in efforts to convert Muslims and Jews. While many prints do not survive, my dissertation reconstructs how they were employed by the citizens of Seville. The function and purpose of prints varied significantly: many were kept in the home and used for personal devotion by so-called Old Christians; they were distributed to non-Christians and new converts, and helped to prevent accusations of apostasy; and they served as models for painted and carved panel compositions. Additionally, terminology like “mudéjar” does not work for a Sevillian context where Islamic decorative motifs were strongly connected to the culture and history of the city. Tracking how, when, and why these motifs were copied and transferred sheds light on the global function of Iberian artworks and provides insight into how these methods operated more broadly. My research highlights connectivity and diversity in a way that impacts current studies and modern understandings of how we can define globality in the Middle Ages. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>La related proteins (LARPs) form a superfamily of 7 distinct, homologous RNA regulatory protein which utilize a tandem La domain and ribonucleotide recognition motif (RRM), termed the La module, to recognize their individual RNA targets. LARP6, in vertebrates, functions to regulate the coordinated synthesis of type 1 collagen peptide mRNA during wound healing processes through the specific recognition of an mRNA secondary structure, the 5’ stem loop (5’SL). This stem loop is located at the junction between the 5’ untranslated region and protein- encoding region of mature type 1 and type 3 collagen mRNA, preoccupying the translation initiation codon. Prolonged injury from chronic disease, lifestyle, or aging results in the hyperactivity of wound healing mechanisms. Overactive myofibroblasts, which excrete extracellular matrix material (ECM) composed primarily of type 1 collagen, fill functional parenchymal tissue space with nonfunctional scaffoldings which rigidifies the tissue or organ. This hyperactivity results in fibrotic scarring which is progressively less reversible and was associated with &gt;17% of mortalities globally prior to 2020. LARP6 acts as a central regulatory element of type 1 collagen mRNA, governing the potential for high-volume collagen excretion and is therefore operative in the development of fibrosis.Recent work, from our lab and others, presented evidence that La related protein 1 (LARP1) lacks an RRM downstream from the La domain. Instead, the intrinsically unstructured region contains a type 2 polyadenylate binding protein association motif (PAM2) sequence which is recognized by the C-terminal MLLE domain of cytosolic polyadenylate binding protein (PABPC1). The PAM2 motif of LARP1 and other protein functions to protect, circularize, regulate, or destabilize 3’ polyadenylated tails of RNA polymerase II transcripts. The PAM2 motif of
xi
LARP1 deviates from the canonical physiochemical composition and standard length of the consensus sequence from other PAM2 motif-containing protein.
In this work novel features of LARP6 substrate recognition and LARP1A PAM2 motif recognition are investigated by NMR spectroscopy and biophysical analysis, as neither system crystalized in our hands. LARP6 can recognize 5’SL RNA without the explicit requirement of the RRM domain, which was previously reported to be mandatory for specific, high-affinity binding. The structure of the LARP6 La domain, residues 79-183, in complex with a 35-nucleotide model of the 5’ SL has been determined by NMR spectroscopy. Specificity conferring arrangements of the La domain and 5’SL explain the ability of the La domain to function as an isolated domain. The alternative MLLE recognition elements within the LARP1 PAM2 motif have also been investigated. This motif deviates in its N-terminal segment from the canonical composition of other PAM2 motifs which have been co-crystallized with the MLLE domain. Chemical shift perturbation of isotopically enriched MLLE domain in the presence of PAM2 peptides, coupled with molecular dynamics simulations, elucidates how the differences between these PAM2 still result in similar binding modes on MLLE. This work is concluded with a review of methyl-detected NMR methods for determining allosteric motions or interactions with the kinetic cooperativity model of human glucokinase as a case study.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Professional development is viewed as a lifelong learning process for educators to improve student instruction and professional skills (Darling-Hammond et al., 2017). Online professional development for teachers of student who are visually impaired (TVIs) provides opportunities for continuing education, including for earning of recertification hours. With the rapid growth of online professional development, there is a need to assess the efficacy of synchronous and asynchronous options (Rowe, 2019). The purpose of this quantitative study was to compare two types of abacus professional development, online synchronous and online asynchronous, provided to TVIs to determine if a significant difference existed for growth of abacus knowledge, participant engagement, and participant satisfaction. Moore’s transactional distance theory (1973) provided a conceptual framework for the study. The results of the analyses found that participants (N = 93) in both conditions had learning gains. The repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) suggested the participants in the asynchronous condition had greater gains in abacus knowledge, but the proximity of the p-value (p=.051) to the customary threshold of .05 makes it difficult to use the p-value to draw conclusions regarding the statistical significance of this difference. Participants reported approximately the same levels of engagement or satisfaction in both conditions. 
This study adds to the very limited literature on differences in educational outcomes for online synchronous and asynchronous professional development for TVIs. The fact that online asynchronous professional development appears to have impacted learning growth more than online synchronous professional development was intriguing. This study suggests that online learning environments can be engaging and satisfying whether delivered synchronously or asynchronously.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this research is to understand the relationship among school conditions, teacher job satisfaction, intention to stay, and school type (charter versus traditional public schools) and to determine if school conditions, and thereby job satisfaction, influences teachers’ intention to stay in the field. Understanding this is critical to addressing teacher shortages from a policy and practical perspective. Data was collected from 275 teachers in four Florida counties, with comparable samples of charter and traditional public schools, through an online Qualtrics survey and all survey responses remained anonymous. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and independent samples t-test, multiple regression and multiple logistic regression analysis, and ANOVA to determine if significant relationships exist. The findings noted that of eight school conditions, six of those conditions were scored higher by charter school teachers, with one not significant and another higher by traditional public school teachers. None of the school conditions predicted a teacher’s intention to stay in the field and only three (salary, high-stakes testing, and student behavior) significantly related to teacher job satisfaction. Of those three, only high-stakes testing and student behavior showed a statistically significant difference when accounting for the type of school.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Teogonía is a symphonic poem in five sections based on the mural, Teogonía de los dioses chibchas, by Luis Alberto Acuña. Each section introduces one of the Chibcha Gods and the creation story of the Muisca people. Other references that inspired me are symphonic works by Latin-American composers: Silvestre Revueltas, Alberto Ginastera, José Pablo Moncayo, and Arturo Márquez. This work was written in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Music from Florida State University. 	Based on the mural located at the Hotel Tequendama in Bogotá, Colombia, Teogonía is meant to depict the creation story of the Muisca, or Chibcha people. While there are many more characters in the mural, this orchestral work illustrates the five principal Gods of the creation story: Chiminigagua, Súe, Chía, Chibchacum, and Bochica. The piece opens with Chiminigagua, the all-powerful God and creator of the universe. This character is represented by a three-note motive [D-F-G] which is the basis of the piece and reappears in each of the following sections. The piece begins in a primordial state of the universe until the spark of creation which leads into the second section.
	Súe is the God of the sun and represents light and energy. This upbeat section is characterized by the use of traditional Colombian dance rhythms, most prominently, the bambuco. These rhythms can be identified by the simultaneous and alternating groupings of two and three. The third section depicts the moon Goddess, Chía. In mythology, Chía and Súe are married and perpetually follow each other in the sky. This section is about their love and culminates in the single moment they can be together, during an eclipse. The fourth section tells the story of Chibchacum, God of thunder and rain. The orchestra, here, depicts the great storm that flooded the world, wiping away the corruption that had spread. The final section introduces Bochica who is commonly seen as the messenger of Chiminigagua. Bochica arrives after the great flood on a rainbow and strikes the ground with his staff creating the Tequendama falls. He teaches the Musica people about moral norms, ways to organize their states, agriculture, metalworking, and crafts. This final section concludes the piece and combines statements of all previous Gods’ themes.

            <DISS_para>This dissertation explores women's property ownership in the south of France from 1750-1815, with a particular emphasis on an overlooked group of women in Bas Languedoc, centered around Montpellier. The study investigates the impact of women's legal and marital status on their economic agency, filling a gap in historical scholarship that has neglected this specific group. In contrast to other regions of France where customary law prevailed, women in the south, subject to written law, enjoyed legal and social empowerment enabling them to independently own and manage property. This assertion applies regardless of social and demographic variables. The argument is substantiated by a blend of qualitative and quantitative evidence. Three in-depth case studies featuring prominent married women- the Marquise de Spinola, the Marquise de Murs, and Catherine Rose Mallié- serve as illustrative examples. These case studies highlight women's formal property ownership and their active engagement in wealth management through activities such as litigation, transactions, leasing, and philanthropy. To complement the case studies, a meticulous examination of notary and tax records reveals the breadth and prevalence of women's property ownership. Geographic comparisons and temporal analyses further illuminate the varied landscape of women's economic autonomy over time. This dissertation argues for the importance of regional perspectives in understanding French history, emphasizing the necessity to provincialize historical narratives for a more nuanced comprehension of women's diverse experiences. Furthermore, it challenges conventional assumptions about the limitations of marriage as an institution, encouraging historians to move beyond passive interpretations of its role in shaping women's economic agency.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This research delves into the complex history of Chitimacha-speaking communities to form a speculated migrations route during the French Colonial era. The arrival of the French marked a pivotal moment, introducing diseases, displacement, and cultural assimilation for Chitimacha-speakers as well as other Indigenous communities. This research analyzes historical documents, archaeological findings, and georeferenced maps to unravel Chitimacha-speaking communities’ migration through Louisiana to the western Atchafalaya Basin, address the gap of knowledge of the Chitimacha-Speakers’ past, and shed light on challenges that this research and archaeology face.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Due to the unknown accuracy of the historic maps and where the cartographers got their data from, it was determined that historical maps are not a reliable dataset on their own to determine Indigenous migration, but instead should be analyzed alongside historical documents and archaeological findings. Analysis of pottery sherds helped place the current study area into regional context through comparisons to findings from previous investigations. A Coles Creek-Plaquemine component is proposed for 16SMY2 and 16SMY12 because of the pottery sherds recovered from previous archaeological investigations in the region. The other three current archaeological investigation areas do not have enough data to be placed into context.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Dovetailing is a collection of nineteen personal essays about my experience with debilitating anxiety and depression. In the collection, I use birds as a mechanism to explore mental illness, with each essay focusing on a specific bird. Throughout the collection, I braid my experience seeing each essay’s titular bird with research about birds, mental illness, literature, or other topics. The entire structure of the book mirrors the experience of being consumed by mental illness and learning to cope with and accept that illness. The opening essays of the collection are shorter, more fragmented, and contain more repetitions, mirroring the way anxiety is cyclical, as well as the way it fragments the way one experiences the world. As the collection progresses, the essays become more linear and less focused on anxiety, mirroring the way the narrator better understands her anxiety and no longer considers it an all-consuming experience. The final essay in the collection, “Passeridae,” is fragmented and follows the narrator through a difficult spell of anxiety. Ending the collection this way allows the collection to counter the notion that anxiety and mental disorders can be “cured.” While the essay collection investigates the way that the narrator finds watching birds a healing and grounding process, it also rejects the common nature writing cliche that nature exists to be healing. Instead, birdwatching has become a part of the narrator, just as she has accepted anxiety and depression as part of her. Accompanying these creative essays is a critical essay that examines the goals and inspirations behind my creative work. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Music therapy research (93%) has indicated the impact of music therapy on older adults with dementia, which is enhancing the quality of life, decreasing stress and agitation, improving mood, increasing cognitive and language skills, and improving physical movement. The purpose of this study was to review and analyze publications in the Journal of Music Therapy (JMT)  and Music Therapy Perspectives (MTP) on older adults with dementia from the years 1980-1999 and 2000-2024. The researcher sought to find the most effective interventions and mostly used assessments for older adults with dementia. The results of this content analysis suggest that singing activities are the mostly used intervention, observation is the most common assessment used followed by using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) as a reference for creating music therapy assessments, and that more research is needed due to the small number of articles published. Recommendations were also given to expand research in the field of older adults with dementia.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The use of music therapy with adolescents/young adults (AYA) in mental health facilities has proven to be effective. The purpose of this research was to examine the use of music therapy interventions with AYA at mental health facilities in Journal of Music Therapy, Music Therapy Perspectives, and Voices: A World Forum for Music Therapy from 2019 through 2024. Criteria for inclusion were music therapy applied to the population with music as the primary focus of the intervention, the presence of music therapy interventions in AYA mental health facilities and research from 2019 through 2024. Of the 321 articles, 21 met these criteria, and 5 were identified for further inspection. Overall, the specific interventions used by music therapists with this population is slim. Further research and in-depth annotation of music therapy interventions with AYA in mental health facilities is needed to continue the expansion of accessibility of music therapy within this population. With continued research and robust research contributing to the field, there is hope that a plethora of resources will be utilized by the field of music therapy. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this dissertation, we address the development of mathematical frameworks for computationally feasible methods to compare and analyze large datasets of complex-shaped data. We discuss several projects at the intersections of optimal transport, geometric measure theory, elastic shape analysis, and geometric deep learning that contribute novel algorithms for the practical analysis of shape data and develop the theoretical foundations of shape analysis.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We propose a supervised deep geometric learning method to achieve a parameterization-invariant calculation of the square root velocity (SRV) shape distance function. This method learns the invariance of the SRV metric to reparameterizations by implementing a shape-preserving data augmentation method during the training process. Moreover, we propose an unsupervised geometric deep learning method that utilizes methods from geometric measure theory to learn parameterization-invariant feature vector representations of curves and shape graphs. This method provides a robust and efficient approach for the classification of shape data and the identification of point-to-point correspondences between curves and shape graphs. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Additionally, we discuss several methods within a framework of relaxed matching between surfaces with respect to a family of second-order Sobolev metrics. These methods combine Riemannian metrics from elastic shape analysis for shape comparison, along with a relaxed matching loss from the domain of geometric measure theory, to solve the correspondence problem. The adoption of weighted varifold representations of shapes facilitates the matching of shapes with different topological structures, accommodating noise, occlusions, and partial matching problems between shapes. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive framework to perform statistical analysis of populations in the space of shapes. We also describe the restriction of this model to shapes that undergo deformations within a basis of biologically relevant or physically feasible deformations.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We also discuss a project studying connection between the Square Root Normal Field (SRNF) elastic shape pseudo-metric and the Wasserstein Fisher-Rao (WFR) unbalanced optimal transport metric. By studying this connection, we construct algorithms and deepen the theoretical understanding of the SRNF and WFR metrics. Specifically, we offer a characterization of the closure of the SRNF map and shapes that are indistinguishable with respect to the SRNF metric. Furthermore, we propose a formulation of the WFR as a diffeomorphic optimization problem related to Gallou\"{e}t and Vialard’s recent extension of the Riemannian submersion result of Otto.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Animal ethics is the branch of ethics concerning non-human animals. Population ethics is the branch of ethics concerning ethical issues related to who will exist or the number of people that will exist. In this dissertation, I argue for some views in animal ethics by appealing to insights from population ethics, and I argue for some views in population ethics by appealing to some insights from animal ethics. There are five chapters. The first chapter introduces the project, while the subsequent chapters each present one of four independent essays. The chapters can be read in any order and each one is self-contained. In the second chapter, I defend a virtue ethics approach to animal ethics. In the third chapter, I discuss an objection to my approach to animal ethics, namely that my approach runs counter to common sense. In the fourth chapter, I defend a theory of well-being that helps us to avoid the so-called “repugnant conclusion,” a conclusion that many population ethicists desire to avoid. In the fifth chapter, I defend a view about the so-called “non-identity problem,” by denying the distinction between doing and allowing harm in what I refer to as “non-identity cases”.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The contemporary power grid landscape is witnessing a transformative shift. As the integration ofrenewable energy resources intensifies and decarbonization objectives gain prominence, there is a
discernible migration from traditional synchronous generator (SG)-based systems to inverter-based
resources (IBRs). This shift, while promising, heralds the dawn of a modernized electric power
grid characterized by unparalleled flexibility and adaptability.
Despite the potential advantages, this transition presents complex challenges. At the forefront
is the phase-locked loop (PLL), a critical synchronization mechanism for the AC power grid.
While its role in inverter controls is essential, it has been linked to issues such as oscillations and
subsynchronous harmonics. Additionally, the "black start"process remains a significant concern.
For SGs, initiating a black start can be time-consuming, often taking tens of minutes due to factors
like the mechanical inertia of generators, extended energizing transients, and system control
latency. In the context of IBRs, the black start process is similarly constrained, especially by the
bandwidth limitations of the PLL.
To address these challenges, this thesis presents a novel PLL-free inverter control approach.
Impressively, this new control, even without the PLL, offers a faster transient response to various
grid changes while maintaining a low steady-state error. We also introduce advanced startup
methods for IBRs. Our hysteresis-based technique allows inverters to connect to the grid within one
fundamental cycle without inrush current and is resilient to grid voltage distortions. Further, we
propose a switching-cycle-based startup method, enabling inverters to become operational within
just two switching cycles, without any inrush current. Together, these innovative methods not
only improve the black start process for IBRs but also enhance the overall stability and resilience
of power systems.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation proposes a novel approach to policy innovation and dissemination studies by developing a comprehensive framework incorporating three key dimensions: space, time, and actors. Policy innovation and diffusion research in the spatial dimension should prioritize the domestic realm and encompass the global sphere. This dissertation demonstrates the influence of national culture on the dissemination of a worldwide policy, using the gender mainstreaming policy as a case study. Using quantitative comparative analysis (QCA) on data from 44 nations, I can identify three distinct pathways when studying the relationship between national culture and the diffusion of global gender mainstreaming policy. This innovative technique is particularly well-suited for symbolic measures. 
As the adage goes, “Yesterday is history. The future is a mystery. However, today is a gift.” Academics do acknowledge the significance of the present circumstances. Nevertheless, it is imperative to recognize the values of both historical and future-oriented principles. Hence, exploring the integration of path dependency, policy innovation, and diffusion is a valuable subject for researchers. Using GMM models, I have observed that fiscal transparency rankings, as opposed to specific fiscal transparency scores, play a more crucial role in deterring corruption in China. Furthermore, the previous fiscal transparency ranking had a significant influence on corruption in China.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Pursuing higher education in a foreign country entails numerous challenges and opportunities for development for international students. Social media allows individuals adapting to a new environment to connect, communicate, collaborate, network, and learn, overcoming geographical, temporal, linguistic, cultural, and social boundaries. In this study, I explored how international graduate students used social media to seek support for acculturation and academic integration, as well as their perceptions of the benefits and challenges of using social media for support-seeking. I employed a naturalistic multiple-case study design to investigate this phenomenon relating to international graduate students’ acculturation and academic integration with social media. I selected participants through snowball and purposeful sampling. The inclusion criteria included that students were in the same university, had finished their first year of study in their academic program, and used social media regularly for support-seeking. The primary inclusion criterion was that students had spent their first year of study in their educational program and used social media regularly for support-seeking. I balanced participant samples based on demographic backgrounds, including country of origin, field of study, and gender, to understand diverse students’ experiences.Participants were eleven international graduate students from seven countries studying in education, social science, humanities, and STEM programs, with an average age of 27. Data were collected through two semi-structured interviews via Zoom and ten participant-generated digital artifacts via Padlet from each participant depicting their use of social media for acculturation and academic integration. Data were transcribed, cleaned, and anonymized before data analysis. I adopted inductive and deductive thematic analysis, guided by Activity Systems Analysis (ASA), as the analytic framework for my data analysis. I used the qualitative data analysis software NVivo to facilitate data analysis.
The study findings revealed that international graduate participants’ primary objectives for using social media were to receive emotional and social support, manage daily and academic tasks, and integrate into their local and academic communities. Participants used a mix of home-country and U.S. social media platforms, with some employing a wide range of platforms and web services and others opting for a few selective ones. Participants purposefully tailored social media platforms to suit the groups of people they interacted with, the tasks they addressed, and their personal preferences and topics at hand. The advantages of using social media for support-seeking included affordability, convenience, vast access to information, and extended social and incidental learning opportunities. However, several tensions arose from negative experiences, such as emotional distress related to social media engagement, with some intensified by algorithms designed for mindless scrolling. Commonly reported tensions included digital distractions, compulsive use of social media, and mindless scrolling. Other tensions included varying information quality and limited access to different language information sources. Accordingly, implications for practice and future research were discussed, including implementing social media curricula to support students’ effective use of social media for personal and professional goals while adapting to their new cultural and educational environment. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Since the passing of NAGPRA legislation in 1990, the academic community has published extensively on the process of repatriation and its impacts on the field of anthropology and stakeholder communities. While systemic critiques of the legislation are widespread in anthropological advocacy and discourse, there remains a gap in the literature about the actual processes of repatriation and the application of NAGPRA regulations, particularly as they relate to collections that have become/remained split amongst various state entities, universities, museums, and federal holdings. Through a process of literature review, interviews, and case study, this project demonstrates the prevalence of split archaeological collections, investigates attitudes towards reconciliation, and offers procedural recommendations to assist in making the process more universally accessible.  </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Spanish-English speaking multilinguals (MLs) with Developmental Language Disorders (DLD) have greater difficulty with verb morphology compared to their typically developing peers. Patterns of error are observed in both monolinguals and MLs. However, there are more studies that have explored the effectiveness of grammar intervention targeting verb morphology for monolinguals compared to MLs. Moreover, there are even fewer studies that compare the effectiveness of implicit and explicit approaches used in grammar interventions. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine an adapted alternating treatment single case design (AATD) to compare the (1) effectiveness of implicit and explicit approaches used in grammar interventions that target the inflectional past tense –ED and third person singular –s (3S) and (2) efficiency of the implicit and explicit approaches for acquiring the past tense –ED and 3S. The study includes third-fifth grade Spanish-English speaking MLs with and without DLD. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>            This study explores tonal states in the music of Dmitri Shostakovich (1906–1975) by examining harmony and voice leading from a Schenkerian perspective. Chapter 1 examines Shostakovich’s realignment with socialist aesthetic ideologies in 1936, demonstrating how traditional idioms and forms in works written after the Pravda attacks enable a wider range of access points for tonal analysis. Methodologies derived from Russian theoretical thought such as modal lowering and modal derivation address surface relations; however, they do not make connections between local modal elements and large-scale tonal structure. Analyses by David Fanning and Sarah Marlowe demonstrate that while modal and chromatic behaviors are exhibited at foreground levels, these events represent post-tonal intensifications of customary idioms that unfold within broader tonal designs. Schenkerian processes of mixture and tonicization illustrate how Shostakovich’s modal-chromatic qualities can be contextualized within tonal frameworks.
	Building on the modal and tonal analytical models from Chapter 1, Chapter 2 investigates how selected passages from Shostakovich’s music articulate tonal structures in a variety of post-1936 works, including the second movement of String Quartet No. 9, the fourth movement of String Quartet No. 3, and Prelude Nos. 4, 13, and 22 from the Twenty-Four Preludes and Fugues, op. 87. Schenkerian theory contextualizes modal and chromatic inflections in String Quartet Nos. 3 and 9 within deeper levels of counterpoint and through the processes of simple, secondary, and double mixture. In Prelude Nos. 4, 13, and 22, Shostakovich’s emulation of Baroque contrapuntal techniques produces foreground and middleground structures that resonate with customary linear models in the Bach-to-Brahms tradition. Although static structures are generated in Prelude Nos. 4 and 22, prolongational techniques express their monotonal designs.
	Chapter 3 examines the tonal structure of the Passacaglia from Shostakovich’s Violin Concerto No. 1. At the middleground level, this movement produces a static bass line and an incomplete Urlinie (\hat{5}–\hat{4}–\hat{3}). The passacaglia rotations navigate tonal pathways through goal-oriented counterpoint, motivic confirmation of structural thirds, and local bass arpeggiations. The ground bass expands the tonic through surface-level arpeggiations, interior \hat{5}–\hat{1} motions, and the linear idiom 5–6–5 above the tonic pedal, producing a static harmonic state in the first half of the middleground. In the second half, the modulatory function of the cadenza is expressed as it transitions into the last movement, illustrating how chromatic voice leading bridges the F minor key area of the Passacaglia with A minor. Although Schenkerian theory does not accommodate modulations at the structural level, Chapter 3 introduces a model for contextualizing harmony and voice leading in Shostakovich’s attacca transitions.
	The second case study explores tonal expressions in the second movement of Symphony No. 12. Chapter 4 demonstrates how modal lowering and mixture generate chromatic elements in the second movement’s themes, motives, and secondary key areas. The modally lowered theme establishes a monotonal state through third motions, tonic arpeggiations, and 5–6–5 gestures. A linear framework for the second movement elucidates how its secondary key areas function as chromatic embellishments of standard contrapuntal procedures. A Schenkerian approach illustrates tonal closure within the obligatory register, producing a melodic structure that resonates with customary Urlinien.
	Lastly, Chapter 5 analyzes selected passages from Shostakovich’s “formalist” works in 1927–1936, including opera Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District, the first movement of Symphony No. 4 in C Minor, and Symphony No. 2. These works present challenges to Schenkerian methodologies in that they provide fewer access points for tonal orientations. Analysis of tonal structure and voice leading in these pieces is complicated by mutable passages that generate subsets of pitches that compete for centricity, counterpoint that lacks directed motion toward a tonal goal (non-functional counterpoint), and melodies with modal orientations that are less responsive to tonal methodology. The studies provide a foundation for tonal applications to Shostakovich’s music. Ultimately, the analyses demonstrate that many components of Shostakovich’s compositional process are addressed by a Schenkerian approach.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Mountain glaciers export ancient, energy-rich, and highly bioavailable dissolved organic matter (DOM) to freshwater and marine ecosystems, influencing downstream carbon cycling and supporting food webs. Despite its importance and the sensitivity of mountain glaciers to climate change, the sources of organic matter (OM) underpinning glacier DOM composition and its high bioavailability remain poorly constrained. To date, our understanding of the glacier carbon cycle has been formed from a handful of glaciers in a small number of regions (typically Greenland, Alaska, and the High Mountains of Asia), where geographically disparate studies have yielded different conclusions as to the dominant source of glacier OM. For example, studies in Greenland have suggested glacier DOM is predominately microbial in origin, whereas studies based in Alaska and Tibet postulate DOM to be primarily atmospheric deposition-derived. Implicitly, these studies indicate there may be regional and global heterogeneity in glacier DOM source and composition, which would have implications for understanding the fate of glacier-derived DOM and the age of carbon respired across glacier-fed ecosystems. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this dissertation combined analytical approaches (including molecular-level and carbon isotopic techniques) are used to assess glacier DOM composition across regional and global gradients. We highlight the glacier DOM pool as a distinct and dynamic carbon pool in the global carbon cycle, with significant diversity in DOM source and composition at both intra-regional and global scales. By analyzing global variability in composition across 136 glacier outflows covering six continents, we demonstrate glacier DOM is regionally distinct, where its composition is largely determined by the relative contribution of OM from in situ production and atmospheric deposition. We combine molecular-level, and bulk and compound-specific black carbon isotopic analyses, to show that anthropogenic deposition (i.e., fossil fuel combustion byproducts) has impacted glacier carbon cycling at the global scale. Nonetheless, in regions downwind of industrial centers (e.g., Alaska) the glacier OM pool is likely older and more stable in composition compared to remote regions (e.g., Ecuador), where glacier DOM is likely predominately derived from in situ production. In glaciers dominated by in situ production, the DOM exported to downstream and marine ecosystems is likely younger in radiocarbon age and relatively more aliphatic (i.e., energy-rich). Using novel respiratory carbon recovery system experiments for a subset of glacier outflows in southeast Alaska, we conclude this modern, in situ produced OM, may underpin the high bioavailability of the glacier dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pool. Thus, although globally glacier DOC is ancient and bioavailable, a modern pool of OM may underpin its high bioavailability. Together, these findings have wide ranging implications for how we contextualize the glacier carbon cycle and the role of glacier-derived DOC in downstream ecosystems. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this Dissertation in Practice was to explore the relationship between cultural intelligence and burnout in teachers. This purpose was rooted in a growing trend of teachers reporting a significant degree of burnout and education frequently being noted as one of the most stressful professions in the job market (Johnson et al., 2005; Saloviita &amp; Pakarinen, 2021). In particular, teachers who work with a culturally heterogeneous student body face challenges with linguistic, behavioral, and social differences which can result in work-related stress which, if unmanaged, leads to burnout (Dilg, 2003; Dubbeld et al., 2019; Gutentag et al., 2018). Since cultural intelligence is an indicator as to how successful a person will be navigating culturally diverse environments and has been related to outcomes associated with job performance and job satisfaction (Baluku et al., 2019), it is worth exploring whether a relationship exists between the four factors of cultural intelligence and the three factors of burnout.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This exploratory research study used a quantitative approach with a survey method. Research participants included 153 PK-12th grade teachers working at an international boarding school located in South Florida. Data collected was analyzed through the lens of three research questions:What level of cultural intelligence (CQ) and degree of burnout are reported by teachers working at an international school in the United States?
How do the levels of teacher CQ and degree of burnout differ by teachers’ demographic characteristics?
What are the relationships between the four factors of cultural intelligence and the three factors of burnout in teachers working at an international school in the United States?</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The data was analyzed using descriptive statistics, independent t-tests, and a series of multiple linear regression models. The results of the study are reported in two parts. First the descriptive statistics and results from the t-tests for the mean differences of each factor of CQ and each factor of burnout between demographic groups are reported. Second, multiple linear regression models were fitted, and the results of each model were addressed. All data analyses were conducted using SPSS. The results of the multiple linear regression analyses are especially important as this research found that teachers with high motivational cultural intelligence tend to report lower degrees of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization and higher degrees of personal accomplishment.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study expands the knowledge on cultural intelligence in educators by finding that Motivational CQ was the only factor statistically significantly related to all three factors of burnout. Moving forward, it is recommended that educational leaders focus on professional development aimed at increasing a teacher’s motivational cultural intelligence as this may lead to a decrease in their burnout. Two limitations of this study are the small sample size and the fact that all teachers work at the same school. Therefore, it is suggested that future research examines the relationship between cultural intelligence and burnout by surveying a larger sample size of teachers who work at multiple schools to allow for greater generalizability of the results.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this content analysis was to ascertain specific practices, demographics, and research formats used to teach or improve social skills in music therapy practice. A history of interdisciplinary research on social skills is presented, followed by an in-depth analysis of 181 journal articles published in the American Music Therapy Association (AMTA) journals. These publications were categorized by their degree of relevance to the practice of teaching social skills. Although a frequently assigned treatment goal and a topic of considerable interest, there remains disagreement among professionals on how to operationally define social skills. The results reflect this discrepancy but provide some useful recommendations on how to successfully treat social skills in music therapy practice with a variety of populations. The most common social skills addressed in music therapy practice were those of initiating verbal communication (49%) and self-regulation (19%). Interventions addressing social skills were implemented by board-certified music therapists typically to children and adolescents with developmental disabilities (31.8%) and mental health disorders (15.4%) using applications with musical instrument play (32%) and group singing (22.9%). Implications for future practice and research are discussed.  </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>In drug discovery, predicting protein-ligand binding structures and affinities is crucial for lead identification. Over the past decades, molecular dynamics simulation-based approaches have gained prominence in this endeavor. Despite some progress, achieving accurate and efficient protein-ligand binding prediction remains challenging. This doctoral dissertation addresses several challenges by focusing on understanding the molecular dynamics sampling bottleneck, developing an accurate isobaric-isothermal ensemble, and creating an automated program to streamline simulation workflow for large-scale lead identification.Enabling sufficient and robust sampling for quantitative protein-ligand binding prediction is challenging in molecular dynamics simulation. Motivated by specific viewpoints on existing sampling challenges, active developments were made largely in four categories: unguided free energy sampling methods, geometry-based free energy sampling methods, alchemical free energy sampling methods, and trajectory stratification approaches. We systematically analyzed these representative methods. In particular, we focus our discussion on essential features of these methods and derive our viewpoint that the orthogonal space sampling problem is the major bottleneck for all of the existing methods. Future areas of improvement that need to be explored was also expanded.  
The isobaric-isothermal (NPT) ensemble mimics conditions often encountered in chemical and biochemical experiments. Thus, its accuracy is important in obtaining correct biomolecular dynamics and thermodynamic properties in molecular dynamics simulations. We introduced “MTK-Langevin”, a novel NPT ensemble method meticulously optimized the critical components that significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, MTK-Langevin: 1) incorporated correction terms to the equations of motion for the desired NPT partition function, 2) used the Langevin piston algorithm for barostat thermalization to reduce mass-dependent ringing effects, 3) integrated the barostat using BAOAB scheme to ensure minimal error and high stability, and 4) optimized parameters for improved equilibration efficiency. Tests showed MTK-Langevin achieved accurate temperature and pressure control with fast equilibration. 
Alchemical free energy simulations entail intricate steps, making manual setup labor-intensive and error prone. Practical lead identification campaigns often require numerous calculations, rendering manual setup impractical. To address this, we developed “AutoAlchem” to automate the simulation workflow. AutoAlchem streamlines topology generation, system building, equilibration, GPU-accelerated production runs, and data analysis. Tested in lead optimization, it consistently delivers accurate and efficient setup. Key features of AutoAlchem include integration of enhanced sampling methods and active learning techniques, allowing for large-scale simulations with high recall rates while sampling only a subset of molecules. 
In summary, these studies highlighted the sampling bottleneck during protein ligand binding process and developed an NPT ensemble method and an automated workflow aimed at enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of protein ligand binding prediction.

            <DISS_para>This treatise is in two chapters, each based on a lecture recital I presented during my doctoral studies at Florida State University. While the topics are not specifically related to each other, both explore performance practices and compositional processes that are not typically considered part of the modern Western classical keyboard tradition. The first half concerns itself with historical keyboard improvisation. Variation sets by W.A. Mozart and C.P.E. Bach are examined for their relationship to improvised eighteenth-century performances and explored as potential learning resources for would-be improvisers. The second half is devoted to three piano pieces by the contemporary composers Gareth Farr, Reena Esmail, and Zhou Long. Each piece combines specific Asian classical traditions with Western composition. The cross-cultural elements present in each composition are analyzed and contextualized to aid performers, scholars, and listeners. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>From its inception, Joseph Smith Jr.’s Latter Day Saint Movement, and by consequence, many of the hymns that accompanied this religious tradition, have been preoccupied with place and geography. Looking to Latter Day Saint scripture, as well as Smith’s particular theologies of Millennialism, embodiment, and exaltation, this thesis contextualizes the descriptions of place within early Latter Day Saint hymns as both soundscapes and a dialogue with the movement’s own sacred geography. These hymns served as tools of sonic placemaking, imbuing the landscape with meaning for the Latter Day Saints as the main body of the movement migrated westward, from New York to Ohio, Missouri, Illinois, and finally as refugees to the Salt Lake Valley in the Great Basin area of the American West. As musical negotiations with the North American continent and the larger globe, these Latter Day Saint hymns enabled their writers and performers, European and Euro-American settlers and colonizers, to interact with their surroundings and create a sonic space for themselves in the New World. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Ultra high performance concrete (UHPC) is an advanced construction material for civil infrastructure development due to its supreme mechanical characteristics and distinct durability properties. There is a notable surge in the application of UHPC, particularly in highway infrastructures in the United States. The current dissertation addresses two critical challenges regarding the implementation of UHPC structures. The first part of the dissertation investigates the impact of fiber orientation and construction processes on the structural performance of UHPC. A comprehensive synthesis of existing literature and the UHPC structural design specifications and recommendations worldwide is conducted to understand how construction processes impact fiber orientation in UHPC elements and how this influence should be addressed in UHPC design. In the second part of the dissertation, sustainable UHPC materials are developed using a multi-scale and probabilistic design approach. A key challenge with UHPC is its high price and high environmental impact from carbon emissions associated with the use of manufactured steel fibers. This study explores the feasibility of using recycled steel fibers (RSF) derived from waste tires in UHPC production. The characteristics of RSF are comprehensively characterized, and their influence on the pullout behavior is determined through experimental and analytical methods. A multi-scale probabilistic framework is then employed to facilitate the design of UHPC composites incorporating RSF. The cost of UHPC production using MSF and RSF are calculated and compared where RSF based UHPC showed significantly lower production cost. The embodied carbon and embodied energy for these UHPCs are also calculated and again RSF based UHPCs showed more sustainability with significantly lower values for these parameters. In conclusion, the dissertation contributes to the sustainable development of UHPC structures by addressing key issues such as fiber orientation and utilizing recycled materials, ultimately enhancing the environmental and economic feasibility of UHPC applications in infrastructure construction.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Chapter 1 explores how shared micromobility impacts other transportation networks, specifically taxi markets in New York City. I exploit the spatial variation in the rollout of Citi Bike dock stations in a difference-in-differences research design. I find that Citi Bike and taxis are substitutes, with the average taxi market experiencing a 3.2% decline in trips each week. Heterogeneity analysis suggests that this effect is largely driven by rider substituting for relatively short trips. Two potential mechanisms are explored; direct substitution to Citi Bike and substituting from taxis to use Citi Bike and public transportation in tandem. I find evidence that both mechanisms generate the observed substitution pattern.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter 2 explores how transportation stations impact local crime. Most studies on the link between crime and transit stations focus on public transportation, however, there is limited evidence for other transportation alternatives, like micromobility. Using a spatial difference-in-differences research design, we provide evidence that bike share docking stations cause a significant increase in crime within 25 meters by leveraging data on Citi Bike and reported crime in New York City. Our results are robust across various estimators and counterfactuals, and we find heterogeneous effects depending on the type of crime and the time of day a crime was reported to have occurred. These findings provide insights into the external costs of micromobility, offering policymakers further information when considering its adoption as a transportation alternative.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter 3 investigates the impact of shared micromobility access on self-reported drunk driving using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey for Selected Metropolitan/Micropolitan Area Risk Trends. By exploiting the heterogeneous rollout of shared micromobility services in the metropolitan area in a difference-in-differences research design, I estimate a small but negative point estimate for the effect of micromobility access on self-reported drunk driving. Standard errors for the estimates are large, resulting in statistically insignificant results. Therefore, I remain agnostic in the interpretation of my results.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The built environment consists of various, diverse, and independent systems distributed across different organizational levels, such as team, project, regional, state, and national, creating a structured hierarchy. Interactions within and between these hierarchical levels, involving human participants, physical resources, and policies, are crucial for the functionality and efficiency of these systems. However, these interactions—physical, spatial, logical, and cyber in nature—can lead to unexpected 'emergent' properties or behaviors not anticipated in the original design of the systems.Emergence, a concept well-recognized in systems engineering, has not been fully integrated into research and practice related to the built environment. Scientific attempts to study processes in the built environment often adopt a reductionist perspective, treating the outcome of the built environment as the sum of its individual elements, thus simplifying and neglecting the complexity arising from continuous interactions among components. This simplification can overlook emergent behaviors that significantly influence planning and management across various areas, including construction productivity, safety, infrastructure planning, and operations, either positively or negatively. Considering the magnitude and nature of impact of any resultant emergent behavior on the holistic outcome of operations and processes in the built environment, it is crucial to acknowledge and account for emergence during planning and decision-making. This necessity becomes especially vital within the framework of resilience and sustainability planning, where achieving ambitious goals demands a holistic approach that transcends isolated entity planning.
To date, research exploring emergence within engineering contexts has been limited. Even among the limited engineering studies that recognize the potential impact of emergent behavior and its significance, formalized analysis approaches are lacking. Moreover, none of these studies have endeavored to regulate the interactions underlying emergent behavior in pursuit of more favorable outcomes. As such, the potential of incorporating the concept of emergence in built environment planning and decision-making, particularly within the realms of sustainability and resilience, remains largely untapped. This research seeks to fill this gap by developing a formalized framework for effective modeling, analysis, and control of emergent behavior. It begins with establishing a taxonomy of emergent behaviors, classifying them into four distinct types based on (a) nature of underlying interactions, (b) level of complexity, and (c) boundaries of information available. This taxonomy is then used as a foundation for a three-step framework – (i) classification, (ii) operationalization, and (iii) implementation – for the systematic modeling and analysis of the different types of emergence within construction and infrastructure engineering and management applications. This study demonstrates the efficacy of the developed framework in augmenting and guiding system- and operational level planning and decision-making within the contexts of infrastructure resilience and construction sustainability planning through two case studies.
The first case study examines the disparities in the resilience of municipal solid waste management systems (MSWMSs) during the COVID-19 pandemic stemming from their complex socio-technical interactions. Specifically, empirical investigation of the operation of MSWMSs during the course of the pandemic was conducted in order to investigate the variance in their adopted adaptation pathways as a function of their systems characteristic, particularly in terms of composition, topology, and control. Subsequently, these variances were used to explain the emerged resilience performance of MSWMSs, particularly with regards to (i) the resourcefulness of each system in establishing and implementing response measures and (ii) its rapidity in recovering and adapting to increasingly complex and dynamic conditions. Findings from this case study serve as a foundation for enhancing the resilience of MSWMSs to future pandemics and other disturbances.
The second case study investigates the improvements or reductions in the productivity of heavy equipment during demolition debris sorting operations stemming from their spatial interactions. Specifically, lab-based scaled models of demolition operations utilizing small-scale excavators were employed to monitor the variables impacting the underlying spatial interactions, particularly (i) the proximity between excavators and (ii) the orientation of excavators during operations. Statistical models were subsequently established to explain the resulting impact on the collective productivity based on these variables. The insights gained from this case study provide a basis for optimizing excavator allocation and spatial arrangement during material separation operations to maximize the recovery of recyclable demolition waste.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Following the Affordable Care Act (ACA), state governments have had the option to expand the eligibility of Medicaid programs since 2014. The expansion states increased the eligibility threshold to 138% of the federal poverty line, which allows more individuals to be covered by the program. In the first year, twenty-seven states, including the District of Columbia, decided to expand the program. However, several states hesitated to adopt the expansion, primarily due to concerns regarding the potential increase in fiscal burdens. Therefore, it is imperative to investigate whether Medicaid expansion significantly impacts state budgets thoroughly.	Furthermore, Medicaid expansion also affects hospitals and healthcare providers, as it leads to a decrease in the uninsured rate and expands coverage. Consequently, it is crucial to examine how expansion alters managerial conditions and decision-making processes within healthcare organizations.
	Moreover, given that the primary goal of Medicaid expansion is to improve access to care for low-income individuals, it is imperative to assess the policy outcomes in a more precise and comprehensive manner. This necessitates thorough evaluation and analysis to understand the extent to which Medicaid expansion achieves its intended objectives and addresses the healthcare needs of low-income populations effectively.
	In this regard, this dissertation aims to provide a more clear and comprehensive understanding of the impact of Medicaid expansion by investigating from the perspectives of state governments, hospitals, and low-income individuals. To assess whether the expansion imposes an excessive fiscal burden on the states that adopt the policy, I explore how the number of Medicaid enrollees, expenditures for the program, and overall state fiscal conditions respond to a sudden economic downturn and analyze whether states expanded the programs should bear more fiscal burden compared to states that have not adopted it.
	Also, I focus on the fact that nonprofit hospitals have been criticized for providing benefits to their communities at an insufficient level despite enjoying enormous amounts of savings due to their tax-exemption status. Employing the principal-agent theory to understand the decision-making mechanisms underlying this behavior, I investigated whether Medicaid expansion mitigates this agency problem. Moreover, to offer a more comprehensive evaluation of Medicaid expansion's impact on access to care, I analyze whether the benefits of the policy are distributed differently among individuals depending on the presence of accessibility barriers.
The findings of my study indicate that the Medicaid expansion would not significantly increase the fiscal burden for the states while allowing many people to stay insured during economic recessions. Also, the expansion affects the managerial conditions of nonprofit hospitals by decreasing their costs of uncompensated care. Despite this saving, hospitals are found not to change their behavior and to keep their scrutiny in providing financial assistance to their patients. In addition, my finding shows that Medicaid expansion relieves the financial burden of healthcare for low-income people, but the benefits are not universal to them. When individuals have low accessibility to their healthcare providers, they still have limited access to care even though they have have same health conditions and income levels. That is, there exists a disparity in the benefits from Medicaid expansion among the low-income groups.
With these findings, I contribute to the relevant literature by offering a deeper understanding of the impact of Medicaid expansion, both theoretically and empirically. By exploring the nuances of Medicaid expansion's effects on state budgets, healthcare organizations, and access to care, my research provides valuable insights into the multifaceted implications of this policy.
Furthermore, I offer practical implications for policymakers to understand the true costs of Medicaid expansion better and identify areas for policy refinement to enhance access to care effectively. By highlighting the potential challenges and opportunities associated with Medicaid expansion, policymakers can make informed decisions to optimize the policy's effectiveness and ensure equitable access to healthcare for all individuals.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Shipboard power systems (SPS) are increasing their reliance on communication systems. Communication enables system-level controls to coordinate the usage of the SPS and provide significant improvements (e.g., size, weight, cost). Communication is commonly divided into layers (application, presentation, session, transport, network, data link, physical). While the lower layers have not had significant changes, the application layer is constantly in flux. New protocols are often introduced, providing new capabilities to facilitate communication.Real-time simulation (RTS) is a tool that has been effectively utilized to study SPSs. Many models and techniques exist. Similarly, the simulation of computer networks exists. However, leveraging these Real-time simulation tools/facilities for evaluating protocols has received little attention. Currently, a co-simulation environment of the SPS electrical system and its computer network provides a way to evaluate the operation of SPS models and assess their capabilities. Protocols are typically defined in the communication system. Yet not much is known about the potential impact of these protocols.
This work proposes a framework to evaluate application layer communication protocols in the communication system of system-level SPS controls using RTS. The framework’s effectiveness was demonstrated by analyzing Modbus TCP and Data Distribution Service (DDS). The network utilization metric was used to compare and contrast the protocols.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Romantic love and intimacy are critical for emerging adults to explore self-identity. Relationship efficacy is a cognitive process related to conflict management that plays an important role in romantic relationship development and quality. Overparenting, characterized by high control and involvement, could undermine the development of emerging adults. Despite the potential negative impact of overparenting, the association between overparenting and relationship efficacy remains unexplored. Furthermore, differences related to norms in romantic relationship development and parenting practices across cultures should be considered, particularly between individualistic societies in the U.S. and collectivist societies in Asia. Using a person-centered approach, this study aimed to investigate the associations between profiles of overparenting and relationship efficacy in the U.S. and Hong Kong. Additionally, the potential moderation by individual-level cultural beliefs was explored to investigate whether these associations vary by horizontal individualism, vertical individualism, horizontal collectivism, or vertical collectivism. Data were collected from 235 American and 303 Hong Kong Chinese emerging adults who were currently in a romantic relationship. Overparenting was assessed across academic, financial, relational, health domains. Results from latent profile analysis (LPA) revealed three profiles in the U.S sample and two profiles in the Hong Kong sample. Regression analyses indicated that an "overall high overparenting" profile was associated with the lowest level of relationship efficacy in both samples. A distinct “overall medium overparenting, but high in financial and low in relational overparenting” profile emerged in the U.S. sample which was related to the most optimal relationship efficacy among American emerging adults. Additionally, moderating effects by individual cultural beliefs suggested that, in the U.S. sample, individuals with higher vertical individualism beliefs were found to be more susceptible to the negative impact of "overall high overparenting" on relationship efficacy compared to those who experienced “overall low overparenting.” Implications, future directions, and limitations were further discussed. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are a pivotal component of highly successful modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT. FPGA’s capabilities of parallelism and efficiency provide an opportunity to provide quicker computation of ANNs than both CPUs or GPUs, whilst consuming much less power in both in data center and edge computing environments. A custom instruction component for the Nios II soft processor and supporting software were developed to allow easy, configurable generation and deployment of high-performance ANN inference on FPGA devices. The custom instruction performs integer matrix-vector multiplications, with each column of the product computed in parallel with pipelined multiply accumulate units. Nios II embedded computer systems were created both with and without the generated custom instruction. FPGA device resource utilization and execution time were evaluated for each system when performing ANN-based image classification on the MNIST handwritten digit database. Speedups of over 300x were achieved when using the custom instruction, at the expense of higher FPGA resource utilization.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Repeated evolution in biology is widespread among morphologic forms but also recognized at essentially all biological levels. Organisms achieving the same functional goal is reported at the level of simple biochemical pathways, complex tissue types, and even social behaviors. Before the advent of the sequencing revolution, studies of repeated evolution centered on morphologic data. With the power of current DNA technologies researchers are increasingly focusing on understanding how repeated forms at the phenotypic level arise at the genetic level. Most of the trait’s biologists’ study are likely continuous and polygenic in nature. Additionally, within diploid sexual organisms, these traits often could exist within populations which consist predominantly of standing genetic variation, opening the door for drift to create genetic variance dictated by history and not fitness. To investigate genetic repeatability from standing genetic variation and retain a possible insight into macroevolutionary outcomes I designed an experiment using two recently diverged species of Drosophila. To create a parallel phenotypic response, we designed a parallel divergent artificial selection experiment in D. melanogaster and D. simulans predominantly selecting on a multi-trait index of proportional length of the three major leg segments. We complimented the phenotypic experiment with population-based whole genome DNA sequencing of individuals from the initial populations and the evolved populations artificially selected for fifteen generations. An experimental design resulting in low estimates of Ne and concurrently strong selection yielded a complicated and idiosyncratic genetic response even within replicates of a species. Evolve and Resequence and convergent evolution experimental designs and null hypotheses often use an expectation that repeated genetics underlies repeated phenotypes. We suggest more skepticism that repeated phenotypes might not be the product of parallel genetic responses for complex quantitative traits..</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study explores the role of social media in addressing educational inequity, focusing on prospective first-generation students’ college exploration. The study answers two questions: (1) how do prospective first-generation students describe their social media usage related to college? (2) how do prospective first-generation students describe the role of social media in their college choice system? To achieve this goal, I employed interviews and social media diaries. Eleven high school seniors whose parents did not complete a 4-year college/university participated in the study. Social media diaries were adopted to capture participants’ daily social media usage related to college. Interviews were conducted to delve into their lived experiences in detail. I analyzed the collected data using reflexive thematic analysis. 
For the first research question, I examined specific platforms participants utilize: Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Facebook, Reddit, Discord, GroupMe, and Twitter. Among them, a subreddit r/A2C (Apply to College), the only niche social media site specifically designed for college information, was used by only one participant, implying the crucial role of a knowledgeable friend. The general pattern of network engagement showed that participants remained within their existing networks rather than forming new connections via social media. Participants explored diverse topics related to college, encompassing majors, options, applications, scholarships, and transitions.
For the second research question, the findings revealed that participants were exposed to college information daily. Under the overall influence of social media, however, three contradictory subthemes were identified: vicarious experience vs. not your experience, thought-provoking vs. not leading to actions, and inspiring vs. distressing. The contradictory themes indicate the complex roles of social media in addressing educational inequity.
The findings showed that social media plays a beneficial role in prospective first-generation students’ college choice system, albeit with enduring boundaries and constraints. Such complex realities indicate that participants’ digital experiences are not transcending the boundaries existing in their non-digital world but rather are deeply intertwined with them, underscoring the existing structural inequities that marginalized teens are faced with. The study suggests implications for research and practice to provide better support for prospective first-generation students’ postsecondary educational opportunities. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This paper introduces the concept of longstanding anger and seeks to address the thought that maintaining anger indefinitely is corruptive to the character of the agent and destructive to relationships.  It denies that anger is inherently harmful and argues that it plays a significant role in the moral landscape as a method of ‘valuing the valuable’ that cannot be replicated through forgiveness.  The paper argues that forgiveness is not morally superior to anger, and our reasons for condemning anger often have to do with discomfort surrounding the presence of discord, rather than anger being unfitting.  Anger is explored within its role as a social emotion as conditions are set out for how and when anger can reasonably be maintained indefinitely, showing how it can fittingly not diminish, even upon the death of the wrongdoer.  The paper suggests that longstanding anger arises from circumstances when an unrepentant wrongdoer maintains their commitment to the wrong and can be resolved either by the wrongdoer or through recognition of the wrong by the greater social community.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>ABSTRACT</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES, 2022) reported that White faculty members constituted 74% of the total number of faculty, while racial and ethnically minoritized groups, including Black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, and Native Americans, collectively comprised less than one-fourth of faculty members. Comparatively, a decade ago, NCES, (2013) illustrated similar trends, with only 21% of racially minoritized faculty showcasing negligible progress over the past 10 years. This underrepresentation extends beyond specific disciplines, suggesting a systemic issue prevalent across academia, especially in allied healthcare programs. According to Salsberg et al. (2021) study of 10 healthcare professions, there is a notable underrepresentation of Black, Hispanic, and Native Americans compared to their respective proportions in the population. The allied healthcare programs in this study include Cardiovascular Technologist, Emergency Medical Service, Diagnostic Medical Sonography, Radiographer, Occupational Therapist Assistant, and Respiratory Care. 
This abstract qualitative exploratory study aimed at to examine racial minority faculty experiences and perceptions of difficulties and success within allied healthcare full-time faculty in colleges serving the rural areas of Florida. Understanding the challenges faced by racially and ethnically minoritized faculty members is critical for addressing the persistent underrepresentation in allied healthcare fields (Abdul-Raheem, 2016; Allen &amp; Garg, 2016; Kaplan et al., 2018) by identifying the challenges of underrepresentation, and effective interventions to enhance racially minoritized healthcare faculty recruitment and retention. Addressing this shortage is pivotal for fostering diversity among faculty, improving graduation outcomes for diverse allied healthcare students, enhancing cultural competence within the healthcare workforce, and ameliorating healthcare disparities in underserved rural communities.
By shedding light on biases, microaggressions, and skepticism regarding qualifications, the findings from this research underscore the pervasive nature of bias within academic environments. Consequently, academia faces an urgent imperative to confront these disparities and cultivate inclusive climates where all faculty members are valued for their scholarly contributions. Initiatives focusing on mentorship, professional development, and supportive leadership emerge as pivotal pathways to empower minoritized faculty to navigate and surmount prevailing obstacles. Addressing systemic barriers and fostering diversity, equity, and inclusion are crucial for enabling all faculty members, irrespective of background, to thrive and contribute effectively to academia and healthcare (Nair &amp; Adetayo, 2019; Poole &amp; Brownlee, 2020; Ratledge, 2020)
The implication of this study for allied healthcare is the key necessity to recruit and retain a minoritized allied healthcare faculty by promoting mentorship and a supportive network for professional development. Overcoming system biases are critical to dismantling barriers faced by a minoritized faculty member, promoting their success, and enriching the cultural variety of healthcare education and profession. Moreover, the implications of this study extend beyond academia to inform broader societal conversations about systemic racism, discrimination, and social justice. The study contributes to ongoing efforts to address disparities in various sectors, including student experiences, institutional leadership dynamics, policy frameworks, and diversity and inclusion endeavors. Effective interventions necessitate decisive leadership action bolstered by robust policy frameworks to improve healthcare disparities in resource allocation and promote equitable support structures for all faculty. Mitigating stereotypes, biases, and resource disparities while fostering supportive leadership and mentorship is crucial for creating an environment where all faculty members feel valued, supported, and empowered to succeed (Luster-Edward &amp; Martin, 2018; Llama et al., 2019; Kelly et al., 2017; Kelly &amp; McCann, 2014).
The study's findings supported recommendations needed for further research to advance knowledge about the experiences of minoritized faculty within academia and inform evidence-based interventions to mitigate disparities and promote a sense of belonging, intentional support, and welcome. Acknowledging and addressing the challenges faced by racially and ethnically minoritized allied healthcare faculty is crucial for institutions to fulfill their mandate of providing equitable opportunities for scholarly engagement and professional advancement. Pursuing these research avenues is essential for realizing academia's standard as an inclusive and intellectually vibrant community fostering the holistic development of all academic members in higher education.
	The exploratory study revealed support recommendations for practice to advocate for racially and ethnically minoritized full-time faculty members. The combination of proactive leadership for an engaging support system, cultural awareness training, and professional training to identify and navigate bias for all employees, and an intentional mentorship program to encourage collaboration and a supportive network is essential for minoritized healthcare faculty members to succeed. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>ABSTRACT</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In modernist and contemporary art history, abstract art has long been associated with issues surrounding autonomy and breaks with figurative art. Scholarship surrounding the development of abstract art in Brazil has tended to focus on those connections in addition to its receptions by local art critics Ferreira Gullar and Mário Pedrosa and trajectories of European movements in abstract art, namely De Stijl, neoplasticism, and concrete art. While these readings have recognized important lineages for abstraction contextualized within the visual arts, the intersection between abstraction in Brazil and architecture remains understudied in comparison. I examine the work of Brazilian postwar and contemporary artist Lygia Clark (1920–1988) to show how her work is just at home in fields of painting and sculpture as it is in disciplines of architecture and design. By forging these connections outside of the visual arts, Brazilian abstract art in the postwar period became a political cultural tool of modern architecture and space, as well as an outlet for civilians to contribute to Brazil’s status as a growing modern nation by constructing modernist spaces. Through formal and social art historical analysis of the work of Lygia Clark, this dissertation revises histories of abstraction in postwar Brazilian art to better account for understudied contexts of architecture, public space, and the built environment. Clark is best known for her interactive geometric Bicho (Critter; 1960–1966) sculptures and association with the neoconcrete group (1959–1961), the Brazilian artistic avant-garde recognized for its participatory artwork. Much like the histories of abstract art to which she belonged, namely concrete and neoconcrete art, her contributions are often tied to painting and sculpture, despite her career-long engagement with architecture. In response to this historiographic problem, this dissertation addresses Clark’s sustained work in and engagement of architecture such as her little-known works, including her ink drawing of a street scene from 1948 and a mural mosaic from 1951, still extant in Rio. Examination of her training and collaboration with landscape designers and architects reveals her synthetic approach to the arts, which facilitates new debates about integrative approaches to the arts that tend to focus on De Stijl and the Bauhaus.
Chapter Two, “Staircases, Interiors, and Studies of Space: The Early Works, 1948–1953,” focuses on the earliest and often overlooked stage of Clark’s career—where her architectural engagement began—prior to her affiliation with concretism with the Grupo Frente in the mid-1950s. Chapter Three, “Clark’s Models of Houses and Architectural Interiors: Displays of Modernist Living,” provides the first in-depth study of Clark’s small-scale models of homes from 1955 to 1964, of which she made six. This chapter argues that Clark re-envisioned neoconcrete art—a form of abstract art—as manipulatable architectural models that engaged with local and global trends of architecture and provided opportunities for viewers to construct home layouts. Chapter Four, “’Walking Along:’ Path-Making as Spatial and Subversive Interventions,” analyzes Clark’s sculptural action and abstract sculptures in politicized contexts of Brazil. Fostering interventionist spatial imaginaries, Caminhando (Walking; 1963), and Trepante (Climber; 1965), and Trepante e caixa (Climber and Box; 1964), use “the winding path” as a strategy to subvert authority by questioning spatial and architectural boundaries of the built environment. Chapter Five, “Clark’s Articulation of Architectural and Environmental Imaginaries,” examines the sculptural objects, entitled Caixas de fósforos (Matchboxes, 1964) and Arquitetura fantástica bichos (Fantastic Architecture Critters; 1963), the installation, entitled A casa é o corpo: penetração, ovulação, germinação, expulsão (The House is the Body: Penetration, Ovulation, Germination, Expulsion; 1968), and propositions, entitled Arquitetura Biológica II (Biologic Architecture II; 1969) and Estruturas vivas (Live Structures; 1969) as case studies. As articulations of anti-authoritarian architectural and environmental imaginaries in varying degrees, these sculptural objects, installations, and propositions demonstrate how space and structure provided outlets to challenge authority and question the possibilities of architecture, while also intensifying environments and feelings associated with political repression under Brazil’s military dictatorship. 
Using formal and social art historical analysis, supported by extensive archival
and field research conducted in Brazil, Argentina, England, and the United States, this dissertation addresses existing gaps between visual art and architecture in the field of art history, particularly in histories of abstract art. Rather than situating Clark’s work mainly in relation to histories of neoconcrete art and its broader legacies of painting and sculpture, I have instead mapped out a new trajectory for her practice based on architecture and urbanism as politicized sites of modernism in and out of Brazil in the postwar decades. In doing so, this project also formulates a new term in relation to Clark, the “artist-architect,” a helpful designation for artists who straddle the line between the visual arts and the built environment. This term can encourage global intersections across potentially disparate areas and periods. Analyzing works of “artist-architects” across media can also present experimental grounds for transgressive practices of resistance and self-expression. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This dissertation explores theoretical mechanisms associated with the adoption and implementation of policy instruments. The first paper addresses the impact of past policy choices on the adoption of vaping policy instruments in the United States, specifically investigating how states with strong anti-smoking policies are more likely to adopt vaping control policy instruments. This suggests that compatibility with past policies plays a key role in the adoption of policy tools. On the other hand, the second and third papers focus on the effectiveness of policy instruments in the context of citizen participation. They examine how citizen participation affects government efficiency and responsiveness, and how participation costs influence the level of citizen involvement, respectively. These three studies make an important contribution to theories of policy instruments, particularly in understanding the adoption and implementation of policy tools, and their impact on the policy process and citizen engagement.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Research on Task Based Language Teaching (TBLT), and learning has developed significantly in recent years. As a result of the popularity of TBLT, numerous studies in second language acquisition (SLA) have explored the effect of task repetition on L2 performance. However, while previous task repetition studies mainly focused on the effects of repeating the same task on the complexity, accuracy, and fluency (CAF) of oral language production, limited research has examined the influence of different types of task repetition on learners’ written production. Moreover, although written corrective feedback has been extensively investigated in SLA, the synergy effect between task repetition and written corrective feedback in shaping the quality of individual writing task output has not received adequate attention. Notably, no study has yet compared the influence of two types of task repetition (identical repetition and procedural repetition), by providing two distinct types of feedback—direct feedback and metalinguistic feedback, on written production for upper-intermediate adult EFL learners. To address this research gap, the current study investigated the effect of task repetition and   two types of feedback on the accuracy of students’ written task performance. Additionally, recognizing the growing importance of individual differences (ID) in SLA, this study investigated the role of individual differences constructs such as working memory capacity, L2 writing anxiety, and L2 writing motivation on L2 learners' written production. Additionally, the level of motivation and anxiety to complete learning tasks was identified as another important factor contributing to individual variation (Kormos &amp; Wilby, 2019). Task motivation is a complex construct influenced by various contingencies associated with multiple actional contexts, making it more intricate than a simple composite of general and state motivation (Dornyei, 2002, 2005). Therefore, beyond general L2 writing motivation and L2 anxiety, the study also examined task-specific anxiety and motivation, which are transitory, to determine whether their levels change over time during task performance. Eighty adult Korean EFL learners participated in four intact classes randomly assigned to four treatment groups: identical repetition + direct feedback, identical repetition + metalinguistic feedback, procedural repetition + direct feedback, and procedural repetition + metalinguistic feedback. A pretest and posttest were employed. The two identical repetition groups repeated the same writing procedure with the same picture description, while two procedural repetition groups repeated the same writing procedure with different picture descriptions. Two types of feedback (direct and metalinguistic) were provided for each task repetition condition. To measure learners’ writing development, overall accuracy and accuracy on three target structures (past tense, articles, and prepositions) were assessed. L2 writing motivation and L2 writing anxiety were measured before the treatment sessions began to explore learners’ general orientation of motivation and anxiety toward L2 writing learning. However, task motivation and task anxiety were measured after they performed writing tasks each week as outcome measurers to observe their patterns. Questionnaires were used for all these four constructs, Lastly, a reading span test (RSPAN) was used for the working memory test. Results from ANCOVA indicated that the procedural task repetition groups significantly outperformed the two identical task repetition groups in overall accuracy and past tense accuracy. Regarding the role of individual differences in working memory, motivation, and anxiety, multiple regressions revealed distinct results based on treatments under each group. For both procedural task repetitions, anxiety was a positive predictor, while working memory was a negative predictor. In contrast to the two procedural task repetitions, anxiety was a negative predictor for both identical task repetition groups. Lastly, two-way repeated measure ANOVA results showed distinct motivational patterns after writing between the two task repetition groups. The two procedural task repetition groups increased their motivation, whereas the two identical task repetition groups decreased task motivation over time. Nevertheless, repeating either content or procedures appeared to alleviate learners’ task-specific anxiety in writing tasks. The findings further our understanding of the language learners’ perceived motivational and emotional factors influenced by task implementation and instructional strategies in the language learning context. These findings provide valuable insights into L2 pedagogy.

            <DISS_para>This treatise offers a diverse approach to practicing with Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs). For many musicians, DAWs are indispensable tools for recording professional projects. Many resources within DAWs allow the musician to discern fluctuations through a detailed analysis, as discussed in this treatise. The pieces chosen to be practiced and examined with the integration of DAWs include three solo pieces for trumpet and piano and three orchestral pieces.  Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) are software applications designed to produce, modify, and capture audio files. They serve different purposes, such as professional music productions and personal projects. The applications offer a diverse approach to assessing a musician’s performance by analyzing their audio using a range of effects integrated into the software. When producing a high-quality recording using DAWs, one can uncover aspects of trumpet playing that would otherwise go unnoticed during a practice session.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This illustrative case study investigates teachers’ formative written responses to students’ writing, and how those responses could be inventive for students’ future composing practices. It engages with the concept of “invention” from a rhetoric/composition standpoint in order to ask: To what extent do different formative written responses on student writing function inventively? What are students’ perceptions of instructors’ written responses on their papers? How can these written responses prompt students to respond inventively in future writing and revisions? There is a general lack of writing assessment or response literature engaging explicitly with invention, even though much of it touches on relevant invention-related concepts, like “topoi” or “heuristic” (Connors, Lunsford 209; Melzer).  This research critically considers that literature and makes a case for inventive response, because students’ generativity in their writing could be compatible with the growth-oriented characteristics of formative feedback. The study uses existing scholarship alongside the research questions to inductively analyze three document-based, semi-structured interviews with student writers at Florida State University. Through answering narrative inquiry-based and descriptive questions, the interviewees indicated generativity in response by perceiving teachers’ feedback as conversational, interpretive, and contextually-influenced. Further, the interviews compellingly implied that positive and question-based teacher comments led students to invent new writing ideas, new writing strategies, and new writing confidence. Based on these findings, the study concludes by pointing to connections for future research, and by providing practical suggestions for teachers to implement more inventive response.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This dissertation discusses hybrid venture firm performance. The predictors include the complementary and competitive institutional logics of social impact accelerators (SIAs) and hybrid ventures, as well as country-level institutional indicators and founder human capital. In Essay 1, I argue that SIA logics shape hybrid ventures’ performance in different ways and that these effects are moderated by both firm logics and founder human capital. In Essay 2, I argue that the effects of the SIA logics not only differ, but also depend on aspects of the institutional environment, specifically the level of managerial discretion and social assistance in countries. Together, the results suggest that the effects of participating in SIAs are contingent upon the institutional-, SIA-, firm-, and entrepreneurial-level characteristics.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Intermolecular interactions of metal-oxide bound molecules can have a substantial impact on the electrochemical and photophysical processes of molecules and their subsequent performances as catalysts, sensors, or electron injectors in solar energy conversion. Inherent to the metal oxide-organic molecule interface is the close proximity of molecules, which can facilitate interactions and processes including aggregation, triplet-triplet annihilation, excimer formation, singlet fission, dimerization, and more. These processes can be either advantageous or disadvantageous for a given application, which makes the intentional formation or inhibition of such interactions critical. We have made efforts to understand the role of post-loading atomic layer deposition (ALD) on ZrO2-bound molecules, in which the precursor for an inert metal oxide (Al2O3) reacts with the ZrO2 surface. Both decreased surface loading density of molecules and an increasing number of ALD overlayers resulted in a decrease in excimer formation. However, photoluminescent and femtosecond transient absorption measurements were still dominated by excimer features. These results suggest that ALD may provide a post-surface loading means of influencing such intermolecular interactions. Instead of reacting solely with the ZrO¬¬2 surface, our current research investigates the effects of ALD directly reacting with functionalized, metal-oxide bound molecules.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Gideon Rosen famously defends a novel skeptical conclusion about moral responsibility, arguing that we are never warranted in confidently judging that any particular someone X is morally blameworthy for some particular action A. Alternative accounts might seem preferable to Rosen’s, at least on the grounds that they are more consistent with our current blaming practices. However, Rosen’s opponents tend to avoid his conclusion by advocating what Alvarez and Littlejohn call the “asymmetry thesis,” essentially the thesis that non-normative ignorance is excused in a different way than moral ignorance. In doing so, they reject a crucial premise in Rosen’s argument. I argue that one needn’t give up what I will call Rosen’s “symmetry thesis” in order to avoid his ultimate conclusion. I first motivate a reason for wanting to preserve symmetry by detailing an objection to symmetry-denying quality-of-will views. I then attack the final premise in Rosen’s skeptical argument, essentially relying on plausible assumptions about standards of justification and the general commonplace of akratic action.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The adoption of quantum computing presents a considerable risk to the security of traditionalcryptographic methods, including those used in current blockchain technologies. Quantum algo-
rithms, especially Shor’s and Grover’s, can efficiently solve problems that classical cryptographic
algorithms rely on for security, rendering them vulnerable to attacks. This thesis explores the
creation of quantum-resistant blockchain platforms to address this critical issue.
The research begins with a comprehensive study of the prevailing blockchain infrastructure
and the potential vulnerabilities posed by quantum computing, with a particular focus on con-
sensus algorithms and cryptographic primitives. Various post-quantum cryptographic approaches,
including lattice-based cryptography and quantum-safe digital signatures, are investigated for their
suitability in securing blockchain systems against quantum threats.
The thesis presents an original contribution in the form of a novel quantum-safe blockchain
protocol that utilizes advanced cryptographic techniques to provide robust security in the quantum
era. The proposed protocol is rigorously analyzed and evaluated for its effectiveness in various
applications, including cryptocurrency, healthcare, tokenization and real world assets.
The findings of this research underscore the urgent need for transitioning to quantum-resistant
blockchain systems. The thesis offers a practical framework and guidelines for designing and im-
plementing secure quantum-resistant blockchain architectures, taking into account the challenges
and considerations involved in such a transition.
By addressing the imminent threat of quantum computing to blockchain security, this research
aims to forge resilient and forward-looking blockchain systems. The outcomes of this thesis have sig-
nificant implications for ensuring the continued viability, security, and trustworthiness of blockchain
technology against the advancements in quantum computing.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Community colleges are institutions that provide access to higher education to anyone with a high school diploma or GED (Kim &amp; Dolan, 2015). The student body is highly diverse and may not be prepared for academic coursework (Cohen et al., 2014). These challenges may be supplemented through embedding services directly into college courses. The focus of this study is specifically on embedding librarians in undergraduate courses that have a research component. For students that have been out of school for a while, or just struggled with research while in high school, an embedded librarian might be a resource that aids in student success.	In order to understand what motivates a faculty member to embed, or not embed, a librarian in their courses, I conducted an exploratory qualitative case study at a single institution in the southeastern United States. Interviews were conducted with nine full-time faculty members from this institution. They reflected a variety of campuses, departments, and faculty static levels. I then utilized In Vivo coding for first cycle coding and focused coding for second cycle coding.
	As a result of the study, I found some common understanding of roles and tasks that embedded librarians can have in college courses; however, I also discovered some underlying emotional reactions to embedding that ranged from excitement to worry. It seems that there is some room for development when explaining what embedded librarians should do, and what embedded librarians should not do. Much of this knowledge comes about through relationships development, and ongoing communication, between the embedded librarian and the faculty member.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The U.S. regularly incarcerates its residents, where time spent behind bars is overwhelmingly negative (Massoglia, 2008a; Rose &amp; Clear, 1998). But not all persons have an equal chance of incarceration. State and federal policies target ethnically heterogenous neighborhoods in ways that lead to residents’ disparate surveillance, arrest, and incarceration, even while research demonstrates that such policies are damaging (Menjívar &amp; Abrego, 2012; Peterson &amp; Krivo, 2010). Contrary to traditional criminological theory, evidence suggests that cultural diversity may work to keep individuals and their communities safer (Wright &amp; Rodriguez, 2014). Indeed, an immigrant paradox has been found, where immigrants are less likely to commit violence, use substances, or offend, though they are more often exposed to criminogenic environments (Salas-Wright et al., 2016).Criminological literature takes this protective effect of diversity for granted, neglecting to unpack the immigrant paradox. It is unknown whether the immigrant paradox extends to prison—where foreign-born persons are less likely to exhibit mental health crises or engage in misconduct—or if incarceration will undo their resilience. Yet effective correctional policy must be sensitive to the diversity of those incarcerated.
Guided by theory and research on the immigrant paradox, prison misconduct, and mental health behind bars, the goal of this study is to examine whether incarcerated native- and foreign-born persons vary in the number and kinds of misconducts they engage in and/or mental health crises they experience. Further, this dissertation examines whether relationships vary by sources of heterogeneity within the immigrant group, including sending country, race, and detainer status. To solve these research puzzles, this study asks three primary research questions. First, do incarcerated immigrants differ from non-immigrants in their involvement in prison misconduct? Second, do incarcerated immigrants differ from non-immigrants in their likelihood of experiencing an in-prison mental health crisis? Third, and finally, do incarcerated immigrants who are subject to deportation differ from those who are not in their involvement in prison misconduct or experience of a mental health crisis?
Data from administrative records on the full population of incarcerated adults housed in a state prison in the western U.S. between 2010 and 2020 (N=58,289) are used. Over 13% (N=7,697) of individuals come from over 120 different countries, not including the U.S. or its territories. Data trace all administrative details of individuals’ in-prison experiences from intake to release. This rich information, coupled with the growing diversity of this western state, render this system ideal for advancing theory and research on the bounds of the immigrant paradox.
Analyses find support for an in-prison immigrant paradox, but they further reveal that the effect of immigrant status varies by race. That is, incarcerated immigrants are expected to engage in fewer counts and types of misconduct than their non-immigrant counterparts and are less likely to experience in-prison mental health crises. But patterns differ for property misconduct and are not uniform across racially diverse individuals. Instead, the immigrant paradox is pronounced among Latinx persons, where these individuals are less likely to engage in most types of prison infractions and have lower odds of mental health crises compared to those of other races. Alternatively, White immigrants more often experience mental health crises behind bars relative to immigrants of color. These differences signify that the protective factors that drive the immigrant paradox may not be readily available to all foreign-born persons, that diverse persons present with diverse in-prison needs, and that prior experience with hardship may be one reason that immigrants are resilient to adversity.
Finally, incarcerated immigrants who face deportation only slightly differ from those who do not in their involvement in misconduct or their experience of mental health crises. While immigrants with detainers were less likely to engage in drug misconduct or experience in-prison mental health crises than those without, findings did not significantly differ by detainer status for overall misconduct or any other infraction type. As such, incarcerated immigrants may already anticipate deportation, and certain characteristics about immigrants who receive detainers may matter more than the threat of deportation itself. Yet further investigation of the effect of deportation is needed.
Broadly, the substantive effect of the immigrant paradox is diminished in a prison setting and is conditioned by heterogeneous statuses of immigrants, but it is not erased. Treating immigrants harshly for fear that they pose a dangerous criminal threat is unfounded and is only successful in perpetuating legal violence against them. While additional work is needed to further unpack the immigrant paradox in incarcerated settings, we must be mindful of clumsy, overly punitive social policies that harm foreign-born populations.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The field of plasmonics as a whole is gathering widespread interest due to their wide range of applications and new technology advancements because of their enhancement of light-matter interactions. Although scientists have largely used noble metals plasmonic metals such as gold, silver, or aluminum, the growing field of plasmonic semiconductor nanocrystals (PSNCs) still require extensive research towards how the semiconducting electronic structure impacts relevant properties such as charge carrier mobility, conductivity, and near field enhancement. This work focuses on how the host nanocrystal density of states directly impacts and modifies the plasmonic properties of interest in both the static and ultrafast transient time regimes. Chapter 1 introduces the concept of plasmons starting from the simple harmonic oscillator model leading to the free electron model's critical relationship for plasmon frequency, carrier density, and carrier effective mass. From there, the concept of band theory is introduced, and the interactions of charge carrier quasiparticles with the semiconducting electronic structure are outlined and discussed. Chapter 2 introduces the intermediate band semiconductor, Cu5FeS4, where magnetic circular dichroism is used to analyze the carrier effective mass as a function of applied magnetic field. Chapter 3 introduces one of the highest energy PSNCs in literature to date, WO3-x, where transient absorption relaxation dynamics are deconvoluted for plasmon and optical band gap excited regimes. Chapter 4 turns to CuxFeS4 (x=3,5,7), where the ratio of Cu:Fe is shown to modulate the hole-phonon and phonon-phonon transient absorption relaxation rates correlated with carrier effective mass and plasmon damping frequency respectively. Overall, this thesis showcases that static plasmon properties correlate well with transient plasmonic properties, where experiments such as magnetic circular dichroism and transient absorption are effective tools for developing the correlations needed for predicting desired plasmonic properties when designing novel PSNCs for future applications.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Teachers of Color bring valuable assets into the classroom and play a vital role in empowering marginalized students (Brown, 2014; Dee, 2004), however these teachers remain severely underrepresented, especially in STEM fields (Irwin, 2022, 2023; NCES, 2020). Meanwhile, preservice teachers (PSTs) of Color often confront marginalization including lack of representation, isolation, and pressures to assimilate in teacher education programs situated in historically white institutions (HWIs) (Gist, 2017; Haddix, 2010; Hayes &amp; Fasching-Varner, 2015). More specifically, Latina STEM PSTs encounter gender stereotypes, unwelcoming climates, and assumptions questioning their abilities (McGee, 2020; Ong et al., 2018). Understanding the barriers that these Latinas face, alongside their sources of resilience and resistance, can inform policies and curriculum to better support minoritized teacher candidates (Kohli, 2021). As such, the central question guiding this study asks: What are the experiences of three Latina STEM preservice teachers at a historically white institution (HWI)?Using frameworks of Latinidad, LatCrit theory (Solórzano &amp; Yosso, 2001), and transformational resistance (Solórzano &amp; Bernal, 2001), this study examines Latinas’ intersectional barriers and resilience in white-dominated contexts of STEM and teacher education. Through two semi-structured interviews with each PST, aimed at eliciting their narratives on motivations and experiences in their program, I analyze using qualitative methods how these PSTs navigated systemic inequities and explore their resistance to systemic oppression (Hannegan-Martinez et al., 2022; Solórzano &amp; Yosso, 2001).  Findings revealed four key patterns in Latina PSTs’ journeys: (1) gendered and racialized microaggressions which affected their emotional and psychological wellbeing; (2) stark underrepresentation in STEM courses heightening isolation and self-doubt; (3) inspiration and motivation from personal experiences to pursue teaching of marginalized students, and (4) advocacy for engagement with sociopolitical issues affecting communities of Color within teacher preparation programs. Despite barriers imposed by dominant structures, the Latina PSTs displayed transformational resistance as they leveraged wisdom from lived experiences to inform their aspiration to teach (Yosso, 2005). Findings center the participants’ knowledge and lived experiences to inform teacher preparation practices in ways that could better support other Latina PSTs in STEM. This study makes an important contribution by applying LatCrit frameworks to elucidate Latinas’ diverse lived experiences at the intersection of race, gender, and class (Chavez-Moreno, 2023) and by positioning Latin* identities as assets for STEM teaching (Fierros &amp; Delgado Bernal, 2016). Additionally, the study highlights the ongoing resilience and resistance of Latina STEM educators against layered oppression (Hannegan-Martinez et al., 2022). More broadly, the study underscores the urgent need for greater inclusiveness, representation, and cultural responsiveness in teacher education. This includes fostering spaces for minoritized PSTs to share their counterstories, openly discuss oppression, and nurture critical consciousness towards social justice (Kohli, 2021; McGee, 2021; Solórzano &amp; Yosso, 2002).</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Older adults are vulnerable to glucocorticoid-induced muscle atrophy and weakness, with sex potentially influencing susceptibility to those effects. Aerobic exercise can reduce glucocorticoid-induced muscle atrophy in young rodents. However, it is unknown whether aerobic exercise can antagonize glucocorticoid myopathic features in aged muscle. The objectives of this study were to define the extent to which sex influences the development of glucocorticoid myopathy in aged muscle, and to determine the extent to which moderate intensity aerobic exercise training protects against development of myopathy. 24-month-old female (n=30) and male (n=33) mice were randomized to either sedentary or aerobic exercise groups. Within their respective groups, mice were randomized to either daily treatment with injections of dexamethasone (DEX) or saline. Following treatments, the contractile properties of the triceps surae complex were assessed in situ. DEX marginally lowered muscle mass and soluble protein content in both sexes, which was attenuated by aerobic exercise only in females. DEX-treated females expressed greater sub-tetanic contractile properties in a sex-specific manner, which were not influenced by aerobic exercise. DEX increased muscle fatigue in both sexes, but aerobic exercise prevented the fatigue induction only in females. The sex-specific differences to muscle function in response to DEX treatment coincided with sex-specific changes to the contents of protein related to calcium handling, mitochondrial quality control, and glucocorticoid receptor in muscle. These findings define several important sexually dimorphic changes to aged skeletal muscle physiology in response to glucocorticoid treatment and define the capacity of short-term aerobic exercise to protect against those changes.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The genetic mechanisms that regulate transformation of genetic material from genotype tophenotype influence evolutionary response to environmental change and promote species
diversity. Identifying molecular regulatory mechanisms that affect gene expression is challenging
for researchers because they are complex, highly variable, and affect nearly every
phase of gene expression. Venom provides an ideal system for studying adaptive evolution
as it is a complex phenotype used for prey capture and defense that is subject to strong selective
pressures. Snake venom in particular appears to have arisen through rapid evolution,
resulting in a conserved set of toxin gene families that are expressed at highly diverse rates
across a wide range of taxa. The venom secretion is the result of a fairly straightforward
genotype-to-phenotype map, which allows researchers to study expression at various points
along the central dogma. To further investigate the evolution of venom gene expression,
in Chapter 1 we characterized the venom profile of the Cottonmouth Snake (Agkistrodon
piscivorus). We found that across their geographic range, A. piscivorus venom expression
consists primarily of proteins in the Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) gene family. In total, we
identified nine complete PLA2s tandemly arrayed in the A. piscivorus genome of a female
snake collected from the Apalachicola National Forest (ANF) in north Florida, which is
more than in any previously characterized North American pit viper. The array contains
four expressed PLA2s, one copy of the basic PLA2-K and three copies of the acidic PLA2-A
that appear to be the result of gene duplication. This PLA2 region is consistent with the
PLA2 arrays of previously annotated hemorrhagic-type rattlesnakes, which lack the characteristic
heterodimeric PLA2s in neurotoxic rattlesnake venoms. We found that expression of
the four toxin PLA2s varied among individual A. piscivorus, but in all cases PLA2-K was
expressed most highly in the venom gland. In Chapter 2, we aimed to determine whether
expression variation of the four toxin PLA2s were differentially expressed among the sampled
individuals. We collected snakes from the three recognized subspecies of A. piscivorus : The
Florida Cottonmouth (A. p. conanti), the Western Cottonmouth (A. p. leucostoma), and
the Eastern Cottonmouth (A. p. piscivorus) and performed RNA-sequencing to quantify
venom gland expression. We found that only one copy of the acidic PLA2-A1c was differentially expressed between Florida (A. p. conanti) and Continental (A. p. leucostoma and A. p.
piscivorus) individuals. This differential expression seemed largely driven by relatively high
expression of PLA2-A1c in half of the sampled Florida individuals. Despite the high conservation
of the PLA2s gene array across sampled individuals, we did find that this expression
variation may be driven by sequence variation found only in the three more high-expression
Florida individuals. We identified one synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
in the coding region of Exon 2 of PLA2-A1c that was only present in these individuals. We
believe that this SNP could be in linkage with regulatory elements that control PLA2 expression,
and thus may explain the increased relative expression. In addition to differential
expression among individuals, we all found that PLA2 paralogs are expressed at varying
amount within a given individual. In Chapter 3, we aimed to characterize the genomic architecture
that may regulate expression of the PLA2 gene family in A. piscivorus. To achieve
this, we used ATAC-sequencing of two individuals collected from North Florida (ANF) to
characterize accessible chromatin and H3K27ac CUT&amp;RUN sequencing of one individual
collected from North Florida (ANF) to identify regions containing active enhancers. We
found several regions of interest that may regulate PLA2 expression in A. piscivorus, including
open chromatin regions just upstream of each of the four expressed PLA2s that likely
contain promoters and large regions of open chromatin downstream of the four expressed
PLA2s. We also found three distinct CUT&amp;RUN sequencing peaks associated with active
enhancers located between each PLA2-A and their associated unexpressed PLA2-C. These
regions are homologous to the third exon of the non-venom expressed PLA2-E, which also
shares the associated peak. We used Sequence Capture sequencing reads from 147 individual
A. piscivorus to determine whether sequence variation in the identified enhancer and
promoter peaks could contribute to PLA2 paralog expression. However, we found that these
regions were highly conserved among sampled individuals. Therefore, future works should
further investigate the identified peak regions to determine what regulatory elements may
be present and contribute to PLA2-expression.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Over the recent years, social media use has become increasingly prevalent among American adults. While the impact of the rise of social media platforms is ubiquitous, researchers revealed that emerging adults (individuals between 18 and 29 years of age) are more vulnerable to social media addiction than other populations. Theories and research have suggested overparenting as a potential predictor for emerging adults’ problematic technology use. Specifically, the theory of emerging adulthood and self-determination theory offer explanations for the detrimental effects of overparenting behavior in the lives of emerging adults, as they seek autonomy and independence at this stage. Further, studies have linked overparenting to emerging adults’ internet addiction, as well as game and social media addictive behaviors. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms through which overparenting impacts social media addiction remain understudied in the literature. Therefore, the present study examined the association between overparenting and social media addiction among a sample of emerging adults. Parental autonomy control and low self-efficacy were also assessed as potential mediators for this association. College students (N = 545) completed surveys at three time points over 12 weeks. Structural equation modeling suggested that overparenting was positively related to social media addiction via higher levels of parental autonomy control and lower levels of self-efficacy. Future directions and implications of the present study were provided. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>As one of the most widely printed and read texts in the world, Dante Alighieri’s Commedia has firmly established its place in the global literary canon. Written between 1308 and 1320, the Commedia quickly became a widely disseminated and studied text. The first lectura dantis, or public readings and accompanying lectures about the poem by the great Giovanni Boccaccio, were held mere years after Dante’s death, and study of the poem has continued for the past 700 years. Its enduring cultural and linguistic value for the Italian people have solidified Dante as a godlike figure in Italian history. The study of diegetic sound and music in the poem, however, has largely been overlooked or ignored, with a few exceptions. This thesis contributes to scholarship on the music and sound in Dante’s Commedia, responds to existing Dante scholars such as Francesco Ciabattoni and sound studies scholars such as R. Murray Schafer and Aimée Boutin, and offers a collection of my thoughts and interpretations on the subject. I argue that Dante crafted an intentional sonic design into the fabric of the poem, and that through analysis of the design we are able to learn more about both the poem and poet. Using the text as an archive of sonic memory that tells the reader significant and culturally relevant information about the city of Florence and its surrounding area in the Middle Ages, I seek to develop a new methodology through which word and music scholars may “listen in” to the past through literature. I also engage with protopsychomusicology and the affective power of music through the ears of Dante. Scenes such as the interaction with the musician Casella in Purgatorio 2 suggest the use of music in an intentionally comforting or healing manner. Although sparse and uncertain, in biographical accounts scholars speculate that Dante may have had epilepsy (or a similar condition), and through the poem I argue that he used music in a therapeutic manner to treat his own condition, similarly to modern medical music therapy. Finally, I look at the sonic remnants of the past in the poem and consider how Dante used audible memory to recall and relate to past literary voices and sought to establish a cultural epic through sonic memory. Dante adopted and adapted elements of epic throughout his work in order to secure his place in literary history, and through this I argue for the relevance of sound in this channel of study. Through this thesis I open avenues for future exploration of the sonic design of the Commedia and establish new ideas with which future Dante and sound studies scholars may approach this and other similar texts.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This qualitative case study explored the experiences of first-generation students with varying levels of support at Bentley University, a private, business-focused university in the Northeast. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews with 11 first-generation students that represented different ethnic/racial backgrounds, gender identities, class standing, and majors.   The study found that while first-generation students of color had established supportive communities on campus, they often struggled with feelings of inadequacy in foundational business courses. Participants also had challenges accessing high impact practices, such as internships and studying abroad.  Bentley prides itself on providing broad opportunities for students, including international education and career development, so these first-generation student experiences do not align with the university’s efforts to support all students. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation contributes to the intersection of public administration, public policy, and public management by exploring avenues to enhance local government capacities for interlocal collaborations and citizen-government interactions. The first study investigates the joint influence of yardstick competition and managerial stability on bolstering interlocal collaborations for public service delivery, utilizing panel data from municipal governments in Florida for empirical testing. Regarding citizen-government interactions, the second paper focuses on public assessments of local government sustainability strategies and performance. Survey experiment results reveal that citizens exhibit distinct preferences regarding sustainability strategies contingent upon sustainability performance conditions, with these preferences further diverging across different subgroups. Furthermore, the third paper examines how administrative burden reductions by local governments can improve the permitting efficiency of energy infrastructure projects for applicants. The findings suggest that reducing eligibility cost can expedite permitting time for applicants in the short term, especially within low-income and high-minority communities, while reducing collaboration cost can accelerate the application process in the long run, particularly across non low-income and low-minority communities.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study illuminates the nuanced experiences of Asian international women students in Computer and Mathematical Sciences, and Engineering doctoral programs in the United States, a domain historically shaped by male dominance, White supremacy, and Western ideologies. While existing literature on gender and racial-ethnic disparities in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math has utilized an intersectionality framework, this investigation reveals the particular ways in which AIS women's identities are constructed and negotiated within these spaces.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Employing narrative inquiries and a counter-storytelling approach, the research uncovers the intersectionality of race, foreign status, and gender identity among these scholars, demonstrating how these dimensions interact uniquely for AIS women. Key findings reveal a pronounced de-emphasis of racial identity in favor of a strong STEM identity, a strategic response to systemic marginalization and racial challenges. This prioritization reflects a culturally embedded respect for meritocracy and academic achievement, reshaped in the U.S. context by their experiences of racialization and othering.The study also highlights the salient gender identity of AIS women, exacerbated by the masculine culture of CME fields. Despite the external assumption of privilege due to their Asian and international status, these women confront significant gender stereotypes and discrimination. Their strong STEM identity, fostered through resilience and the pursuit of academic and professional excellence, emerges as a counter to traditional gender norms and a mechanism for navigating the complex landscape of gender and racial inequality in STEM.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The research proposes a new conceptual framework integrating the intersectionality of AIS women's identities with the Looking-Glass Self theory, offering a comprehensive understanding of their experiences across different cultural and social contexts. This framework challenges the prevailing deficit thinking about AIS women in CME, emphasizing the complexity and resilience of their identity construction in the face of multifaceted inequalities.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Implications of this study are vast, suggesting changes in research, policy, and practice to better support AIS women in STEM. By recognizing the intertwined nature of their gender, foreign, and racial identities, this research calls for a more nuanced approach in academic support, mentorship, and policy formulation to foster an inclusive environment that acknowledges and addresses the unique challenges faced by AIS women in CME fields.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This  dissertation  explores  the  integration  of  quantum  electrodynamics  (QED)  with  electronic structure theory to accurately model and understand complex light-matter interactions within optical cavities.  Clever designs of optical cavities have enabled experimentalists to achieve strong light-matter coupling, where the interaction between light and matter is so strong that new hybrid light-matter states emerge, known as polaritons.  These polariton states can significantly alter molecular properties and chemical reactivity, leading to potential applications in quantum information processing, quantum materials, and light-driven chemical reactions.  The dissertation focuses on the development of advanced quantum chemistry methods to capture cavity-induced effects and to provide a comprehensive understanding of the underlying physics. Several key technical advancements in QED are presented, including the development of QED generalizations of coupled-cluster (CC) and equation-of-motion (EOM) CC theories, as well as a framework to automate the derivation of optimized many-body equations for QED.  These correlated many-body methods are compared to QED generalizations of mean-field methods like density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) for qualitative assessments of cavity-modified molecular properties.  In addition, analytic gradients are derived for QED-DFT to elucidate the orientation dependence of cavity-influenced reactions and to caution against the use of unmodified geometries obtained from standard electronic structure calculations in the absence of a cavity. Through  the  developments  of  these  methods,  the  dissertation  aims  to  provide  novel theoretical  insights  into  cavity-controlled  chemistry.   Specific  topics  addressed  include  the characterization of photon character within electron-attached excited states, the relevance of  orbital  relaxation  within  mean-field  theories,  and  the  orientation  dependence  of  cavity-influenced  reactions.   By  bridging  quantum  chemistry  and  QED,  this  research  paves  the way for new fundamental discoveries of light and matter coupling and provides a foundation for understanding and controlling cavity-modified chemistry in experimental settings. The dissertation reflects the substantial progress in modeling complex QED systems, despite challenges regarding their computational efficiency and accuracy.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Adaptively incorporating historical information into analyses of current data can improve the precision of inference without requiring additional new observation. Unfortunately, not all borrowing methods are suitable when limited historical studies are available. When a single historical study is available, the power priors control the amount of information to borrow via specification of a weight parameter that discounts the contribution of the historical data in a likelihood combined with current data. We develop a new type of conditional power prior called the historical-bias power prior using an empirical Bayes approach. It relaxes the assumption of the traditional power priors to allow for historical bias. Moreover, our new weight function controls the amount of borrowing and only borrows when historical data satisfy the borrowing criteria. This is achieved by embedding the Frequentist test-then-pool approach in the weight function. Hence, the historical-bias power prior builds a bridge between the Frequentist test-then-pool and the Bayesian power prior. In the simulation, we examine the impact of historical bias on the operating characteristics for borrowing approaches, which has not been explored in previous literature. The results show that the historical-bias power prior yields accurate estimation and robustly powerful tests for the experimental treatment effect with good type I error control especially when the historical bias exists. Furthermore, we extend the historical-bias power prior to account for differences in subjects' baseline covariates between the historical and current studies by implementing the inverse-probability-weighting adjustment. In the simulation, the adjusted outcomes are examined under two different scenarios based on the imbalanced subjects' baseline. The results show that the operating characteristics may be influenced by the adjustment and is associated with the degree of imbalance between subjects. However, the adjustment is effective because it mitigates the impact of the confounders between studies after borrowing, leading to more reliable inference. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This treatise will briefly explore the reasons a composer would accredit their own works to a different name other than theirs; whether the name is of another living or deceased composer, or a name that is fabricated altogether.  This will serve as a prerequisite to the central topic on hand, an examination of a set of guitar studies composed by the German classical guitar pedagogue, performer, as well as composer, Tilman Hoppstock (1961-).  In 1992, Hoppstock recorded a piece by an allegedly obscure composer, Franz Werthmüller (1769-1841), and for the next 15 years managed to keep the secret that Werthmüller was merely Hoppstock’s first use of a pseudonym, to present a piece written in the style of an older musical era.  In 2010, Hoppstock published a set of 12 studies, for the guitar, under another obscure composer, Allan Willcocks (1869-1956).  Undoubtedly, Willcocks was in fact another pseudonym used by Hoppstock, and though this British composer came with an in-depth two-page biography, facsimiles of hand-written manuscripts, and even old photographs documenting various stages of Willcocks’ life, it took only two years for the true identity behind these studies to come out.  This treatise will explore the alleged life of Allan Willcocks, Hoppstock’s own reasons for inventing this character, why the Willcocks’ 12 Studies for Guitar has proven to be a valuable addition to classical guitar literature, as well as the style in which they were written in.  Provided are musical examples, biographical information, original manuscripts, photographs and even concert programs that Hoppstock put together to introduce the world of music to Allan Willcocks.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The exploration of combinatorial mixtures in liquid/liquid extraction and phase-transfer catalysis represents a groundbreaking shift in the understanding and application of complex organic systems in chemistry and biology. By investigating the enhanced liquid/liquid extraction capabilities through the introduction of organic solutes, we have demonstrated the superiority of combinatorial mixtures over individual components.  At the same time, the study on lipid-based phase transfer catalysis challenges traditional views by revealing the potential of lipids in catalyzing reactions, as evidenced by the successful ester hydrolysis of calcein-AM to fluorescent calcein in phospholipid vesicles. These findings not only illuminate the untapped potential of lipid and organic solute mixtures in catalysis and extraction processes but also suggest broader applications in developing new combinatorial biosensors, materials with unique properties, and innovative catalytic systems. This integrated approach highlights the importance of combinatorial chemistry in advancing our understanding of molecular interactions and the potential for novel applications in synthetic and biological chemistry.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Early American women’s history and the history of visual culture tend to avoid overlapping in terms of both sources and questions. A gendered lens when applied to the origins of America typically seeks to answer the question of how the Revolution affected women, whereas the history of American visual culture demonstrates changes over time, or the meanings behind symbolism without a fully comprehensive look at gender. This thesis seeks to connect the two fields while raising further questions about white women’s political involvement during the American Revolution through an examination of America as represented by a woman in British-American visual sources from approximately 1760 to 1800. Through both a chronological and thematic approach, this thesis highlights how the changing status of women throughout the Revolution and their experiences are reflected in paintings, cartoons, and state seals, complicating arguments that these female embodiments of America are merely a product of national identity formation. The shift from an Indigenous woman to a Roman goddess can be charted parallel to the rise of Republican Motherhood ideology and anxieties about female autonomy. This thesis will also explore the complex powerful nature of femininity in relation to societal norms and additional iconography, including transgressions of sex and sexuality, liberty, and the mother/daughter dynamic. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>When a character enters the stage in a musical, the audience begins to make assumptions about that character based on what they see—their presented gender, race, etc. Once the character begins to act, speak, and sing, the audience learns who that character truly is. What interests me is how aspects of a character’s identity become manifest on the stage.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation centers on the portrayal of male queerness in two musicals by Jeanine Tesori, Shrek the Musical (2008) and Fun Home (2015). In exploring how the queerness of three characters from these two shows are represented in both material and performance, I construct a narrative that traces Tesori’s works through a spectrum of representations from those that rely on stereotypes to attempt to portray queerness in a more individualized fashion. I begin by examining the character of Lord Farquaad from Shrek the Musical in Chapter Two. I demonstrate how Farquaad relies entirely on visual and sonic stereotypes to present the character as queer, and I employ Conceptual Integration Networks to highlight how it is the interactions between queer elements, such as his costuming, choreography, vocal performance, and lyrics, that code the character as gay. I then turn to Donkey from Shrek the Musical in Chapter Three, noting the extra complexity that arises with his character’s depiction of both queerness and Blackness. I complicate the ways that Donkey’s character uses stereotypes, questioning the methods employed by the creative team to juggle his marked identities effectively. Finally, I examine the character of Bruce Bechdel from Fun Home in Chapter Four, whose representation is far from stereotypical, instead relying on queer markers established within the musical itself. In examining the differences between how similar identities are portrayed in Chapter Five, I reveal a progressive shift in how queerness is represented on stage, moving from a stereotypical depiction used to garner laughs from the audience to a more true-to-life representation that attempts to capture the realities of being queer.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Staff members in institutions of higher education who are not faculty, such as those who work in student affairs, information technology, student business services, and other areas, may feel invisible and unappreciated. This sense of obscurity for racially marginalized staff can be intensified by discrimination and oppression that persist within these institutions, despite the implementation of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. Unfortunately, higher education literature that examines perceptions and experiences related to racism, oppression, and DEI initiatives tends to focus on students or faculty, neglecting the experiences of professional staff. This qualitative case study delved into the perspectives of racially marginalized professional staff concerning a predominantly White institution's (PWI) endeavors to establish a diverse, equitable, and inclusive environment, employing a critical race theory (CRT) framework. Utilizing a two-phase interview approach, encompassing walking and sitting interviews, nine participants shared their insights and experiences related to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) efforts on campus. The data analysis involved an inductive, iterative coding process of the interview data.
Concerning participants' workplace encounters on campus, the findings underscored instances of racial and ethnic bias, discrimination, threats of violence, discrimination based on intersectional identities, being discredited in the workplace, and perceptions of being less valued by administrators compared to faculty, sometimes even facing devaluation by faculty themselves. Regarding participants' perceptions of the institution's DEI effectiveness, a majority expressed unawareness of any DEI initiatives and perceived those they were aware of as lacking permanence. Participants highlighted the challenge of insufficient racial diversity among employees, citing political interference with the institution's DEI efforts. Despite acknowledging these challenges, participants strongly felt that the institution should address DEI concerns. Additionally, the study revealed that DEI programming encountered issues when not appropriately administered, and participants displayed mixed reactions to how their White colleagues received DEI programs and initiatives.
This study carries significant implications, affirming that racially marginalized staff encounter notable challenges within Predominantly White Institutions (PWIs), including instances of discrimination, bias, ridicule, violence, and devaluation. Moreover, the findings suggest that institution-sponsored Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs were perceived as more performative than substantive, while grassroots-led initiatives initiated by staff members addressing diversity, equity, or inclusion demonstrated a greater potential for sustainability. Lastly, a poignant observation from one participant underscores the implication that staff being viewed as "second-class citizens" in comparison to faculty significantly contributes to their sense of devaluation within the institution.
Drawing from the study’s findings, four key recommendations emerged. First, institutions of higher education should take a stand against racial discrimination, microaggressions, and violence. Second, higher education institutions should take a bow, stop performing, and be intentional with their efforts to positively foster diversity, equity, and inclusion on campus. Third, institutions should take a seat and increase diverse representation among employees. Fourth, institutions should take a leap and prioritize the equal recognition and valuation of staff, mirroring the acknowledgment and opportunities afforded to faculty. In terms of future research, there is a necessity for in-depth analyses of the experiences of all higher education staff, quantitative examinations of staff and faculty salaries from an equity perspective, comparative investigations into staff policies and practices in states with restrictive DEI legislation versus those without, and further research on the effectiveness of grassroots DEI initiatives.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Black male students enrolled in predominantly White institutions (PWIs) face a myriad of challenges that hinder their academic success and overall well-being. These students often grapple with feelings of disconnection, stress, and isolation. According to studies, Black male students in PWIs are more likely to experience lower retention rates, higher dropout rates, and lower academic performance compared to their peers (Harper et al., 2018). This research explores the critical need to foster a sense of belonging for Black male students at PWIs, acknowledging the multifaceted nature of their experiences and the systemic barriers they encounter. Drawing on the works of Brooms (2020) and McCoy (2014), this study examines administrators' perspectives on Black male mentorship programs and their impact on Black male students' sense of belonging and success within PWIs.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Employing a qualitative methodology (Merriam, 1998), this study focused on gaining insights into administrators' viewpoints on Black male mentorship programs, allowing them to share their experiences and the significance they attributed to these programs (Merriam &amp; Tisdell, 2016). Data collection involved interviews with ten administrators directly overseeing and leading Black male mentorship programs at mid-size and large PWIs. The research questions probed how administrators utilize these programs to cultivate a sense of belonging for Black male undergraduate students and how they addressed challenges encountered in overseeing them.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The findings highlight the positive impact of Black male mentorship programs, indicating that administrators perceive them as advantageous for fostering a sense of community, connection, and positive experiences. Although administrators recognized the advantages of these programs, they also highlighted areas for improvement in different aspects of the programs and within their institutions. This nuanced understanding of mentorship programs for Black male students has played a significant role in fostering a sense of belonging within PWI settings.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In response to research question one, the data identified two primary themes: (1) facilitating personal connection and (2) fostering an engaging and supportive environment. These themes illuminated the ways in which mentorship programs contributed to the sense of belonging for Black male undergraduate students, emphasizing the importance of personal connections and a supportive academic environment.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Addressing research question two, administrators navigated challenges through three key themes: (1) creating and executing strategies for financial resource management, (2) navigating staff and personnel management, and (3) managing the evaluation processes, sharing stories, and aligning with institutional goals. These themes unveiled the varied approaches employed by program administrators to address challenges and enhance the effectiveness of their mentorship programs.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Exploring the implications of the findings, administrators demonstrated adaptability and resilience in integrating mentorship programs into institutional structures. The emergence of engaging activities and understanding program origins as crucial elements underscored administrators' ability to seamlessly align programs with institutional goals. Challenges were effectively addressed through adept financial resource management, strategic personnel navigation, and a commitment to storytelling, thus reinforcing institutional alignment.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Four recommendations emerged from the findings. Recommendation one advocates for prioritizing the hiring of culturally competent staff sensitive to the unique challenges faced by Black male students and emphasizing the need for ongoing training. Recommendation two stresses the importance of establishing clear and measurable program goals, providing a roadmap for success, and enabling outcome assessment. Recommendation three encourages institutions to customize mentoring programs to meet the specific needs of their campus sizes and communities. Recommendation four underscores the need for individualized resource allocation for Black male mentorship programs.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In conclusion, this research contributes valuable insights into the significance of Black male mentorship programs at PWIs, shedding light on their positive impact while addressing challenges. The recommendations offer a roadmap for institutions to enhance these programs, ultimately fostering a sense of belonging and academic success for Black male students in higher education.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Charles Stuart returned to his native country after fourteen years in exile. His subjects had just endured eleven years of military dictatorship under Oliver Cromwell and wanted a return to the days of monarchy. On 25 May 1660, Charles II landed in Dover and was warmly greeted by his people and the leader of the army, George Monck. They set off for London and arrived on 29 May, Charles II's thirtieth birthday. Escorting Charles into London were his Life Guards, a professional military cavalry force of Royalist supporters who followed their king into exile. Having witnessed his father’s failure to keep his crown because he lacked a loyal bodyguard and seeing first-hand how a devoted household helped his cousin Louis XIV maintain his kingdom, Charles II had every intention of keeping these guards throughout his reign. The challenge was that Charles had promised to disband the military, which had become very unpopular in England and was viewed as a tool of tyranny and absolute rule. This dissertation deals with the challenges Charles II and his brother James II faced in keeping a loyal guard about them in a country that genuinely feared the institution of a standing army. The first four Stuart monarchs stubbornly believed in the Divine Right of Kings and sought to rule by the Royal Prerogative. How they wielded arbitrary powers in an era where Parliament wanted more to say in declaring laws and charting a direction for the country was challenging, and all four dealt with it differently. At the root of these challenges was how money was collected to fund wars and build armies. The Stuart kings could rule without Parliament but not raise taxes to pay for expensive armies to conduct military campaigns. For this, they had to call Parliament, and Parliament was all too aware of their growing power to the point that they used these episodes to demand more say. In this complicated world, Charles II and James II could not rule as absolutists without the Life Guards who formed the nucleus of England’s standing army.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation provides a comprehensive analysis of the intricate dynamics of coastal systems under the extreme stress of hurricanes. A multi-faceted study on the interactions between hydrodynamics, morphology dynamics, and various coastal defenses like sand dunes and vegetations during hurricane events is presented, employing advanced numerical modeling to enhance the understanding of coastal resilience and protection. It is constructed upon three pillars of research, each delving into different yet interconnected aspects of coastal defense mechanisms and their responses to hurricane-induced forces.The research begins by examining the protective functions of sand dunes against hurricane forces, utilizing a non-hydrostatic XBeach model (XBNH) to analyze wave dynamics with various storm surge after overtopping sand dunes. The research presents an in-depth analysis of wave behavior as they encounter sand dunes during hurricane-induced storm surges. The research focuses on Hurricane Michael as a case study, dissecting the dynamics of wave propagation, breaking, and overtopping. It offers a quantitative assessment of the dunes’ ability to attenuate waves, pinpointing the conditions that precipitate maximum erosion and wave heights. The findings reveal that sand dunes are pivotal in reducing wave heights, particularly as storm surges intensify, with waves breaking at the dune base, overtopping, and losing their energy as they move inland. Through the model validation, the chapter establishes the superior performance of XBNH over the hydrostatic mode (XBSB), especially in critical metrics such as significant wave height and peak water surface elevation, where XBNH showed a markedly lower average and maximum error rates. This research not only underscores the precision of the XBNH, also provides the foundation for following research.
The investigation then extends to the complex processes leading to barrier-island breaching during hurricane conditions. A case study using a two-dimensional XBNH model provides a detailed account of how hurricane-induced waves and storm surges interplay to alter island topography. The study reveals that supercritical flow conditions significantly contribute to the rapid erosion and eventual breaching of barrier islands, offering a predictive analysis of the morphological changes under extreme weather events. In addition, it provides a detailed account of the barrier-island's breaching evolution, through the analysis of bed elevation cross-sections and surge-wave profiles across various storm stages. This comprehensive examination not only reinforces the model's precision but also offers a deeper understanding of barrier island dynamics, contributing valuable knowledge to enhance coastal hazard mitigation strategies.
The final aspect of the research integrates the hydrodynamic focus of the preceding chapters to explore the evolution of dune profiles, particular the role of vegetation in coastal protection. It highlights how different conditions of vegetation affect dune morphology under storm conditions. The study explores the use of the XBeach model to simulate these interactions, emphasizing the critical role of vegetation in mitigating erosion. Moreover, the chapter enriches the XBeach model's application by incorporating sensitivity analyses to different wind conditions, thereby broadening its predictive capability. The study's comprehensive approach illuminates the multifaceted relationship between vegetation, coastal morphology, and erosion processes. It highlights the indispensable role of vegetation in bolstering coastal resilience and provides strategic insights for coastal management, reinforcing the vital need for integrated environmental considerations in the design of coastal defense systems.
To summarize, this dissertation underscores the importance of integrating hydrodynamics, morphological dynamics, and ecological considerations into coastal management practices. The results contribute valuable insights into the design and conservation of coastal defenses, promoting the development of more resilient communities in the face of increasing hurricane activities. Through the refined application of the XBeach model and the insights gained from its performance, the dissertation makes a significant contribution to the field of coastal engineering and environmental protection.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Standardized testing has elementary schools transitioning into departmentalization, where a teacher is assigned to teach a particular subject matter. Elementary education programs tend to provide a holistic approach to education that includes training in all subject matters and learner psychology. The national trend of teacher shortages as resulted in the hiring of teachers who have not attended a formal education preparation program. Departmentalized elementary teachers in mathematics enter the role without prior specialized training due to holistic teacher preparation programs or entering the profession from another role. This study explores the implementation of pedagogical content knowledge of departmentalized elementary mathematics teachers in a large urban district during planning and instruction. Pedagogical content knowledge is the specialized content knowledge needed to effectively instruct a subject matter. Through multiple case study design, this exploration was able to identify specific elements of pedagogical content knowledge evident in the lesson plans, class observations, and interviews with seven elementary mathematics teachers in a large urban district. The findings provide insight on the various levels of planning in the area of questioning, but a consistency of evidence in the areas of multiple representation and problem selection. Despite the inconsistent evidence of planning for productive questioning, the elementary teachers demonstrated evidence of asking productive questions throughout the lesson and responding to student errors. The participants during the interview expressed the desire to increase the level of purposeful reflection on their planning and instruction as a way to improve their craft. Implications of these findings are discussed for school-level professional development programs and district-level structures for continuing education for departmentalized elementary mathematics teachers. This study contributes to the exploration of pedagogical content knowledge and teacher development specifically in the elementary setting and departmentalization that can be supported through collaborative structure and formalized reflections.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm is a powerful test of graph isomorphism, and works by iteratively isolating clusters of nodes via a coloring scheme based on binary relationships. This refinement process is akin to message passing on graph neural networks. Graph neural networks are paradigms of computation that yield powerful results for structured data based on binary relationships, and therefore their expressivity shares the limitations of the Weisfeiler-Leman test. One way to circumvent this limitation relies on identifying and working with higher relationships within the data, or by finding a better refinement criterion that can be implemented on a machine. In this thesis, we put forward data structures closely based on the identification of such higher relationships via Kan Extensions of structured data built on binary relations. These data structures are well known in algebraic topology as Simplicial Sets; the theoretical underpinnings based on the combinatorics of simplicial sets and directed graphs are explored in this thesis and, based on of it, algorithms are introduced that can identify higher-order relations. A metric that can serve as a quantification for community detection tools is also introduced, as well as the notion of a pseudoterminal vertex as a proxy for these higher relations. This helps us balance the variance-bias tradeoff necessary for generalizability of the architecture. We introduce functors that show how these higher relationships can be modelled and expanded. Finally, we propose three neural networks that benefit from the topology of these nonbinary relations. These neural networks can be ported into the standard graph neural network library to augment feature classification in a semisupervised manner.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Europium exhibits two stable valence states, Eu2+ and Eu3+, with energies closely matched, wherein the magnetic Eu2+ state is significantly larger than the nonmagnetic Eu3+. EuPd2Si2 (EPS) undergoes a bulk valence state transition from Eu~3+ to Eu~2+ while cooling. The phase diagram of the EPS compound differs from that of other typical rare-earth 1:2:2 compounds with valence instability. Therefore, the valence transition of the EPS compound cannot be explained by theoretical models of other compounds and remains rather mysterious. This study aims to construct a comprehensive phase diagram of the EPS crystal structure during the valence phase transition, while varying chemical substitution, temperature, and magnetic field.Chapter one discusses X-ray crystallography and crystal structures. Chapter 2 delves into the electronic and magnetic states of lanthanides and specifically europium. Curie’s susceptibility of the magnetic divalent europium atoms and the Van Vleck paramagnetism susceptibility of the non-magnetic trivalent europium atoms are discussed. A literature review on the valence instability of 1:2:2 rare-earth compounds, especially the EPS compound, is presented in chapter three. 
Chapter four covers the efforts on the growth and characterization of the pristine and below 5% chemically substituted EPS compounds. The temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction (XRD) powder measurements by the APS synchrotron and our in-lab XRD machines will be discussed. In the EPS and its low-doped compounds, another smaller unit cell appears beside the high-temperature EPS (HT-EPS) unit cell. The new low-temperature EPS (LT-EPS) unit cell is related to the Eu3+ valence state. A magnetic valence transition was observed in the DC magnetic susceptibility measurements at temperatures where the unit cell transformation starts.
In the next chapter, in the 10 to 20 % alloyed samples of EPS, the linear thermal coefficient can suddenly increase or slowly decrease to up to 3.5 times, or stay constant at all temperatures. Finally, the four thermal expansion trends are explained qualitatively by the available space for the europium atoms in the unit cell in chapter 6.
The analysis of powder patterns of EPS at high magnetic fields and low temperatures in Cell 5 of MAGLAB has been conducted in chapter 7. Key findings include the magnetic field's enhancement of the HT-EPS phase, driving the valence transition temperature lower. The weight fraction of the EPS phase demonstrates a linear dependence on temperature, particularly around the temperature equating HT-EPS and LT-EPS weight fractions. Moreover, quadratic relationships with magnetic field strength are observed, along with hysteresis effects influencing the symmetry of these relationships.
Finally, some of my other side projects that I have done during my study at FSU are presented. Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) semiconductor materials serve as excellent absorber layers in thin-film photovoltaic devices, yet their low open-circuit voltage hinders mass production. Unlike CZTSSe, Ag2ZnSnSe4 (AZTSe) possesses a favorable bandgap of 1.4 eV, making it a promising candidate to replace toxic or scarce materials in photovoltaics. Powder AZTSe was successfully synthesized. In an attempt to grow single-crystal AZTSe via the chemical vapor transport method, Ag8SnSe6 and SnSe2 phases were obtained. Further exploration focused on Ag8SnSe6's potential as a thermoelectric material, highlighting its superionic conductivity. By constructing a comprehensive electron density map of Ag8SnSe6, the path of silver atoms inside the single crystal was determined. Additionally, efforts to grow AuPbSbS3 and (Au0.5Cu0.5)PbSbS3 for renewable energy applications via chemical vapor transport were explored. Another study investigates the impact of light and temperature on the optical properties and stability of mixed-ion perovskite thin films, demonstrating slight peak shifts under elevated temperature conditions, potentially indicating anisotropic thermal expansion. Additionally, doping with Cs shows improved performance and stability compared to other compositions, as evidenced by XRD measurements. Another study examines the chemical composition of shark teeth artifacts from archaeological sites using XRD analysis, revealing residues that provide insights into ancient tool applications. Despite challenges posed by uneven surfaces, the integration of XRD patterns uncovers phases like hematite, shedding light on ancient material usage and cultural practices.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Some philosophers have recently argued that a decision-theoretic model of rational choice can guide us to the answer of what it is appropriate to do in situations of moral uncertainty (i.e., uncertainty about what one ought to do). By proposing and defending this view, these philosophers aim to show how decision-theoretic procedures provide us with action guidance even when we have yet to settle all of the issues in normative ethics. In this paper, I argue that decision theory is never action-guiding in cases of moral uncertainty. I thus suggest that because of this limitation on decision theory’s action-guiding capacities, it fails to fulfill the role that these philosophers hope to show that it has. I consider several objections to my argument and reply to each of them.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This thesis investigates how critics respond to the fat body onstage, aiming to better understand how to develop positive fat representation. Through my research, I advocate for theatre to develop fat-positive practices. I argue that fat positivity in theatre must go beyond simply including fat bodies onstage. A fat-positive theatre would cast fat bodies in all roles, while maintaining the sensitivity that the fat body carries unique cultural assumptions and may require material changes to the theatrical processes. Adopting these fat-positive practices would involve a radical acceptance of fatness onstage.My research examines three notable plays as case studies to understand how the fat body is performed and received onstage in the United States. My first case study, ’night, Mother, takes place in the 1980s as a landmark example of how casting a fat body affected a production’s reception. The other two case studies, Untitled Feminist Show and Fat Ham, focus on the 2010s and 2020s, to examine how recent shifts in fat activism and body-positive movements have impacted cultural understandings of the fat body. My research seeks to understand how these cultural shifts connect to critical receptions of the fat body onstage. Through these case studies, I aim to craft a narrative around the shifting ways we conceptualize the neutral body and how the fat body challenges this unspoken assumption. In this thesis, I use the term “neutral body” to refer to bodies that fit the cultural norms of an ideal performer and “non-neutral bodies” to identify fat bodies that visibly break the traditional mode of what we expect an actor to look like. This framework provides a way of thinking about how fat bodies are routinely excluded from representation and highlights the unspoken assumption that the fat body is not the ideal body.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Community colleges provide access to higher education for a wide range of prospective students with diverse interests and educational goals. With more than 60 percent of incoming community college students deemed as academically underprepared for college-level work, traditionally, students have been required to enroll in one semester or more of developmental coursework before beginning college-level classes. Several studies demonstrate traditional remedial education models seldom increase students’ skills and contribute towards success in outcomes such as persistence, passage of gateway courses, or credential completion (Bailey &amp; Phillips, 2016; Goudas &amp; Boylan, 2013; Jaggars &amp; Bickerstaff; 2018). Recent developmental education reform efforts include models that have proven to be successful in accelerating the time it takes for students to successfully matriculate through developmental coursework (Edgecombe et al., 2013; Jaggars &amp; Stacey, 2014). These reform models include options for students to enroll directly in college-level courses simultaneously with support courses as with corequisite courses, curricula changes and interventions which consolidate multiple standalone courses into one single semester as with compressed courses, intensive advising policies, and alternatives to traditional placement assessments which result in a higher likelihood of placement accuracy and success in college-level coursework. 
Overwhelmingly, studies examining the outcomes of students who participate in developmental reform models have found benefits relative to traditional developmental models, however, these studies largely consider the effects of one type of developmental model or the presence or lack thereof of any type of developmental policy (Bahr et al., 2019; Barbitta &amp; Munn 2018; Cho et al., 2012; Jaggars et al., 2013; Ran &amp; Lin, 2019). Additionally, many studies have failed to examine whether certain types of developmental policies are more effective than others and if this differs based on gender and race/ethnicity.
With states adopting varying developmental education reform policies to improve student progression into college-level coursework and beyond, this study examined how recent state modifications to placement policies, compressed/corequisite modalities, or changes to advising/academic planning have affected student persistence trends. Using a modified version of Wang’s theoretical model of momentum for community college student success, I conceptualized developmental reform policies based on how they may function to contribute towards the momentum of students, and therefore, outcomes such as first-year retention and graduation rates. Drawing data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, this study used a difference-in-differences approach between the years of 2012 to 2020 to observe student success outcomes before and after implementation of developmental education policy reform models, while comparing outcomes among non-adopting states. This study considered how developmental reform policies in a national context contribute to academic momentum and student success outcomes such as persistence and completion. 
Results in the aggregate provide evidence that the presence of developmental education reform policies in states increase institutional retention and completion rates more so than institutions within states that do not adopt reform policies. Additionally, when disaggregating results by type of developmental education reform policy, there are no differential impacts on student outcomes, with one exception, holistic reforms which may more negatively impact outcomes. Lastly, while developmental education reforms aided in increasing overall student outcomes, gaps in graduation rates among genders and racial/ethnic groups were observed, with disparities between certain groups widening at institutions within states with reforms.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Problem of PracticeSchool principals have a powerful effect on student achievement, school culture, and teacher turnover.  According to the National Association of Secondary School Principals (2020), the average career of a school principal is four years, and one in five school principals leave their schools annually.  These numbers are even greater in more challenging schools with high numbers of minority students, English Language Learners, and students living in poverty.  These students need the most experienced school principals, yet they often end up with the newest and least experienced.  Even more alarming is that results from a recent survey conducted jointly by NASSP and the Learning Policy Institute (LPI) in 2020 indicated that 42% of school principals were considering leaving their position.  
This exploratory qualitative research study answers the following research question:  The purpose of this study is to answer the following research question: What has motivated school principals to remain in school-level leadership? The study focuses on gaining the perspectives of principals on factors influencing school-based leaders to remain in their positions. Motivation and retention of current school leaders is critical to student growth and success, overall school achievement, and retention of school educators at all levels.  This study will add to the current body of research focused on development and support of school leaders to positively impact school principal perseverance and retention.  
Methods
Semi-structured interviews and coding methods have been used to organize and analyze outcomes effectively without losing the individuality of the participants’ responses.  
Ten principals participated in semi-structured interviews. The stratified and purposeful sample included both males and females, principals at all K-12 levels, Title I and non-Title I schools, and urban and suburban schools.
Data Analysis
First cycle descriptive coding using a priori codes in conjunction with in vivo coding outcomes and second cycle coding outcomes were charted to identify dominant codes: Relevant Preparation, Relevant Experience, Relationships with Staff, the Participants’ Perception of the Role/Feelings About the Role, Passion for Helping Others, Internal Drive, Future Role, Informal Collaboration with Peers, and the Mentor/Mentee Relationship.  Code outcomes were clustered based on commonality.  Six overarching themes emerged and were named: External Validation, Collaboration, Preparation and Support, Future Plans, Intrinsic Motivation, and Relationships. These themes answered the research question: What has motivated school principals to remain in school-level leadership? 
Recommendations
	 Based on participant interview outcomes for this study, the following recommendations are offered.  The first recommendation is to ensure that the right support is being provided to school leaders to positively impact the leader to be able to succeed within the role.  The next recommendation is focused on collaboration. A focus on formal collaboration needs to shift from interaction in meetings to shadowing peers and a sharing of ideas to positively impact schools, leadership practices, and student achievement.  Informal collaboration when supported and celebrated by school districts could potentially support school leaders professionally as well as emotionally which would positively impact retention rates.    Next, mentor programs should be expanded to include both internal and external relationships.  For mentoring programs to be most impactful on the decision-making of school principals, evaluation or fear of retribution should be removed, and this often results from an external match.  Additionally, it is critical to establish and encourage a pipeline of leaders within a school district to ensure a continual pool of qualified leaders prepared to support and lead schools.  All school districts and current leaders should identify and tap potential leaders and provide effective professional development, encouragement, and mentorship to develop leadership skills. Creating a pipeline of educators at all levels positively impacts students, schools, and school districts as a whole.  Finally, salaries should increase to compensate school leaders fairly and adequately.    
Conclusion
	Addressing this research question provides answers and informs practice to improve formal and informal learning opportunities for school principals in an effort to address principal turnover rates.  Ensuring that the right learning opportunities and supportive measures are in place are of the utmost importance to increase longevity of school leaders in their role to ultimately positively impact student achievement, increase teacher retention, and positively impact the climate and culture of a school community.  
	Based on the perceptions of current school principals in this study, 6 themes have emerged from the data: External Validation, Collaboration, Preparation &amp; Support, Future Plans, Intrinsic Motivation, and Relationships.  Each plays an important role in developing and supporting school leaders. The combination of these supports and opportunities increases school principal perseverance and retention in their school-based leader role.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study explored the relationship between autism spectrum disorder (ASD) severity, parental stress, barriers to care, and family resilience among 210 parents of children with ASD. Using path analysis, the study investigated how ASD severity influences parental stress, mediated by barriers to care and family resilience. Results demonstrated positive direct effects between ASD severity and parent stress as well as significant indirect effects when including barriers to care as a mediator in this relationship. The sequential mediation effect of barriers to care and family resilience on the relationship between ASD severity and parent stress also supported partial mediation. While family resilience alone did not have a significant indirect effect on this relationship, resilience plays a significant role in the sequential mediation model alongside barriers to care. These findings emphasize the importance of comprehensive interventions that address both ASD symptoms and familial stressors. They have implications for clinical practice, research, education, public policy, and family support initiatives, suggesting the need for improved access to care and increased awareness and inclusivity.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>ABSTRACT</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The Sullivan Report (The Sullivan Commission on Diversity in the Healthcare Workforce, 2004) identified the lack of racial diversity among health care practitioners as a major issue. This report points out that, while the U.S. population has continued to become more diverse, the composition of health care workers has not kept pace with these changes. Emergency Medical Services (EMS) workers provide advanced medical care to patients in the prehospital environment. Nationally, 11.6% of the entire workforce is African American, and 16.1% are Hispanic. Within the EMS field, African Americans represent only 6% of workers, and Hispanics represent 10.6% (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2017). One possible impediment to minorities entering the EMS workforce may involve the admissions practices of post-secondary institutions offering EMS programs (Health Resources and Services Administration [HRSA], 2017). This study examined the admissions practices of Florida college-based paramedic programs to determine what they currently are and how decisions about these requirements are made. This study used a document analysis of Florida college-based paramedic program websites to determine what current admissions requirements are in place for these programs, as well as interviews with the program managers of 11 of the 25 Florida college-based paramedic programs, to determine how decisions are made about which instruments are used and how they are used in admissions processes. The study found that these programs used a variety of qualitative and quantitative instruments in their admissions processes as well as several different methods of selecting students based on these instruments. Interviews with program managers revealed that their decision-making processes were influenced by a desire to meet several goals, including  selecting students they felt would successfully complete their programs, pass licensing exams, and perform as competent clinicians. They also incorporated influences from accreditors, government regulators, and employers of their graduates in their decision-making processes. Program directors relied mostly on anecdotal evidence to make these decisions, and diversity considerations did not play a meaningful part in their decision-making processes. Accreditors and regulators should provide guidance for these decision makers in this area, and research should be conducted to assess the validity of common instruments and selection processes and their effect on the diversity of these training programs.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Approximately 25% of women and 15% of men have reported being sexually abused in childhood. Although child sexual abuse (CSA) prevention and treatment methods have been widely supported in the literature, many survivors either never disclose or delay disclosing their abuse until later in life. The absence of disclosure presents major challenges to holistically understanding CSA prevention and treatment methods. Consequently, research attempting to uncover the barriers, influences, recipients, and impacts of CSA disclosure has become increasingly prevalent. A perceived negative response to CSA disclosure has been linked to a variety of long-term survivor consequences including revictimization, mental and physical health struggles, and relational issues. Not only is fear of others’ responses one of the largest barriers to CSA disclosure, but having access to someone you can trust is also the most commonly identified influence to disclosing CSA. Unsurprisingly, survivors who decide to disclose initially do so and are primarily worried about the responses of their parents. Additionally, much of the CSA disclosure literature is oriented especially around children who disclose. It is reported, however, that survivors of CSA often delay reporting until adulthood. In order to increase feelings of safety for survivors to disclose, there is a need to strengthen our awareness of how survivors perceive their parents’ responses to CSA disclosure. The present study aimed to gain an in-depth understanding of survivors’ perceptions surrounding disclosure of CSA to a parent. Grounded theory qualitative methods were employed to develop a central theory surrounding the process of adult CSA disclosure to a parent. Findings highlighted a relational process through which adult survivors perceive and interpret their parent’s response to CSA disclosure. Analyses concluded that parent response to CSA disclosure impacted the parent-child relationship by either hindering or strengthening it. Whether a relationship was ultimately hindered or strengthened by the CSA disclosure experience was dependent on the manner in which parents responded to the disclosure. Harmful and helpful parental responses were divided into five subthemes: statements, questions, behaviors, positionality, and follow-up actions. Other patterns discussed were wished for responses, familial context, and ongoing CSA discussions. Findings from this study provide insights for parents and clinicians, as well as future research directions. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This thesis offers the first comprehensive exploration of the Rotherwood site (40SL61) in Upper East Tennessee, focusing on faunal remains to understand the subsistence practices of its original occupants. Located along the South Fork Holston River, this site presents a unique opportunity for archaeological investigation, being relatively unexplored and lacking scholarly publication. This study investigates subsistence strategies, social organization, and broader behavioral patterns during the Mississippian period through faunal analysis. Methodologically, the research addresses taphonomic processes, site formation factors, and the challenges of archaeological interpretation. The presence of whole animal remains suggests limited carcass sharing, challenging prevailing notions about Mississippian cultures in Tennessee. Furthermore, the abundance of vertebrate remains suggests that Rotherwood was not a freshwater mussel shell processing station, indicating a more diverse subsistence base. By examining the material evidence from Rotherwood, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of pre-contact societies in Upper East Tennessee and emphasizes the significance of faunal analysis in archaeological research.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In the rapidly evolving world of molecular biology, genetics and epigenetics have taken crucial roles in unraveling the complex origins of diseases.  Through gene expression, genes govern the synthesis of proteins, the fundamental building blocks of life.  Conventional observational studies grapple with major limitations in exploring the relationships between diseases and gene expression, leading to the advent of transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS).  Similarly, methylome-wide association studies (MWAS) have been developed to explore the relationships between DNA methylation and disease, as DNA methylation plays a key role in regulating gene expression.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In Chapter 2 of this dissertation, we introduce MIMOSA (MWAS Imputing Methylome Obliging Summary-level mQTLs and Associated LD matrices), a comprehensive set of DNA methylation prediction models for use in MWAS.  MIMOSA significantly improves the accuracy of DNA methylation prediction and downstream power of MWAS by training on a large, summary-level methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) dataset from the Genetics of DNA Methylation Consortium.  We apply MIMOSA to genome-wide summary statistics for 28 complex traits and include a case study in high cholesterol.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In Chapter 3, we present SUMMIT-FA (Summary-level Unified Method for Modeling Integrated Transcriptome with Functional Annotations), which extends the state-of-the-art TWAS method SUMMIT by incorporating functional annotations from the the Multi-dimensional Annotation-Class Integrative Estimation (MACIE).  SUMMIT-FA improves gene expression prediction accuracy and TWAS power, which we demonstrate through its application to 24 traits and through simulations.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In Chapter 4, we turn our attention to spatial transcriptomics, which measures gene expression in situ on slices of tissue.  We present a novel zero-inflated hierarchical generalized transformation (ZI-HGT) model that functions as a noisy transformation for cell-type deconvolution with conditional autoregressive-based deconvolution (CARD).  CARD assumes normality of the highly zero-inflated, count-valued spatial transcriptomic data, and the ZI-HGT transforms the data to better fit this assumption.  Joined together, the ZI-HGT and CARD not only achieve enhanced cell-type deconvolution accuracy, but naturally quantify uncertainty in the estimated cell-type proportions through bootstrap Bayesian pointwise credible intervals.  This leads to a novel, exploratory ``heterogeneity score'' for quantitative assessment of cell-type heterogeneity at different locations, which is demonstrated to coincide well with pathologist-annotated tissue layer boundaries.  We apply the combined method to 12 samples of oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) data to gain a better understanding of the tumor microenvironment.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>With regard to Emergency Medical Services (EMS), the response time and consistency thatthey can provide care to in need patients is of the upmost importance. The key aspects
of achieving this efficiency lies in how the EMS vehicles are dispatched to a patient from
the currently available fleet and how they are then redistributed to best cover the area
of care. This problem can be formulated as both a Markov-Decision Process and as a
Multi-Agent Markov Game in which we can find some optimal policy to best assist those in
needs. Previous works have approached this problem in both the combined sense (considering
dispatching and redeployment as a single problem) or as two separate systems to optimize.
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been growing in popularity over the past half
decade, and applications of these advances are still underutilized for this problem. While
methods within the DRL family have been applied to this problem, they typically only
consider the dispatching or redistribution sides independently, there has been a growing field
of interest in applying one DRL policy to multiple tasks. Our approach is centered around
improving the redeployment side of the problem but we will also be exploring the benefits of
using a single policy to approach two aspects of a conjoined problem to improve the response
time and consistency of these vital services.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Properties of the space of representations of a surface group into a given simple Liegroup is a very active area of research [11, 16, 18, 1, 7, 6, 15] and is particularly relevant to
higher Teichmuller theory. For a closed surface, classical Teichmuller space is a connected
component of the moduli space of representations into PSL(2, R) and [11] showed that the
space of positive representations into PSL(k, R) coincides with the Hitchin component. In
this dissertation we study representations of finitely generated groups into PGL(k, C) and
determine necessary and sufficient conditions for such a representation to be conjugate into
PGL(k, R). In this way, we identify representations in the larger representation variety which
are conjugate in PGL(k, C) to a representation in hom (pi_1(S), PGL(k, R)) / PGL(k, R).</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>My dissertation explores publication-bias detection methods for meta-analyses of survival analysis studies. I simulated individual-level survival data and created pseudo studies that were combined in meta-analyses. I analyzed the pseudo study data using both Cox and AFT models, then submitted the studies to meta-analysis. I examined 120 conditions describing features of the meta-analyses, each studied with 500 replications. I analyzed the simulated meta-analyses of survival data using eight methods including three tests based on the trim and fill method (using the L0, R0, and Q0 estimators), the Copas-model test, and four Egger’s tests. I calculated the rejection rates of each test based on the 500 simulated meta-analyses and analyzed them via ANCOVA models. In the unbiased meta-analyses of AFT data, all tests showed type I error rates comparable to their alpha levels. In unbiased meta-analyses of Cox data, all tests except the Egger’s test at the alpha level of .05 showed low type I error rates compared to their alpha levels. In the biased meta-analyses of Cox and AFT data, all tests showed low empirical power which indicated that these traditional meta-analysis detection methods cannot detect publication bias effectively.  </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This work examines the debate between the luck and relational egalitarians. The former, including authors like Dworkin, Cohen, Arneson, Tan, and Lippert-Rasmussen, are said to view equality as deriving from the nullification of certain types of bad luck, such as by equalizing access to resources, opportunity sets, or experienced well-being. Such accounts are said to be distributive in character, as they are concerned chiefly with the way some good is distributed in a population. The latter, including authors like Anderson, Scheffler, Scanlon, and Schemmel, argue that equality consists not in any sort of distribution, such as an equal distribution of bad luck, but instead in the nature of the social relationships we are enmeshed in. When these are relations of equality, when objectionable status hierarchies are not present and individuals are treated with respect and dignity, equality obtains. I argue, in support of philosophers such as Kok-Chor Tan and Kasper Lippert-Rasmussen, that the two views are not as distinct or incompatible as generally characterized by either side of the debate. Instead, I suggest that a pluralist account which incorporates elements of both is the better choice for our egalitarian purposes. I argue for this conclusion in large part utilizing the work of Richard Rorty, whose pragmatism easily accommodates and encourages the sort of pluralism on offer. Such an account is especially important given recent advances in economics involving our understanding of the structure and behavior of capitalist systems and how they impact the mere distribution of goods. Such distributive concerns as raised by Thomas Piketty are difficult to account for if our philosophies must be entirely non-distributive in their character. Given the importance of incorporating these insights, it stands to reason that merely distributive concerns will be a part of any viable egalitarian philosophy. Broadly speaking, this work sets as its goal the defense of such distributive approaches to egalitarian philosophy.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The present work is about partially hyperbolic dynamics on closed 3-manifolds and closed periodiccurves. Partially hyperbolic systems are dynamical systems characterized by a dominated splitting
of their tangent bundle into directions of contraction, expansion and intermediate behavior. The
prime candidates of study are Anosov flows and partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms. In recent
years, these systems have gained a lot of interest, mainly in dimension 3, where there is lot of
machinery available.
In the realm of Anosov flows, the orbit structure of these systems plays a major role in understanding their properties and even helping in their classification. For skewed R-covered Anosov
flows whose weak stable foliation is transversely orientable, it was shown by Fenley [7] that any
two distinct freely homotopic periodic orbits are always isotopic. We were interested in knowing
whether this result was also true for non R-covered Anosov flows. Our first main result is to extend
this result to a class of systems generalizing Anosov flows, called topological Anosov flows. This is
theorem 34.
In contrast with Anosov flows, partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms may not exhibit a very
desirable property called dynamical coherence. This property means that the center direction of
the system integrates into a foliation. The first example of a non dynamically coherent partially
hyperbolic diffeomorphism in dimension 3 was constructed by Hertz, Hertz, and Ures [37]. The
existence of non differentiable points in curves along the center direction, is what makes the system
not dynamically coherent. Quite commonly, important invariant sets of regularity no more than C
0
appear in the study of dynamical systems whose regularity is C
1 or better. Seeing as periodic orbits
play an important role, we wonder whether a continuous embedded (possibly non differentiable)
closed periodic curve, under a partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism could be “tangent” (see remark
11.2.1) to the center direction. We show this is indeed the case in our second main result, theorem
53.

            <DISS_para>Firms struggle to credibly communicate privately with other firms, which leads them to rely on public disclosure to share information. Although public disclosure alleviates the credibility concerns of private interfirm communication, it comes with proprietary costs. Recent advances in blockchain technology provide a potential solution that allows firms to communicate on a shared, immutable, and private ledger which mitigates credibility concerns and avoids the proprietary costs of public disclosure. Thus, blockchain technology may reduce firms’ reliance on public disclosure to corroborate private interfirm communications. Using a difference-in-difference design, I find results consistent with this argument. Specifically, I find that managers, especially those of firms that likely bear greater proprietary costs of public disclosure, decrease their public disclosure following blockchain adoption. I find that this decrease in public disclosure has negative consequences, as it leads to greater analyst forecast errors. Collectively, my results suggest that although blockchain technology can improve private interfirm communication, it may have the unintended consequence of deteriorating the public information environment through reduced public disclosure. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to investigate music therapists’ perceptions of including a client's primary language in sessions. It also sought to gather relevant information regarding what tools would be most helpful to assist music therapists in including their clients’ primary language in sessions. A 12-question survey was sent to music therapists in the United States to gather data on their perceptions of including language and culture within music therapy sessions. Results revealed that majority of music therapists included in this study are not actively including different languages in sessions based on patients’ primary language. Results showed having personalized tools for learning and applying different languages is an important resource for music therapists to begin this inclusion. Findings from this survey may reveal a need for more research regarding the effects of language inclusion in music therapy sessions as well as the need for this inclusion based on client preferences. Further results and implications are discussed within this study.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Self-compassion can be understood as cultivating a gentle and understanding relationship with the self. The benefits of self-compassion for romantic relationships have been well-established in the literature. Additionally, the benefits of self-compassion for LGBTQ+ individuals has also been examined. However, no studies to date have examined the associations between self-compassion and relationship outcomes for queer couples. Furthermore, given the established connection between internalized stigma and relationship quality, it is important to consider how internalized stigma may affect this association as well. Therefore, a sample of 143 queer couples was recruited to complete an online survey that assessed demographic information, self-compassion, internalized stigma, both positive and negative relationship quality, queer consciousness, and self-esteem. The data was analyzed using an Actor-Partner Interdependence Mediation Model, or APIMeM, to identify the mediating role of internalized stigma on the actor and partner effects of self-compassion and relationship quality. Self-compassion was not found to mediate the relationship between internalized stigma and relationship quality. The decision was made, then, to explore internalized stigma as a mediator between self-compassion and relationship quality, which yielded significant indirect effects, thus supporting the idea that internalized stigma helps to explain the relationship between self-compassion and relationship quality for queer couples. Additionally, self-esteem was added as a covariate, which resulted in self-compassion no longer having any significant direct or indirect associations with any of the study variables. The clinical implications of this study highlight the importance of addressing internalized stigma in queer couples who are hoping to increase relationship quality. One such way of addressing internalized stigma may be self-compassion interventions. Future directions and additional clinical implications are discussed.  </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>High-achieving teenage students (HATS) take Advanced Placement (AP) courses to fulfill two goals: boost their grade point average (GPA) and maintain or increase their class rank. To assist in accomplishing these goals, HATS access social media (SM) and technology. Smart devices, laptops, and tablets provide easy access for HATS to build social communities where exchanging knowledge, sharing opinions, and communicating messages are related to AP. Therefore, continual access to social media communities serves as a gateway for HATS to participate in academic dishonesty (AD), which can adversely affect their performance on the AP exam but ultimately challenge the traditional models of teaching and learning. This exploratory qualitative study examines the social, behavioral, and technological worlds of HATS’ participation in AP courses. Twenty-one participants shared their perspectives through focus group interviews to answer why and how social media was used to complete AP coursework. Interview transcripts were coded using Atlas.ti, and these codes, along with prior research, revealed three themes for each research question:</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>1.  Why HATS use SM emerged into the themes of personalized learning structures, time management, and building social media communities.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>2.  How HATS used SM resulted in developing learning strategies, fact-checking, and AD.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>3.  HATS's reactions to AD included various emotions, the depths of AD considered through “morally gray” lenses, and the justifications given to rationalize AD acts.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The results reveal a need to redesign our current teaching and learning models rather than trying to catch HATS’ engaging in AD behaviors. 	</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Collegiate class piano for music majors has grown substantially since its beginnings in the mid-twentieth century and has been developed by music teachers and organizations. Research on collegiate group piano has increased in the past forty years, and literature on teaching strategies, professional development, technology, and perceptions of students is available. Presently, there have not been any post-pandemic studies which have collected instructor perceptions on collegiate group piano. Additionally, there is limited literature focusing on collegiate class piano outside the United States. The purpose of the study was to investigate the status of group piano instruction as well as instructor perceptions in universities throughout North and South America through a mixed methods investigation. To accomplish this goal, the researcher collected data from class piano instructors in universities across eight different countries within the Western Hemisphere. The questionnaire developed by the researcher served as the survey instrument for this investigation. The researcher used the data collected to analyze the program structure of collegiate group piano classes, investigate the materials, resources, and equipment used by instructors, as well as collect information about instructors’ educational backgrounds and group piano training. 
The researcher sent emails to a total of 40 universities across North, Central, and South America, and received replies from 20 universities. The number of participants for the present study was 28. 
Results from the questionnaire indicated that piano performance (36%) was the participating instructors’ most common musical concentration during their training. Other areas were reported as well such as piano pedagogy, theory/composition, collaborative piano, music education, musicology/ethnomusicology, conducting, and jazz. Out of all instructors, a slight majority (54%) had not received training specifically in group piano pedagogy. 
Data from the questionnaire revealed that the typical number of sequential semesters of class piano offered at universities was 3.55, with music theatre (M = 3.5, SD = 1.91) and theory/composition majors (M = 3.29, SD = 1.07) being required to take the most semesters. Weekly contact hours were reported to be slightly below 2 hours (M = 1.93, SD = 0.73). 
The textbook most frequently chosen from the questionnaire's list for classroom use was Alfred’s Group Piano for Adults (43%), however several instructors from South America gave titles of the books and materials that they use in their classes which gave deeper insight into the curriculum used in other countries. Names of smart device applications and websites were also shared. Of the digital tools listed in the questionnaire, the most used item across all participating countries (30%) was YouTube. 
The questionnaire also revealed significant differences in some perceptions between North and South America. When instructors were asked to rank their students’ attitudes toward the university class piano requirement, North American instructors’ rankings (M = 3.4, SD = .83) were lower than South America instructors’ rankings (M = 3.92, SD = .52). Another significant difference found between the two continents was that when asked to rank the importance of 11 skills commonly learned in class piano, South American respondents overwhelmingly rated chord progressions very highly (M = 4.7, SD = .4) whereas North American responses exhibited greater variability and an overall lower ranking (M = 4, SD = 1.13). The reason for this disparity is likely due to the manner in which chord progressions and accompaniment styles are taught in South American countries. 
Near the end of the questionnaire, instructors also shared their thoughts on the possibility of a national standard for university class piano in their countries. Those who were not in favor of a standardized curriculum mentioned that it is important to keep class content flexible, and respondents who were in favor of a national standard stated that it would be useful for more uniformity across institutions.  
According to the results from the research questionnaire, the researcher recommends that more rote teaching be implemented into North American class piano instruction to enhance the student learning experience. The researcher also proposes that while a standardized curriculum may not be necessary, more national guidelines can ensure consistency across universities to give students a strong foundation of piano fundamentals on which they can build upon if specialized skills are desired in the future. Finally, the researcher suggests embracing a more global perspective on piano pedagogy, and that instructors worldwide engage in increased international dialogue to foster sharing of repertoire, learning new pedagogical strategies, and nurturing mutual growth.

            <DISS_para>La clase universitaria de piano para estudiantes de música ha crecido sustancialmente desde sus inicios a mediados del siglo XX y ha sido desarrollada por profesores y organizaciones de música. La investigación sobre el piano de grupo universitario ha aumentado en los últimos cuarenta años y se encuentra disponible literatura sobre estrategias de enseñanza, desarrollo profesional, tecnología y percepciones de los estudiantes. Actualmente, no ha habido ningún estudio post-pandémico que haya recopilado las percepciones de los profesores sobre el piano de grupo universitario. Además, existe poca literatura centrada en clases universitarias de piano fuera de los Estados Unidos.    	 El propósito del estudio fue investigar el estado de la enseñanza de piano en grupo, así como las percepciones de los instructores en universidades de América del Norte y del Sur a través de una investigación de métodos variados. Para lograr este objetivo, el investigador recopiló datos de profesores de piano en universidades de ocho países diferentes dentro del hemisferio occidental. El cuestionario elaborado por el investigador sirvió como instrumento de encuesta para esta investigación. El investigador utilizó los datos recopilados para analizar la estructura del programa de las clases universitarias de piano en grupo, investigar los materiales, recursos y equipos utilizados por los instructores, así como recopilar información sobre los antecedentes educativos de los instructores y la formación de piano grupal.???
El investigador envió correos electrónicos a un total de 40 universidades de América del Norte, Central y del Sur, y recibió respuestas de 20 universidades. El número de participantes para este estudio fue 28.
	Los resultados del cuestionario indicaron que la interpretación del piano (36%) fue la concentración musical más común de los instructores participantes durante su formación. También se informó sobre otras áreas, como la pedagogía del piano, teoría/composición, piano colaborativo, educación musical, musicología/etnomusicología, dirección y jazz. Del total de profesores, una ligera mayoría (54%) no había recibido formación específica en pedagogía de piano en grupo.
	Los datos del cuestionario revelaron que el número típico de semestres secuenciales de clases de piano ofrecidos en las universidades era 3,55, siendo obligatorios que los de especialidad en teatro musical (M = 3,5, SD = 1,91) y teoría/composición (M = 3,29, SD = 1,07) tomaran la mayor cantidad de semestres. Se informó que las horas de contacto semanales eran ligeramente inferiores a 2 horas (M = 1,93, SD = 0,73).
	El libro de texto elegido con mayor frecuencia de la lista del cuestionario para uso en el aula fue Alfred's Group Piano for Adults (43%). Sin embargo, varios instructores de América del Sur dieron títulos de los libros y materiales que utilizan en sus clases, lo que brindó una visión más profunda del plan de estudios utilizado en otros países. También se compartieron nombres de sitios web y aplicaciones de dispositivos inteligentes. De las herramientas digitales enumeradas en el cuestionario, el elemento más utilizado en todos los países participantes (30%) fue YouTube.
	El cuestionario también reveló diferencias significativas en algunas percepciones entre América del Norte y del Sur. Cuando se pidió a los profesores que clasificaran las actitudes de sus alumnos con respecto al requisito de clases de piano en la universidad, las clasificaciones de los profesores de América del Norte (M = 3,4, SD = 0,83) fueron inferiores a las de los profesores de América del Sur (M = 3,92, SD = 0,52).  Otra diferencia significativa encontrada entre los dos continentes fue que cuando se les pidió que clasificaran la importancia de 11 habilidades comúnmente aprendidas en clase de piano, los encuestados sudamericanos de manera abrumadora dieron una calificación muy alta a las progresiones de acordes (M = 4,7, SD = 0,4), mientras que las respuestas norteamericanas mostraron una mayor variabilidad y una clasificación general más baja (M = 4, SD = 1,13). La razón de esta disparidad probablemente se deba a la forma en que se enseñan las progresiones de acordes y los estilos de acompañamiento en los países de América del Sur.
	Casi al final del cuestionario, los profesores también compartieron sus opiniones sobre la posibilidad de un estándar nacional para las clases universitarias de piano en sus países. Aquellos que no estaban a favor de un plan de estudios estandarizado mencionaron que es importante mantener flexible el contenido de las clases, y los que estaban a favor de un estándar nacional afirmaron que sería útil para lograr una mayor uniformidad entre las instituciones.
	Según los resultados del cuestionario de investigación, el investigador recomienda que se implemente más enseñanza de memoria en la instrucción de clases de piano norteamericanas para mejorar la experiencia de aprendizaje de los alumnos. El investigador también propone que, si bien puede ser que no sea necesario un plan de estudios estandarizado, más pautas nacionales pueden garantizar la uniformidad entre las universidades para brindar a los estudiantes una base sólida de fundamentos del piano sobre la cual puedan desarrollar si desean habilidades especializadas en el futuro. Finalmente, el investigador sugiere adoptar una perspectiva más global sobre la pedagogía del piano y que los instructores de todo el mundo participen en un mayor diálogo internacional para fomentar el intercambio de repertorio, aprender nuevas estrategias pedagógicas y fomentar el crecimiento mutuo.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>To this day, the origins and prognosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pose significant challenges. This thesis presents a methodology to understand AD by systematically applying state-of-the-art techniques from graph neural networks (GNNs) to medical images, producing a set of individualized graphs suitable for analysis. We accomplish this task by defining a latent graph variable as an intermediate latent variable inferred in a machine learning task. As one of the first researchers to explore the use of GNNs with medical images, this thesis begins with simple machine learning tasks that gradually increase in complexity. In particular, the thesis is organized into the following four main parts: (1) establishing a baseline with standard attention-based models applied to gray matter and PET probability regions of interest (ROIs), (2) developing a 3D-CNN model for processing voxel images directly to infer a latent graph more interpretable and closely aligned to known forms of connectivity within the brain, (3) learning latent graphs for a challenging network diffusion task with synthetic and real longitudinal datasets, (4) and developing a pipeline based on statistical analysis and metrics for comparing the learned latent graphs to baseline graphs derived from standard methods to assess the performance of the latent graphs.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Our experiments show that the careful application of GNNs to medical images can provide a suitable inductive bias to enhance performance compared to standard baselines such as support vector machines and multilayer perceptrons. The latent graph connectivity structure learned from our new 3D-CNN-GNN model alone is significant enough to achieve state-of-the-art precision when differentiating between patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who will progress to AD and those who will maintain an MCI diagnosis, providing a set of interpretable features to uncover the mysteries surrounding AD.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Throughout the course of history, women have often been relegated to the margins ofsociety. The cultural and societal expectations kept them on the sidelines and in the footnotes of
history books. Historically, women were not allowed to be composers or performers of music,
especially of brass instruments until the twentieth-century. This has left a gap in the repertoire of
women-composed music before the 1900s.
During the nineteenth-century, many women composers produced quality music within
the boundaries that society set upon them—music for voice, piano, or sometimes stringed
instruments. Unfortunately, compositions for brass instruments such as French horn were seen as
a masculine endeavor and most women composers avoided composing for them until the
twentieth- and twenty-first- centuries.
This document features six compositions by Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel, Clara
Schumann, and Josephine Lang transcribed and arranged for French horn. The compositions
include Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel’s Schwanenlied from 6 Lieder, op. 1 and Abendbild from 5
Lieder, op. 10; Clara Weick Schumann’s Liebst du um Schönheit from Op. 12 No. 14 and Warum
Willst du And’re Frangen; and Josephine Lang’s Wenn zwei Voneinander Scheiden and Wie
glänzt so hell.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>First we show that, since 2000 the U.S. federal government has imposed over $600 billion in penalties and spent over $5 billion in preventing fraud. Yet 87% of firms re-offend, which raises the question, is punishment effective? We analyze the effectiveness of federal monetary sanctions using U.S. courts’ five criminal law rationales for punishment: retribution, specific deterrence, general deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation. We show that punishment has the largest effects on retribution and rehabilitation. We measure that a $1,000,000 increase in annual sanctions is associated with 3% decrease in firm value, as measured by Tobin’s Q, and a 57% improvement in Li et.al(2020) strong culture , which we use as a proxy for firm culture. We find substantial evidence that punishment effectiveness is aggravated by firm reputation, governance, and political connectedness. Next, we investigate the impact of government subsidies on corporate financial strategies, focusing on payout policies, debt reduction, and asset management. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset and employing methods to address endogeneity, we provide evidence that firms significantly alter their financial behaviors following the receipt of government subsidies. Specifically, we find evidence that firms increase payouts to shareholders, predominantly through share repurchases, after receiving subsidies. This behavior underscores a preference for returning value to shareholders when external financing conditions are favorable. We further observe a shift towards debt reduction, indicating a concerted effort to optimize capital structure and reduce financial risk. Contrary to initial hypotheses, the anticipated increase in asset investments is not sustained when endogeneity concerns are addressed, suggesting that the immediate response to subsidies does not translate into long-term asset growth. Further, our analysis identifies distinct shifts in firm behavior in theaftermath of significant economic events, during the dot-com bubble burst and the 2007 financial crisis. These periods reflect a change in how firms allocate subsidized resources, highlighting the influence of economic context on corporate financial decisions. This paper notes that while firms react strongly to both negative and positive shocks from the government, the reaction by firms to negative government shocks are broader.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This paper explores modern Bosniak, Serbian, and Bulgarian oral-traditional epic, three closely related Balkan cultures and traditions linked through cross-border exchange and commonality of experience within the Ottoman ecumene. The dominant gender code for men in these borderland societies of the early modern Balkans was epic masculinity, as illustrated in heroic songs (BCS junacke pjesme and Bulgarian junaški pesni.) Through my reading of these heroic songs, I identify a perplexing, submerged theme—feminine roles that scold, censure, and punish failures in epic masculinity. I argue that, ultimately, these expressions of scolding, mocking, vulgarity, and curses serve as a mechanism to maintain and reinforce epic masculinity. Moreover, this study proposes that this function may be an extension of women’s child rearing role. Through examination of these female roles and their expressions in heroic epic and non-heroic epic, this study seeks to recover aspects of epic femininity in oral-traditional narrative song and hypothesize as to women’s gender roles in their heroic Slavic borderland communities of the Balkans.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Works for unaccompanied horn written by straight, white, cisgender male composers are often more accessible than those written by underrepresented composers, information about these works is more readily available than those composed by underrepresented composers. Despite this, there is a plethora of works written by underrepresented composers for unaccompanied horn that are beneficial to learn and program. This treatise provides detailed information about selected repertoire for unaccompanied horn composed by women, black, brown, indigenous, Asian (BBIA), and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, plus (LGBTQ+) composers. Reference note cards provide information a performer would need to consider when searching for repertoire to program, such as the difficulty of the work, what equipment is needed, the setting of the work, and the background of the composer. Three pieces of varying difficulty from those provided in this treatise are further explored through interviews with the composers and a structural analysis. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Phanerozoic is typically known as an interval in which complex life has developed and thrived. However, there are multiple instances throughout this era in which climatic shifts and extinctions have made it difficult for the development of life. One of the most notable factors affecting marine biota throughout the Phanerozoic is the presence (or lack thereof) of oxygen; thus, better constraining the redox conditions of the ocean is vital during intervals of rapid change. One means to do this is through the development and improvement of novel and useful redox proxies, such as thallium (Tl) isotopes. Using marine sediments off the coasts of California, Mexico, and Peru, various low oxygen conditions were analyzed for Tl isotopes to expand settings known to record seawater values. This work expanded previous studies that failed to look into more suboxic settings and showed that the most accurate seawater records can be found in anoxic environments with elevated sulfide content in pore waters, with other less reducing conditions showing a range of values between seawater and sources. Applying this proxy to the end-Permian mass event (EPME), there are notable shifts in Tl isotopes. Not only was there a visible change towards more anoxic conditions earlier than other proxies can determine, but there was also a sudden rapid negative excursion that indicated short-term oxygenation at the onset of the extinction interval, contributing to the massive loss of life through rapid redox fluctuations. Continuing this work to the next minor extinction event chronologically, the Smithian-Spathian extinction provides a persistence of the low-oxygen conditions that was present at the very beginning of the Triassic following the EPME as well as transient redox fluctuations at the extinction interval. Lastly, to better constrain these anoxic events, a model of oxygen across Oceanic Anoxic Event 2 and the Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event was applied. Using these well-studied events, a model comparing excessive oxygen production from burial of organic carbon and pyrite sulfur to large igneous province erupted reductants was created, the results of which showed a large influx of reductants is capable of balancing much of the excess oxygen that should be produced during anoxic events. All of these projects show the importance of redox to understanding the development of Earth’s systems, which in turn affected the development of life on the planet throughout the Phanerozoic.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Infrastructure systems are the backbone of modern civilization, supporting our cities, economies, and way of life. Yet, they do not exist in isolation. They are continually influenced by a multitude of external social, economic, and environmental factors. These impacts may affect the structure of the built environment over time (i.e., through the evolutionary process) or the interplays between and within subsystems, thus causing emergent behaviors. In anticipation of the immense complexity of the built environment and the diversity of the influential factors, the major research challenge is finding an approach that yields engineering solutions to understand how, when, and why the evolutionary and emergent behavior of a system occurs. Answering such questions is the first step toward developing adaptive, preventive, or corrective plans and programs to enhance infrastructure resilience to external dynamics. This research proposes a framework to facilitate understanding the impact mechanisms of the external factors causing infrastructure evolution. Such knowledge is necessary to determine how a behavior evolves throughout a system. Given the diversity of the factors affecting the infrastructure system, an overwhelming amount of information needs to be continuously monitored and analyzed to comprehend the changing nature of the built environment. To address these challenges, the proposed framework uses multivariate analysis methods to identify and detect the most influential external factors driving the behaviors of the built environment system of systems. Dynamic factor models are developed to construct a composite index framework that (1) monitors and analyzes large volumes of information from numerous external factors impacting the system, (2) detects changes in the trends of the influential factors, and identifies how these changes originated within the system, and (3) analyzes how the internal system dynamics are influenced by external impacts.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this research project is to provide insight into 3D GM methods in regard to lithic artifact research and provide data that allows a better understanding of the variables that affect a 3D GM study and the importance of the third dimension when investigating adzes. Geometric Morphometrics (GM) quantifies the shape variation of objects while controlling for variables such as scale, size, translation, and rotation then utilizes multivariate statistics to identify trends in the data. GM maintains the shape of an object more than traditional linear measurements so that morphological comparisons can be more comprehensive than traditional linear measurements. Most of the archaeological studies that utilize GM in American archaeology focus on skeletal remains and bifacial lithic points. While 3D GM analyses of skeletal remains are often employed, the lithic analyses have largely been restricted to 2D analyses for reasons that will be covered in this thesis. Because there are not many 3D studies on lithic tools, a portion of this research will be dedicated to refining 3D GM digitization and model construction of thick lithic tools in an effort to help standardize 3D GM analysis so that the comparisons of different research projects are more robust and error introduction is better understood. The results of this analysis provided ways to increase the efficiency of 3D GM studies and indicated that the third dimension accounted for a majority of the variation present in adze morphology, suggesting that a 2D analysis would be insufficient to understand the morphological trends found within this tool type. These methods were also used to analyze a sample of adzes from three different sites as well as an assemblage with unknown provenience. When adze morphology was compared to the site locations, regional trends were able to be identified. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>ADHD is a behavioral cognitive correlate of achievement associated with lower reading performance. The externalizing and internalizing symptoms that characterize ADHD behaviors negatively impact the engagement of students experiencing reading difficulties and the ability to regulate attention and behavior during the reading acquisition process. There is also considerable comorbidity between ADHD and reading-related learning disabilities driven by genetic and environmental pathways. This poses challenges for interventions (i.e., an environmental factor) containing reading instruction designed to improve the reading performance of children who may be exhibiting ADHD behaviors. This study examined the associations between ADHD behaviors and response to reading instruction, using a diverse sample of at-risk kindergarten and first-grade children (N = 715) across 67 classrooms who participated in a randomized control trial evaluating the Individualized Student Instruction (ISI) reading intervention. A structural equation modeling approach assessed teacher-rated ADHD behaviors predicting response to instruction across several teacher-implemented instructional reading approaches (ISI vs. BAU). Qualitative differences in the associations based on the operationalization of ADHD behaviors (i.e., inattention, hyperactivity-impulsivity, and combined) were examined. Exploratory analyses were performed to examine whether the association between ADHD behaviors and children's response to reading instruction significantly differed by instructional group. Several subscales of the SWAN Rating scale measured ADHD behaviors. Response to instruction was based on residual gain scores in reading-related skills measured as a composite of decoding and expressive vocabulary skills from subtests of the Woodcock-Johnson III Tests of Achievement. A statistically significant negative relation was found between the ADHD behaviors and response to instruction. Higher teacher-rated ADHD behaviors predicted lower SDs in response to reading instruction. Qualitatively, the combined ADHD behaviors produced the strongest association and explained the most variance than the other ADHD behaviors. Exploratory analyses suggested that there were significant instructional group differences for inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity but not the combined ADHD behaviors. The multiple-group models favored the ISI group. ADHD behaviors and response to instruction were more strongly related to lower responsiveness to instruction in the BAU group compared to ISI. This study highlights the role of distinct ADHD behaviors in early reading-related skills in response to reading instruction. These preliminary analyses have implications for classroom-based reading instructional practices and empirically replicating evidence to understand the influence of ADHD behaviors on efforts to remediate poor reading in children.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The destruction of vast tropical forests poses a threat to both globally significant biodiversity and carbon storage. Tropical deforestation and degradation are complex phenomena driven by a combination of proximate causes, such as agricultural expansion, wood extraction, infrastructure development, and biophysical conditions, as well as broader underlying drivers, including economic, demographic, technological, and cultural factors. Here we present a comprehensive synthesis of case-based studies (n = 199) that identified proximate causes and/or underlying drivers of tropical deforestation or degradation, and quantified forest cover loss. Latin America emerged as the most frequently studied region, accounting for 42.2% of all cases. Agriculture stood out as the most commonly identified proximate cause of deforestation across all regions, constituting 84.9% of cases and was frequently identified in conjunction with other proximate causes. While recent research has emphasized the role of agricultural expansion as a prominent contributor to tropical forest cover change, we show that agricultural expansion rarely occurs in isolation. Biophysical factors, such as droughts, wildfires, and pest outbreaks, also played a significant role in forest cover loss in all regions. Rates of forest cover loss associated with different proximate causes did not appear to differ. We further examined the ability of common satellite vegetation indices of “greenness”, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), to capture changes in tropical deforestation or degradation after forest cover loss was detected in primary studies. We found that these indices failed to show reduced greenness after forest cover loss was identified. In some cases, these indices showed increased greenness, presumably owing to conversion to intensive commercial agriculture. It appears that only in cases of complete vegetation loss from infrastructure projects such as forest conversion to roads or buildings, did NDVI and EVI decrease after forest cover loss was detected. Our results suggest that strategies for the prevention and mitigation of tropical forest cover loss should not only consider the role of agricultural expansion but also how agriculture interacts with other proximate causes. Furthermore, the vulnerability of these forests to environmental stressors is important to consider given the prominent role of biophysical factors in forest cover loss. Lastly, although NDVI and EVI are widely used in large-scale analysis of vegetation change, they appear to capture only the near-complete loss of vegetation and may be insufficient to detect other ecological impacts of tropical forest cover change.

            <DISS_para>The photophysical and photochemical properties and the photoconversion scope and mechanism of di- and triaryl-substituted-1,2,3-triazoles are reported in this work. The ease of synthesis of regioisomers of substituted triazoles enables a systematic study on the correlation between regiochemistry and excited state properties, which include the solvent dependence of fluorescence, energy gap between singlet and triplet emitters, and propensity to photon-triggered transformations. Triazoles that carry electron (e)-donor and e-acceptor aryl substituents show high fluorescence quantum yields in weakly polar solvents and exhibit solvent-dependent fluorescence. The luminescence properties of these compounds in glass matrices at 77 K and the thermal and photo-stability of these compounds are determined. The position of the e-donor substituent has a significant impact on the fluorescence emission energy and solvent sensitivity, singlet-triplet energy gap, and photochemical reactivity and stability. Quantum chemical calculations were used to explain the experimental observations on the structural correlation with the photophysical and photochemical properties. The photochemical reactivity in the triazole conversion to indole was leveraged to study the reaction mechanism and intermediates (carbene and azirine). A new method for the synthesis of 5-cyanotriazoles was developed to expand the scope of the photoconversion of triazoles into indoles. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Understanding how a single genome can produce drastically different phenotypes is a central themein evolutionary biology. It requires a keen understanding of the ecological, molecular, and genomic
regulatory mechanisms driving phenotypic, often adaptive variation. As complex traits with clear
fitness implications and well-defined genotype-phenotype maps, venoms represent practical systems
for evaluating the interplay between phenotypic change and genetic regulation. In addition, as
approximately 15% of all animals are venomous, studying venomous animals will likely have wide-
ranging impacts for the ecosystems in which they inhabit. Furthermore, the tendency for venom
proteins to target specific physiological systems and pathways makes them excellent resources for
bioprospecting novel therapeutic compounds. However, most research on venom has focused on
snakes, which only represent a small proportion of venomous animals. Conversely, invertebrates,
which represent a disproportionately large number of venomous animals, have historically received
a disproportionately low level of research attention. Although not as charismatic as their reptilian
counterparts, research on venomous invertebrates benefits from lower regulatory pressures, often
trivial sampling methods, reduced maintenance effort and cost, and significantly diminished safety
risks. For this research in this doctoral dissertation, we use scorpions and centipedes to evaluate
the molecular and genomic regulatory mechanisms underlying the evolution of invertebrate venoms
and make the case for a scorpion as model species.
In Chapter 1, we begin our work at the ecological by assessing rates of venom regeneration in one
scorpion and one centipede species. As biochemical traits with clear fitness consequences, venoms
serve a critical ecological role for the animals that produce them. Understanding how venoms
are maintained and regenerated after use will, therefore, provide valuable insight into the ecology
of venomous animals. Furthermore, most studies on venomous organisms often require removing
animals from the wild and waiting extended periods of time between venom extractions. Uncovering
the patterns of venom regeneration across different species will likely lead to the development
of more efficient venom extraction protocols, reducing both experimental time and the number
of animals required. Using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, we identified
asynchronous regeneration of venom protein component abundances in the centipede Scolopendra
viridis but found no evidence for asynchronous venom regeneration in the scorpion Centruroides
hentzi. We also observed high levels of intraspecific venom variation in C. hentzi, emphasizing the
importance of testing for intraspecific venom variation in studies evaluating the synchronicity of
venom regeneration. Although the regeneration of relative venom protein component abundances
is an asynchronous process in S. viridis, we provide evidence that the presence-absence of major
venom components is not an asynchronous process and suggest that studies relying on just the
presence/absence of individual proteins (e.g. bioprospecting, drug discovery) could use catch-and-
release methods of venom extraction to reduce the number of animals removed from the wild.
In Chapter 2, we leverage high-throughput sequencing technologies to evaluate the genetic ba-
sis for sex-biased gene expression in centipede. Sexually dimorphic traits are widespread across
metazoans and are often the result of sex-specific inheritance or sex-based differences in gene ex-
pression. Intersexual differences have even been observed in invertebrate venoms, although the
identification of these differences has been limited to the more well-studied groups, such as scor-
pions and spiders, where sex-based differences in morphology and behavior are apparent. Recent
studies on centipede venom have identified evidence of intraspecific variation, but intersexual dif-
ferences have not been reported. To investigate the potential for sex-based differences in centipede
venom composition, we performed reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-
HPLC) analyses on five male and 15 female eastern bark centipedes (Hemiscolopendra marginata)
from the Apalachicola National Forest in northern Florida. After detecting a significant sex-based
difference in H. marginata venom composition, we completed a high-throughput venom-gland tran-
scriptomic and venom proteomic analysis of one male and one female to determine the genetic basis
for differences in venom composition. We identified 47 proteomically confirmed toxins and 717
nontoxin transcripts in H. marginata venom-glands. Of these proteomically confirmed toxins, the
most abundantly expressed in the male venom included ion channel-modulating toxins and toxins so
divergent from any characterized homologs that they could not be given a functional classification,
whereas the most abundantly expressed in the female venom were γ-glutamyl transferases and CAPs
(cysteine-rich secretory proteins, antigen 5, and pathogenesis-related 1 proteins). These differences
were then confirmed by performing replicate LC-MS/MS analyses on the venom from an additional
three male and three female H. marginata. Our RP-HPLC and high-throughput transcriptomic and
proteomic approach resulted in not only an in-depth characterization of H. marginata venom, but
represents the first example of sex-based variation in centipede venoms.
In Chapter 3, we shift towards improving our understanding of scorpion venom protein diver-
sity by characterizing the venom from one species of an underrepresented genus. Scorpion venoms
have long been studied for their peptide discovery potential, with modern high-throughput venom-
characterization techniques paving the way for the discovery of thousands of novel putative toxins.
Research into these toxins has provided insight into the pathology and treatment of human diseases,
even resulting in the development of one compound with Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
approval. Although most of this research has focused on the toxins of scorpion species considered
medically significant to humans, the venom of harmless scorpion species possess toxins that are
homologous to those from medically significant species, indicating that harmless scorpion venoms
may also serve as valuable sources of novel peptide variants. Furthermore, as harmless scorpions
represent a vast majority of scorpion species diversity, and therefore venom toxin diversity, venoms
from these species likely contain entirely new toxin classes. We sequenced the venom-gland tran-
scriptome and venom proteome of two male Big Bend scorpions (Diplocentrus whitei), providing
the first high-throughput venom characterization for a member of this genus. We identified a total
of 82 toxins in the venom of D. whitei, 25 of which were identified in both the transcriptome and
proteome, and 57 of which were only identified in the transcriptome. Furthermore, we identified
a unique, enzyme-rich venom dominated by serine proteases and the first arylsulfatase B toxins
identified in scorpions.
In Chapter 4, we evaluate the molecular signatures of selection underlying the evolution of giant
desert hairy scorpion venoms. Venoms are primarily believed to evolve under strong diversifying
selection resulting from persistent coevolution between predator and prey. Recent research has
challenged this hypothesis, proposing that venoms from younger venomous lineages (e.g., snakes
and cone snails) are governed predominantly by diversifying selection, while venoms from older
venomous lineages (e.g., centipedes, scorpions, and spiders) are under stronger purifying selection.
However, most research in older lineages has tested selection at more diverse phylogenetic scales. Al-
though these tests are important for evaluating broad macroevolutionary trends underlying venom
evolution, they are less equipped to detect species-level evolutionary trends, which likely have large
impacts on venom variation seen at more diverse phylogenetic scales. To test for selection among
closely related species from an older venomous lineage, we generated high-throughput venom-gland
transcriptomes and venom proteomes for four populations of Giant Desert Hairy Scorpions (Hadru-
rus), including three Hadrurus arizonensis populations and one Hadrurus spadix population. We
detected significant episodic and pervasive diversifying selection across a highly abundant toxin
family that likely has a major role in venom function (αKTxs), providing a contrast to the stronger
purifying selection identified from other studies on scorpion venoms. Conversely, we detected weak
episodic diversifying and/or stronger purifying selection in four toxin families (non-disulfide bridged
peptides, phospholipase A2s, scorpine-like antimicrobial peptides, and serine proteases), most of
which were less abundant and likely have ancillary functional roles. Finally, although we detected
several major toxin families at disproportionate transcriptomic and/or proteomic abundances, we
did not identify significant sex-based variation in Hadrurus venoms.
In Chapter 5, we broaden our focus to not only test for sex-biased venom genes in a sexually di-
morphic scorpion, but also evaluate the genomic and epigenomic landscape underlying those venom
genes. Unfortunately, while our knowledge of how phenotypic variation is influenced by changes
in ecology, environment, gene number, and gene sequence is the result of work in a diverse set of
systems, our understanding of complex, genomic regulatory networks stems primarily from research
on human cells and model systems. Because studies in these systems are not typically paired with
ecological experiments, much of the important context underlying the evolution of genomic regula-
tory networks is missing. With the emergence of novel genomic methodologies and their continually
increasing efficiency and decreasing costs, non-model systems, such as venoms, have become sen-
sible, effective systems for studying how the epigenomic landscape influences variation in complex
traits. However, as previously discussed, much of what we know about the genomic and epigenomic
landscape underlying venom genes is the result of studies in venomous snakes. In most venomous
taxa, venom genes are primarily organized into large tandem arrays of duplicated genes on a subset
of chromosomes, with few exceptions. Generating a comprehensive understanding of the genomic
landscape of venomous systems requires the generation of high quality reference genomes for mem-
bers of all venomous lineages. Therefore, to resolve the genomic architecture for scorpion venom
genes, we assembled the first chromosome-level genome for the Hentz striped scorpion (Centruroides
hentzi). We also tested for sex-based differences in (1) differential expression of venom genes with
RNA-seq, (2) differential chromatin accessibility using Cleavage Under Targeted Accessible Chro-
matin (CUTAC), (3) differential H3K27ac histone modification using Cleavage Under Targets and
Tagmentation (CUT&amp;Tag), and (4) diet using PCR detection of arthropod-specific cytochrome c
oxidase I genes. With this multifaceted approach, we not only provide a broad perspective of the
ecological and genomic regulatory mechanisms underlying the evolution of scorpion venom genes,
but make the case for C. hentzi as a model system.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This work was designed to provide insight into how a disaster of historical proportions, in this case the COVID pandemic, influenced the work foreign language (L2) teachers in an English as a foreign language (EFL) setting.  The research was situated within the framework of positive psychology (Seligman, 2011), with the investigation of the interactions of hope, metacognition, and teaching practices. In this work, Hope was understood to be a cognitive construct that refers to setting goals, finding pathways to achieve those goals, and using agency to persevere in those paths or find alternative ones (Snyder, 2002, 2005, 2018). This research hypothesized that the levels of hope experienced by L2 teachers were connected with other events in the classroom.  The questions addressed in this research include the following:
1.	What is the relationship between hope, metacognition, and foreign language teachers’ practice during a period of intense global difficulty?
2.	Is L2 teacher metacognition a mediating variable between hope and teacher practices? 
3.	What other aspects of L2 teacher hope, L2 teacher metacognition, and L2 teacher practices can be identified through teachers’ reports of their teaching experiences during a period of intense global difficulty? 
Within an explanatory sequential mixed methods design, and using Likert surveys and interviews, I examined whether the levels of teacher hope, teacher metacognition and teacher practices were associated. The instruments used in in this research were the dispositional hope scale (DHS) (Snyder et al., 1991), the Language Teacher Metacognitive Inventory (LTMI) (Hiver et al., 2021; Jiang et al., 2016), and the Postsecondary Instructional Practices Survey (PIPS) (Walter et al., 2016). Interviews were conducted to provide complementary evidence of teacher hope levels, metacognition, and teacher practices of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) teachers during COVID-19. The High Leverage Teaching practices proposed by Glisan and Donato (2017) complemented the interview in regard to teacher practices as they supplement the 10 macrostrategies introduced by Kumaravadivelu (2006).  The research questions were analyzed following a factorial confirmative approach, in which the components of each of the surveys were used to build the constructs they represent, and hypothesis were tested on them. This analysis included an exploratory factor analysis to examine internal reliability and a subsequent confirmatory factor analysis to do the actual testing of the underlying factor structure existence. Afterwards, the mediation analysis was achieved by fitting a SEM model and contrast the pathways among L2 teacher, hope, L2 teacher metacognition, and L2 teacher practices. Teacher interviews complemented the quantitative results, as four the four themes that emerged from the qualitative analysis (i.e., Foreign language teacher goals and pathway thinking, Foreign Language Teachers’ Coping Strategies, Teachers’ Metacognitive Classroom Experience, and Interaction in the Foreign Language Class) provided additional insights from participating teachers. Structural equation modeling suggested that L2 teacher metacognition is a significant mediator of the relationship structure between hope and instructional practices for the population under study.  These findings speak to a connection between teacher hope, teacher metacognition, and teacher practices for L2 teachers during a period of social upheaval, something that can pave the way for other researchers working with teachers in different disciplines and during different periods of time. An important conclusion from this study was that understanding these constructs separately, their components and their connection may influence how teachers think about their profession with a view of improving of what they do in the classroom. Finally, tertiary teacher preparation institutions may be encouraged to measure these constructs in order to target interventions to influence how teachers think about their profession with a view of improvement.

            <DISS_para>The Battery State of Charge (SOC) is the parameter representing the fraction of a battery’s remaining available energy to its fully charged state. The Battery SOC is one of the most important parameters of an electric vehicle’s (EV) Battery Management System (BMS) as it is used for battery pack balancing, estimating available power, battery safety control, and providing users with available runtime. Electric Vehicle mostly uses lithium-ion battery because of its high energy density which comes with a cost of complex non-linear dynamic system. Lithium-ion batteries are susceptible to over-charging and undercharging because of their inherent properties. Their dynamic properties also tend to change with ambient temperature, operating current, SOC, and operating voltage. Hence requires a complex Battery Management System (BMS) to effectively manage the dynamic parameters. SOC is one of the most important intermediate parameters required for effective EV battery management. In addition, the life cycle of lithium-ion batteries is also a function of its operating SOC.  Unfortunately, EV battery SOC cannot be measured directly due to lack of parameter linearly proportional to its available energy. Hence it requires complex estimation algorithms to achieve an accurate SOC estimate. It is often the case that conventional EV SOC management system over-compensates the SOC error estimates at the cost of usable energy.  Another common challenge with conventional algorithms is their inability to reconverge quickly from erroneous initialization. Quick convergence and fast SOC estimation algorithm is also required in EV for fast charging. 
This research proposes a novel ensemble algorithm that uses a weighted estimate of the Central Difference Kalman Filter (CDKF) and Nonlinear Autoregressive with Exogenous Input (NARX) to estimate SOC.  The proposed method   improves the accuracy of SOC estimates in comparison to convention ensemble SOC estimation methods especially at low temperature. The method introduces an SOC estimation technique which converges quickly from large erroneous initialization state, this is particularly useful in super-fast EV charging technology. Finally, the proposed method provides robust and reliable SOC estimates. The robustness of the proposed method is tested under various drive cycles and temperatures. The estimator provides a reliability indicator in the form of a convergence covariance which indicates how close the estimate is to the true value.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In the theory of wave propagation, several important nonlinear dispersive systems are known to be integrable – that is, exactly solvable by linear techniques. Such systems are typically characterized by the existence of an infinite number of conserved quantities, a Hamiltonian structure, the admittance of soliton solutions, and many other rich mathematical properties. The primary focus of this thesis is a study of integrable systems that are nonlocal in the sense that they possess a reflected and shifted spatial and/or temporal argument. Chapter 1 serves as an informal overview of the field of integrable partial differential equations and an introduction to this nonlocal variety. Chapter 2 provides a detailed analysis of the solution process, known as the inverse scattering transform (IST) method, for several examples of nonlocal integrable systems. The IST is developed and solutions are constructed for nonlocal variants of the nonlinear Schr ̈odinger (NLS) equation, the modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation, and the semi-discrete Ablowitz-Ladik (AL) lattice.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The secondary subject of this thesis is beam propagation in non-Hermitian optical media. In this context, non-Hermiticity refers to the presence of a complex-valued index of refraction, where the imaginary part is interpreted as a distribution of gain and loss of power (which in this case in not conserved). Such systems have been shown (theoretically and experimentally) to possess many counter-intuitive properties, one of which is the existence of constant-intensity (CI) waves that can propagate through the medium without diffracting. In Chapter 3, special types of these CI waves are introduced and their properties and further implications, including their usefulness in the study of dispersive hydrodynamics in non-Hermitian media, are discussed.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>These two topics are unified by the fact that they both center around NLS-type models in which certain fundamental properties such as conservation of power and translational invariance are lost. In the latter case, this is due to a complex external potential, while in the former case this is due to a nonlocal self-induced potential.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The poems in No More Games explore the cyclical and complex relations of religion, loss of faith, newly found love, immigration, the female body, and the Anthropocene in a linguistically hybrid landscape. These poems track the internal and the external world of a speaker who has immigrated from Turkey to America at a young age, as the geographical landscape in which the poems are set vary from Turkey to Kyrgyzstan to America. While influenced by contemporary poets, the manuscript aims at shedding light onto an encounter that is rarely highlighted in contemporary American poetry: the loss of religion, specifically Islam, in a particularly Islamophobic American sphere and the complications that may occur from such an encounter. The speaker of the poems is concerned with similar tensions, including the impending climate crisis, the metamorphoses of cultural identity as a Turkish-American, and the effects of violence upon the female body inflicted by a patriarchal figure. These tensions are navigated by the words of Gloria Anzaldúa in Borderlands/La Frontera, when she writes “I feel perfectly free to rebel and to rail against my culture” (43). She adds to this phrase by stating “Yet in leaving home I did not lose touch with my origins because lo mexicano is in my system. I am a turtle, wherever I go I carry “home” on my back” (43). This idea becomes the compass for No More Games, as the speaker in the poems both rebels and is loyal to the roots which haunt the self, whether those roots are Islam, the patriarchal aspects of Turkish and American culture, or recording the collective cry of an aging world while immersed in love. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation delves into the factors that motivate business students to enroll in internship courses at Florida State University's College of Business, as well as the satisfaction they experience with these internships. Using a quantitative approach rooted in Self-Determination Theory, the study utilizes the Academic Motivation Scale (AMS) (Vallerand et al., 1993) and the Instructional Materials Motivation Scale (IMMS) (Reference) to determine students' intrinsic and extrinsic motivations and their satisfaction with internship experiences. The research provides an understanding of how internships align with students' educational and professional goals, highlighting the role of academic curricula and external influences in shaping their decisions. Findings indicate the dominance of extrinsic motivations, particularly identified regulation, over intrinsic factors. While participants expressed moderate intrinsic motivation, emphasizing the "To Experience Stimulation" regulatory style, satisfaction levels, measured by the IMMS, revealed a moderate trend. Higher satisfaction correlated with the successful completion of course modules and engagement in a well-designed course. Robust correlations between intrinsic motivations and satisfaction underscored the significance of autonomy. Notably, identified regulation within extrinsic motivations significantly correlated with satisfaction, particularly concerning career decision-making. The findings have implications for developing internship programs, emphasizing the importance of aligning these programs with students' career aspirations and ensuring that they offer meaningful, practical learning experiences.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Fates of Man, a series of four polychrome wooden sculptures attributed to Indigenous artist Manuel “Caspicara” Chili, made in Quito, Ecuador in c. 1775, stands as one of the primary examples of the artwork produced by the Quito school. Characterized by their emotionality, the four figures represent the iconographical program of The Last Things, a Catholic visual convention demonstrating the four endings that await the soul once the material body has passed on, including Death, Soul in Heaven, Soul in Hell, and Soul in Purgatory. By considering this group within the complex and ever-changing historical landscape of the colonial Andes, the figure of the skeleton takes on a broad multivalent meaning. Through the examination of the skeleton within the European and Andean iconographic canons, the figure of Death in Caspicara’s devotional program becomes a means of thinking about the complex worldviews of the eighteenth-century Andes that informed the various viewer perceptions of Catholic imagery in the region. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>As governments and other organizations worldwide increase their investment in research, the demand for skilled research administrators grows. Researchers need knowledgeable administrators to provide guidance and ensure their projects are administratively managed according to required policies and guidelines. Institutions must ensure their audit risk is managed appropriately without creating unnecessary burdens and hardships for their researchers. With a lack of academic programs in research administration, most research administration professionals enter the field with limited to no understanding of research administration. The need for research administration training programs is high. To address Florida State University’s (FSU) needs in this area, the Office of the Vice President for Research (OVPR) staff developed and implemented a research administration certification program. All FSU research administrators must complete the eSPEAR Research Administration Certification Program within six months of starting their position.Florida State University (FSU) has invested staff time and other resources into developing and delivering this program. FSU wishes to evaluate the value provided to FSU’s research community by eSPEAR and identify where changes or expansion would bring value. While FSU’s OVPR requests feedback from participants following the training, this provides only a snapshot of the learner’s experience immediately following the completion of the program. No industry-accepted method for evaluating research administration training programs exists. Kirkpatrick’s Four Levels of Evaluation, which looks at learner satisfaction, learning, behavior, and return on expectations,  provides a model that could potentially fill this void.
This study uses Kirkpatrick’s Four Levels of Evaluation to evaluate FSU’s eSPEAR Program. Information was gathered from learners who completed the training, their supervisors, the researchers they support, those involved in developing eSPEAR, and members of FSU’s Council of Associate Deans for Research (CADR). Overall, favorable feedback was received from learners and their supervisors. The response rate from researchers, CADR members, and those involved in developing eSPEAR was lower. Their responses were broad, with some highly favorable and others unfavorable. Many respondents answered with neutral answers, mainly due to their lack of direct knowledge. The study results provided insights into what works well with the program and where additional content, or further training development is needed.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This qualitative case study describes how American Repertory Theater (ART) and Harvard University (Harvard) decision-makers perceive the exchange that occurs through their partnership. Since the majority of nonprofit theaters in the United States struggle with sustainability (Fonner et al., 2020), and affiliations support sustainable operations for nonprofits (Álvarez-González, 2017; Mandel &amp; Brudney, 2018; Shumate, 2018; Sowa, 2008), this study ultimately profiles this one specific affiliation to promote awareness of a theater and higher education affiliation model. The study uses social exchange theory (Burgess et al., 1979; Homans, 1958) as a theoretical framework. Pragmatism (Dewey, 1948; James, 1928) as a philosophical worldview informed the study. This case study explores three research questions: (1) What do Harvard and ART decision-makers perceive that each entity gives through the exchange? (2) What do Harvard and ART decision-makers perceive each entity gets from the exchange? and (3) What is each entity’s level of relationship commitment and propensity to leave the affiliation? Jeong and Oh’s (2017) business-to-business social exchange model served as a framework for answering research question three. This case study used content analysis (Schreier et al., 2019) and interviews (McGrath et al., 2019) to collect data and coding (Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1990) to analyze the data. To enhance the study’s trustworthiness, member checking (Birt et al., 2016) served as a form of structural corroboration (Eisner, 1991). 
Through the findings I identified three ways that decision-makers perceive what each entity gives and gets through the partnership, (1) resource-driven exchange, which includes a give from one organization’s resources and a clear get for the other organization; (2) byproduct benefits, which are benefits received by one entity as a result of the partnership but not definitively tied to the resources of their partner, and (3) synergy, which occurs when the partners work together with their resources on a single artistic output.
The results show that through resource-driven exchange ART gives, and Harvard gets: educational support for Harvard’s Theater, Dance &amp; Media concentration; internship and mentorship for students; facility operations; and Harvard events produced by ART, and that Harvard gives and ART gets: use of performance, rehearsal, office, and set construction space; financial support; and support for information technology, legal, and human resources. As a result of the partnership, ART receives the byproduct benefits of: reputational benefits by association with Harvard; increased audience development opportunities due to the geographic area they operate in; enhanced access to donors who otherwise may not support a nonprofit theater. Likewise, as a byproduct of the partnership, Harvard gets: reputational benefits relative to the arts, locally, nationally, and internationally; engagement opportunities for local community members to access Harvard; the arts more infused in the cognitive life of Harvard; opportunities for interdepartmental connections through the arts in an otherwise decentralized institution. Through a synergetic collaboration, the partners develop new works of theater. ART staff and Harvard researchers each provide their expertise to develop well-informed and impactful pieces of art. Through the co-creations ART gets access to in-depth expert research, and Harvard researcher get an artistic platform to share their research with a broad community. Examples of this include the new musical We Live in Cairo, and Ocean Filibuster. The partners exhibited a high level of relationship commitment and a low level of propensity to leave the partnership based on Jeong and Oh’s (2017) model. Decision-makers used the partners’ collaboration of a new $100,000,000 arts center that will house ART as evidence of relationship commitment. Participants described high levels of trust between those at ART and Harvard. The decision-makers shared that Harvard’s policies and bureaucracy created the only challenges.
This dissertation includes several conclusions, and recommendations for practitioners and future research relative to nonprofit arts organization and HEI partnerships based on the study. In the ART and Harvard partnership, ART receives more impactful resource-driven benefits than byproduct benefits, and Harvard receives more impactful byproduct benefits than resource-driven benefits. Recommendations for practitioners include: seek to understand what their organization could give and get through a partnership; identify possible the motivations a partnered, or potentially partnered organization; and, for decision-makers in nonprofit arts organizations, consider how integrated their organization should be with an HEI – the more integrated they are, the greater the potential resources but the more they must work with the often-bureaucratic structures of an HEI.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this treatise is to survey eight of the Ten Fanfares by Ten Composers for Brass and Percussion commissioned by Maestro Eugene Goossens and the Cincinnati Symphony for performance use throughout the 1942-43 season. Eighteen composers responded with fanfares for different combinations of instruments. Ten feature brass and percussion exclusively. Composers included in this commission consist of prominent figures such as Aaron Copland, Howard Hanson, Virgil Thompson, Paul Creston, among others. This treatise revitalizes the importance of these chamber works as an addition to the brass ensemble repertoire, the larger diaspora of twentieth century American music, and how the underlying connection(s) between musical performance and politics have cultural implications that shape and manifest various outlooks on citizens within a nation.In addition to exploring the historical and cultural context and legacy of these works, this document serves to invite greater discussion within arts organizations about the importance of programming lesser-known works for the sake of greater representation. These fanfares are less than a century old and many of these works have not seen a proper performance since their original premieres in the 1940s. The research and explanations in this treatise intend to bring greater exposure surrounding their purpose and effect in hopes of these fanfares utilized for performance into the twenty-first century.   </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Personality has been found to have significant connections to language. Ranging from impacting narrative style, to informing expectations about others based on linguistic factors such as accent, personality affects both language comprehension and production (Oberlander &amp; Gill, 2004; Van den Brink et al., 2012). However, research in this area primarily focuses on offline measures. Online measures, such as EEG or pupillometry, have not been included until recently. Pupillometry, which involves measuring the size of the pupil, is considered a reliable indicator of cognitive effort during language comprehension. Hubert-Lyall and Järvikivi are unique in their research studying the possible relationship between personality and online language comprehension due to their use of pupillometry (Hubert &amp; Järvikivi, 2019; Hubert-Lyall &amp; Järvikivi, 2021). They showed that several of the Big Five personality traits are related to the processing of errors during language comprehension. Unfortunately, theoretical explanations of the language-personality link are undeveloped. One theory, presented by Hubert and Järvikivi (2019) and Jiménes-Ortega et. al. (2022) posits that perhaps for Neuroticism, anxiety may be the connecting factor between personality traits and language comprehension.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The current studies had two goals. First, we aimed to replicate the findings of Hubert-Lyall and Järvikivi (2021) using the same methodology but in a new population and culture. Second, we aimed to address a more specific hypothesis – does Anxiety, through its connection to Neuroticism, predict cognitive load in response to errors in sentences? Overall, we found mixed results. While we did not replicate the findings from Hubert-Lyall and Järvikivi (2021), nor did our results replicate from our own Experiment 1 to Experiment 2, we did find possible support for the connection between anxiety and language processing. However, it does not seem as though anxiety alone can account for the Neuroticism x language comprehension connection. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>All-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) represent a promising advancement in electrochemical energy storage, with solid electrolytes (SEs) playing a crucial role. Sulfide and halide SEs have garnered substantial interest due to their distinct characteristics; sulfide SEs offer high ionic conductivity and stability with Li metal anodes, while halide SEs have better compatibility with high-voltage cathodes. This dissertation explores the structure-property relationship of mixed-anion frameworks in both sulfide- and halide-based SEs, aiming to fine-tune material structures and properties for enhanced battery performance.Firstly, we delve into the transformation of Li3PS4 via the introduction of LiBr. 31P NMR unveils the emergence of a glassy PS43− network interspersed with Br−. Solid-state NMR corroborates fast Li+ migration between PS43− and Br−, with increased Li+ mobility. A more than four-fold enhancement in ionic conductivity is observed upon LiBr incorporation (1.06 mS cm-1) into Li3PS4 (0.23 mS cm-1) resulting from the reduction of the energy barrier and transitioning Li+ transport dimensionality from 2D to 3D. The compatibility of Li3PS4 with Li metal is improved alongside an increase in critical current density (CCD) from 0.34 mA cm-2 to 0.50 mA cm-2 while preserving the electrochemical stability window. ASSB cells with 3Li3PS4:LiBr as the SE and TiS2 as the cathode active material (CAM) show robust high-rate and long-term cycling performance.
Secondly, we incorporated LiBr and LiI simultaneously in Li3PS4 as a mixed-halide strategy. We achieve a two-fold increase in conductivity using a one-step ball milling technique. Subsequent low-temperature sintering further enhances conductivity to 4.43 mS/cm with a low activation energy of 0.29 eV. Furthermore, we engineered a cell configuration with stable milled SE layers toward Li metal and a high-conductive sintered SE separator in the symmetric cell with which CCD further increases compared to individual separators.
In addition to sulfide-based SEs, Li-deficient lithium yttrium bromide, Li3-xYBr6-x, was prepared using the co-melting method. High-resolution X-ray diffraction and Rietveld refinement confirm the formation of the monoclinic structure with the C2/m space group with increased cation site disorder and polyhedral volume. Bond valence site energy calculations show the Li+ migration energy barrier from Li-deficiency. Ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations show the emergence of 3D-Li+ conduction. Solid-state NMR spectroscopy confirms the elimination of LiBr impurities
and reveals increased Li-ion dynamics. An ionic conductivity of 4.49 mS cm-1 and activation energy of 0.28 eV were achieved.
Furthermore, we synthesized a series of Li2.73Ho1.09Cl6-xBrx compounds using a solid-state co-melting approach. Crystal structure analysis revealed the presence of Li-ions in 2d octahedral sites of the C2/m space group for x ≥ 2. Analysis shows highly disordered cation sites with mixed occupancy of Li/Ho. 6Li solid-state NMR revealed a highly disordered local Li environment, which increases with Br/Cl substitution. The significant improvement in room-temperature ionic conductivity from 0.45 mS cm-1 for Li2.73Ho1.09Cl6 to 3.79 mS cm-1 for Li2.73Ho1.09Cl3.27Br2.73 is achieved with a significant decrease in activation energy from 0.38 eV to 0.32 eV, respectively.
Further mixing anions and cations within a SE significantly enhances ionic conductivity by introducing controlled disorder at both cation and anion sites. This increases the system's configurational entropy and allows for the overlap of energy bands. Incorporating Mg2+ and Hf4+ into a Li3ClBrI mixed-rock-salt structure results in a substantial increase in ionic conductivity, reaching 0.88 mS cm⁻¹ for Li1.54Mg0.23Hf0.17Cl0.68BrI. The enhanced conductivity is attributed to a nanoscale solid solution between the disordered rock-salt and spinel structure.
Moreover, introducing a mixed anion sublattice into cost-effective LiAlCl4 through a simple one-step mechanochemical milling process led to a 22-fold increase in ionic conductivity – from 0.0083 mS cm⁻1 to 0.18 mS cm⁻1 for Li2AlCl3S. This improvement can be attributed to the formation of new Li sites, enabling efficient 3D Li+ transport. The strategy leverages the inherent disorder to modify the Li-sublattice locally, leading to broader lithium-ion site occupancies and enhanced ion dynamics through polyhedral edge sharing.
Mechanochemical milling of thiophosphate-based SEs combined with TiS2 CAM produces a composite material that leverages both cationic (Ti3+/4+) and anionic (S2-/n-, where n&lt;2) redox processes – resulting in ~2× enhancement in specific capacity. Catholytes containing mixed-anion SEs, especially with 3Li3PS4:LiBr, demonstrate better cycling performance compared to their mono-anion counterparts due to the improved ionic conductivity and thermodynamical stability.
In summary, this dissertation explores innovative compositional design, optimal synthesis environment, and characterization of mixed-anion SEs, in addition to the utilization of these SEs in ASSBs. Overall, this research provides valuable insights into the development and application of high-performance ASSBs, addressing challenges associated with SEs in energy storage.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Training and development are used extensively in the United States to impact employee learning and performance. The considerable investment and expenditures across public and private sectors and the vast number of employees who receive support from training and development professionals warrants exploration into how instructional designers are supporting a culturally diverse labor force. This qualitative research study explores how and why instructional designers developing training in a non-academic, adult learning settings incorporate cultural responsiveness in their instructional design (ID) practices. Incorporating evidence from semi-structured interviews with thirteen instructional designers across various levels of experience and organizational types, findings demonstrate that instructional designers are incorporating culturally responsive strategies in support of diverse learner populations. Results suggest that focus can be placed on cultural responsiveness during all phases of the systematic ID process and that there are considerable instructional, institutional, and personal dimensions working together at various degrees. Designers rely on their existing ID knowledge and institutional supports to execute their strategies and are driven by personal experiences and an organizational culture that respects diversity, equity, and inclusion.   </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The number of Nontraditional-age students has been on the rise in higher education over time, and although this population has been increasing nationwide, there has been a continued decline in nontraditional-age students at Florida Gulf Coast University (FGCU). This quantitative study focused on the background characteristics, academic characteristics, and financial characteristics of accepted nontraditional-age undergraduate students in an effort to alter admission strategy and improve enrollment of nontraditional-age students at the institution. The results of a three-step logistic regression model found there were significant predictors of enrollment related to the background characteristics, academic characteristics and financial characteristics utilized in the regression models of the study. The results of the study will be utilized in FGCU Admissions to refine recruitment strategy in an effort to enroll more nontraditional-age undergraduate students.  </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>I argue that the dividing of values into epistemic and non-epistemic is not a productive way to understand and judge the influence of values in science. A better approach is to consider what is motivating a value and what justifies using it in a particular context. By reframing our assessment of values this way, we can better recognize epistemic contributions from diverse values. I further argue that when a value improves the empirical adequacy of a hypothesis or theory, the use of that value is epistemically justified in that context. To illustrate this point, I offer an example where the value of egalitarianism, which is widely considered to be a “non-epistemic value,” improved the empirical adequacy of a neuroscientific hypothesis, rendering the value epistemically justified in that context. Ultimately, I hope to make plausible the epistemic advantage of using that which has traditionally been relegated to the category of the non-epistemic—morally sound values.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study addresses the challenge of achieving a stable teleoperation over the Internet, improving the convergence rate in the presence of high communication time delays, and maintaining consensus in the platoon while the lead agent is being teleoperated over Internet. The first part of this thesis dealt with stable teleoperation where we employ a passivity-based formalism to establish stability using wave variables and wave scattering techniques, and we enhance the convergence rate by combining it with predictor-based approaches. The elevated time delay within the teleoperated communication layer - The second part is known to induce collision between the agents as well as descensus behaviour in the platoon, which reduces the convergence rate and increases the settling time in the convergence of power variables. This issue is addressed in this paper by utilizing a Smith predictor on the operator end and Minimum Jerk (MJ) predictors on the remote end. We present experimental and simulation results to demonstrate the improvements, ensuring stable teleoperation under high communication time delays.Contributions of this thesis work include:
• Setup a teleoperation platform over Wi-Fi and the Internet.
• Identify the instability in the system, and implement the wave variable method to introduce stability which leads to witnessing the convergence issue.
• Implementing Smith Predictor and MJ predictor to compensate convergence issue.
• Design a platoon multi-agent system where the first agent is teleoperated over internet.
• Study the performance of the approached model in Simulink and Hardware.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The introduction of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has greatly improved our understanding of structural biology, especially regarding muscle tissue. This technique has been key in revealing the complex structure and functional dynamics of myosin filaments, essential for muscle contraction. Cryo-EM's ability to provide high-resolution images gives us an unmatched look into the intricate interactions of muscle proteins, effectively closing the gap between biochemical theory and the actual observation of molecular structures. Unlike traditional crystallography, which needs protein crystallization and might introduce artifacts, cryo-EM allows for the observation of proteins in a state close to their natural environment, avoiding these issues.This study centers on the cryo-EM investigation of myosin filaments, focusing on sample preparation, data processing, and the protein composition and structure across different species, including both vertebrates and invertebrates. Chapter 1 introduces the basic principles of structural biology and explaining the groundbreaking role of cryo-EM in this field. It covers the essentials of protein structure, tracing the path from genetic code to the three-dimensional shapes vital for biological function. It also points out the key protein structures related to striated muscle, setting the stage for an in-depth look at myosin filaments in the following chapters.
Chapter 2 explores the discovery of two distinct forms of myosin thick filaments in the flight muscles of Drosophila melanogaster, achieved through advanced cryo-EM techniques. This chapter not only points out the structural differences between ordered and disordered filament types but also introduces variations in flightin, a non-myosin protein, in these filament types. By obtaining high-resolution structures, this analysis provides a deeper understanding of the protein composition and conformational differences that contribute to these variations.
In Chapter 3, the focus moves to building atomic models for both filament types, enabled by near-atomic resolution structures. This comparative study of myosin filament backbones in Drosophila flight muscles highlights the structural differences between ordered-head and disordered-head filaments. These models clarify the molecular interactions between myosin coiled coils and non-myosin proteins. Additionally, this chapter looks at mutations in myosin-related genes linked to human cardiac diseases, examining the corresponding residues in the atomic models and the significant interactions they are involved in.
Chapter 4 turns the focus to vertebrate models, addressing the challenges and methodologies involved in preparing myosin filaments for cryo-EM study.  It emphasizes the critical importance of preserving structural integrity during sample preparation, highlighting some techniques that help preserve the structure of the vertebrate’s filament during this process and paving the way for future experiments on vertebrates’ myosin filament.
Looking forward, future research plans to use cryo-EM to study myosin filaments across different Drosophila mutants, comparing them with the wild type in terms of protein structure. This effort aims to figure out how changes between ordered and disordered configurations happen, hoping to gain deeper insights into the molecular mechanisms that control myosin filament organization and the functional effects of these structural changes.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Due to the constant mental, physical, and thermal stress of firefighting, it is imperative to explore interventions that may mitigate any negative health effects the occupation brings to firefighters. One of those risks is heat related illnesses. Because a high amount of firefighters experience symptoms of heat related illness and heat related illness is associated with an increased risk of mortality, this is a critical component to focus on for firefighter safety. Betaine supplementation has been shown to decrease heat related deaths in animals and mitigate rises in core temperature in endurance athletes. Therefore, the aim of this project was to determine if betaine supplementation would decrease risk factors associated with heat related illnesses as well as mitigate rises in core temperature during a live burn scenario. In this double-blind placebo-controlled trial, structural firefighters (n=13) were stratified based on shift type and sex, then randomized to receive 3g/day of rice flour (PLA) or betaine (BET). Participants ingested the supplement for roughly 1 month (30 ±2 days) and completed pre-post testing for vitals, salivary stress markers, and body composition. During that month, the participants also wore a WHOOP 4.0 device to track sleep and components of recovery. At the end of the month, participants then underwent a live burn scenario in which they completed a stair climb of four stories outdoors then sat in a conex box that had a fire in it to be exposed to extreme passive heat (temp here) for 15 minutes. Baseline salivary biomarkers, core temperature, sweat rates, vitals, and sweat content were measured. Pre to post paired t-tests were used within groups for the 4 weeks of supplementation. Unpaired t-tests were used to analyze differences between groups in response to the live burn. One tail tests were used on relative thermoregulatory outcomes and baseline salivary markers, all other assessments were two tailed tests. There were no differences in the BET group for vital signs pre to post supplementation, however the PLA group had an increase in resting heart rate. The BET group had significantly better sleep quality as observed through restorative sleep increases while the firefighters were working on shift and after they got off of work that were not observed in the PLA group. When comparing the before and after 4 week supplementation, the BET group had decreases in C-Reactive Protein and cortisol which resulted in increases in the testosterone:cortisol ratio in the BET group (p&lt;0.05). Arrival interleukin-8 and alpha-Amylase were significantly lower in the BET group compared to the PLA group. Absolute core temperature differences were not significantly different between groups, however when presented relative to caloric expenditure from the stair climb and burn, body weight, heart rate average from the stair climb and burn, and air usage, the BET group was significantly lower (p &lt; 0.05). Sodium content of sweat in the BET group was significantly higher, while sweat rates were not different from the PLA group. Based on these findings, BET may decrease chronic stress and inflammation and acutely better maintain blood volume and decrease the risk of heat related illnesses and improve on shift safety and health in firefighters.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Intercollegiate athletics has become a business enterprise which exists and thrives on higher education campuses. As the growth of intercollegiate sport has continued, women have been noticeably absent from leadership roles in this extremely male-dominated profession. With the passage of Title IX there was hope and expectation that women would be considered and accepted on both the playing field and in leadership positions. While the playing field has shown significant advances with approximately 50% of student-athletes being female, leadership has severely lagged behind. Slow in the evolution of female athletic directors, it is important to explore the reasons why and determine if there are opportunities for change. Speaking with women in senior leadership roles at NCAA Division I FBS institutions provides information and ideas for supporting young women who aspire to be athletic directors and leaders in intercollegiate sports. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Using this exploratory study through the narrative inquiry process, women who assisted in leading their departments at NCAA Division I FBS institutions which were classified at the time in autonomy conferences were interviewed on the professional development, opportunity, and mentorship throughout their careers. The information shared was thoughtful and insightful and provides an opportunity for young women and men to understand challenges faced and opportunities for change moving forward in assisting and guiding young women into leadership positions within these departments. The feedback from these accomplished women provides leaders at institutions of higher education, search firms, and hiring managers with details and background that may assist in overcoming unconscious bias.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Culture in intercollegiate athletics must evolve and adapt to the quickly changing landscape of intercollegiate sport. Allowing thought leaders in the profession to remain white and male will inevitably stunt the advancement of collegiate athletics overall. Diversity in gender, as well as race, will provide different perspectives to assist in understanding challenges that are faced by those that strive to be leaders in this environment.  </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Microplastic (MP) pollution is an ongoing problem in coastal systems, where wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and other sources deposit particles daily. While research regarding MP pollution worldwide is increasing, especially surrounding the role of WWTPs in facilitating MP inputs to marine environments, two major gaps exist within the MP literature: (1) MP pollution data within United States coastal areas, especially in marine sediments; and (2) MP effects on animals that may be most at risk. MPs are bioavailable to a range of marine fauna, including fish, benthic invertebrates, and marine mammals, and they can transport invasive species, alter biogeochemical cycles, and they can cause physical stress to fauna. These negative effects are potentially most pronounced at the base of food webs and in fauna that perform microecosystem functions, due to their small sizes and high likelihood for interaction with MPs. I posed five questions in my dissertation: (1) What is the spatial and temporal distribution of MPs in St. Andrew Bay, Florida? (2) How are spatial and temporal factors correlated with the identities of MPs in St. Andrew Bay? (3) What spatial distinctness exists within nematode communities in the St. Andrew Bay? (4) How do microbe-MP associations alter marine nematode feeding behaviors? And (5) How do MPs alter interstitial marine ecosystem functions? I used a combination of field collections and experimental manipulations to address these questions, as microplastics and interstitial communities are difficult to manipulate in natural environments.To assess spatiotemporal variation in MP pollution within St. Andrew Bay, I conducted a seasonal sampling from October 2020 to February 2022 along 1-km transects across five separate parts of the bay system. Sediments in areas of WWTP outflow contained more MP pollution than areas without direct outflow, and concentrations of MPs were highest in winter months. Additionally, MP concentrations at the Millville WWTP were nearly an order of magnitude higher than anywhere else in the bay system, suggesting that damages to and inefficiencies at the plant are exacerbating the magnitude of MPs imported into this system, though other factors that help explain MP loading patterns, including road runoff, tidal and wave action, and microplastic degradation, were not evaluated. Extrapolation of mean MP concentrations in the bay system suggests that there may be approximately 30 billion MPs in the bay at any time, which are likely exported out to the Gulf of Mexico during heavy rains or storms.
To assess spatiotemporal variation in MP compositions within the bay system, I evaluated the MP polymer types, particle shapes, and sizes. Unexpectedly, fragments were the dominant particle shape at WWTP sites, while sediments from other sites were mostly fragments and fibers. Mean MP sizes were significantly smaller at WWTP outflow sites than elsewhere, which suggests that waste processing and filtration retains larger particles or that particle collisions during processing and export lead to smaller MP sizes. In the winter, WWTP sediments were dominated by polyester and polyethylene terephthalate, which are indicative of the role that laundering of synthetic textiles plays in coastal MP pollution. 
To evaluate spatial distinctness within nematode communities in the St. Andrew Bay system, I extracted nematodes from sediments at the two WWTP sites and two reference sites at two separate times: winter and summer. Nematode community diversity was strongly associated with the distance to the nearest WWTP, and communities were dominated by tolerant, opportunistic genera. These findings suggest that the system is possibly stressed by organic enrichment, potentially linked to the WWTPs, but has not reached an ecological tipping point evidenced by an abundance of pollution sensitive nematode genera.
To assess the effect of microbe-MP associations on marine nematode feeding behaviors, I set up a factorial experiment varying microbe presence, MP concentrations, and MP exposure time. Microbe-MP associations did not encourage nematodes or other meiofauna to consume MPs, and while nematodes did consume MPs, consumption was rare, suggesting that accidental ingestion may be a more plausible reason.
Finally, to assess the effect of MPs on interstitial marine ecosystem functions, I conducted a mesocosm experiment with a control and three MP concentrations (low, medium, high), and luminophores—glow in the dark particle tracers—to assess bioturbation and oxygen microelectrodes to track oxygen turnover. All MP concentrations resulted in reduced bioturbation depths but only the high treatment resulted in increased oxygen penetration depth compared to the control treatment. Discrepancies in bioturbation and oxygen penetration trends under the influence of MP pollution suggests that MPs may be differentially affecting size classes of fauna. Decreased bioturbation because of MP contamination supports that MPs are reducing this behavior in macrofauna and meiofauna members in the sediments. However, increases in oxygen penetration depth that do not align with bioturbation depth suggest that macrofauna and meiofauna may not be responsible for these oxygen trends. Instead, deeper oxygen penetration depth may be linked to altered microbial activities, changes in microbial community compositions where less effective oxygen-consuming bacteria are present in abundance, or changes in sediment physical structures that allow for deeper oxygen penetration at high MP concentrations. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) youth experience higher rates and severity of anxiety, depression, non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), and suicide-related thoughts and behaviors (STBs) compared to their cisgender peers and compared to TGD older adults. The literature indicates that this disproportionate risk may be attributable in part to TGD youths’ higher levels of gender nonconformity, gender dysphoria brought on by undergoing puberty, and TGD youths’ increased risk for bullying and peer victimization. Although these factors have generally been found to be cross-sectionally associated with internalizing problems, NSSI, and STBs, little longitudinal research has been conducted on these relationships. The Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) dataset, an ongoing project which has collected longitudinal data on a large (n = 11,877) sample of children who were 9-10 years old at baseline, includes measures of mental health, gender identity, pubertal development, and peer victimization at several time points. The current study tested the relationship between gender nonconformity and mental health symptoms over time, mediated by peer victimization and moderated by pubertal development, utilizing data from the ABCD dataset. The models were supported, in that earlier gender nonconformity significantly positively predicted depression, anxiety, and suicide ideation two years later. These associations were significantly and partially accounted for by peer victimization. The association between gender nonconformity and peer victimization was significantly moderated by pubertal development, such that it was stronger at higher levels of pubertal development. These findings highlight the importance of studying specific risk factors for adverse mental health outcomes for TGD youth.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Scholars Leonard &amp; Woodland (2022) suggest schools and districts face a crucial challenge. Are schools and districts ensuring their personnel are prepared to engage in critical practices to affirm, include, and support all students, families, peers, and communities? Or are schools and districts just haphazardly committing to diversity, equity, and inclusion statements to check a box? Current research lacks a focus on how K-12 educators make sense of, learn, and implement, as well as the challenges to implementing equity-centered, culturally responsive, and antiracist practices. Therefore, this exploratory case study sought to address this research gap by focusing on the experiences and perceptions of educators who participated in and graduated from the District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS) yearlong professional development program, Anti-Racist Educator University (ARE-U). Specifically, this study is interested in examining the processes of sensemaking, learning, implementation, and challenges of implementing concepts learned in ARE-U in their practice, as well as educators’ perspectives on the program’s effectiveness. This study was informed by four frameworks: sensemaking, critical race theory, intersectionality, and critical sensemaking. 
This study illuminates the narratives and perspectives of classroom educators who voluntarily decided to participate in a year-long equity-centered and antiracist professional development program to improve their practice. These critical perspectives are omitted in current research, but they provide insight into the effectiveness of current approaches in supporting educator learning. Moreover, through this study and its findings, stakeholders will gain an understanding of educator’s experiences in equity-minded and antiracist programs from the perspective of these educators. Specifically, the process by which educators engage in meaning-making, their understanding of concepts in teaching and instruction, and challenges to implementation. ARE-U program organizers can use data from this study to evolve ARE-U to be more effective in supporting learning and implementation. This data can also challenge school and district leaders’ resource allocation and decision-making approaches that negatively impact educators. This study also supports the value of programs like ARE-U in educator training regarding sensemaking of equity and antiracism. Despite some educators' inability to make explicit connections between ARE-U’s content and its application to their teaching, all educators praised ARE-U as a first step in exploring how educators can address systemic inequities in their classrooms.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This treatise examines the Violin Concerto, op. 224 (1955) by American composer Mana-Zucca (1885-1981). A highly regarded musician during her lifetime, Mana-Zucca maintained successful and simultaneous careers as a virtuoso pianist and a singer and performer in operettas and musical comedies. As a composer with a catalogue of 1,100 compositions, she dominated the popular music scene in the early- to mid-twentieth century with her melodious songs, including “I Love Life” (1923), which launched her into the national spotlight. Mana-Zucca’s legacy has been inextricably tied to this song and her role as a popular composer, but she was also an accomplished composer of instrumental concert music. Primary sources illuminate the Violin Concerto as a compositional undertaking that was especially significant to her, in part as a demonstration of her legitimacy as a serious composer. Despite her perseverance and optimism, the concerto, like many of her works, as well as those of other women composers, has been largely overlooked since her death in both literature and concert programming. The Violin Concerto can be heard as a reflection and culmination of her robust musical pursuits. Its kaleidoscopic style and structure incorporate characteristics of romanticism, classicism, and modernism, as well as the intimate style of salon music and the dramatic expressiveness of opera. Mana-Zucca positioned herself not only within a concert culture network but also at the center of a vibrant salon culture, which she cultivated through the fun, accessible nature of popular music and the value she placed on music as a force for building connection and community. Although the Concerto reflects a push to treat her compositional voice in a serious manner, this “professional salon piece” also reveals how a complex, virtuosic work for solo and orchestra can capture the appeal and charisma of “light music.” 
This treatise is an invitation to reexamine Mana-Zucca's legacy through the lens of her Violin Concerto. By providing a historical and stylistic analysis, I contextualize Mana-Zucca's style within the broad stylistic trends of twentieth-century American music. The work itself provides a way to understand Mana-Zucca's impact on her musical network and reflects not only a stylistic synthesis but also her all-encompassing pursuit of life as a musician, composer, collaborator, and community leader.

            <DISS_para>ABSTRACT</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The aim of this study was to understand how Florida State University undergraduate students perceive their relationships with social media influencers and whether that is changing their intention to pursue their degrees. Six focus group discussions were conducted with 15 undergraduate students using a semi-structured interview guide. A thematic analysis of the data identified 10 common themes to address their motivations and realities in becoming an influencer. Parasocial relationships were formed with social media influencers by participants identifying and bonding with them through personality traits. What drove the participants’ interest in becoming a social media influencer were the benefits, such as money, freedom of time, and the lifestyle portrayed. Perceived social norms of social media influencers had no effect on the participants’ academic decisions. Participants had many uncertainties about pursuing becoming a social media influencer, such as mental health and job stability. Nearly all participants in the study agreed that they would balance pursing their degree program along with becoming a social media influencer. As suggested by the findings, the following is recommended: meet with university marketing and discuss ways in which students who wish to be social media influencers can be an asset to the university in student recruitment and other marketing purposes.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this dissertation is to provide a conductor’s analysis of Negro spirituals arranged by H. T. Burleigh for satb choir. The selected works were limited to H. T. Burleigh’s works that are extant. In-depth analysis was limited to works in print and available for purchase still today. The author seeks to facilitate informed performance of these works and provide a general resource for conductors who have an interest in performing the music of H. T. Burleigh.The study includes a brief historical survey detailing the evolution of the Negro spiritual. It also includes a brief biographical overview of the life of H. T. Burleigh and how he became a pioneer in this genre. It also includes the discussion of the function of the Negro spiritual specifically in predominantly white institutions.
	The study concludes with an analysis of seven pieces by H. T. Burleigh. These pieces are: Deep River, Dig My Grave, Were You There, Ezekiel Saw de Wheel, I’ve Been in the Storm So Long, Wade in the Water, and My Lord What a Mornin’. For each piece, a general overview of pertinent compositional information is provided, including instrumentation, vocal ranges, publication facts, and available recording, including performance times. Finally, each piece is analyzed for its musical content, including formal tables and musical excerpts as supporting information.  </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation observed and analyzed the experiences of five higher education students participating in a modified tabletop role-playing game (TRPG) intentionally modified for teaching adaptive leadership concepts. The study observed participants’ capacity to learn the adaptive leadership concepts taught throughout the game and the ways in which participants exhibited such learning. Further, it inquired about the influence of participants’ experiences with the game on their ability to identify adaptive leadership concepts outside the game.The study followed a qualitative exploratory single-case study approach. The combination of teaching strategies selected in the study aimed to construct a case that simulates what using a TRPG as a leadership pedagogical tool in a leadership undergraduate course could look like. The participants’ campaign and their interactions served as the case being observed. Data collection consisted of the recorded gameplay sessions, post-game debrief sessions, rubrics recording participants meeting the game’s learning objectives, analytical memos collected throughout the study, participant interviews, written reflections, and in-game assessments.
The findings suggest that TRPGs can serve as adaptive leadership pedagogical tools as long as they are supported by other leadership teaching strategies, essentially acting as a space where learners can engage with the educational content and experience applying it. The study also suggests that the type of learning participants experienced was cognitive rather than embodied and that game elements such as engaging nature, co-constructed narrative, NPC interactions, guided reflection, and in-game assessments were crucial in fostering participant interaction with the game's adaptive leadership concepts. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the potential of role-playing games as instructional tools in a traditional educational setting.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Children with hearing loss have a higher risk of not developing crucial language and communication skills without the support of early intervention services. Language development is crucial for early childhood education, cognitive and socio-emotional development. This is due to the lack of access to communicative skills and exchanges and other surrounding factors. Early intervention services include music therapy. Music therapists must have a general knowledge of working with children with hearing loss, utilize hearing loss devices, and Deaf children. The purpose of the current study was to explore board certified music therapists’  perceptions of willingness, comfort, and preparedness of working with children with various levels of hearing loss and within the Deaf community. The participants answered their perceptions of (1) general benefit of music therapy, (2) preparedness from training, (3) comfort adapting music therapy, and (4) willingness to provide music therapy. The participants (N= 47) were first cycle board certified music therapists that are currently working in the Southeast region. The results revealed that the participants had overall higher perceptions of their willingness to provide services and had overall lower perceptions of their preparedness from training. Additionally, the results revealed that music therapists had higher perceptions of working with children with lower degrees of hearing loss and children with hearing loss devices. Further results and analysis are discussed within the paper. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Mexican Americans have been native to the United States for centuries, but their educational attainment numbers reflect an achievement gap. This has led to increased poverty levels, low social capital, and low quality of benefits. One way to increase social mobility for a racial group is by increasing the number of bachelor’s degree holders. Because high school lays the foundation for postsecondary attainment, it is important to study college access in high school to understand how students experience and interact with this information in preparation for applying to college. This qualitative case study looked at the student experience through data collected via open ended interviews. Data was analyzed using the Psychosociocultural Theory to account for the psychological, social, and cultural barriers that are unique to the Mexican American student population. A purposeful sample recruited from Valley High School included five female students who were in the 11-25% of their class rank, first-generation to go to college, and Mexican American. The findings showed that the majority of the collected data indicated the psychological and social realms. Notably, the cultural realm did not contain substantial data. A total of seven themes were found ranging from their interactions with their peers to the value of sibling experiences. Implications for this study were gender related help-seeking behaviors for males and traditional culture roles for females. This study adds to the literature surrounding Mexican American students and their persistence to postsecondary education and shines a spotlight on the need to include student voices when creating college readiness programming in high school. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Transcribing and arranging has become a popular way for musicians to expand and explore a wider range of repertoire than is available on one’s own instrument. Viola virtuosi, such as Lionel Tertis and William Primrose, paved the way for transcribing works that would have been otherwise unthinkable for a violist at the time. One does not, however, need to be a virtuoso in order to transcribe music for one’s instrument. Today, free music notation software, along with many other resources, makes creating transcriptions achievable for any performer.	The purpose of this treatise is to provide an overview of the transcription process from a performer’s perspective, so that others may it use as a guide for their personal use when transcribing music for the viola. The chapters give a brief overview of performers who created transcriptions, criteria for choosing music to transcribe, methodologies for transcribing music for the viola, and performance practices.

            <DISS_para>Prospective memory (PM), the ability to remember to execute an intention in the future, is critical for the performance of everyday tasks important for independence and quality of life. PM failures are associated with negative health, financial, and social outcomes, and are more frequent with increased age and can be even greater for older adults with a cognitive impairment such as subjective cognitive decline (SCD). Technology holds promise for providing everyday PM support for older adults with cognitive impairment, but little is known regarding their attitudes and preferences toward technology-based PM support. The present work utilized an online survey and focus groups to examine the attitudes of older adults with SCD toward technologies to support PM. 188 older adults with SCD and 190 older adults without SCD completed an online survey and answered questions about a variety of technologies to support PM in different activity areas. A separate sample of 24 older adults with SCD participated in online focus groups and were probed about their perception of the use of technology devices for supporting PM, benefits they feel they might derive from these devices, and potential costs or barriers to using them. Results show that the attitudes of older adults with SCD 1) differed based on the type of device and the type of activity the technology is meant to support, 2) were more positive than those of older adults without SCD, and 3) were associated with individual difference factors such as attitudes toward technology in general, technology proficiency, frequency of memory failures, health, and age. Results suggest that older adults with SCD might prefer using mobile apps relative to other devices and technology to support healthcare relative to other activities. Older adults with SCD also showed privacy concerns related to voice-activated assistants and using technology to manage finances. Results indicate that older adults with SCD may be a promising population to target using technology-based solutions, and the type of device and type of activity being supported are important to consider in the development of technology solutions to enhance independence and well-being. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Marine ecosystems are increasingly threatened by human activities, highlighting the urgent need for effective conservation strategies. This dissertation focuses on the hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) in Brazil as a case study to enhance marine conservation efforts. Recognized as keystone species for their ecological significance and classified as Critically Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the charismatic flagship species, hawksbill turtle, serve as sentinel, important indicator for the health of marine biodiversity. Utilizing satellite telemetry and population monitoring, key demographic parameters and spatial ecology of nesting hawksbill turtles were investigated. The utilization distribution by tracked turtles overlapped with Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and the potential threats, offered insights into broader marine conservation strategies. The second chapter advances our understanding of marine turtle population dynamics by refining the accuracy of demographic parameter estimates, specifically clutch frequency, which is pivotal for assessing marine turtle populations. Such parameter is broadly used to estimate number of individual nesting females based on the total number of nests, which often times is the only information available. In addition, this chapter demonstrate the significant impact of the presence of transient turtles on these estimates and are informative for study designs that aim estimate total number of nesting females within a season or for the population at large.
The third chapter breaks down their nesting, foraging, and migratory behaviors to inform conservation management. A significant contribution of this work is the identification of key migratory corridors and foraging areas, particularly for the subpopulation from Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, highlighting the need for spatially explicit conservation goals and targets. The effectiveness of Brazil's coastal MPAs in protecting the vital habitats for nesting hawksbill turtles was assessed. The findings reveal mismatches in the current MPA network, leading to recommendations for strategic MPA expansion and management, emphasizing ecological-scale approaches over political boundaries to accommodate the species' extensive migratory patterns. The research advocates for MPAs to not only cover high-use areas identified through telemetry but also to implement protection levels tailored to the hawksbill turtles' specific needs. 
Furthermore, the fourth chapter provides a nuanced understanding of hawksbill turtle internesting behavior, using a novel approach to discretize hidden behaviors during this critical period. Besides evidencing high fidelity to nesting beaches and residence areas, mapping the behaviors provided essential insights into their vulnerability to specific threats, including vessel strikes and accidental capture in fishing gear. It proposes evidence-based strategies to enhance MPA effectiveness, integrating technological advancements with conservation biology to inform policy and management decisions. The study's findings underscore the importance of adaptive management strategies, responsive to the evolving understanding of hawksbill turtle ecology. 
Beyond hawksbill turtles, the research offers a framework for applying similar conservation strategies to other marine species, underlining the potential for species-specific efforts to catalyze broader and effective environmental management and conservation. The dissertation calls for continued research and adaptive management in response to the dynamic nature of marine ecosystems and emerging threats, highlighting the role of science in effective conservation policies.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The United States higher education system has developed strategies to prepare students for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) careers as the STEM labor market expands. One set of educational interventions, known as STEM Intervention Programs (SIPs), employs extracurricular activities to engage and retain STEM major students. These SIPs often target underrepresented racial-ethnic minority (URM) students, low-income students, and women to reduce social disparities in STEM education. However, studies assessing the effectiveness of SIPs in improving STEM retention, graduation, and career outcomes have produced inconsistent results. Another area of racial-ethnic inequality in STEM education is the faculty roster, particularly in terms of representation, hiring, and promotion practices. Increasing the number of URM STEM faculty members addresses two main issues: equitable representation and providing URM STEM students with race-matched instruction, mentorship, and role models. Extracurricular SIPs and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) hiring initiatives for URM STEM faculty are common strategies for promoting racial-ethnic equity in STEM education. However, these efforts, along with other DEI campaigns, have shown limited success in improving academic experiences and outcomes for marginalized groups, including URM STEM students. Some of the implicit bias in STEM education can be categorized as institutional racism, which is perpetuated through the policies, practices, and structural elements of organizations. These institutional features create barriers for URM STEM scholars and faculty during their education, hiring, and promotion, limiting race-matched learning opportunities for URM STEM undergraduates.This dissertation seeks to advance the literature by investigating the relationship between institutional racism and SIPs: does underrepresentation of Black and Hispanic/Latino STEM faculty undercut the intended benefits of SIPs on academic and career outcomes of URM participants? Using a quantitative research design, this study examines the impact of SIPs and the underrepresentation of URM STEM faculty on individual and cohort outcomes. Analyzing institutional datasets of three complete, consecutive cohorts of undergraduates from a predominantly white higher education institution, this study examines how SIP participation and URM faculty exposure relate to the success of URM STEM students. As previous research has found the long-term benefits of SIP participation to partially depend on other student characteristics and experiences, the present study also explores whether the benefits of URM-targeted SIPs differ from other SIPs and how these benefits compare with exposure to URM faculty in the classroom. I analyzed how these practices and their associated outcomes relate to the persistence of institutional racism in STEM education. To contextualize and validate the quantitative findings, I triangulated my findings with my advisor and committee members with substantive expertise, teasing out the details and broader meanings of the quantitative results. Ultimately, the strongest positive relationships observed between inputs and desired STEM graduation outcomes was between URM STEM faculty exposure and timely STEM graduation. Increasing URM STEM faculty exposure may improve timely graduation outcomes, reduce student loan debt, and prepare URM STEM graduates for the workforce. In contrast, high-cost extracurricular programming may not move the needle URM STEM students' graduation goals. In sum, this case study provides insights into the limited benefits of programs that many universities have implemented to retain URM STEM students and interprets those lackluster results as demonstrating the key tenet of Critical Race Theory known as “interest convergence.”</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Emotional experiences and expressions are integral parts of sports. Emotions in sports were commonly examined on the individual level. From an interpersonal perspective, the EASI model (Van Kleef, 2009) describes emotions as signals sent to the environment. When perceived by others, emotional signals provide information about the person expressing the emotion and about the environment. Previous research also examined interpersonal emotional processes in naturalistic and experimental designs. Specifically, the process of emotional convergence was documented in soccer penalty kick shootouts. This current study examined the influence of viewing teammate’s performance outcome (i.e., IV1) and post-performance emotional expressions of pride or shame (i.e., IV2) on participant’s (i.e., perceiver) pre-performance emotional state and subsequent performance. An on-the-field between-participants experimental design was conducted, in which previous penalty kick viewing was manipulated using a pre-recorded Virtual Reality video. Participants (N = 93) viewed one of six experimental condition videos, reported their emotional state and related cognitions, and shot a penalty for their team’s common goal. Results indicated no significant differences between groups in pre-performance emotional states, although a non-significant trend in anxiety was observed. The data revealed that perceived emotions were significantly influenced by the observed performance outcome, regardless of the emotional expression. Subsequent performance was significantly affected by previous penalty outcome, and a trend regarding the emotional expression appeared in the data. The results of the study are discussed within the elements of the EASI model (Van Kleef, 2009) and other relevant literature (e.g., context and perceived emotions, ironic processing). Plausible explanations for lack of consistency with previous literature are offered. Future research is encouraged to examine interpersonal emotional processes (e.g., emotional convergence) in advanced experimental designs such as using new technologies, as well as in naturalistic settings. Further, we recommend that athletes develop effective emotion regulation strategies to mitigate the potential negative effects of negative (e.g., shame) emotional expressions on individual and team performance.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In Dragon Year, the speaker explores their emerging queer and polyamorous identity amidst one failing relationship and another burgeoning one. At its core, this is a story of ode and elegy. The speaker looks back at the people and places who have made and unmade them. In the pain of rebirth, the speaker thinks often of death, including the suicide of a personal idol, YouTube gamer Desmond “Etika” Amofah. Indeed, video games recur throughout the work, demonstrating that digital landscapes and characters have also played a large role in the speaker’s navigation of self. The poems are organized around four sections. The first introduces the speaker’s current situation in media res; the second delves into the past and early formative situations; the third is a sort of quiet climax, a dark night; and the fourth is an emergence into a jubilant yet unsure future. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Like Frank O’Hara suggests in his famous manifesto “Personism,” these poems take place between people. Some of the poems deal explicitly with romantic love, especially potential love lost, as in “Applebee’s,” where the speaker admits, “I love you, and you know / though I’ve never said it, / and you don’t love me, though we sit close / and talk a secret language.” Other poems play out more of a family drama, such as “On the Plain of Dura in the Province of Delaware” and “Self-Portrait with Oathkeeper &amp; Oblivion,” in which the speaker laments their inability to protect their younger sister from their parents’ divorce deep in the past. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Formally, I strike a wide range throughout this book. Though most of the poems count as free verse, I employ a contemporary take on several traditional forms, such as the sonnet (e.g. “Winter Lights: Three Scenes”), the pantoum (e.g. “Blue Gucci”), the blazon (e.g. “Blazon featuring Zelda Mixtape &amp; Coconut Oil”), the ode (e.g. “Ode to Just Dance, Lindy Hop, &amp; The Great Gatsby”), and the contrapuntal (e.g. “At Least Spiritually”). I also experiment with forms that carry syntax along paratactically such that the entire poem is one sentence (e.g. “Lights Out Ode”).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Spirituality is an important undercurrent in this book. I’ve been Catholic my whole life, and that provides some consistent tension in my navigation of queerness and other complex contemporary topics. Many poems in this book demonstrate a wrestling with faith—a refusal to give in and also a refusal to give it up (e.g. “Ode to Boudin, Hurricanes, &amp; Street Performers”). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In comparison to other books or the poetry market, I’d say this book owes a debt to Christian Wiman, whose works such as Every Riven Thing or Once in the West demonstrate a tense relationship with faith, a holding on even as the speaker fights back. Wiman’s work, like mine, also demonstrates a deep commitment to tight, intentional form and strong musicality, though Wiman’s musicality is even more pronounced than mine. I would also consider my narrative style in the lineage of Barbara Hamby and David Kirby. I expect this book would appeal to readers of poetry who are interested in queer spirituality and in poetry books that can strike a wide variety of forms, from the compressed lyric to the syntactically-expansive narrative. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Though the book’s final section attempts some sense of acceptance and closure, even then the speaker is just on the brink of returning to the beginning of pain again. In the final poem, “Traverse Town,” during a game of mini-golf, they conclude, "I’m so color drunk I’d almost say it’s / enough: tonight let’s not play therapy, / pack boxes, reach for each other’s bodies. / I’ll birdie the next one—betcha / an ice cream. You say, let’s fucking go."</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The study conducted in Dolphin County School District offers a comprehensive exploration of teacher beliefs among K-8 educators, specifically focusing on perspectives related to mathematics instruction. The findings reveal a diverse array of beliefs, shedding light on nuanced aspects of transmissionist, facts-first, and fixed instructional plan beliefs.An examination of background characteristics and their relationship with teacher beliefs emphasizes the intricate nature of these beliefs within the teaching community. The study identifies a weak connection, highlighting the diverse array of perspectives held by educators. Factors such as gender, race, and teaching experience contribute to this complexity, emphasizing the need for a nuanced understanding of the interplay of these factors in shaping teacher perspectives on mathematics education.
Professional development emerges as a crucial factor influencing teacher beliefs. However, the study reveals a lack of statistically significant correlations between professional development and teacher beliefs. This calls for a critical reevaluation of existing professional development initiatives, urging the district to ensure their content aligns effectively with instructional practices that enhance mathematics education.
The multiple regression analysis accentuates the substantial impact of teacher beliefs on average classroom math score growth. Teachers endorsing traditional approaches are associated with lower student performance, while those embracing more progressive beliefs exhibit a positive influence. Notably, overall teacher beliefs wield a particularly strong influence on student outcomes, emphasizing the significance of fostering innovative and student-centered approaches to teaching mathematics.	
While the study acknowledges the existence of conflicting research, particularly concerning culturally relevant beliefs, it underscores the need for a more extensive study dedicated to beliefs about the teaching and learning of mathematics. This recognition of the complexity of teacher beliefs aligns with the observations made by Beswick (2007), emphasizing the necessity for a more in-depth understanding of these intricate aspects.
In response to these findings, several recommendations are proposed for Dolphin County School District. Firstly, a thorough evaluation and refinement of professional development programs are essential to ensure their efficacy in shaping teacher beliefs. Internal examinations of belief consistency, encouragement of curriculum flexibility, and initiatives promoting innovative teaching approaches are prioritized to foster a cohesive instructional culture. Additionally, the district is encouraged to actively support a culture of continuous learning and collaboration among teachers through communities of practice.	
By implementing these recommendations, Dolphin County School District can position itself as a leader in cultivating a teaching environment where beliefs align with effective instructional practices. This proactive stance is poised to enhance the quality of mathematics education within the district, ultimately resulting in positive impacts on student outcomes. The district's commitment to continuous improvement and the provision of high-quality education for all students is evident in these recommendations, reflecting its dedication to fostering an environment conducive to both teacher and student success.

            <DISS_para>This dissertation explored the current perceptions and preferences for residence hall construction lifespan standards among campus master planners and housing administrators in higher education. Historically, universities have built residence halls with the intention of them spanning many decades (Guckert &amp; King, 2004). However, there has been a recent trend for housing departments to design and build new residence halls with the intent to tear them down in a much shorter time frame, perhaps 30 years or even less. Several factors have played into this developing trend, such as financial constraints, delivery deadlines, perceptions of flexibility, and consumer expectations. Beyond just how a college or university campus is built, this topic also contributes to the framework of how higher education administrators view the role and impact of campus residence halls. One of the theoretical concepts at play in this study is campus ecology, which can be described as the transactional processes in which environments promote growth and development for participants. Some theorists focus not only on the environment, but also the participants’ perceptions of it (Evans et al., 2010).
This study was conducted using both a quantitative survey tool as well as qualitative interviews. In total, 92 people from 46 institutions across the 10 states included in the SEAHO (Southeast Association of Housing Officers) region were surveyed. Another criteria of institutional involvement were select factors of the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. The total survey response rate was 53%, with a usable response rate of 45%. From there, three qualitative interview participants were selected from the survey participants.
There were several key findings. Only one-third of survey participants indicated that the intended building lifespan of their last-constructed residence hall was over 50 years old. A quarter of respondents indicated their school has intentionally built a residence hall with a shorter lifespan. Seventy one percent of  participating schools have not done a P3 project. For the 13 schools who have done a P3, only four selected construction standards intended to have that facility last longer than 50 years. Participants were asked to share what key factors they believe played a role in the decision to intentionally build residence halls with shorter lifespans. First costs, speed of delivery, P3 projects, and projecting the need to replacing buildings sooner due to the changing needs of students, and perception of flexible design were the responses. 
There was division on whether flexible design was best achieved through short- or long-lifespan buildings. Another salient point was the need for key decision makers and designers to understand and apply how residence halls differ from other spaces on campus. The conversation around P3s revealed significant hesitation for a variety of reasons, but one interviewer gave strategies for their campus attempts to mitigate many of these concerns. Fifty five percent of participants indicated they preferred building residence halls to last at least 50 years. 
There is a strong desire to be aware of students’ wants, needs and perceptions. There is also concern about how the residence halls will adapt and over time with these changes of student desire. Most of the interview discussions did not favor the strategy of shorter lifespan buildings, citing factors such as lack of trust that both financial resources and campus footprint would be available 20-30 years in the future. A variety of financing strategies were indicated, but bonding was overwhelmingly the avenue being used. About 60% of respondents said that financial capacity has at least a significant amount of influence on determining the construction design standards for new residence halls. 
In the interviews, the lack of available institutional debt capacity was cited as a major factor for both shorter-lifespan buildings as well as alternate funding/delivery methods. Another challenge is that some schools are directing their revenue-producing operations (like housing) to pursue external funding methods to keep that debt off the institution’s books, reducing the school’s debt capacity and potentially creating more capacity for other campus projects. An interviewee positively commented that using a P3 delivery method shortened the time frame for securing funding versus going through a more traditional bonding process. 
While this mixed methods study explores administrators’ current practices, perceptions, and preferences, it also points towards more. In short, these factors set the tone and affect the environment in which students live, study, and engage. If these settings are perceived to be unreliable, reduced, or not tailored to their intended audience (residents), the institution will miss the mark on providing intentional spaces for student growth and development.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>As a part of the developing scholarship in childhood studies, propaganda studies, Cold War China, and transwar studies of World War II history, this project examines the changing propagandistic themes that informed Chinese role-playing games, from fighting demon-like Japanese enemies in the 1960s to enjoying playful Japanese opponents in the 2010s. By surveying the role real children and players played in reshaping China’s memories of the Fifteen Years War (1931- 1945), this dissertation aims to understand the interactions between children and states, propaganda and reality, identity and memory, as well as games and grand strategy presented with children’s images and actual children’s experiences with playthings. Based on primary sources from official Chinese propaganda channels toward children in the People’s Republic of China (PRC), such as New Year’s paintings, posters, broadcasts, youth newspapers, magazines, and Chinese children’s publications in these channels, this project argues that Chinese children have been playing active roles in shaping Chinese propaganda throughout the history of the PRC. By focusing on children’s own experiences and their own voices, this dissertation attempts to recenter the essential roles Chinese children played not only in the Fifteen Years War but also in the continuing Communist effort to maintain China’s revolutionary fervor during the Cold War era and beyond. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>High-energy radiations such as X-rays and Gamma rays have become integral to our daily lives. They are utilized in various fields, including medical imaging, security screening, and scientific research. However, an efficient and reliable detector is required to unlock their potential fully. Scintillators play a crucial role in this process as they convert these invisible high-energy radiations into visible light photons. Despite years of research and numerous breakthroughs, scintillators still face significant challenges.Currently, the most commonly used scintillator materials are inorganic, such as NaI:Tl and CdWO4. While these materials are somewhat effective, they have some drawbacks. They are expensive to produce, and some may even be toxic. Additionally, many of these inorganic crystals do not meet the specific requirements of modern applications. As an alternative, organic materials like anthracene and stilbene have been explored as scintillators. Organic materials offer advantages over their inorganic counterparts, such as low cost, short scintillation decay time, and ease of processability. However, among many other challenges, their conversion efficiency or ability to convert radiation into charge carriers is a significant drawback.
In this dissertation work, we explored the combination of the merits of both inorganic and organic materials into a single system addressing issues such as radiation absorption, scintillation light yield production, and radioluminescence decay lifetime. This work involved material and molecular design, material synthesis, characterization, processing, device fabrication, and application. The first part of this dissertation focused on increasing radiation absorption, enhancing scintillation light yield, and achieving a short radioluminescence decay lifetime. We explored three different methods. In Chapter 2, we investigated using organic metal halide hybrids as sensitizers to planar organic molecules (light emitter). We achieved spatial proximity and excellent spectral overlap between the sensitizer and the light emitter by embedding planar organic dye molecules and organic metal halide hybrids in a polymer matrix. This resulted in efficient energy transfer and a significant enhancement of radioluminescence. We also discussed challenges such as residual tailing emission and fluorescent quenching resulting from aggregation.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In Chapter 3, we addressed some problems encountered in Chapter 2 with a new design concept. We ionically coupled an Aggregative-Induced Emissive (AIE) organic cation with a high Z metal halide anion, promoting efficient sensitization. This work synthesized and fully characterized a zero-dimensional (0D) organic metal halide hybrid, with the high Z metal halides acting as X-ray sensitizers and AIE organic cations as emitters. These materials were easy to prepare at low temperatures and exhibited high light yields with short decay lifetimes, dramatically enhancing X-ray scintillation. We also discussed efforts to improve solution processability in Chapter 4, where the AIE organic molecule was covalently bonded to derive an organic metal halide complex, achieving better solution processability. This covalently bonded complex demonstrated efficient molecular sensitization with zinc chloride, leading to high-energy radiation harvesting and charge transfer to the organic emitting units.The second theme of this dissertation, discussed in Chapter 5, focused on our approach to achieving scintillator-specific applications, particularly in radiotherapy. We utilized molecular engineering to control the effective Z value of organic metal halide hybrids, aiming to develop a scintillator with similar radiation interaction with water and body tissue. The work highlights the potential of organic metal halide hybrids in radiotherapy applications.
In the appendix, a few of the new structures discovered during the course of this dissertation's experimental work are highlighted.
Overall, this dissertation contributes to developing new scintillator materials and improves our understanding of the structure-property relationship in these materials. The findings can guide the design and application of scintillator materials and other optoelectronic devices. By addressing the challenges in scintillator development, this work paves the way for more precise and accurate detection of high-energy radiation in various fields, ultimately benefiting both scientific research and human safety.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>It seems to me that the greatest contribution which Christianity has made to the history of ethics is its claim that what we should do, above all else, is love—love everyone with no exceptions. It is strange to me that this insight has generally not survived in contemporary ethics. Though our dominant ethical theories always mention love at some point, they seldom give it the seat of honor. This dissertation, then, is an argument that they should: that our ethical theories, secular ones included, should be founded on love.	Perhaps that sounds like a strange suggestion. (You may say, “Are you suggesting that contractualism, for example, should be founded on love? Well… it isn’t. If it were it would not be contractualism.”) The structure of my argument therefore begins with some remarks on ethics as a project. Why might it be the sort of thing that is best approached with the tools of charity? I then turn to an example—one possible ethics of charity (and quite a compelling one, in my view), borrowed largely from Thomas Aquinas. Finally, I employ this Thomistic theory to the issue of forgiveness and correction, as a way of showing how such a theory works itself out in application. The hope is that the overall picture is one on which the ethical-theoretical utility of love is clearly on display.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This qualitative case study, which took place at Ringling College of Art and Design, explores the experiences of students in on-campus where emotional support animals (ESAs) are present. With rising disability diagnoses on college campuses and an increasing number of requests for students to be allowed to keep an emotional support animal, it is important to examine their impact on the living experiences of students who share living spaces. Between June and August of 2023, a convenience sample of returners and first-time college students at Ringling College of Art and Design were contacted about completing the study, which consisted of 56 students. Out of the 56 students, 12 students decided to complete semi-structured interviews about what they knew about ESAs, their personal experiences, and their thoughts on how living on campus with an ESA was beneficial or not. The researcher aimed to address the broader question of “How does the presence of an emotional support animal influence the experience of the roommate or suitemates in on campus housing?” through questions related to participant’s knowledge of the roles of ESAs, their experiences with ESAs, and their personal beliefs of the benefits and downfalls of the animal in on-campus housing.
Findings showed participants without their own ESA varied in their knowledge of ESA policy and procedures. Despite no personal experience regarding ESA approval and accommodation on campuses, participants offered their opinions about the roles of ESAs along with a lack of knowledge related to the application process and possible misinformation about the specifications of an ESA. Participants reported good experiences with the owners of ESAs, indicating the potential for community-building and for mature relationships to address problems arising from the presence of an ESA. Self-mediation and communication practices among suitemates were reported, demonstrating a collective willingness to implement potential solutions to the animal’s presence. Finally, roommates assessed living with ESAs as mainly positive, contributing to their emotional wellbeing and to positive relationships among residents.
Some respondents were able to identify advantages like being able to self-soothe during stressful or depressive episodes, or shared happy moments with the ESA, but there were also ongoing criticisms of existing policies, specifically regarding the number and types of animals and their movement. The findings of the study offer translatable lessons on how to better disseminate information about ESAs, about how to foster community-building efforts, and about how to increase communication and outreach between residents. Among these, certain suggestions might include developing targeted educational sessions, enhancing avenues of knowledge dissemination, and perhaps even rethinking or amending ESA rules so as to cultivate more close-knit and supportive campuses. 
The findings address many important knowledge gaps, ensure compliance with federal law and campus policies, and encourage community. With appropriate college and university policies, guidelines and supports in place, uncertainty surrounding the rights of ESAs in on-campus housing complexities can be resolved, ensuring institutions may provide greater continuity of care for students experiencing mental illness and create campuses that are friendly for both students and ESAs.

            <DISS_para>Short Take-Off and Vertical Landing (STOVL) aircraft achieve the required lift by vectoring thrust toward the ground. These jets impinging on the ground exhibit strong resonance induced by a feedback mechanism, consisting of downstream-traveling large-scale coherent structures and upstream-propagating acoustic waves. Consequently, this resonance produces a highly unsteady flowfield, leading to high noise levels, harmful structural vibrations, and significant lift loss. Moreover, the presence of multiple impinging jets leads to the generation of a fountain flow, which further adds to the complexity of the flowfield dynamics. Understanding the flowfield and applying effective flow control methods are essential to reducing these negative consequences for STOVL aircraft.In the present study, the flowfields of a single supersonic M1.5 jet in over-expanded, ideally-expanded, and under-expanded conditions (NPR = 3, 3.67, and 4.5, respectively) are examined. For dual impinging jets, the configurations include a Mach 1.5 supersonic jet paired with an additional sonic jet at NPRs of 2 and 3. The goal of effectively controlling the inherent resonance for this flow is achieved through the use of microjet arrays. This requires a better understanding of the properties and parameters governing this flow, which was achieved through a systematic study of first single and then dual jets using a variety of experimental and analytical tools.
Firstly, the influence of microjet hardware on acoustics, both passive and active, is examined across a wide range of impingement distances (H/D from 0.75 to 10) at a fine resolution (D/16). This approach enables a precise quantification and in-depth characterization of resonance phenomena. Findings indicate that the use of external microjets, which inject into the jet shear layer near the nozzle exit, proves less effective for the over-expanded jet condition at NPR of 3. Consequently, the over-expanded Mach 1.5 supersonic jet condition at NPR = 3 is selected as the representative condition, given the challenge in attenuating jet resonance at this condition. At selected impingement distances, schlieren flow visualization and stereo particle image velocimetry (SPIV) are employed to further elucidate the flow dynamics and the impact of this control technique. Furthermore, an in-depth analysis is conducted to enhance the understanding of the role of large-scale coherent structures in jet resonance. Despite the importance of large-scale coherent structures, also referred to as disturbances, comprehensive discussion on the disturbance convection velocity has been limited due to the challenges posed by nonintrusive measurement requirements. To determine the convection velocity of disturbances in the jet shear layer, high-speed schlieren flow visualization is carried out, and phase bin-averaged wave diagrams are constructed from the image sets. A parametric analysis is performed to examine the influence of nozzle pressure ratio on the convection velocity and phase lead/lag at specific impingement distances. The results reveal that the impingement tonal frequency is nearly independent of the disturbance convection velocity, except in cases of staging behavior. A slower downstream convection velocity of the disturbance corresponds to larger coherent structures, resulting in increased noise levels. Based on the observation of acoustic standing waves, an acoustic speed-based frequency model has been proposed. With the help of the allowable frequency range calculated from the vortex-sheet model, this model can provide a good approximation for the majority of axisymmetric impingement tonal frequencies.
To enhance the noise reduction capabilities of microjet control, additional microjets have been introduced into the diverging section of the supersonic nozzle along with the externally installed microjets. The control system for microjet pressure and on/off status has been further upgraded, and a genetic algorithm has been utilized at selected impingement distances to optimize the microjet configuration for noise reduction. This optimized approach, especially with the staggered microjet configuration, has led to significant noise reduction achievements, including a reduction of over 12 dB in OASPL and up to 32 dB in impingement tones at specific impingement distances. Most notably, the optimized microjet configuration has effectively attenuated impingement tones across the entire scanned range of impingement distances (H/D from 0.75 to 10), covering over-expanded, ideally-expanded, and under-expanded jet conditions.
Furthermore, the response of lift loss to microjet control across a range of impingement distances under different NPR conditions has been evaluated. Lift loss was assessed by measuring pressures on the lower surface of the lift plate. Microjet control has been shown to effectively reduce lift loss at lower impingement distances. For instance, lift loss at an H/D of 0.75 reaches up to 8% of the nozzle's isentropic thrust, which is decreased to 3% upon activating microjet control. Conversely, activating microjet control at higher impingement distances slightly increases lift loss. In-depth analyses of turbulence intensity distribution were conducted, revealing that the presence of large-scale coherent structures in the wall jet significantly contributes to higher lift loss. Furthermore, microjet control is observed to increase entrainment locally near the nozzle exit.
In dual jets configurations, the acoustic characteristics and the response to external microjet control on the supersonic nozzle are examined for both dissimilar and matching NPR conditions. For the dissimilar NPR condition, the supersonic nozzle operates at an NPR of 3, while the sonic nozzle is set to an NPR of 2. In contrast, in the matching NPR condition, both nozzles operate at an NPR of 3. Modal decomposition techniques are utilized on time-resolved schlieren image sets to elucidate the interactions between the jets. Microjet control applied in the dual jets configuration has demonstrated better noise attenuation across an extended range of impingement distances, in contrast to its application on a single jet configuration, which showed effectiveness within a more limited range of impingement distances. Volumetric flowfields of both dissimilar and matching NPR configurations have been reconstructed using the scanning Stereo Particle Image Velocimetry (scanning-SPIV) technique. Additionally, oil surface visualization on the impingement surface has been performed, providing a detailed perspective on the flowfield. To the best of this author's knowledge, these volumetric, whole field measurements are the first of their kind for this complex flowfield. The highly-resolved velocity field provides unique insights into the three-dimensional flow dynamics and the intricate interactions between the fountain flow and the jet shear layer. Furthermore, in the dual jets configurations, the responses of acoustic performance and lift loss to the optimized microjet configuration, initially determined for a single jet condition, are evaluated over a range of impingement distances.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The vertebrate neural retina acts as a light detector, where photons are transduced into chemical and electrical signals at the brain. Phototransduction takes place in the photoreceptor cell outer segment (OS). Rods are responsible for dim light vision; cones are responsible for color vision and high spatial resolution. Visual information is transmitted from photoreceptor synapses to bipolar cells in the inner retina. The signal is encoded in the ribbon synapses of these two types of retinal neurons. Humans rely upon cone vision. Most mammalian models are nocturnal, and their retinas are rod-dominated. Zebrafish has emerged as a powerful model for studying gene function and neural development. Zebrafish is diurnal; cone out-number rods in twenty-to-one in larval retina. Behavior assays have shown that zebrafish are largely dependent on cone vision. My projects utilized zebrafish as genetic models to investigate the role of the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex in cone and bipolar cells. The SNARE complex is a central membrane fusion machinery that is essential for synaptic transmission and membrane trafficking. Mutations in SNARE proteins have been implicated in microvillus inclusion disease (MVID) and a spectrum of neuronal developmental disorder such as encephalopathy and retina dystrophy. The t-SNARE protein syntaxin-3 (Stx3) and syntaxin-binding protein-1 (Stxbp1) are exclusively expressed in the photoreceptor and bipolar cell of the retina. Stx3 is crucial for photoreceptor development, rod OS morphogenesis, and synaptic vesicle exocytosis in ribbon synapses, whereas the role of Stxbp1 in the retina is largely unknown. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) have emerged as a powerful model organism for studying gene function. Whole genome duplication has resulted in two STX3 ohnologues in zebrafish, Stx3a (Chr.1) and Stx3b (Chr.14). Utilizing the CRISPR-Cas9 targeting system in the zebrafish model, my studies have demonstrated that Stx3a is specifically essential for cone development and cone-driven vision, whereas Stx3b ensures the signal transmission fidelity of bipolar cells. Our previous study found that Stxbp1b, a Stxbp1 ortholog in zebrafish, is essential for photoreceptor survival. I have shown that Stxbp1b is crucial for the protein stability of both Stx3 ohnologs in zebrafish. Collectively, my studies demonstrate that the subfunctionalization of Stx3 ohnologs in photoreceptors and bipolar cells, along with their chaperone Stxbp1b, are essential for cone vision in zebrafish.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Northern high-latitude freshwater systems are an essential link between terrestrial and marine carbon cycles, transporting organic matter from ecosystems on land to the Arctic Ocean. However, polar regions are warming faster than the global average due to anthropogenic climate change, potentially releasing hundreds of tons of carbon currently stored in peatland and permafrost soils. Arctic ecosystem dynamics are also changing under continued warming, and changing land cover and hydrology will alter the amount and composition of organic matter exported by surface waters. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a crucial component of the carbon cycle, with the global DOM pool rivaling the amount of carbon stored in the atmosphere. The composition of DOM is fundamentally linked to its reactivity and, as such, partially determines whether mobilized DOM will be mineralized and released as greenhouse gases or stored on long time scales in marine systems. Understanding DOM dynamics in Arctic freshwater systems is thus crucial to understanding the impacts of climate change.This dissertation investigates DOM sources, molecular composition, and processing pathways across the pan-Arctic watershed and uses a suite of investigative tools, including optical measurements, Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS), and spatial analysis, to investigate how a changing Arctic landscape may impact DOM dynamics. The research focused on four distinct areas: refining dissolved organic carbon (DOC) fluxes from the pan-Arctic watershed, characterizing the influences of peatland cover and permafrost on exported DOM, evaluating how DOM composition and microbial community influence the processing of DOM, and characterizing the composition and reactivity of DOM from non-vascular plant sources.
DOM composition varied across ecosystems, reflecting the chemodiversity inherent to this carbon cycle component. In the Onega River, a relatively small and understudied high-latitude river, DOM exhibited a uniquely terrestrial signature throughout the year with muted seasonal changes, contrasting with the dramatic seasonality of DOM composition in larger watersheds. Scaling data from the Onega River increased the estimated pan-Arctic annual DOC flux by approximately 50% from previously reported estimates, suggesting that including smaller watersheds is important for improving pan-Arctic modeling estimates. The Onega River watershed is unique from the six largest Arctic rivers by being permafrost-free and having a large proportion of its area covered by wetlands; thus, its unique molecular signature is likely driven by these landscape features. The relationship between these landscape features and DOM composition is explicitly revealed through an analysis of DOM composition across a latitudinal gradient in West Siberia, demonstrating that peatland extent and permafrost influence have observable impacts on DOM exported by rivers. DOM composition from permafrost-free watersheds exhibited greater variability, higher molecular weight, and a more terrestrial signature than permafrost-influenced watersheds. Peatland extent explained much of the variance in measured variables, with watersheds with greater peatland extent exhibiting more heterogenous DOM composition. However, permafrost effectively acts as a switch on this peatland influence, and so these data demonstrate that DOM from previously permafrost-influenced watersheds may become more heterogeneous and exhibit a more terrestrial signature as permafrost thaw continues. A novel bioincubation experiment was conducted to explore further how these landscape features and their impacts on DOM composition affect DOM biolability and to determine whether the introduction of microbes from one type of soil to another impact DOC loss over time. Leachates created from two wetland depths of wetland soil and soil from two ages of permafrost at distinct filtration levels allowed for the simulation of the mobilization and potential mixing of DOM and microbes from these sources under continued permafrost thaw. Data from these bioincubations demonstrated that the source and composition of DOM, not the microbial community, was the factor that determined DOM biolability and processing. Pleistocene permafrost produced compositionally unique DOM that exhibited an approximately 70% DOC loss rate over time, highlighting the high bioavailability of DOM mobilized as these deposits thaw.
Warming not only affects permafrost but impacts the distribution of vegetation on the landscape. Lignin phenol analysis and optical measurements of individual moss and lichen leachates were conducted to explore how shrub expansion and associated loss of moss and lichen cover in the Arctic may impact DOM dynamics. Moss leachates produced high concentrations of biolabile DOM enriched in p-hydroxy phenols; however, the general aromaticity of the DOM and not the phenol composition appeared to be the primary driver of DOC loss over time. Overall, these data characterized DOC export and DOM composition across a wide range of sources and regions in the pan-Arctic watershed and highlight the need for further research to continue elucidating DOM dynamics in the Arctic.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Tropical cyclones (TCs) are observed in general circulation models (GCMs) as well as reanalyses. However, itis known that GCMs and reanalyses struggle to accurately represent TCs and have biases in the TC frequency
and intensity distributions. By employing the column-integrated moist static energy (MSE) variance budget
as a process-oriented diagnostic, we can analyze the model representation of physical processes that help
or hinder the development of TCs. Specifically, we analyze the radiative and surface flux feedback terms
within the MSE variance budget across 5 different reanalysis datasets and 19 different GCM simulations.
Binning and compositing of TC snapshots by maximum velocity and minimum sea level pressure allows for
comparison across the GCMs and reanalyses of the feedbacks at a given intensity, as well as an examination
of how the feedbacks vary with storm intensity. We find that the surface flux feedback on TC development
is weaker in coupled models. Ocean coupling also influences radiative feedbacks, because the TC-induced
sea surface temperature (SST) cooling reduces the surface upward longwave radiative flux. Across all
models, the longwave radiative feedback positively contributes to TC development and is driven by cloud
effects. Models differ regarding the role of the shortwave radiative feedback, though it is generally smaller
than the longwave. Regarding the intermodel spread in surface flux and radiative feedbacks at a given
intensity, models with coarse resolution differ more from each other and from reanalyses than those with
high resolution. These results can help us understand how differences in model representation of physical
processes lead to model differences in TC intensity.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Johannes Kepler’s  Tabula III in the Mysterium Cosmographicum (1596), printed in Kepler’s dissertation at the University of Tübingen, is a diagram containing the spheres in space and the geometric figures that determine the proportional spaces between them. By utilizing the method of visualization taught through images in texts of astronomy published in northern Europe in the early modern period to introduce his new geometric model of the universe, Kepler solidified visualization as a necessary component of viewing astronomical models. Because astronomical models of the 16th century did not visually support the investigation of metaphysics, Kepler created a model that would allow the viewer to investigate such matters. I argue that in doing so, Kepler created an object-diagram that not only animates the viewer’s visualization of space, but also its celestial mechanics. Additionally, the diagram sits upon a sculptural, geometric base, which has not been addressed in art historical treatments of the image. Using a semiotic analysis of the individual components of the diagram, the relationships between the diagrammatic components and the sculptural base become evident. The functions of the diagram, in combination with the base, turn the image into a mathematical instrument. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>I Play All the Parts is more than a collection of poetry—it is best read as a contemporary verse drama, pulling from traditions as early as antiquity. The text explores questions regarding motherhood, daughterhood, womanhood, selfhood, cycles of generational trauma, sexuality, and gender identity formation and performance as it tests the limits of speakers’ embodiment and mental (un)wellness and indicts patriarchal, capitalist, fascist, sociopolitical systems, such as the contemporary American nuclear family, healthcare, and government systems, all of which impose inequities that prove not only traumatic but debilitating for these characters. I Play All the Parts emerges to address a grave need to dramatize disidentifying discourse in fictive speakers’ embodied experiences. As queer-femme, neurodivergent bodies wrangle with the imposed realities of anti-choice legislation and the criminalizing of survivors of assault and other abuses of systemic patriarchal power, I Play All the Parts necromances networks of occult rituals that establish politically potent and transgressive identities, thereby repairing and (re)animating defunct forms via a community chorus of performative polyvocality.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Thermal management is crucial in everyday life across a range of applications, influencing our safety, comfort, and efficiency of various technologies. Composite material combines different materials to achieve a mutually unique property that cannot be achieved by one homogenous material. Composite material used for thermal management offers a unique opportunity to enhance overall thermal performance. Composite material is a key player in addressing challenges related to heat dissipation and temperature control due to its ability of incorporating lightweight and thermal properties. In this dissertation, we developed a numerical finite-difference model for 2D transient diffusion in lamellar structures. The explicit application is heat transfer, but it could equally be applied to dielectric constants, magnetic susceptibilities, electron/ion conduction, and mass diffusion as well. The control volume contains two phases A and B. The phases have different transport parameters. The modeling aims to evaluate the effect of grain size, grain boundaries, and phase contrast on apparent transport properties of composite materials, such as laminates, polycrystalline materials, and block copolymers, by examining a progression of increasingly complex structures. To validate the model, effective transport parameters of parallel and perpendicular structures from the numerical model are compared to analytical expressions. Effective Medium Theory provides an analytical expression in the limit of many, small, randomly oriented grains. The impact of coarse grains on transport is investigated. Specifically, the model is used to examine how the apparent transport parameters trend from the limit of a homogeneous material to small randomly oriented grains containing two different phases. The effective thermal conductivity (averaged over many random structures) was found not to be a function of grain size. However, the standard deviation decreased exponentially with decreasing grain size, reaching less than 2% variation for transport through 15 grains. Thus, the appropriate Effective Medium prediction is reliable for a surprisingly few number of grains, and connectivity of the more conducting phase is important only in coarse grains with significant contrast.	In addition to the 2D lamellar model structure, we focus on examining the impact that geometric structure has on the thermal conductivity of multi-phase constructs in multiple 3D-printed PLA samples. We explore alternative structural configurations beyond planar arrangements, specifically we focus on cylindrical and gyroid shapes. We investigate how various infill percentages and infill materials influence the thermal conductivity of these structures. By precisely controlling the infill percentages and incorporating different infill materials with varying thermal conductivities, PLA samples can be tailored to simulate various thermal conductivity contrasts observed in practical applications. In this study, we explore the thermal conductivity of PLA structures with different infill percentages and two distinct infill materials: air and thermal paste. Air represents the least conductive material at 0.026 W/(m K), and thermal paste exhibits high thermal conductivity at 5 W/(m K). The experimental results are compared to an analytical model prediction to confirm the efficacy of the model in predicting the thermal performance of these complex structures. 
	Finally, the design of advanced composite nanostructured material requires a fundamental understanding of material behavior at several length scales from nanometer to macroscopic, linked by mesoscopic structure and dynamics. In this work, the structure and dynamics of high molecular weight polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (PS-b-PEO) block copolymers (BCPs) were studied. The BCPs exhibited microphase separated cylindrical and lamellar morphologies. Structural dynamics were measured with X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) in the small-angle regime. Morphologies and domain sizes were evaluated using small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The PS-b-PEO grain size was controlled by different processing conditions, a combination of solvent vapor annealing during solution casting and thermal annealing, were investigated. The grain sizes were evaluated using SAXS, were found to depend weakly on processing only for the rubbery majority BCP and the results showed that the grain size variation depends on which block formed the matrix majority. The structural relaxation times were examined as a function of PS volume fraction, temperature, morphology, and structural sizes. Well above the glass transition temperature (Tg) of PS, all samples exhibited stretched autocorrelation decays and diffusive dynamics. Near Tg of PS the dynamics of all samples was anomalous with compressed autocorrelation decays and hyperdiffusive dynamics. This transition occurred at 153 °C or 1.13 Tg of PS. Surprisingly, the structural relaxation times do not correlate with grain size, indicating that PS dynamics and out-of-equilibrium state play the dominant roles in structural dynamics of these strongly phase segregated BCPs.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>University instructors often lack the knowledge and skills to effectively facilitate learning and teaching in the online environment. Instructors in higher education institutions (HEIs) have faced common challenges to online teaching, such as a lack of digital literacy, access to software and hardware resources and training, and pedagogical and content-related concerns. The rapid transition to fully online teaching necessitated by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic brought many of these instructional issues to the foreground; however, online teaching also encompasses the integration of online tools into traditional classroom environments, as well as blended or hybrid instructional formats. In this dissertation, I define online teaching broadly to include all such formats of online teaching.	In this multiple-case study, I aimed to investigate the online teaching challenges of higher education instructors in Hong Kong and to examine the approaches to professional learning these instructors took in order to address the challenges they encountered. I employed qualitative methods in this study, including conducting individual semi-structured interviews with instructors working at a tertiary university in Hong Kong that specializes in teacher education and collecting artifacts from the participants that related to their professional learning experiences. I found that instructors experienced online teaching challenges that encompassed content-related, pedagogy-related, technology-related, and motivational factors, thereby providing insights for both practice and future research into improving online teaching competencies and experiences for instructors. 
	My findings highlight the importance of integrating both formal and informal professional learning approaches to address online instruction challenges. Formal professional development (PD) programs, such as university workshops and certificate courses, provided structured learning opportunities for instructors. Informal PD through social media platforms and professional networks facilitated collaborative learning and knowledge sharing, and was often engaged in to supplement formal PD. The integration of both formal and informal PD approaches was suggested to provide a comprehensive and personalized professional learning experience.
	Furthermore, I adopted Activity Systems Analysis (ASA) as a framework to analyze my findings regarding the professional learning strategies of higher education instructors in response to their online teaching challenges. The research implications of ASA included investigating the compensatory role of informal PD, understanding the time-intensive nature of informal PD tasks, exploring customization possibilities for software tools, and examining the impact of mandatory informal PD on instructors’ workloads.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>1,4-Dioxane is a synthetic chemical used as a stabilizer of chlorinated solvents and as a solvent in several industrial processes and commercial products.  It is identified as an emerging water contaminant and classified as “likely to be carcinogenic to humans”.  Removal of 1,4-dioxane from wastewater is challenging due to its high water solubility, low Henry’s law volatility constant, and low partition coefficients.  Bioremediation is a promising treatment method for removing 1,4-dioxane from water as it is potentially eco-friendly and cost-effective.  Some microorganisms can use 1,4-dioxane as a sole carbon and energy source, and the degradation of 1,4-dioxane can be enhanced when primary substrates are provided to promote microbial growth.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The main objective of this research was to investigate the co-metabolic biodegradation of 1,4-dioxane.  The first objective focused on kinetic parameters for ethane biodegradation and co-oxidations of ethane and 1,4-dioxane.  Based on experiments combined with mathematical modeling, it was found that ethane promoted 1,4-dioxane biodegradation when the initial mass ratio of ethane:1,4-dioxane was &lt;9:1 mg-COD/mg-COD, while it inhibited 1,4-dioxane degradation when the ratio was &gt;9:1.  A model-independent parameter estimator was used for kinetic-parameter estimation, and all parameter values for 1,4-dioxane were consistent with literature-reported ranges.  The results support that bacteria that co-oxidize ethane- and 1,4-dioxane had a competitive advantage over bacteria that can use only one of the two substrates.  The minimum 1,4-dioxane concentration required to sustain steady-state biomass with 1,4-dioxane as the sole primary substrate was 1.3 mg-COD/L.  As 1,4-dioxane concentrations at most groundwater sites are less than 0.18 mg-COD/L, providing ethane as a primary substrate is vital to enhance biomass growth and 1,4-dioxane bioremediation. 
The second objective investigated the biodegradation of 1,4-dioxane using ethane as a primary substrate in an O2-based membrane biofilm reactor (O2-MBfR).  Based on more than 800 days of continuous operation of two O2-MBfRs with different influent ethane concentrations over the various stages, it was found that an ethane:1,4-dioxane mole ratio of around 300:1 was required to remove 1,4-dioxane from 100 µg/L to ~10 µg/L and from 10 µg/L to 2 µg/L.  Results from the microbial community analysis showed that Rhodococcus and Mycobacterium were the two dominant genera in both MBfRs.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The third objective of this research was to investigate the biodegradation of ethane and 1,4-dioxane in the O2-MBfR by developing a mathematical model.  A higher ethane supply resulted in biofilm growth, with the biofilm’s active biomass dominated by ethane- and 1,4-dioxane-co-oxidizing bacteria.  At &gt;200:1 ethane to 1,4-dioxane mole ratio and &lt;1.9 mg m-2 d-1 1,4-dioxane loadings, the 1,4-dioxane removal was &gt;70%.  On the other hand, high ethane (&gt;300:1 ethane to 1,4-dioxane mole ratio) at high 1,4-dioxane loadings (&gt;4 mg m-2 d-1) inhibited 1,4-dioxane biodegradation to &lt;30%.  The findings underscore that at low 1,4-dioxane loadings, ethane is an essential primary substrate to maintain sufficient biofilm growth for 1,4-dioxane degradation.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the fourth objective, 1,4-dioxane-metabolizing mixed cultures were enriched by periodically spiking 1,4-dioxane at low concentrations (&lt;1 mg/L).  Five 1,4-dioxane-metabolizing pure cultures LCD6B, LCD6D, WC10G, WCD6H, and WD4H were isolated and characterized.  The partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that the five strains were related to Dokdonella sp. (98.3%), Acinetobacter sp. (99.0%), Afipia sp. (99.2%), Nitrobacter sp. (97.9%), and Pseudonocardia sp. (99.4%), respectively.  Compared to the literature, these strains have lower half-maximum-rate concentrations (1.8 to 8.2 mg-dioxane/L), lower maximum specific 1,4-dioxane utilization rates (0.24 to 0.47 mg-dioxane/mg-protein d)), higher biomass yields (0.29 to 0.38 mg-protein/mg-dioxane), and lower decay coefficients (0.01 to 0.02 d-1).  These are characteristics of microorganisms living in oligotrophic environments.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Although the adsorption kinetics and isotherms of several water pollutants have been widely studied, little is known about the adsorption kinetics of 1,4-dioxane.  In the fifth objective, the kinetics of 1,4-dioxane adsorption by AmberSorb and Granular Activated Carbon (GAC) were investigated.  A homogeneous surface diffusion model was developed to describe the adsorption of 1,4-dioxane in continuous flow and batch systems.  The external mass-transfer and internal diffusion coefficients of 1,4-dioxane for AmberSorb (1.79x10-3 cm/min and 3.52x10-4 cm2/min) were determined about five- and thirty-fold larger than that of their corresponding parameters for GAC.  For both adsorbents, the adsorption was limited by the mass-transfer across the fluid film that covers the adsorbent and the adsorbent-adsorbate interaction at the adsorbent surface but not limited by the diffusion within the adsorbent.  While the mass-transfer across the external fluid film affected the maximum 1,4-dioxane removal percentage and the adsorption rate, the isotherm parameters mainly controlled the adsorption capacity and adsorbent service life.  </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This research studied an approach for the characterization of tensile properties of continuous carbon nanotube (CNT) yarns to potentially use as the primary composite reinforcement in aerospace applications.  A standard approach was developed for the tensile testing of CNT yarn materials better representing their engineering mechanical performance compared to small gauge length tests.  CNT yarns were tested under environmental conditions and test parameters to determine their tensile property ranges to improve the mechanical performance of CNT yarns and CNT yarn-based microcomposites.  The effects of thermal and mechanical treatments on the tensile properties were investigated.  The results show the limiting factors of CNT yarn tensile performance are poor load transfer ability, shear failure mode, and limited resin infiltration.  The research provides valuable insights to understand tensile properties and behaviors of high strength continuous CNT yarns with multiscale microstructures. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This work explores the effects of changing the Cu:Sn ratio in Nb3Sn Rod in Tube (RIT) wires togain a better understanding of the Cu-Sn mixing process prior to Nb3Sn formation. Internal Tin
Nb3Sn wires like the Rod Restack Process ®(RRP) always have complexities associated with the
Cu-Sn mixing steps. Imperfect mixing compromises the ultimate performance of the wire. From
this point of view RIT wires are of special interest because all the Cu and Sn is contained within
one tubular filament that in principle offers a simplified window into the mixing and subsequent
A15 layer growth. Here we examined wires with Cu:Sn atomic ratios of 3:1 and 6:5. We tested new
multistep heat treatments motivated by the Cu-Sn phase diagram, observing both Cu-Sn and A15
phase formation around key transition temperatures. Problems with eliminating low Sn α phase
compositions from RIT wires with a Cu:Sn ratio of 3:1 were previously discussed by Segal et al [1].
and here his experiments were extended by using higher temperature Cu-Sn mixing steps above
500C. Using the heat treatment step 525◦C/96h, we were able to eliminate the α phase at the
Nb-Core interface prior to the A15 reaction step by completely mixing the Cu-Sn core. However,
this achievement did not lead to improved properties like we initially expected. In some cases,
wires with worse CuSn mixing prior to A15 formation step had better properties than those with
a mixed core. None of these wires produced good superconducting properties when compared to
other common wire designs RRP, PIT, and the Bronze process. However, the internal Cu:Sn ratio
is seen to influence the superconducting properties. Wires with an internal Cu:Sn ratio of 3:1
significantly underperform compared to the wires with the starting composition of 6:5. We found
that the reaction path for 3:1 (and bronze wires) avoids the nausite phase (generally thought to
be deleterious to Jc) always found in RRP wires while the 6:5 wire reaction always went through
nausite with decomposition into NbSn2, Nb6Sn5 and then A15 at high temperatures. Furthermore
we recorded that a key difference between RIT and RRP is that RIT exhibits a larger spread in
the normal to superconducting transition curve following the same heat treatment. This transition
was shown to be a result of gradients in at%Sn across the Nb3Sn layer.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Milk for Gall’s title alludes to Lady Macbeth’s renunciation, “Unsex me…Come to my woman’s breasts, / And take my milk for gall,” and (re)vises it for a postmodern feminist epic woman-spreading through a Y2K kingdom that houses a Lolita Army, Shitshow Barbie, and strange entanglements with literary figures. This collection begins with a “primordial sigh,” descending into realm after realm, self after self, questioning “how do you hold yourself together” while facing a barrage of patriarchal contradictions. Tombasco “rummages for loveliness” in works as broad as those by Emily Dickinson, René Magritte, and Yorgos Lanthimos and navigates situationships with “Orpheus fuckboy[s],” cultivating a nomenclature all her own—nimble, lush, rhythmic verse that restlessly seeks to answer, “what is my / true utterance?” In the wake of #MeToo, the dismantling of Roe v. Wade, and the increasing climate threat, she dissects any yearning for potential motherhood, but instead, demands a new role: “I don’t mean to upset the natural order or anything / but when might I get to play Prometheus? give myself / to the birds?” Milk for Gall is a coming-of-age poetry collection that follows a speaker from pre-birth to girlhood, into womanhood and beyond. Throughout these different life stages, her identity is sculpted by what comes through various high and low art mediums and she questions notions of femininity.

            <DISS_para>Community colleges struggle with enrollment and student success challenges to enhance student experiences and improve completion through various initiatives. Despite efforts, many lack long-term sustainability efforts, leaving colleges seeking solutions. The Guided Pathways framework leverages a college’s existing practices and restructures campuses for equitable, targeted student success. In California Community Colleges, the Guided Pathways framework was adopted across the system. This qualitative case study examined a college’s implementation in a large multi-college district to understand practice changes and challenges experienced. The findings uncovered are significant to the college and yielded insight into the implementation approach for future colleges or districts.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The need for increased efficiency and performance of high-speed aircraft has led to the need for a reduction in aircraft weight. One option is to use thinner and lightweight skin panels at different regions of the aircraft, such as the fuselage, wings, engine inlet, and control surfaces. When such an aircraft operates at high speeds, the shock wave generated or impinging on those surfaces interacts with the surface boundary layer, leading to the well-known phenomenon of shock wave boundary layer interactions (SBLI). SBLI on rigid surfaces has been heavily researched in the past and a sufficient understanding of parameters affecting SBLI has been obtained, including its detrimental effects on the flight vehicle. However, there is a lack of sufficient understanding of the effects of SBLI over thin surface panels that led to fluid-structure interactions (FSI) and high cycle fatigue damage of flight vehicles and detrimental effects on the lives of the crew operating on such missions.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Previous studies have shown that FSI on a compliant panel is a highly coupled problem depending on several parameters such as the shock impingement location, pressure and temperature gradients, shock strength, boundary layer thickness, Mach number, material properties, etc., and therefore difficult to analyze compared to the SBLI on a rigid surface.  The present study aims to decouple the effect of some of these parameters to simplify the analysis and better understand FSI at high-speeds. In this experimental investigation, one parameter is varied at a time to study its effect on the mean and dynamic characteristics of FSI on a compliant panel at supersonic speeds.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Experiments were carried out at the Florida Center for Advanced Aero-Propulsion (FCAAP) supersonic and Pilot wind tunnels. The model geometry consists of a compliant panel with a cavity on its underside embedded in the tunnel wall. The cavity was pressurized to different values simulating various flight conditions, resulting in different levels of static deflection of the panel. The panel was subjected to an impinging shock generated by a shock generator at two locations, namely, the central and 3/4$^{th}$ length of the panel and three cavity pressures equal to ambient, upstream static, and vacuum were tested. In addition, the effect of two shock strengths (by varying the shock angle), two Mach numbers (M = 2, 5), and two boundary layer thicknesses were studied. Several flow diagnostic techniques such as high-speed shadowgraph, surface oil flow measurements, panel deflection measurements, and steady and unsteady pressure-sensitive paint measurements were employed to study the mean and dynamic flow features of the interaction.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The results show that the interaction over the panel is curved or three-dimensional, compared to the nominally two-dimensional interaction over a rigid plate. The level of curvature of the interaction or the separation line is a function of the shock impingement location and the cavity pressure. The mean separation bubble length along the panel centerline was modified in the case of interaction over the panel compared to the rigid plate. An increased width of the upstream influence region was observed in the case of the compliant panel compared to the rigid plate for most of the cases tested, indicating increased unsteadiness. The centerline pressure distributions over the panel are a strong function of the shock impingement location and pressure gradient across the panel. The response of the panel to the turbulent boundary layer at supersonic speeds was observed to be multi-modal and excited by the turbulent structures within the boundary layer of varying lengths and time scales. Compared to the natural structural modes of the panel, these interaction modes were observed to shift to relatively higher frequencies. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the presence of an impinging shock, some modes were amplified, indicating a strong coupling between the panel and the shock. An increase in frequency was also observed compared to the no-shock case, for both shock impingement locations and all cavity pressures. This may be due to the increased forcing generated by the shock impingement. For a fixed shock impingement location, the effect of the cavity pressure was to amplify and excite different modes of the panel. While the higher cavity pressures excite the lower order modes, the case with cavity at vacuum was observed to excite higher order modes. The pressure spectra corresponding to cavity at vacuum is relatively broadband indicating reduced coupling. For a fixed shock strength, an increase in the boundary layer thickness was observed to increase the separation bubble length over the rigid plate and the compliant panel. The sensitivity of the separation line to cavity pressure modification was observed to increase in the case of a thicker boundary layer. The mean separation bubble length was observed to increase with an increase in the shock strength for the panel as well as rigid plate interaction. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Considerable progress has been made toward addressing the objectives of the current study. The remainder of the goals, namely the unsteady aspects of the fluid-structure interaction for an increased boundary layer thickness, Mach number, and shock strength, will be investigated.  3D deflection data obtained using LASER vibrometry, pressure using PSP, and velocity using PIV measurements will be further analyzed. The results from this study will help designers and analysts to design structures that can withstand the detrimental effects of the aeroelastic coupling encountered at high speeds. It will also aid in generating an experimental database for validating numerical solvers for FSI. It will help develop higher-order aeroelastic models with detailed structure modeling and separated flow effects using the reduced-order modeling approach.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Gold Rush Cherokees looks at the centrality of gold rushes to Cherokee history and the importance of Cherokees to the history of American gold rushes. More specifically, these chapters investigate Cherokees’ lived experiences in the California gold mines and their discovery of gold in Colorado in the 1850s. After discovering gold in Georgia in the 1820s and then being forced to relinquish these claims, hundreds of Cherokee men and women became central actors in the more well-known gold rushes of the mid-nineteenth century. With the gold-mining skills and expertise Cherokees developed during the Georgia gold rush, many Cherokee men and women took the overland trail and set up gold mining companies in California in 1849 and 1850. A Cherokee company from Georgia was the first to discover gold at Pike’s Peak, a discovery that launched the Colorado gold rush in 1858. Thus, as opportunities in California diminished, many joined other miners in the new mining communities in Colorado. In these western gold mining spaces, these refugees of colonization and removal became colonizers of the west. Some Cherokee miners made fortunes while participating in these gold rushes. However, most experienced hardships on the overland trails and in the mines, which led many of the Cherokee miners to return home to the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma, or to their communities in Georgia and North Carolina that had avoided removal.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>My Dissertation in Practice concentrated on sexual assault in community colleges with a focus on a mid-western community college. Sexual assault is a pervasive issue that has plagued higher education for years. The purpose of this quantitative descriptive exploratory research study was to explore students’ knowledge and awareness of the policies and procedures with respect to sexual assault as well as support services available for victims of sexual assault in a community college setting. The purpose was to also to learn about students’ perspectives on the usefulness of sexual assault training if they received training. The following research questions and sub-question guided the study:</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>RQ 1: How knowledgeable and aware are the students at a Mid-Western community college of sexual assault?Sub-Question: Are there significant differences in knowledge and awareness of sexual assault based on the students’ full-time or part-time status?
RQ 2: What are the students’ perspectives on the usefulness of sexual assault training at a Mid-Western community college?</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A quantitative approach was the chosen methodology for this study. The targeted participants were the freshman students. The data collection method for the study consisted of a noninterventional, anonymized, web-based survey. My findings concluded that 28 students did not receive sexual assault training. Most of the students were at least moderately knowledgeable (16) about how to report a sexual assault at this school but least aware (18) of where they can find 24/7 support related to sexual assault. Findings highlighted opportunities for college officials at the mid-western community college to better explore ways to engage students’ knowledge and awareness of sexual assault.  </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>By employing an organic theory that views theatre as a living body, this thesis explores how theatre has adapted to pandemics throughout history. It suggests that theatre, like the human body and mind, operates as a complex adaptive system, evolving in response to crises. The study examines three historical pandemics—the Athenian Plague, the Spanish Influenza, and COVID-19— through the theatre-as-body framework, highlighting theatre's resilience and healing role in society. This exploration reveals two remarkable adaptations within the theatre-as-body's immune system: catharsis as a purgative release, allowing audiences to emotionally cleanse themselves of collective trauma, and disavowal as a protective mechanism, enabling the theatrical space to momentarily distance spectators from the harsh realities and uncertainties of pandemics. This thesis emphasizes theatre's ability to creatively respond to challenging circumstances and, therefore, reinforce its cultural function.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Intensive parenting involves parents centering their children’s needs, spending most of their free time engaging with them, and following the advice of child experts. Although most studies on intensive parenting have been qualitative, one group of researchers developed a quantitative measure for intensive parenting attitudes called the Intensive Parenting Attitudes Questionnaire (IPAQ). Studies have shown mixed results in terms of intensive parenting attitudes being linked with positive and negative outcomes. However, scholars have pointed to this construct as being rooted in White, middle-class ideals that are not necessarily accurate for parents with other identities and the IPAQ has failed to show measurement invariance across racial groups. The current literature lacks representation in understanding the experiences and effects of intensive parenting in racially and economically diverse populations, therefore, it is reasonable to question whether intensive parenting is a valid construct for all parents. This dissertation aimed to discover the extent to which this concept may or may not be inclusive for parents who do not identify as White and/or middle-class. 	Through theories of intensive parenting and intersectionality, this dissertation utilized a convergent mixed-method design to test the content validity of the IPAQ through a confirmatory factor analysis and measurement invariance analyses. Additionally, through semi-structured interviews, this study aimed to discover how key domains of intensive parenting were described. A racially, ethnically, and economically diverse sample of parents was recruited resulting in 465 participants for quantitative analyses, and 15 parents were selected for qualitative interviews.  
	This study aimed to answer the following research questions: Among a racially and economically diverse sample of parents, what is the content validity of the IPAQ? And among a racially and economically diverse sample of parents, how are key domains of intensive parenting described? Through the confirmatory factor analysis, results indicated that the data did not fit the five-factor model of the IPAQ well. Seven alternative models were run to find better model fit and with one of these models, measurement invariance analyses were conducted. These tests revealed that the alternative model only showed configural invariance across racial groups but demonstrated scalar invariance across racial groups. Qualitative results suggested that intensive parenting is a relevant concept in a racially and economically diverse sample, as descriptions of the key domains were consistent with previous literature. The quantitative and qualitative data were merged through an integrative analysis to discover how results converged, diverged, and were expanded upon. These findings highlighted how contextual variables, such as race and socioeconomic status, played a key role in the quantitative and qualitative results. While intensive parenting appears to be an important construct in a racially and economically diverse sample, more research is needed to fully understand how to quantitatively measure intensive parenting attitudes, specifically for racially marginalized populations.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The 21st century technology has advanced to become an accessible beacon of education.The physical boundaries of the chemistry laboratory have expanded with the use of innovative virtual lab simulations despite disparate results from previous investigations of student performance comparing virtual lab simulations with traditional laboratory teaching methods. The need to characterize performance holistically and evaluate a combination of virtual labs with traditional methods has prompted a paradigm shift. This dissertation aims to examine the effectiveness of a low immersive virtual chemistry pre-lab simulation that complements the traditional chemistry laboratory in achieving student cognitive and skill-based learning outcomes and student experiential satisfaction in the General chemistry I course. The student achievement measures include cognitive and skill-based outcomes, time on task, and student experiential satisfaction taken for two General chemistry I experiments. A quasi-experimental with repeated post-tests only with a control group research design is implemented at a Florida state college. A convenient sample of General chemistry I course sections is randomly assigned to either a combination of virtual pre-lab simulation with a traditional chemistry laboratory (treatment) or traditional pre-lab and chemistry laboratory (control). The covariance (ANCOVA) analysis of repeated cognitive and lab skills measures revealed that the treatment group significantly outperformed the control group in both cognitive post pre-lab tests. However, the control group attained the greatest increase in cognitive scores between the post pre-lab and post lab tests. The time of task revealed significant differences, though not consistently for the same group, highlighting a difference between laboratory topics. The lab-skills tests showed that both groups performed similarly with no significant difference suggesting that neither approach may have contributed to their lab skills development. Students also had similar experiential satisfaction with no significant difference between the virtual pre-lab simulation and the pre-lab in the traditional laboratory manual.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is a thermoplastic polymeric material that is chemically inert, vacuum compatible, has a low surface energy, and has a large operating temperature range due to its high melting temperature. PTFE is also the lowest friction bulk polymer, which has led to its use as a solid lubricant in a wide variety of application spaces including, but not limited to, friction modifiers in oils and greases and in low friction coatings. However, PTFE suffers from extremely high wear rates, which limits its ability to be used as a bulk solid lubricant material. The addition of filler materials to bulk PTFE has resulted in wear rates that are 10-10,000x lower than PTFE alone. There are several wear reducing mechanisms for PTFE composite materials that have been developed in previous studies, including: 1) the prevention of crack propagation and delamination of PTFE, 2) the mechanochemical alteration of the material at the sliding interface, and 3) the modification of the sliding interface through filler accumulation and inclusion, which reinforces the material at the sliding interface. This work seeks to further understand the wear reducing mechanisms for ultralow wear PTFE composite materials under varying contact conditions, and to develop process-structure-property relationships for a multi-polymer composite material, PTFE and  poly ether ketone ketone (PEKK) blends, and link these relationships to fundamental wear mechanisms.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this work, an ultralow wear composite is developed  - a PTFE-PEKK blend. PEKK is a thermoplastic polymeric material with excellent mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties but suffers from high friction and moderate wear. It is found that PTFE-PEKK composite materials can result in wear rates which are 1,000 – 10,000x lower than the wear rates of bulk PTFE, and low wear behavior can be produced at high weight percent loadings of PEKK. The wear and friction behaviors along with the mechanical and thermal properties of the composites are found to be dependent on the ratio of the content of PTFE and PEKK in the composite. The environmental sensitivity of the material was investigated, demonstrating that the wear reducing mechanisms of the composite do not depend as heavily on mechanochemically developed species at the interface that many other low wear PTFE composite materials rely on, but require the accumulation of PEKK at the sliding interface. This PTFE-PEKK composite material’s structure and properties can be changed significantly through the thermal processing conditions that the material undergoes, which is found to be due in large part to a thermal degradation mechanism present in PEKK at temperatures necessary for processing PTFE and PEKK composite materials. Thermal degradation of the PEKK in the composites and subsequent crosslinking of the material leads to an increase in storage modulus of the composite, and a decrease in the viscous response of the composite with increasing temperature. Wear rate and friction coefficient are found to decrease with increasing thermal degradation of the PEKK in the composite. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Other materials are investigated, including alumina particles and poly ether ether ketone (PEEK), which is a thermoplastic material within the same family of polyaryletherketones as PEKK. Wear and friction measurements, along with chemical analysis of the sliding interface using infrared spectroscopy, are performed on composites comprised of PTFE blended with PEEK and PTFE filled with alumina. Through the variation of sliding contact conditions and contacting materials, it is found that the PTFE-alumina composite requires a high surface energy gradient and hard sliding countersurface to initiate the filler particle breakdown and reincorporation into the tribofilm that leads to the development of tribochemical species and the low wear behavior. In contrast, PTFE-PEEK composites achieve ultralow wear through the accumulation of PEEK at the interface but do not need a hard countersurface to achieve this, and benefit from contacting surfaces which are conformal, do not abrade the material, and have similar surface energies.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Since its inception in the early twentieth century, academic theatre has used practical production experiences as a link between education and the professional industry. This experience was propelled by the educational pioneers, George Pierce Baker, Hallie Flanagan, and Thomas Wood Stevens, claiming production work as an essential tool for industry improvement and professionalization. However, universities struggled with the placement of this non-traditional academic work, frequently leaving it to be an extra-curricular component and placing large amounts of additional labor on student participants. Today, contemporary collegiate theatre programs continue the tradition of practical production work as tools of industry improvement and professionalization, with this requirement now codified by the National Association for Schools of Theatre’s (NAST) accreditation standards. This thesis will trace the history of production work in academic theatre from the early programs such as Harvard and Yale to Florida State University’s current School of Theatre (FSU SOT). This history will culminate in an exploration of educational ideals in practice as an examination of my autoethnographic approach as the calling stage manager for one of FSU’s fall productions. This experience allows a glimpse at how FSU’s ideals manifest in the production process, focusing on the labor of student participants and the sustainable systems that have been implemented to protect the wellbeing of these students. This thesis proposes that academic theatre more closely returns to the original mission of industry improvement, working as a try-out space for sustainable labor practices that can shift the professional industry away from its current normalization of burnout and exhaustion. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Research has shown that the frequency of patterns in everyday print influences the naming speed of those patterns. The present study aims to investigate the impact of single-letter frequency on naming time in the Rapid Automatized Naming (RAN) task, specifically the isolated (discrete) version. While previous literature has extensively explored word frequency effects on recognition speed, the influence of single-letter frequency in print on single-letter naming time remains underexplored and inconclusive. The significance of understanding factors that impact letter naming speed lies in its correlation with word reading ability and its role in serial letter naming, which has demonstrated a stronger connection to reading than discrete letter naming.  This study sought to determine if single-letter frequency significantly influences naming times in the discrete task and whether single-letter naming time or frequency uniquely predicts naming time in a primed RAN task. These were measured in a study of 108 college-aged students. Results showed that reaction times varied by both the person and the letter in the discrete RAN task. However, single-letter frequency did not account for this variance. The results also showed that reaction times varied by both the person and the letter in the primed RAN task as well. Surprisingly, single letter frequency and discrete RAN emerged as unique predictors of primed RAN accounting for a significant proportion of the variance in reaction times. This finding was unexpected. Single-letter reaction time varying between letters has important implications for measuring RAN assessments that are commonly used in progress monitoring. Single-letter naming time differences may account for some of the variability between forms using different letters. Although letter frequency did not account for this variability, future research should investigate what other factors may explain this variability between letters.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>	Skies &amp; Horizons is a collection of pieces for wind ensemble connected through figurative and literal concepts pertaining to the ground, earth, sea, sky, and stars. The work is divided into ten pieces, totaling twenty-three minutes in length. Succinct and full of character, each piece explores various possibilities, in which the wind ensemble and its subsections can offer. 	Throughout history, our place on this planet and university have served as a point of inspiration for philosophers, artists, explorers, musicians, and numerous other fields. Concepts and inspiration for the work have manifested in the pieces: Horizon Expanse (1’), Separating Circle (1:45’), Celestia (2:30’), Mirage (2’), Kite-Flying (3’), Redwoods (3’), Soarin’ (2:30’), Sky Dive (2:45’), Vanishing Point (2:00’), and Fireside (3:30’) for a combined duration of approximately 24 minutes. 
	While unified under the concept of Skies &amp; Horizons, each piece are distinct in their own right. Horizon Expanse opens the work with a powerful fanfare, Three pieces feature the subsection of the wind ensemble, Mirage – percussion, Redwoods – woodwinds, Soarin’ – brass. Separating Circle and Vanishing Point represent intricate and technical pieces with angular motives and rhythmic patterns, while Celestia, Kite-Flying, and Sky Dive incorporate more flowing, melodic passages. Fireside concludes the work with a requiem in a celebration for life lived and loved.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation utilizes a basic qualitative exploratory approach to examine the schooling experiences of eight Black high school males in a predominantly White community. It seeks to understand how they define and make sense of their own mental health and well-being through a theoretical framework of Mental Health and Well-being: A Socio-Ecological Model (Michaels et al., 2022). The findings of this dissertation revealed that the schooling experiences of Black males is multifaceted, with both positive and negative aspects that influence their understanding and management of their mental health and well-being. Despite this complexity, participants generally expressed a positive overall mental health, attributing this to a range of coping skills they would employ when faced with challenging situations. While peers and school staff were perceived as sources of support in navigating challenges, they were also identified as contributors to issues related to school belonging, safety, and racial identity. Participants discussed the pressures of acceptance while also navigating instances of racism and microaggressions from their peers and school staff. However, participants were able to acknowledge that their involvement with extracurricular activities and the support provided by their school regarding mental health and well-being, had a positive impact, mitigating some of the challenges faced by Black males. The implications of this study are relevant for school officials, administrators, teachers, researchers, and families, providing insights into how to better support Black males attending schools in predominantly White communities. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation focuses on the mechanochemical synthesis of several families of multicomponent crystals (MCCs), their characterization by multinuclear solid-state NMR (SSNMR) and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), and their structure determination by single crystal XRD (SCXRD) and/or NMR-guided Rietveld refinements. All MCCs reported herein are inorganic-organic hybrids featuring different combinations of simple organic molecules with alkali or ammonium chloride salts, and sometimes water. The MCCs were prepared via ball milling, with syntheses optimized for maximum yield and efficiency.  NMR crystallography (NMRX), which features a combination of multinuclear SSNMR, XRD methods, and dispersion-corrected plane-wave DFT calculations, was used to validate, refine, and in some cases, aid in solving the crystal structures via Rietveld analysis.  The NMRX work herein relies upon quadrupolar nuclides (i.e., those with spin &gt; ½), with an emphasis on 35Cl SSNMR of chloride ions (Cl–) present in each MCC, as well as alkali metal SSNMR (7Li, 23Na, 39K, 87Rb, 133Cs).  Additionally, comparisons of experimental and calculated 35Cl electric field gradient (EFG) tensors are presented as guiding metrics for structural validation, and to elucidate their relationships to molecular-level structures and crystallographic symmetry.	In Chapter 2, five MCCs of the form NR4Cl:xUrea·yH2O (R = H, Et, n-Pr; x = 1, 2; y = 0, 2) were prepared to demonstrate the utility of 35Cl SSNMR for use in NMRX investigations.  35Cl SSNMR spectra reveal powder patterns that act as spectral fingerprints for each MCC, while also detecting residual educts not observed in corresponding PXRD patterns. DFT calculations on geometry-optimized structures yielded 35Cl EFG tensors in good agreement with experiment, except for NH4Cl:Urea; hence, ab initio molecular dynamics (aiMD) simulations were used to study the impact of molecular motions of NH4+ cations on the 35Cl EFG tensors, and their concomitant use for structural characterization.
	Chapter 3 explores accelerated aging (AA) reactions that produce four of the MCCs from Chapter 2, using in situ and ex situ 35Cl SSNMR and ex situ PXRD for monitoring.  Different aspects of the AA reactions were investigated, such as mechanical activation (ball milling vs. gentle mixing), environmental conditions (temperature and humidity), sample packing and unpacking, and different reactant ratios. Comparisons of the AA reactions yielding NH4Cl:Urea and NEt4Cl:2Urea demonstrate that the induction times dramatically impact reaction rates.  Reaction mixtures of NPr4Cl and urea in 1:2 and 1:3 ratios produced MCCs with very different AA rates, and revealed a series of transient species, offering insight into competitive kinetic and thermodynamic effects on AA reactions.
	In Chapter 4, two classes of MCCs of the forms MCl:xCA (CA = cyanuric acid; M = Li, Na, Rb, Cs; x = 1, 2) and MCl:xBA∙yH2O (BA = barbituric acid; x = 1, 2; y = 0, 2; M = Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs) were prepared with ball milling. Twelve MCCs were characterized using multinuclear SSNMR, including 35Cl, 13C, and alkali metal nuclides, as well as PXRD and SCXRD methods.  Seven novel MCl:xBA∙yH2O MCCs were discovered, and new crystal structures are reported for five of these. Alkali metal SSNMR spectra aid in determining the number of distinct sites and rapidly detecting residual educts.  Comparison of experimental and calculated 35Cl EFG tensors suggests they are influenced by both H⋯Cl– hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions involving alkali cations.
	Finally, Chapter 5, which combines many ideas from the preceding chapters, features three MCCs of the form MCl:Urea∙xH2O (M = Li, Na, Cs; x = 0, 1) that were prepared via ball milling and NMRX-guided Rietveld refinements to solve their crystal structures.  35Cl SSNMR was the most useful technique for their characterization, due to its inherent sensitivity to different H⋯Cl– hydrogen bonding configurations.  23Na MAS NMR allowed for the in situ monitoring of the autocatalytic degradation of NaCl:Urea∙H2O. All characterization data were used to inform the initial structures for Rietveld analysis, with final Rietveld structures subjected to DFT geometry optimizations, enabling exploration of relationships between the local hydrogen bonding environments of the chloride ions and NMR interaction tensors.
	It is anticipated that the synthetic methods herein will be used to generate a broad range of MCCs of increasing complexity, featuring different metal ions, simple organic molecules, and ratios of components.  These highly efficient syntheses, in combination with the characterization protocols described herein, could be beneficial for the design of new quadrupolar NMRX techniques for validating, refining, and solving the crystal structures for a wide range of MCCs where conventional characterization methods fall short, perhaps even allowing for the prediction of hitherto unknown structures in tandem with modern crystal structure prediction methods.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this content analysis was to explore the current literature published in American Music Therapy Association journals regarding vocational skills for adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD). A content analysis of 15 articles was completed and analyzed for (a) the prevalence of literature addressing vocational skills and rehabilitation with individuals with I/DD, (b) the methodologies used in research on this topic, (c) the music therapy goals and interventions discussed in current literature, and (d) the settings in which music therapists address vocational skills with individuals with I/DD. Of the articles analyzed, most research was found in Journal of Music Therapy, with only three articles published on the topic within the last 20 years. The most prominent goal in the literature was social and interpersonal skills, and instrument play was the most mentioned type of intervention. Due to the gap in literature, further and more current research is needed on music therapy and vocational skills with individuals with I/DD.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Scholars have advocated for more environmental education (EE) within elementary preservice teacher education through science methods courses as elementary preservice teachers have consistently demonstrated limited environmental literacy. This is critical as environmental issues continue to threaten our world, preservice teachers must demonstrate the environmental literacy needed to teach our youngest students about the impacts of these problems on communities. The goal of this qualitative case study was to explore how four preservice teachers who engaged in a semester of EE demonstrated environmental literacy and reflected on instructional practices that aligned with the Ambitious Science Teaching instructional framework that was implemented during the science methods course. In-depth interviews with preservice teachers, along with an analysis of their written work during the semester, revealed that they drew on their own funds of knowledge to demonstrate knowledge and a sense of concern about environmental issues and the impact they have on communities in different ways. However, preservice teachers mainly showed individualistic ideas about these problems and were reluctant to take action within the community to address them. This research also suggests future instructional approaches to strengthen preservice teachers’ environmental literacy to best prepare them to engage their future elementary students in EE, helping our youngest learners understand more about the world around them.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Oxidoreductase enzyme complexes are one of the known biomolecular machines, which play a cru- cial role in cellular biochemistry including metabolic, signaling, and electron transport pathways. In these complexes, individual subunits can oligomerize to form homo-multimers or hetero-multimers and can transiently interact with redox enzyme partners to perform multistep enzymatic reactions. Multi-subunit oxidoreductases can show inter- and intra-subunit domain interactions by switching from open to closed conformations in order to deliver electrons to their oxidase partners. Assimi- latory sulfite reductase (SiR) is an NADPH-dependent multidomain oxidoreductase that catalyzes sulfur reduction to produce sulfide, the bioavailable form of sulfur for subsequent synthesis of biomolecules. In Escherichia coli, SiR is a dodecameric holoenzyme, consisting of eight subunits of a flavoprotein (SiRFP) and four subunits of a hemoprotein (SiRHP). SiRFP is a diflavin reductase, a homolog of cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) that is composed of the following domains: a FMN binding flavodoxin (Fld)-like-domain, a connection domain interrupting FAD/NADPH bind- ing FNR (Ferredoxin/NADP+ reductase)-like-domain and a flexible linker connecting Fld and FNR domains. This flexible linker is ∼ 30 amino acids long and remains crucial for transferring electrons from one domain to another. SiRHP is a metal-harboring domain that contains a siroheme (iron- containing tetrapyrrole) cofactor at the active site covalently coupled with Fe4S4 cluster through cysteine conjugations. Chapter 1 provides an introduction of multi domain oxidoreductases with a main focus on SiR and its homologs.Chapter 2 provides information about small-angle scattering technique including both neutron scattering and X-ray scattering. Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) and neutron contrast variation technique are discussed in detail. SANS is used to analyze the solution structure of proteins and gives information about the radius of gyration, inter atomic distances between the particles, shape and size of the protein sample and also gives an approximate idea about the molecular weight of the sample.
Chapter 3 includes the structural characterization of the SiR complex. SANS, neutron contrast variation, analytical ultracentrifugation and other biophysical techniques showed that SiR is an asymmetric complex. SiRFP undergoes compaction in the complex as compared to the free SiRFP and the four SiRHP binds at the periphery of the complex. This study showed the first solution structure of the SiR complex.
Chapter 4 provides information about the two conformationally restricted variants of SiRFP and showed the possibility of open and closed conformations of SiRFP. This study showed the presence of domain crossover in SiRFP which indicates that the Fld domain of one polypeptide can interact with the FNR domain of an adjacent polypeptide. The SANS measurements provide the first model of the possible arrangement of eight subunits of SiRFP and showed that the N-terminal helical bundle acts as a central core of the complex.
Chapter 5 presents a study about a novel variant of SiRFP which forms a tetramer. The N- terminus region of SiRFP consists of only 52 amino acids which oligomerizes to form an octamer. This study showed that four amino acids (Y39, F40, Q22, Q47) of the SiRFP’s N-terminus region play a crucial role in the oligomerization of the eight copies of SiRFP. These residues show aromatic stacking (Y39, F40) and salt bridge interactions (Q22, Q47) between the helices and thus form a strong octameric bundle. Mutating these four amino acids results in a tetrameric assembly of SiRFP. The ultra stable properties of SiRFP’s N-terminus octameric helical bundle are also discussed in this chapter.
Chapter 6 includes the cryo-EM studies of SiR. SiR is a challenging sample to study using cryo-EM due to its sensitivity to the air-water interface during the grid preparation. This chapter reveals that a minimal binding interface is present between the SiRFP and SiRHP dimer. This study also shows the first high resolution structure of the SiRFP/SiRHP variant and explains that this minimal interaction is governed by the N-terminus of SiRHP and the FNR domain of SiRFP. Additionally, the highly flexible Fld domain of SiRFP explains its accessibility for transferring electrons to its redox partner.
The last chapter highlights the future direction of the SiR project. It explains the ongoing crystallization related work for the different variants of SiRFP. Chapter 7 also includes the trou- bleshooting of SiR’s sample preparation for cryo-EM studies which aims to solve the high resolution structure of this complex.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Triple Threat: A Study of American Musical Theatre Training, explores the history, growth, ethics, and progression of professional musical theatre training and BFA musical theatre programs in the United States. As this type of accredited conservatory training has existed for less than sixty years, this project ultimately seeks to pioneer an intensive inquiry into the evolution of musical theatre training, both prior to its existence within the academy and in the BFA context, and trace its relationship with the professional theatre industry. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The first part of this work will historicize musical theatre training in America prior to its placement within academia, highlighting the foundations of existing methodologies, delving into the backgrounds of its most influential contributors, and identifying the strengths and challenges presented by the training throughout its development. The second part will chart the history of BFA musical theatre training within academia, contextualizing the evolution of the training within the larger framework of American higher education. This portion of the work will utilize three case studies conducted from a sampling of BFA musical theatre programs across the country to recount their respective histories and evolution, gain insight into the structures and goals of each program, and assess their relationship with the professional industry. Using the information learned from the historical research and case study portions of the project, the final part of this study will address the challenges and potentialities of current musical theatre training. An encompassing scope of the entire work will examine the inherent and pathological diversity and inclusion problems in both academia and the professional musical theatre industry. I seek to analyze how both institutions inform, uphold, or challenge the other, and how both entities may strategize for progress and change in these areas to create a more equitable industry, which I propose begins with the training. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>My study aims to unpack the promise of “Triple Threat training” that purports to develop well-rounded performers equally proficient in acting, singing, and dancing, where the curriculum seems to be both defined and limited by a set of prescribed skill sets. While mastery of skills valued by the existing industry is an undoubtedly important component of this training, I argue that musical theatre training must evolve to emphasize the areas in which scholarship, artistry, and craftsmanship may converge, developing artist-thinkers who can identify possibilities in the industry that may not be currently presented. I thus propose that this can be achieved through a new Triple Threat training model that replaces the pillared standards of acting, singing, and dancing with artistry, advocacy, and entrepreneurship. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In the American music industry, genre is used to efficiently organize music into digestible forms for consumers, critics, and creators. The trade-off for efficiency in this industry is fewer genre options, which leads to songs and artists being placed in imprecise categories. Across the American music industry, streaming platforms (e.g. Spotify), media (e.g. Billboard), distributors (e.g. record stores), and award shows affect how artists' music is viewed, assessed, heard, and consumed. A prime example of commercial efficiency is the misplacement of artists into specific award categories at the Recording Academy’s Grammy Awards Show. In the past year, this has resulted in Drake and The Weekend, two of the biggest pop music stars in the world, withholding their music for the 2023 Grammy submission. Their decision is a reaction to the Recording Academy’s inaccurate assessment of artists and their work. Across the industry, genre handling has provided many results that benefit various parties. This thesis aims to examine how the music industry's efficient approach to handling genre compares to that of the fans who consume music daily.Genre is ever-evolving by the people who make and consume it, but it is limited to the musical elements deemed a standard of that genre by American music companies. David Brackett states that the music industry uses “marketing categories” with varying rules and restrictions that are amendable to the organization of music. In contrast, fans view music as “critic-fan genres” with specific rules and qualifications for artists and songs to fit into particular genres. I will extend Brackett’s genre theory by providing further insight into how the American music industry’s approach to handling genre affects artists and consumers. To accomplish this, I will use ethnographic methods and music analysis to provide critical commentary and analytical proof for my discussion on genre. I understand that the music industry encompasses all areas of music, so I will use hip-hop and Latin trap as case studies to show how people associated with the most popular music genres are affected. By providing a detailed examination of how the industry and consumers view well-known genres, I would like this thesis to assist consumers and music industry insiders in learning about the various ways we can improve on the current genre classification system across the American music industry.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Dollhouse Dreams and Other Broken Things is a collection of personal essays exploring issues of the body, the historically silenced voice and shifting notions of femininity. The collection also investigates how myths that shape the body are continually carried down and reinforced by families, institutions, and culture. This essay collection is both a deconstruction of these myths and a reconstruction of what the body/home can look like—or rather what it means to (re)build after the deconstruction of patriarchal values.  These essays illuminate both the holding of breath and the relinquishing of voice, but also the stirring movements towards agency. One sub-focus of this essay collection includes an interrogation of the fairy tale childhood—one that not only encourages a belief in happy endings anchored by a prince charming but also encourages this magical thinking in other avenues. Instead of doing away with these classic tales, I merge them with autobiographical essays in order to bring the woman back into these stories written by men, rebuilding and reshaping patriarchal representations of womanhood in the process.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Visual communication plays an important role in the evolution of organisms, as selection processes often rely on the organism’s physical appearance. For example, mate choice—often by females selecting the most attractive males—can lead to the evolution of brighter or more exaggerated patterns. However, there are instances where organisms have evolved physical attributes beneficial for sexual selection but costly in terms of energy expenditure or increased predation risk. A particularly valuable communication channel, then, would be one invisible to predators but helpful for identifying potential mates. Signals produced via the mechanism of fluorescence have been proposed to be such a channel. Although biologists have described biofluorescence in a diversity of taxa, there have been few systematic efforts to document the extent of biofluorescence within a taxonomic group or to investigate its general significance. These signals were recently discovered in amphibians. The goal of my dissertation was to: (1) assess the diversity of frog biofluorescence, (2) examine the function of fluorescence in predation on frogs, and to (3) reconstruct a highly supported phylogeny for a treefrog genus upon which we can (4) test for accelerated speciation of biofluorescence lineages within one treefrog clade. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>First, through a field survey across South America, I discovered and documented patterns of biofluorescence in tropical amphibians. Through these efforts, I more than tripled the number of species that have been tested for this trait and added representatives from previously untested anuran families. Fluorescence was ubiquitous; I recorded at least a low-level fluorescent signal from every individual I tested. I found evidence for ecological tuning (i.e., the specific adaptation of a signal to the environment in which it is received) of the novel anuran biofluorescent signals. For the majority (56.58%) of Anura species tested, the fluorescence excitation peak matches the wavelengths most abundant at twilight, the light environment in which most frog species are active. Additionally, biofluorescence emission spans both wavelengths of low availability in twilight and the peak sensitivity of green-sensitive rods in the anuran eye, likely increasing contrast of this signal for a conspecific receiver. With evidence of tuning to the ecology and sensory systems of frogs, my results suggest frog biofluorescence is likely functioning in anuran communication.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>After demonstrating the significance of frog biofluorescence as a potential signal, the next critical line of inquiry was to examine who is receiving the signal: potential predators, mates, or both. I began to test this through a case study experimentally testing the function of frog fluorescence in predation of a local treefrog species. Over half of the studies documenting biofluorescence in the last century suggest this fluorescent signal may affect predation; however, to date, only one other experimental study has tested this hypothesis. To address this question, I first quantified the spectral characteristics of a novel biofluorescence pattern in the Cope’s Gray Treefrog, Hyla chrysoscelis. In both sexes of this species, the fluorescent signal is concentrated in an area that contains a proposed aposematic pattern that may warn predators of the frog’s toxic secretions. I hypothesized that the biofluorescent trait may increase the conspicuousness of this pattern and enable the frogs to deter predators more effectively. I then tested this prediction by conducting a clay model field experiment to assess differences in predation attempts on fluorescent versus non-fluorescent H. chrysoscelis models by various predator types. I found no effect of biofluorescence on the overall presence, type, or location of predation, suggesting that biofluorescence alone does not act as an antipredator signal of H. chrysoscelis. This study represents one of the first attempts to experimentally test the effect of biofluorescence on predation in any organism and the first to do so in amphibians. Further work is needed to explore the role of this trait in predation in other systems and to investigate alternative functions for the biofluorescent signal in H. chrysoscelis.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The final goal of my dissertation was to examine the evolution of biofluorescence across an amphibian clade. To do so, I first reconstructed, and time-calibrated, a highly supported phylogeny for one treefrog genus upon which we can test for trait-dependent accelerated speciation rates. With 108 recognized species, Dendropsophus is one of the most diverse genera of tropical treefrogs in the Western Hemisphere. Despite the broad distribution of the clade across Central and South America, little is known about the biogeographic origins and expansion of the group or how key life history traits have evolved in this taxon. I reconstructed a phylogeny of Dendropsophus based on 432 nuclear loci for 78 taxa (72% of species) obtained using anchored hybrid enrichment. I estimated divergence times within the clade to reconstruct the biogeographic history of the genus to test alternative models of dispersal. I also assessed the evolution of egg deposition mode and examined correlations with speciation rate and the extent of biogeographic expansions. I recovered a well-resolved phylogeny with very strong support at 92% of the nodes. I found evidence that the genus likely originated approximately 57 mya, occupying the Eastern Highlands and Amazonian-Orinocan Lowland, and underwent multiple expansions into the surrounding Central and South American biomes. The origin of the genus predates the beginning of the Andean uplift in western South America. The best supported biogeographic hypothesis for the Dendropsophus clade is one of unconstrained dispersal between the Eastern Highlands and Amazonian Basin. My results suggest that the majority of Dendropsophus groups originated via range expansion speciation events that occurred during the Andean uplift. Overall, my phylogenomic data provide clear resolution of the evolutionary relationships among species of Dendropsophus. My study provides insight into the biogeographic origin and expansion of the clade and demonstrates that the dispersal of this group was not as heavily constrained by a changing ecological history as previously hypothesized. The evolution from an aquatic to terrestrial egg deposition mode was not correlated with speciation rate or the extent of biogeographic expansions. Given Dendropsophus is one of the most broadly ranging genera in South and Central America, my highly supported tree will be an invaluable tool for future clade-specific and comparative studies investigating the evolution of life history traits, mating behaviors, and ecological associations throughout these regions.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Finally, I mapped the evolution of biofluorescence across the Dendropsophus treefrog genus. I utilized ancestral state reconstruction to examine the evolutionary history of biofluorescent traits (intensity, area, and color) within the genus. Dendropsophus is a widespread, diverse South American genus, and studies have examined clade-specific drivers of diversification, but only within the context of ecological constraints and not color pattern divergence. The biofluorescent patterns I discovered in Dendropsophus range from widespread, full body coverage to location-specific patches. Hence, my goals of this study were to (1) map these traits across the recently published, highly supported, time calibrated Dendropsophus phylogeny based on anchored hybrid enrichment data, and (2) use state-dependent diversification models to determine if biofluorescence parameters affect speciation rate to ascertain whether visual (fluorescence) signals have contributed to an accelerated rate of speciation within the genus. My study provides the first insight into the evolutionary history of biofluorescence in Dendropsophus frogs. My results suggest a biofluorescent ancestor for the clade with an intense, widespread, green emission phenotype. I found evidence of a strong phylogenetic signal between the traits of fluorescence and the Dendropsophus phylogeny. Finally, fluorescent intensity, but not emission color, influenced speciation rate in the genus; and the influence of fluorescent area is still unresolved. Dendropsophus lineages with greater than 10% biofluorescent intensity had a speciation rate over 7.2 times faster than the speciation rate for lineages with less than 10% fluorescent intensity. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The combination of my findings suggests there is an adaptive function of frog fluorescence for intraspecific communication. I found (1) evidence for sensory drive of the frog fluorescent signal, (2) this signal meets criteria of ecological significance for intraspecific communication, (3) no effect of fluorescence on predation of frogs, and (4) a correlation between treefrog fluorescent intensity and an increased speciation rate. Together, these results highlight the potential importance of this recently discovered trait and the need for further exploration of this novel signal to determine its function in anuran communication.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to determine how choral, band, and orchestral string musicians perceive the clarity and expressivity of choral, band, and orchestral conductors based upon the use or non-use of the baton. This study aimed to address the following research questions: (1) Are there differences in collegiate choral, band, and orchestral string musicians’ ratings of conductor clarity or expressivity dependent upon the presence or absence of the baton? (2) Are there differences in collegiate choral, band, and orchestral string musicians’ ratings of conductor clarity or expressivity dependent upon the specialty of the conductor? (3) What aspects of conductor baton use or non-use influence collegiate choral, band, and orchestral string musicians’ ratings of conductor clarity and expressivity? (4) Do collegiate orchestral string musicians’ ratings of conductor clarity and expressivity align more closely to those of choral musicians, band musicians, or neither?I selected three highly expressive professional recordings of Morton Lauridsen’s O Magnum Mysterium, one each of the original chorus composition, the band transcription, and the string orchestra transcription. I then invited a graduate orchestral conductor, graduate band conductor, and graduate choral conductor to conduct the recording that fit their specialty both with and without a baton. I then recorded each conductor as they conducted along to their recording with and without a baton and replaced the camera audio with the professional audio. Two 30 second to 45 second excerpts from each conducting recording were selected and anonymized. These excerpts where then placed into a survey asking participants to view each video, rate each video for conducting clarity and expressivity, and optionally provide feedback about how they arrived at their ratings. This survey was then distributed to several universities around the United States.
Participants (N = 238) consisted of collegiate choral (n = 93), band (n = 74), and orchestral string (n = 71) musicians. Statistical analysis revealed significant main effects for baton use in ratings of expressivity as well as significant interactions between conductor specialty and baton use for ratings of clarity and expressivity and significant interactions between participant musician type and conductor specialty for ratings of clarity. No significant interaction between participant musician type and baton use was found. Participants overall found the bare hands to be more expressive than the baton, with no significant difference in clarity. Both the choral conductor and band conductor were found to be clearer with the baton, significantly more so than the orchestral conductor. Chorus musicians considered the choral conductor to be clearer than either the band or orchestral conductor, while band and orchestral musicians both agreed that the orchestral conductor was less clear than either the choral or band conductor. Band and orchestral string musicians tended to align on most metrics.
Qualitative analysis of comments (N = 599) left by participants suggests that most participants were influenced by aspects of the conductors unrelated to the baton or right hand. Of those comments that did center on the baton or right hand, most were concerned with issues of technique, congruency of musical gestures with musical response, and overall quality. Only a small subset of comments specifically attributed their ratings to the presence or absence of the baton.
Taken together, these findings have implications for both conducting research and applied conducting. In conducting research, the practice of generalizing findings of studies done with wind and percussion players to all instrumentalists, inclusive of string players, would appear to be valid. The converse may also be true: the findings of future conducting research done with orchestral string players may also be generalizable to wind and percussion players. For applied conducting, while the need to be comfortable both with a baton and without a baton has not been negated, it seems that as far as musicians in general are concerned, conductors may be able to take advantage of the increased expressivity of conducting without the baton without a significant loss of clarity given appropriate technique and training. However, further research on the use of the baton in a variety of styles and tempi is necessary.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Many flutists are familiar with Francois Borne’s Carmen Fantasie, Franz and Karl Doppler’s Rigoletto Fantasie, and Paul Taffanel’s Mignon and Der Freischütz Fantasies. While these virtuosic showpieces have been favorites of the flute repertoire for decades, they only represent a small portion of a much larger body of repertoire. There are over 300 extant opera fantasies that feature the flute which have been arranged by over 120 composers and feature motives and themes from over 130 operas.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In addition to discussing the context in which the opera fantasy became so popular in the nineteenth century, this document intends to serve as a reference work for flutists by suggesting a proposed process for analyzing and performing opera fantasies and cataloging known and lost opera fantasies written for the flute. It also proposes why opera fantasies fell out of favor in the twentieth century, and presents justification for their continued relevance, pedagogical implications, and newfound popularity in the flute repertoire today.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Moscow is a State of Mind explores the psychological landscape of a Dark Night of the Soul the narrator worked through between 2011-2023. Excising the roots of personal trauma by means of poems that describe personal events too intense and traumatic to place into narrative format—“event,” in this case, meaning a rupture in the narrative fabric of reality itself—Moscow is a book that reads “across” itself, as if a strong wind were spreading memory, desire, and lawn ornaments across the field of a troubled life. The poems speak to one another like an entangled quantum system. A dog appears in one poem as a porcelain accessory in an MTV music video, only to reappear later being led into the water to be drowned by its owner. By following the different guises of the dog and other similar patterns of imagery and exploring how they relate to one another, we begin to see a story superimposed on top of its own self, the mind as a feedback loop feeding itself back into itself, struggling to make sense of emotional realities too intense for narrative to capture. As William Blake wrote in his “Proverbs of Hell,” “The cistern contains; the fountain overflows.” The emotional trauma of a difficult childhood explains itself through meditations on time, human consciousness, global catastrophes present and past, Biblical allegory, and other similar intensities. Throughout, however, a curious form of joy and play provides a levity that counterbalances the darkness. In this surreal fusion of hell and joy, the narrator of Moscow is a State of Mind dances a war within himself, resolving what cannot be said through witness to what must not be forgotten. The end goal is annihilation of self, not through self-destruction but through self-transcendence: To wake up from history, even for a moment, into the vast presence of every possible dawn.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>ABSTRACTThe purpose of this study was to explore whether a targeted Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) program, Classroom Champions, would close gaps in SEL skill areas identified by a student universal screener. This study specifically examined the skill areas of persistence, engagement, and optimism. The first research question examined the levels of student persistence, engagement, and optimism in comparison and intervention groups before and after program implementation. The second research question examined the relationship between student participation in Classroom Champions and student growth in the areas of persistence, engagement, and optimism. The third research question examined how growth in the areas of persistence, engagement, and optimism among intervention group participants differed by gender. Participants in both the intervention (n = 215) and comparison group (n = 545) were in grades 6-12. Participants were given a universal screener prior to SEL curriculum to obtain baseline scores for persistence, engagement, and optimism. The screener was administered again after completion of instructional delivery to obtain post-test scores. Data analysis was completed with the use of paired sample t-tests, independent sample t-tests, simple linear regression, and multiple regression. Findings showed that both the intervention and comparison group saw statistically significant differences in pre- and post-test scores in the area of engagement. There was a statistically significant change score in the area of persistence for the intervention group; however, analysis of pre-test means showed that the intervention group started out significantly lower than the comparison group in this area. There were no statistically significant findings related to gender. In conclusion, although there were some statistically significant findings, there were no conclusive results that the targeted SEL curriculum was able to close the identified SEL skill gaps. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The purpose of this dissertation was to extend the knowledge in the field on effective and efficient ways to teach reading to students with extensive support needs (ESN) in small groups. Chapter one provides the rationale for research on reading for students with ESN and an overview of the questions addressed in the dissertation. Chapter two is a systematic literature review of the research on reading interventions for students with moderate and severe intellectual disabilities (ID). This chapter describes the reading components targeted, identifies the evidence based instructional practices used in current research, describes the treatment intensity of intervention implemented in current research for students with moderate and severe ID and discusses the percentage of goal obtained for single case studies as a measure of effect size. Chapter three is a single-case, repeated acquisition design study that examines the effects of the Accessible Literacy Learning (ALL; Light &amp; McNaughton, 2009) program on the development of letter sound correspondence, sound blending and decoding skills for students with ESN in small groups. Result of this study indicate that with explicit, systematic instruction and supports students ESN can make gains in foundational reading skills. Results, social validity, implications and future research are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>While Black students have experienced significant growth in college enrollment since the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Higher Education Act of 1965, they are still less likely than their white counterparts to attend and graduate from a post-secondary institution (Ryan &amp; Bauman, 2016). There have been previous studies on college access programs that aim to combat the challenges contributing to the college access gap for Black students, such as percentage plans, admissions lotteries, and admissions preferences for low socioeconomic students. Although the aim was to promote equality, race-neutral and objective admissions policies perpetuate patterns of power, privilege, and racial inequity by assuming that all educational resources are equal (Bonilla-Silva, 2010). In an effort to address educational disparities, the Florida State University Office of Admissions, Center for Academic Retention and Enhancement (CARE), and Office of Financial Aid joined forces in 2015 to launch the High School Partners Program, a new college access initiative. Students from eight (8) public high schools located in three counties along the eastern and western corridor of Interstate 10 in Florida receive support with college applications and enrollment through the High School Partners Program (Florida State University, 2021). Increasing the percentage of students from underfunded public high schools who applied and were accepted to Florida State University was the objective of the High School Partners Program. All students at participating high schools are eligible for the High School Partners Program, regardless of their financial situation or status as first-generation students, although most of them come from historically underserved backgrounds. The purpose of this study was to explore the role of the High School Partners Program in the college choice process among Black students who enrolled at Florida State University through the general admissions process. This study is supported by research on factors associated with Black students' postsecondary enrollment patterns and chances to improve the pipeline and yield of students from high schools with inadequate resources. Hossler and Gallagher (1987) created a college choice model that outlined three stages (predisposition, search, and choice) that students go through while selecting a college, and this model had an influence on the research framework. The study explored a range of factors that influence students' decision-making through semi-structured interviews. The sample consisted of seven Black students who were enrolled in Fall 2023 and were alumni of a school that was affiliated with the High School Partners Program. 
According to the study's findings, Black students' enrollment in the predisposition or search stages of the Hossler and Gallagher College Choice Model (1987) was not significantly impacted by the High School Partners Program. Comparable to previous studies, family, college reputation, geographic location, cost, and availability of financial aid shaped Black students’ pre-college experiences (Bers &amp; Smith, 1989; Clayton et al., 2023; Comeaux et al., 2020; Sevier, 1992; Weiler, 1994). However, the study indicated that the High School Partners Program played an influential role in the choice stage. Students gave a variety of reasons for choosing to enroll, including scholarship funding, interactions with Black FSU personnel, a different academic and cultural setting from their high schools, household structure, and family member accessibility. The findings also revealed that the High School Partners Program is positively correlated with postsecondary enrollment at FSU for Black student populations that were previously overlooked in the admissions process. These populations include first-generation students who are not eligible for Pell grants and second-generation students who are eligible for Pell grants, who each represent only 9.7% of the university's total FTIC Black student body in Fall 2023 (FSU Office of Institutional Research, 2024).
Participants suggested that in order to improve the FSU High School Partners Program, the admissions staff should consider three primary modifications: 1) increase awareness of the High School Partners Program; 2) provide more opportunities to build relationships with FSU representatives; 3) assist in integrating students from partner schools into the FSU community. Further research is imperative to determine the High School Partners Program's viability as an approach to Black student recruitment and to obtain a better understanding of the student populations that stand to benefit the most from involvement.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Emerging adulthood is a time of great vulnerability for psychological well-being, as during this time, individuals are facing numerous challenges stemming from societal demands in this transitional period. Most notably, emerging adults are some of the most highly anxious cohorts, with over half reporting symptoms of anxiety (Arnett &amp; Colleauges, 2014). Furthermore, anxiety is rising more rapidly for emerging adults than any other age bracket (Goodwin et al., 2020). This research aimed to look internally and examine how emerging adult’s emotion dysregulation may potentially influence their levels of anxiety. Further, this study aimed to examine whether parent-child relationship quality moderated the relation between emerging adult emotion dysregulation and emerging adult anxiety. This research conducted a second study that examined the influence of emerging adult emotion dysregulation on their parent’s anxiety levels. This study also aimed to test whether parenting stress mediated the relation between emerging adult emotion dysregulation and their parents’ anxiety.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Study one participants consisted of 449 college students (M age = 20.45 years, SD = 2.85). Furthermore, study two participants were 142 parent-child dyads. This study analyzed secondary data, as both samples used in this study were sourced from a previous project. Findings from study one suggested that emerging adult emotion dysregulation was significantly associated with emerging adult anxiety. The hypothesis that parent-child relationship quality would moderate the relationship between emerging adult emotion dysregulation and emerging adult anxiety was not supported. For study two, results suggested that emerging adult emotion dysregulation was not significantly related to parents’ anxiety levels. Additionally, the mediation hypothesis of parenting stress between emerging adult emotion dysregulation and parent anxiety was not supported either. Implications of study findings, recommendations, limitations, and future research directions are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The process of Data Assimilation in the Geosciences, in which real world data is used to improve the mathematical simulation of some event of interest, is a large field in applied mathematics. When that system is driven by dynamics, and the real world data is incomplete and noisy, we use the interactions of Bayes Rule with the probability distributions to apply either a filter or smoother to the data. A filter considers an estimate of the current state of the system using up-to-date data, while a smoother considers an estimate of previous state(s) using up-to-date data.  In this thesis, we focus on lag-$l$ Linear Ensemble Transfrom Smoothers (LETS), that use current data to estimate the state of the system $l$ cycles in the past using Monte-Carlo strategies confined to a lower dimensional subspace than the system's dimension. These methods assimilate each new observation as it arrives, behaving as a `smoother in filter's clothing.' Smoothers can have an advantage in forecasting future states over filters in some scenarios; characterizing these scenarios in a way that is practical is one of the goals of this work. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Each system in the geosciences will have a unique structure; the relevance of each observation to a feature of a system (such as a observation of wind above Liverpool and an estimate of the temperature in London), or the distance between two features in the system (such as the rainfall in New York and the rainfall in Seattle). By assimilating this structure, we can further improve the assimilated results produced by a smoother; this is called localization. Further, we can assimilate the reliability or unreliability of the system; this is called inflation. Finally, we can assimilate the `normality' (Gaussian) of the distributions produced to apply the correct method at the correct time; this is called hybridization. Each of the above can be accomplished by `tuning' scalar superparameters, and turning over the task of tuning to a Machine Learning (ML) method. In this work, we consider tuning all of the above when applied to the standard Lorenz test problems, using Global Bayesian Optimization (GBO) as the ML tool. Showing the extensive flexibility of tuning for smoothers, and how they can provide more meaningful comparisons than are standard in the literature, is the main goal of this work. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Along the way, we consider a novel cost/loss functions defined on a lag-$l$ smoother, and various novel LETS methods that are created by the constructive composition of multiple methods together. We consider different localization strategies under a `more fair' framework than what is standard in the literature, by tuning each competitor to near optimum performance given the system.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation explores two chapters of 13D filings. Chapter one examines the impact of activism by non-financial corporations. I find that the market reacts more favorably to corporate activism relative to non-corporate activism. This is irrespective of apparent economic links between a corporate activist and their target firm. Further, corporate activists do not facilitate takeovers in the ways traditional activist investors do. Despite this, I find that corporate activist target firms experience similar ex-post changes in cash, investment, leverage, payout policy, and profitability to non-corporate activist targets. Overall, corporate activists are beneficial to target firms, so it is important to consider them in future activist studies. Chapter two proposes that target firms of activist 13D filings are associated with a decline in the likelihood of experiencing an extreme positive return outcome; i.e., a decline in the target firm’s right-tail return skewness subsequent to the 13D event. The underlying logic is that activists often take actions that increase the target firm’s stock price at the expense of the small possibility of extremely favorable long-term return outcomes. Consistent with a correction of skew-induced overpricing, I report that stock price reactions to 13D filings are lower for target firms associated with higher idiosyncratic skewness. Additional evidence indicates that subsequent changes in firm investment are lower for 13D targets relative to non-13D targets. Further, ex-post extreme right-tail returns are less likely in the years after the 13D filing for targeted firms as opposed to non-targeted firms. Overall, the evidence suggests that investors downwardly revise their expectations of an extreme right-tail outcome following the involvement of activists.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This document comprises two main parts which will respectively focus on how composers, Johann Sebastian Bach, Claude Debussy, Sergei Prokofiev, and Emma Lou Diemer, composed original piano works under the generic title of “Toccata.” The second part will explore Taiwanese pianist Yi-Chih Lu and his four piano arrangements, which draw on various traditional Taiwanese folk songs.The first part explores the history of the toccata and its development in various periods, illustrating certain intrinsic toccata features that permeate these works. It examines the role these toccatas play in the composers' respective periods of composition and the individual approaches of composers in creating highly original works, despite all sharing the same title.
The second part focuses on Yi-Chih Lu and his piano arrangements. Lu, a Taiwanese musician, was born and grew up in Taiwan. After completing high school, he went to Europe to continue his music study. Lu was majoring in piano performance when he was studying classical music in Europe, and this experience influenced a lot in his following arrangements about Taiwanese folk songs. Lu has composed numerous arrangements to date, the selected four works in this document serve as fitting examples to demonstrate Lu’s compositional journey. Both Lu and his piano arrangements are gaining more recognition and are being wildly performed. Beyond representing Taiwanese folk songs, Lu seeks to merge both types of culture in his musical compositions. It is meaningful to discover how Lu employs concepts and ideas that he learned from his Western Classical music training and applies to his treatment of his homeland’s folk tunes.
According to Florida State University’s requirement, this research document is based on two public lecture recitals presented on April 27, 2022, and November 21, 2022.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Combining the network governance model with knowledge of emergency management, this manuscript analyzes the performance of Hubei and Sichuan provincial governments in 
response to COVID-19 in early 2020. This study reveals that network governance, as seen in 
the Chinese response to COVID-19, does not closely resemble any of the three well-known 
forms of network governance in the literature. Instead, although the prevailing governance 
structure mimics some elements of the Network Administrative Organization form, it exhibits 
some uniquely Chinese characteristics. This manuscript also argues that core leaders’ 
characteristics, mass media roles, and path-dependent adherence to systems created earlier 
significantly affect the resulting network governance. This manuscript also provides 
suggestions for improving the effectiveness of network governance of emergency management 
in China’s centralized system.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Incorporating insights from implementation theory and emergency management, this manuscript examines the performance of the Henan and Shanghai provincial/municipal 
governments during their early response to COVID-19 in 2020. The study reveals that the 
Chinese approach to COVID-19 policy implementation diverges from traditional models found 
in the existing literature. While it mirrors some of these conventional models, it also showcases 
distinctive Chinese attributes. Furthermore, the paper posits that during the COVID-19 
response, Henan's strategies were predominantly steered by provincial governments, with 
grassroots organizations playing a pivotal role. In contrast, Shanghai's approach was chiefly 
guided by government departments, bolstered significantly by professional bureaucrats.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Utilizing the Multiple Streams Framework (MSF), this research delves into the determinants guiding COVID-related decisions across U.S. states from August 2020 to January 2022. It 
critically evaluates eight salient variables linked to the problem, policy, and political streams 
of MSF, focusing on the adoption patterns of mask mandate policies. The analysis reveals that 
factors such as monthly COVID case rates, political affiliation, vaccination rates, and interstate 
travel restrictions significantly influenced the strictness of mask mandates during different 
periods.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Eukaryotic cells employ a sophisticated process to generate properly assembledribosomes. This intricate process commences in the nucleolus through the transcription of a
singular 35S ribosomal RNA precursor (pre-rRNA), encompassing three distinct rRNAs (5.8S,
18S, and 25S), along with the 5’ and 3’ externally or internally transcribed spacer regions (5’-ETS,
3’-ETS, ITS1, and ITS2). Approximately 2% of rRNA nucleotides undergo 12 of the 140
recognized types of RNA modifications (Sharma and Lafontaine, 2015; Sloan et al., 2017).Among
the most prevalent modifications of rRNA are 2’-O-methylation and pseudouridylation, both
facilitated by small nucleolar ribonucleoparticles (snoRNPs). The box C/D snoRNPs play a pivotal
role in the site-specific addition of 2’-O-methyl groups at 80-100 sites in rRNA, while the box
H/ACA snoRNPs are responsible for the isomerization of a similar number of uridines. Each
snoRNP comprises a catalytic subunit, with fibrillarin serving as the methyltransferase and Cbf5
as the pseudouridine synthase in yeast, respectively1
.
There are still many unanswered questions to be explored for the function of 2’-Omethylation and pseudouridylation. The impact of rRNA modification is mainly concentrated on
the assembly of ribosome precursors (such as 90S pre-ribosome) and the protein synthesis process
of mature ribosomes. Therefore, by studying the structural and functional changes of pre-ribosome
and mature ribosome caused by loss of modification, we can understand the regulatory roles of the
RNA backbone modification. This dissertation uses structural and functional studies to shed light
on the intricate mechanisms of the regulatory roles of the RNA backbone modification.
In Chapter 1, we showed that removal of chaperones for box C/D snoRNP can potentially
alter the dynamics of 90S pre-ribosome of which the U3 box C/D snoRNP forms the core and thus
allow us the capture of transiently associated factors. Our structure model provides the first near
atomic model of the yeast Bfr2-Lcp5 complex. And I proved the model with the protein-protein
interaction results and the secondary structures of recombinant Bfr2 and Bfr2-Lcp5 complex
obtained by Circular Dichroism. Chapters 2 of this dissertation details unpresented views of
ribosomes as they function and assemble in absence of 2’-O-methylation. For the first time, I
- 8 -
extensively surveyed the growth sensitivity of cells that lack 2’-O-methylation to translation
inhibitors, revealing a dependence of inhibition on temperature.
In Chapter 3, I further compared melting temperatures of the healthy and the hypomodified
ribosomes by Circular Dichroism and showed a significant decrease in thermal stability in absence
of chemical modifications, underscoring their pivotal roles in determining ribosome stability and
possibly its sensitivity to translation inhibitors. I pioneered the study of the effects of translation
inhibitors on ribosome stability using Circular Dichroism. Finally, our lab obtained the structure
of a hypopseudouridylated ribosome bound with a aminoglycoside (hygromycin B), which
revealed a possibility mechanism for its hypersensivity.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In recent decades, many research efforts focused on global climate change, multidecadal, decadal, interannual variability, and the increasing extreme events of sea surface temperature. In contrast, the continuous evolution of the reference frame, the annual cycle of SST used to quantify the aforementioned variability and changes, has long been overlooked, resulting in difficulties in under- standing the underlying physical mechanisms responsible for these variability and changes. This study strives to bridge this gap on the changes in SST annual cycle.By devising a running correlation-based method, the seasons such as summer and winter are characterized as a period of varying SST rather than an exact timing and the phase and amplitude of non-sinusoidal annually evolving SST annual cycle is quantified. It is revealed that the varying phases of summer or winter are more closely linked to multidecadal SST variability than to long- term climate change, with the former reaching 3.0 day/decade. Moreover, the changes in amplitude are well-explained by the distinct variation of summer and winter SST. Both the systematic shift of the phase and alterations in the annual cycle shape contribute to the phase changes which explain up to 1.2 K of monthly SST anomaly with respect to climatological annual cycle on multidecadal timescale. The variation of surface wind stress is found as an important driver of phase shift of SST annual cycle.
Furthermore, it is evident that the SST annual cycle in CMIP6 historical simulations experience notable bias compared with that in ERA5 SST for both phase and summer/winter SST. The low-frequency variability is often overshadowed by substantial high-frequency part or, in some cases, underestimated in models. The oversensitivity of modeled SST to anthropogenic forcing significantly contributes to these results. A well-simulated temperature annual cycle is required for more realistic feedback mechanisms and interactions between regional climates.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Power electronic applications that demand ratings exceeding 250kW require medium voltage (MV) converters to handle the high power (HP) levels. MV HP converters are widely used in motor drive applications such as in heavy-duty electric and hybrid-electric propulsion/traction drives, as well as in other industrial applications including refiners, fans, pumps, and rolling mills. In addition to drives applications, the increased grid integration of renewable energy resources to achieve a more sustainable and cleaner energy has led to the proliferation of MV HP converters in utility applications. MV converters have played a major role in modernizing traditional transmission and distribution networks and facilitating the smart-grid transition. They can provide active control of power quality, provide shunt and series compensation, and achieve self-healing, islanding operation, fault handling, and other functionalities. To achieve low common mode voltages (CMV), low dv/dt stresses, low electromagnetic interference (EMI), and better harmonic performance, MV HP converters are often implemented with multi-level topologies. Among the several multilevel converter topologies, the modular multilevel converter (MMC) has received increasing interest due to its modularity, efficiency, and voltage and power scalability features.
However, some challenges still exist for utilizing MV converters in general, and MMCs in particular, whether in motor drives or grid applications. These challenges are mainly driven by the high power density requirements. Along with cost, reliability, and efficiency, power density has recently become among the fundamental figures of merit when characterizing a power electronic conversion system performance. Nevertheless, many barriers exist that hinder achieving high power densities in MV applications. These power density barriers include the magnetic components such as transformers, harmonic filters, and the arm inductors of MMC-based MV conversion systems. As a result, any advancement along the power density trajectory would not be possible without a substantial reduction in the volume and weight of the aforementioned magnetic components.
This research proposes the switched-capacitor modular multilevel converter (SCMMC) as a high power density converter, which can achieve inductor-less, filter-less, and transformer-less MV conversion. The dissertation is divided into six parts. In the first part, the power density challenges of MV converters are highlighted in grid and drives applications. In the second part, the switching frequency and the modulation technique choice of the multilevel inverters are presented. The importance of using the lowest frequency modulation with high number of levels to achieve the lowest harmonic distortion is demonstrated as the approach to make a filter-less and transformer-less operation possible. In the third part, the SCMMC topology is introduced as a solution towards high power density MV power conversion through its arm inductor-less topology. In the fourth part, the control of the SCMMC is presented; a low output frequency modulation technique is proposed for the SCMMC, and a startup control strategy is proposed for the SCMMC with middle submodule. In the fifth part, a 2kW, 425Vrms single phase SCMMC prototype built in our lab is showcased, and its modulation techniques are verified. In the final part, the scope of future research is presented. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Piano literature (or keyboard repertory studies) is commonly included in piano performance and some piano pedagogy degrees in the United States. This single or sequential course is required by the National Association of Schools of Music (NASM) at both undergraduate and graduate levels. While most universities include such courses in their degree requirements, it might be argued that not all instructors are well-equipped to teach piano literature courses. An oft-cited maxim in higher education is that "faculty teach the way they were taught" because they usually receive little formal training in teaching before entering the classroom. There are almost no pedagogical resources or materials that directly address issues regarding teaching piano literature courses to prepare young piano faculty and facilitate their teaching of such courses. While the fields of piano pedagogy, music theory, music history, and musicology have many up-to-date resources available for reference, there is minimal scholarly discussion of teaching piano literature courses in educational journals or at conferences.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This treatise aims to serve as a reference for both young and experienced college professors to think about how piano literature classes for 21st-century pianists can and should be taught. It compiles the wisdom and experience of established textbook authors and course instructors at prominent music institutions in the United States. Using a qualitative inquiry approach, this document will discuss essential and neglected topics surrounding teaching a piano literature course. Discussions include teaching methodologies and strategies for Generation Z and Generation Alpha in the Artificial Intelligence world, selecting course materials that include overlooked composers without compromising canonic composers, and navigating the practicality of assignments in a piano literature course. This investigation seeks to initiate discussion on these important topics and contribute to the pedagogy of piano literature in higher education.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>A wealth of research has documented the association between low self-control and child victimization. However, the conditions under which low self-control has the greatest impact on victimization have rarely been examined and, more importantly, no prior research has examined the complex ways in which neighborhood characteristics interact with self-control and other individual characteristics to impact victimization. Using data from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods, the current study tests whether the effect of low self-control is contingent upon age and poverty and whether the positive effect of low self-control on victimization is lessened in neighborhoods with high collective efficacy. Furthermore, this study goes beyond the prior literature by examining the multifaceted nature of conditional effects. By employing three-level multivariate Rasch models and cross-level three-way interactions, the research demonstrates that low self-control increases the risk of victimization, and that the effect of low self-control depends on the combined effects of neighborhood collective efficacy of children, age, and poverty. Thus, this study claims that child victimization is a product of the complicated interplay between neighborhood context—child-based collective efficacy—and children’s individual characteristics—low self-control, age, and poverty. This study advances our understanding of the specific conditions and situations where low self-control most significantly influences victimization, emphasizing the intricate nature of conditional effects. This research contributes importantly to building a developmental and life-course perspective on victimization. In addition, by forging new pathways in understanding the multifaceted influences on victimization, this research paves the way for innovative strategies in prevention and intervention, ultimately contributing to more effective and holistic approaches to addressing victimization across the lifespan.

            <DISS_para>In this dissertation, we focus on the novel dimension reduction method and its application on sensitivity analysis. First, we introduce the Monte Carlo method, one type of surrogate model, polynomial chaos expansion, the active subspace method and global sensitivity analysis. Then, to overcome the issues when there are high-oscillated or noised components in the function, we propose a global generalization of the active subspace method. We form the algorithm, do the error analysis and establish a new type of sensitivity measure based on our method. We present numerical experiments in each section to explain the framework, and support the effectiveness of our new method</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation examines the interaction of social capital, interorganizational dynamics, the role of the third sector, and institutional change in post-disaster recovery context. The dissertation is a qualitative case study in the rural town of Adjuntas, Puerto Rico post-2017 Hurricane Maria. Puerto Rico was impacted by category 4 Hurricane Maria on September 20, 2017, and left a death toll around 3,000 to 4,000 people across the island and communties without communications systems, water, gasoline, road access and electric power for months and even over a year in some isolated communities. Around 6% of residents emigrated to US in the months right after the hurricane. The rural town of Adjuntas was selected to study disaster recovery within Puerto Rico due to its rural low-income context and its history of community participation in mining opposition and sustainable projects, with the local NGO Casa Pueblo playing a significant role in its history of community grassroot movements since 1980. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation takes a three-paper approach. The first paper, in chapter two, is based on the social capital and post-disaster recovery literature. It uses the three dimensions of social capital, bonding, bridging, and linking to categorize and examine social capital dynamics. It concludes that disaster recovery is rooted in a game of relationships, with bonding social capital at the center of those relationships. In this paper, the central argument is that bonding social capital is used by communities as a gateway to other manifestations of social capital, such as bridging and linking. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The second paper, in chapter three, discusses the role of non-governmental organizations in disaster recovery. This chapter confirms the literature about the key role of NGOs in post-disaster recovery, which often become first responders. It further claims that countries and communities where governmental response capacity is weak, post-disaster response is highly dependent on the response capacity of NGOs. This chapter also uses the metaphor of “sancochos comunitarios” to illustrate the interorganizational dynamics of NGOs discovered in Adjuntas. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The third paper, in chapter four, suggests that a large-scale disaster presents an opportunity to shape institutional fields. They create the conditions to invite the integration of new players, including individuals, organizations, and networks that together have the potential to change institutional fields by creating new institutions, norms, collective consensuses and values that define the new society post-disaster recovery. This chapter integrates the concepts of sense of urgency, time compression, and institutional fields to develop an analytical framework as a tool to understand institutional change dynamics in post-disaster contexts. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Esta disertación examina la interacción del capital social, la dinámica interorganizacional, el papel del tercer sector y el cambio institucional en el contexto de recuperación posterior a un desastre. La disertación es un estudio de caso cualitativo en el pueblo rural de Adjuntas, Puerto Rico, después del huracán María de 2017. Puerto Rico fue impactado por el huracán María categoría 4 el 20 de septiembre de 2017, y dejó un saldo de muertes entre 3,000 y 4,000 personas en toda la isla. Dejo comunidades sin sistemas de comunicaciones, agua, gasolina, acceso a carreteras y energía eléctrica durante meses e incluso más de un año en algunas comunidades aisladas. Alrededor del 6% de los residentes emigraron a Estados Unidos en los meses inmediatamente posteriores al huracán. El pueblo rural de Adjuntas fue seleccionado para estudiar la recuperación de desastres dentro de Puerto Rico debido a su contexto rural, de bajos ingresos y su historia de participación comunitaria en la oposición minera y proyectos sustentables, con la ONG local Casa Pueblo jugando un papel importante en su historia de movimientos de base comunitaria desde 1980.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Esta tesis adopta un enfoque de tres artículos. El primer artículo, en el capítulo dos, se basa en la literatura sobre capital social y recuperación post-desastre. Utiliza las tres dimensiones del capital social, “bonding, bridging and linking” para categorizar y examinar la dinámica del capital social. Concluye que la recuperación ante desastres tiene sus raíces en un juego de relaciones, con el capital social de “bonding” en el centro de esas relaciones. En este artículo, el argumento central es que las comunidades utilizan el capital social de “bonding” como puerta de entrada a otras manifestaciones del capital social, como lo son “bridging” y “linking”.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>El segundo documento, en el capítulo tres, analiza el papel de las organizaciones no gubernamentales en la recuperación de desastres. Este capítulo confirma la literatura sobre el papel clave de las ONG en la recuperación post-desastre, que a menudo se convierten en primeros respondedores. Afirma además que en los países y comunidades donde la capacidad de respuesta gubernamental es débil, la respuesta post-desastre depende en gran medida de la capacidad de respuesta de las ONG. Este capítulo también utiliza la metáfora de los “sancochos comunitarios” para ilustrar la dinámica interorganizacional de las ONG descubiertas en Adjuntas.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>El tercer artículo, en el capítulo cuatro, sugiere que un desastre a gran escala presenta una oportunidad para dar forma a los campos institucionales. Crean las condiciones para invitar a la integración de nuevos actores, incluidos individuos, organizaciones y redes que juntos tienen el potencial de cambiar los campos institucionales mediante la creación de nuevas instituciones, normas, consensos colectivos y valores que definen la nueva sociedad después de un desastre. Este capítulo integra los conceptos de sentido de urgencia, tiempo comprimido y campos institucionales para desarrollar un marco analítico como herramienta para comprender la dinámica del cambio institucional en contextos posteriores a un desastre. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Quasi-Newton methods have gained popularity across various domains, providing efficient iterative algorithms for finding optimal solutions to unconstrained optimization problems. Their limited- memory variants offer advantages in terms of reduced storage and computational requirements. This dissertation generalizes full Broyden family of limited-memory quasi-Newton optimization methods on Riemannian manifold (LRBroyden). The work encompasses the comprehensive anal- ysis, implementation, application and evaluation of LRBroyden. An essential extension to this research involves the adaptation of these algorithms to stochastic methods tailored for large-scale optimization. This results in the generalization of the stochastic variant of the Riemannian full Broyden family of limited-memory quasi-Newton methods, incorporating with variance reduction (LR-SBroyden-VR). The dissertation provides empirical insights into parameter selection and offers a thorough evaluation of the performance of various methods.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Ribosomes are giant RNA-protein complexes responsible for translating the information encoded by the genome to create the proteome in all kingdoms of life. In budding yeast, the mature cytoplasmic 80S ribosome consists of 79 ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) and 4 ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), which form the 40S small subunit (SSU) and the 60S large subunit (LSU). One of the most important chemical features of ribosomes is post-transcriptional modification of the rRNAs, most of which are comprised of pseudouridylation and 2’-hydroxyl methylation. Previous biochemical and genetic studies have shown that rRNA modifications: (1) facilitate ribosome biogenesis; (2) stabilize the structure of ribosomes; (3) ensure the efficiency and fidelity of the translation activity of ribosomes; (4) impact antibiotic sensitivity. Notably, the identification of partial modification sites on rRNA has added a new layer of ribosome heterogeneity, indicating its role in regulating gene expression. Despite the demonstrated importance of rRNA modifications, the molecular basis of how rRNA modification affects ribosome biogenesis and ribosome function remain elusive, owing to the lack of structural information. In this thesis, I investigate the structural impact of rRNA modification on ribosome biogenesis and function. I solved a series of atomic resolution cryo-EM structures of mature ribosome and precursor ribosome isolated from yeast mutant strains defective in rRNA modification activity. By comparing them with previously reported wild-type structures with fully modified rRNAs, I identified a surprising number of local and global structural changes. Removal of pseudouridine (Ψ) results in loss of Ψ-associated water molecules and Y-associated base pairing; altered structural arrangement of the decoding center; abnormal inter- and intra-subunit movement. Removal of 2’-hydroxyl methylation (Nm) results in gain of Nm-associated water molecules; altered sugar pucker preference; disrupted structural arrangement of the exit tunnel; impaired maturation of peptidyl transfer center; erroneous domain motions. These structural abnormality upon loss of Ψ or Nm, provide molecular explanation for the observed functional defect, paving the road towards understanding the role of rRNA modification played in maintaining the accuracy and efficiency of ribosome production and function.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Renewable energy source has been integrated into our distribution system with a rapid pace. At the same time, the increasing amount of renewable energy source lead to instability and low power quality issues to the distribution systems, especially for underground cable based distribution systems. The major cause of these issues are the resonant phenomenon, which can lead to unwanted oscillations of voltage or current and then cause control or hardware failure of the distribution system. So, measures must be taken to suppress, transform, or eliminate these unwanted factors. This dissertation addresses the issues and analyzes the causes of the underground cable based distribution systems with renewable energy source. The state-of-the-art techniques to solve such issues are introduced. To perform the theoretical analysis, the mathematical and simulation models are built for inverter-based renewable resources, distribution grid interface, and underground cable based distribution lines. After that, the proposed strategy is comprehensively introduced. The research shows that the traditional interface inverter control method limits the possibility of utilizing the characteristics of inverters. In order to introduce the new method, a novel PLL-less and voltage sensorless inner loop control method of the interfacing inverter of the renewable energy source and the distribution network is presented. Then, the virtual resistance control method is carried out to showcase how the aforementioned issues can be solved. The first chapter will give an introduction of the background of the research, and lead out the emerging problems we are facing. The second chapter will give a description of the base methodology to be used in the research. The third chapter will introduce the control method which will be used for the solution. Chapter four will discuss the virtual resistor based method in detail. And finally, chapter five will conclude the dissertation and provide future works.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation includes four research projects. The first two projects mainly focus on the depth method on temporal point process data. The third project is the depth method on spatial point process. This is an extension of the first two projects. The fourth one is about memory and future movement decoding on spike train of small rats, which is collaborated with Dr. Aaron Wilber's lab in Psychology Department. I will provide summaries of each project below. The details can be found in the main chapters. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Project 1: Statistical Depth for Point Process via the Isometric Log-Ratio Transformation. Statistical depth, a useful tool to measure the center-outward rank of multivariate and functional data, is still under-explored in temporal point processes.  Recent studies on point process depth proposed a weighted product of two terms - one indicates the depth of the cardinality of the process, and the other characterizes the conditional depth of the temporal events given the cardinality.  The second term is of great challenge because of the apparent nonlinear structure of event times, and so far only parametric representations such as Gaussian and Dirichlet densities have been adopted in the definitions. However, these parametric forms ignore the underlying distribution of the process events and are difficult to apply to complicated patterns.  To deal with these problems, a novel distribution-based approach is proposed to the conditional depth via the well-known Isometric Log-Ratio (ILR) transformation on the inter-event times.  Motivated by a uniform distribution on simplex, the new method, called the ILR depth, is formally defined for general point process via a Time Rescaling. The mathematical properties of the ILR depth are thoroughly examined and the new method is well illustrated by using Poisson and non-Poisson processes to demonstrate its superiority over previous methods.  Finally, the ILR depth is applied in a real dataset and the result clearly shows its effectiveness in ranking.   </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Project 2: Depth-Based Statistical Inferences in the Spike Train Space. Metric-based summary statistics such as mean and covariance have been introduced in neural spike train space. They can properly describe template and variability in spike train data, but are often sensitive to outliers and expensive to compute. Recent studies also examine outlier detection and classification methods on point processes. These tools provide reasonable result, whereas the accuracy remains at a low level in certain cases. In this study, we propose to adopt a well-established notion of statistical depth to the spike train space.  This framework can naturally define the median in a set of spike trains, which provides a robust description of the "template" of the observations. It also provides a principled method to identify "outliers" and classify data from different categories. We systematically compare the new median, outlier detection and classification tools with state-of-the-art competing methods. The result shows the median has superior description for template than the mean. Moreover, the proposed outlier detection and classification perform more accurately than previous methods. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Project 3: Statistical Depth in Spatial Point Process. Statistical depth is widely used as a powerful tool to measure the center-outward rank of multivariate and functional data.  Recent studies have introduced the notion of depth to the temporal point process, which exhibits randomness in the cardinality as well as distribution in the observed events.  The proposed methods can well capture the rank of a point process in a given time interval, where a critical step is to measure the rank by using inter-arrival events. We propose to extend the depth concept to multivariate spatial point process. In this case, the observed process is in a multi-dimensional location and there are no conventional inter-arrival events in the temporal process. We adopt the newly-developed depth in metric space by defining two different metrics, namely the penalized metric and smoothing metric, to fully explore the depth in spatial point process.  The mathematical properties and large sample theory, as well as depth-based hypothesis testings, are thoroughly discussed.  We then use several simulations to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed depth method.  Finally, we apply the new method in a real world dataset and obtain desirable ranking performance.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Project 4: Memory and Future Movement Decoding on Spike Train Information. Movement through space and establishing memories based on such experiences is essential for survival of animals including humans. This ability is thought to require storage of memories often in an allocentric (map-like) framework and conversion to a body-centered reference frame comprised of specific locomotor actions (e.g., turn right). These frameworks must be coordinated in a fluid manner during navigation. The encoding observed in hippocampus (HPC) and parietal cortex (PC) has led to the notion that this circuit operates as a part of a coordinate transformation network; for example, transforming a remembered allocentric representation into the appropriate action. While HPC neurons are typically modulated by allocentric locations, PC neurons are modulated by multiple reference frames including actions (e.g., right turn). This hypothesis was tested using a complex spatial sequence task where rats learn to navigate to unmarked locations fixed in space in a specific sequence. Landmarks are distributed around the room for spatial orientation. We use a sequence (1-2-3-4-1-2-3-5-) that has a repeating path segment (1-2-3) followed by one of two distinct actions. Specifically, the rat learns in context 1-2-3-4, to go to 4 for reward, while in context 1-2-3-5 the rat must go to 5. Thus, navigation to zone 4 or 5 requires a map-to-action transformation. This emulates the spatial memory problem one encounters when driving through an intersection and remembering the appropriate action given the current route and goals (e.g., turn left to a bank versus right to home). Sets of "cued" runs in which a light at each goal leads the rat through the sequence are interleaved with unguided (memory) runs through the complete 1-2-3-4-1-2-3-5 sequence . During memory runs, following an error, a light cue directs the rat to the next zone in the sequence. Thus, during memory runs, the rat must coordinate between remembered allocentric context and egocentric action. We found that decoded PC ensembles (and some single cells; but not simultaneously recorded HPC ensembles) predict upcoming actions following the repeating path segment (3-4 &amp; 3-5) during "memory" but not "cued" trials. Additionally, we hypothesize that accurate action selection by PC will require HPC encoding of memory for the allocentric context. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that a failure in allocentric context decoding (forgetting if came from 5 vs 4 while navigating 1-2) by HPC ensembles (but not by PC ensembles) also predict behavioral errors. Thus, we provide evidence that the HPC-PC circuit is a coordinate transformation network for interfacing between map like and person centered reference frames.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>American composer Kevin Day (b.1996) experienced a quick rise to notoriety in the wind band community, largely fueled by the success of his Concerto for Euphonium and Wind Ensemble (2018). The work’s first movement, premiered by Demondrae Thurman, Associate Dean and Professor of Euphonium and Chamber Music at Indiana University and the Texas Christian University Wind Ensemble, saw an outpouring of interactions and views through the spread of a social media post by Thurman. This premiere quickly led to a series of concerto commissions by Kevin Day, elevating his reputation and expanding his body of work. At this moment in time, Concerto for Euphonium and Wind Ensemble is one of four works written for euphonium by Black composers. The work’s quality solidifies it as a piece that should be studied by high level euphoniumists.	This performance guide incorporates analysis of form, motivic elements, and musical narrative concepts as delineated by Byron Almén. Furthermore, it draws from techniques informed through the author’s preparation and performance experience, as well as insights gleaned from interviews with Kevin Day, Demondrae Thurman, and SSG Hiram Diaz of The President’s Own United States Marine Band.  In addition to the utilization of method books by Jean-Baptiste Arban, David Vining, and Johannes Rochut, Kevin Day’s 25 Advanced Studies for Euphonium are highlighted as modern works written for euphonium that will serve as an aid to preparing the concerto. Finally, the guide includes exercises composed by the author that isolate passages from the music and simplify them, facilitating a thorough understanding of the intervallic relationships and techniques required to execute the Concerto at a high level.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Coastal areas are very dynamic places, and a lot of that is due to the movement of waves and currents, which are responsible for disturbances on the seabed by causing shear-stress. Bed shear-stress can cause sediment motion and transport, which is very important in coastal areas because of beach morphology changes, viability of coastal constructions, among others. However, sediment transport depends on very complex and interactive processes, some of which are still not very well understood or sometimes poorly calculated. Waves and currents are the main drivers of sediment movement in coastal areas. This study analyzed the wave contribution to the bed shear-stress near the coast of the Florida Panhandle. Florida is one of the most vulnerable states to hurricanes in the US, but the Peninsular Florida acts as a shield for the Gulf side from westerly hurricanes, and the wide West Florida Shelf protects this region from the Gulf waters. Dog Island Reef is located near the coast of the Florida Panhandle, on a low gradient and low energy continental margin. The region is composed mostly of sandy beaches, barrier islands, and low energy waves arrive at the shoreline. Four stations were chosen near Dog Island Reef to have sediments collected and analyzed for size distribution. The sediment sampling stations were strategically located in between two other sites where wave data were collected for four years (2008 – 2011). The wave data was acquired using moored ADCPs and narrowed down to the period of peak hurricane season (August 1st to October 31st). Relevant statistical wave parameters such as significant and maximum wave heights (HS and HMax), and wave directions (WDir) are presented for both sites during each storm period. The four sediment samples were classified into the textural group “slightly gravely sand”, presenting a low percentage (~ 5%) of fine gravel or bigger; station 2 showed a high (72%) percentage of small sizes (fine sand or smaller) when compared to the other 3 stations (25%). Six tropical cyclones that passed through the Northeastern Gulf of Mexico in that period were selected for the analysis. All storms caused similar wave heights at site A (HS ~ 1.1 m, HMax ~ 1.7 m) with highest waves coming from south-southwest quadrants, and the highest wave caused by Tropical Storm Fay. Site B had more variability in wave height (HS 1.5 ~ 2.8 m, HMax 2.7 ~ 4.5 m) and spread directions. Tropical Storm Lee created southerly winds with the longest fetch, generating the highest waves in the record. All recorded wind directions followed an organized and delineated clockwise (counterclockwise for Fay) change of directions during storms closest approach to mooring sites, while wave directions followed that same pattern with a -15° offset approximately. The critical shear stress for initiation of movement was calculated for both sites considering median grain size d50 = 292.9 µm, and was 0.2 Nm-2. The mean calculated wave-induced stress was approximately 0.04 Nm-2 at both sites, and maximum of 0.52 / 1.11 Nm-2 for sites A/B respectively. Tropical Storm Lee caused the highest stresses for the longest time at both sites. During the four-year period analyzed, stress was above critical threshold of movement for less than 10% of the year, and storms were usually responsible for about 50% of that contribution. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Hiring private tutors is causing a financial burden on parents, as they are made to pay high tutoring fees in Nigeria. Yet, Nigerian parents continue to invest heavily in financially burdensome private tutoring amid high poverty levels. This evident paradox between high poverty levels and the widespread use of financially burdensome private educational support in Nigeria has received little attention. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This gap motivated me to use in-depth qualitative interviews to explore why parents often pay high tutoring fees to support their children’s education, despite the financial burden it creates, and how parents perceive the academic impacts of private tutors. In light of this contradiction, this study also uses a cross-sectional survey to examine whether there is a relationship between children having a private tutor to assist with homework and their reading and numeracy outcomes. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A total of 18,737 primary-school-age children in a nationally representative household survey data set was used as the analytic sample for the quantitative arm of this mixed-methods study. A total of 15 parents who hire private tutors to assist their primary school-age children in doing their homework were selected for the qualitative phase of this study. Thematic analysis and binary logistic regression were used to analyze the qualitative interview data and quantitative survey data, respectively. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study found that hiring the service of private tutors created a financial burden on parents. This study asked why parents continued to invest in private tutoring. This study found that the major reason parents hired private tutors to guide their children in doing their homework was to ensure they grew academically. Since the major reason why parents invested in private tutoring for their children was to ensure they would grow academically, this study asked the parents about the perceived impacts of private tutors assisting their children in doing their homework on their children’s academic outcomes. Nigerian parents perceived that private tutoring improved their children’s reading and numeracy outcomes as well as the outcomes of their children in other academic subjects. However, the parents’ perceptions might be subjective, and the private tutors who were the classroom teachers of the children they tutor in this study might have engaged in unethical activities that led to improvement in the children’s reading and numeracy outcomes.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This plausible subjectivity of parents’ and teachers’ unethical activities made this study take a step further to use a cross-sectional, descriptive design to investigate the relationship between children having a private tutor to assist with homework and their reading and numeracy outcomes. In contrast to parents’ stated beliefs, the findings of this study’s quantitative phase revealed no statistically significant relationship between children having a private tutor to assist with homework and their reading performance. In addition, this study found that children having parents, other family members, and neighbors assisting them with their homework was significantly related to reading outcomes.  However, in line with parents’ stated views, a statistically significant positive relationship existed between having a private tutor to guide children with homework and their numeracy outcomes. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Based on these findings, this study recommends that policies be developed to ensure high-quality private tutoring is accessible to all children to improve their numeracy outcomes. Also, educated families and neighbors should be encouraged to guide their children in their homework to improve their reading outcomes. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>With advancements of technology over the past few years, digital imaging data has grown significantly.Such data is analyzed here using statistical shape analysis. It is important to develop theoretical methods to
perform the analysis in a nonparametric way. Here, one develops nonparametric procedures for comparing
two extrinsic antimeans on compact manifolds, using recent limit theorems for extrinsic sample antimeans
w.r.t. an arbitrary embedding of a compact manifold into a Euclidean space. One derives a large sample chi
square test for the equality of two extrinsic antimeans. Applications are given to distributions on Kendall
planar shape spaces, in their complex projective space representations, that are Veronese-Whitney embedded
in numerical spaces of self-adjoint matrices. Two medical imaging examples are given.
The study of finite configurations of points modulo projective transformations is called projective shape
analysis, and it is the topic of this paper, which has a various applications in machine vision. We also
present a suitable coordinate system for this projective shape space, together with an appropriate projective
shape space. The projective form space that results for general arrangements of k points in m dimensions is
known to be a combination of k-m-2 copies of the axial space Rm. Finally, one also hints at two sample tests
for means on the projective shape space of k-ads in general position in P(Rm+1) associated with R^{m+1}.
Applications to 3D bioshape analysis for data extracted from digital camera images are introduced. For
small samples test are based on Efron’s nonparametric bootstrap.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In many Monte Carlo applications, one can substitute the use of pseudorandom numbers with quasirandom numbers and achieve improved convergence. This is because quasirandom numbers are more uniform than pseudorandom numbers. The most common measure of that uniformity is the star discrepancy. In addition, the main error bound in quasi-Monte Carlo methods, called the Koksma–Hlawka inequality, has a star discrepancy in its formulation. A difficulty with this bound is that computing the star discrepancy is known to be an NP-hard problem, so we have been looking for effective approximate algorithms. The star discrepancy can be thought of as the maximum of a function called the local discrepancy, and we will develop approximate algorithms to maximize this function.In this dissertation, we introduce new algorithms for estimating the lower bounds for the star discrepancy. The random walk algorithm is based on the Monte Carlo method for computing the star discrepancy using random walks through some of the points in the unit cube [0, 1]^s. The second algorithm is analogous to the random walk algorithm; instead of directly accepting the randomly chosen dimension, we apply the Metropolis algorithm to the chosen dimension to accept or reject this movement. We call it the Metropolis random walk algorithm. The implementation of this algorithm is based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo method.
This approximation is much less expensive than computing the exact value of the star discrepancy. The random walk algorithm and Metropolis random walk algorithm can find the exact value of the star discrepancy or estimate the lower bound of the star discrepancy in a reasonable time. The findings of our experiment indicate that the estimation of the star discrepancy is obtained without a substantial computational cost. Also, in comparison to all previously known techniques, the Metropolis random walk algorithm is superior, especially in high dimensions.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Urban traffic congestion has become an increasingly critical issue as the number of vehicle owners continues to rise each year, resulting in increased travel times, fuel consumption, and environmental pollution. Traditional adaptive traffic signal control systems struggle to accommodate this rapid growth in traffic demand, highlighting the need for innovative and efficient solutions to manage traffic in urban environments. Connected vehicle (CV) technology, which enables vehicles to communicate with each other and infrastructure, has emerged as a promising solution to address these challenges. The integration of CV data can significantly enhance traffic management systems, allowing for more effective traffic signal optimization, improved traffic flow, and increased safety.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation focuses on the development and evaluation of a novel algorithm for optimizing adaptive traffic signals under platooned CVs. The goal is to harness the potential of CV technology and vehicle platooning to improve traffic efficiency, safety, and environmental sustainability in urban settings. By leveraging the unique characteristics of CVs, mixed traffic scenarios, and the dynamic nature of urban traffic, the proposed algorithm aims to address the limitations of existing traffic signal control systems and provide a more efficient and adaptable solution.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The study begins with a comprehensive literature review to identify the current state of the art in adaptive traffic signal control systems, CV technologies, platooning, and their integration in traffic management. The review serves as a foundation for understanding the research gaps and opportunities in this field, setting the stage for the development of the proposed algorithm.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The main contribution of this dissertation is the development of a robust, efficient, and adaptable algorithm for optimizing adaptive traffic signals under platooned CVs. A simulation-based framework was designed and implemented to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, considering various performance indicators such as travel times, delays, queue lengths, vehicle stops, fuel consumption, and emissions. The safety implications of the algorithm were also investigated, providing valuable insights into its safety performance.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The performance of the proposed algorithm was compared with existing traffic signal control strategies, including both traditional and connected vehicle-based approaches. The algorithm demonstrated superior performance in terms of various traffic parameters and improved traffic safety compared to existing strategies. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the algorithm's adaptability and robustness under different traffic conditions, CV penetration levels, and platoon formation scenarios.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The findings of this dissertation have important theoretical and practical implications for the fields of adaptive traffic signal control and CV technology. The study contributes to existing theories, models, and frameworks in the field, while also providing recommendations for traffic engineers, policymakers, and other stakeholders on how to leverage the research to improve traffic management, alleviate congestion, reduce emissions, and enhance safety. Limitations and future research directions are also discussed, offering potential avenues for further investigation and development in the area of adaptive traffic signal control and CV technology. This research lays the groundwork for the next generation of traffic management systems that can effectively accommodate the increasing traffic demand and capitalize on the benefits of connected vehicles and platooning.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The country of Serbia, located in Central/Southeastern Europe, offers a rich trumpet tradition worth examining due to the depth and diversity of art and knowledge tied to its unique socio-political history and cultural traditions. Isolated from Western musical trends during the Ottoman Empire’s rule over the region from the 15th through the 19th centuries, the contemporary music of Serbia offers a synthesis of Eastern and Western sound concepts, incorporating musical trends and style elements of folk tunes and Orthodox chants as well as elements of atonality, electronic music, classicism, romanticism, and jazz.	This treatise provides an overview of Serbia’s classical trumpet tradition by cataloging its history, repertoire, and pedagogical concepts. By compiling as much available information into one document, this treatise fills a gap in scholarship about the depth and diversity of the music and pedagogy of Serbian classical trumpet, and functions as a springboard for those interested in further study on this topic.

The linear stability problem for perturbed  solitons is formulated for the nonlocal reverse time and parity-time symmetric nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equations. Through a combination of numerical and analytical approaches, it is determined that the stability profiles for the one soliton solutions are identical to that of the classical NLS equation. Direct numerical simulations agree with the stability analysis and reveal filamentation and collapse of perturbed solutions. Collapse is explored. A generalized variance quantity is introduced in an attempt to describe the blow-up of localized functions. Simulations reveal that this quantity going to zero in finite time does not, in general, indicate collapse in finite time.In this thesis, we also study modulational instability using a neural network approach. This is done by using the Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) applied to the stability problem. In particular, we postulate a loss functional whose minimization leads to system parameter identifications. The input is a randomly perturbed plane wave and the output is a binary number i.e. 0 or 1 with 0 representing a stable state whereas 1 indicates a modulationally unstable plane wave. The advantage of this approach is that it is fast, accurate, and effective (computationally feasible).

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The nervous system of a human being is formed gradually during embryonic development. On a microscopic level, neuronal development involves (1) differentiation, polarization and migration of nerve and glial cells, (2) the growth and guidance of axons, and (3) formation and elimination of synapses. This thesis focuses on two aspects of the development: neuronal polarization and axonal growth.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Neuronal polarization, a process wherein nascent neurons develop a single long axon and multiple short dendrites, can occur within in vitro cell cultures without environmental cues. This is an apparently random process in which one of several short processes, called neurites, grows to become long, while the others remain short. In this thesis, we propose a minimum model for neurite growth, which involves bistability and random excitations reflecting actin waves. Positive feedback is needed to produce the bistability, while negative feedback is required to ensure that no more than one neurite wins the winner-takes-all contest. By applying the negative feedback to different aspects of the neurite growth process, we demonstrate that targeting the negative feedback to the excitation amplitude results in the most persistent polarization. Also, we demonstrate that there are optimal ranges of values for the neurite count, and for the excitation rate and amplitude that best maintain the polarization. Finally, we show that a previously published model for neuronal polarization based on competition for limited resources shares key features with our best-performing minimal model: bistability and negative feedback targeted to the size of random excitations.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Following polarization, an axon grows under the intrinsic control of the neuron. We develop a closed-loop multi-scale model for axon length regulation based on a frequency-dependent negative feedback mechanism. It builds on earlier models by linking molecular motor dynamics to signaling delays that then determine signal oscillation period. The signal oscillation is treated as a front end for a signaling pathway that modulates axonal length. This model is used to demonstrate the feasibility of such a mechanism and is tested against two previously published reports in which experimental manipulations were performed that resulted in axon growth. The model captures these observations and yields an expression for equilibrium axonal length. One major prediction of the model is that increasing motor density in the body of an axon results in axonal growth.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Several future research directions follow naturally from our work. These include: (1) mean first passage time problems of a bistable system under Poissonian noise, (2) axonal and dendritic branching variability, and (3) bistability in the treatment of Alzheimer Disease by antibodies. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para> The GlueX experiment is located in Newport News, Virginia and aims to search for exotic quantum states that are not predicted by the quark model. These states include multi-quark configurations and configurations with excited gluons. This dissertation describes an investigation of the photoproduction of \(\eta \eta^\prime \) which is expected to decay from an isoscalar partner to the \(\pi_{1}(1600)\) with exotic quantum numbers \(J^{PC} = 1^{-+}\). A detailed data selection study is presented to achieve an exclusive reaction \(\gamma p \rightarrow \eta^{\prime}\eta p\). A differential cross section in four bins of \(M(\eta^{\prime} \eta)\) is calculated. The cross section was calculated for a beam energy greater than 7.5 GeV. The mass bin from 1.7 to 2.1 GeV\(/c^{2}\) is the region where BESIII observed a candidate for the exotic \(\eta_{1}\). However, no significant features were observed in the cross section in this region to corroborate their observation. Nonetheless, there are some similarities such as the sharp rise near threshold and a peaking structure near 2 GeV\(/c^{2}\). Systematic uncertainties are included in the calculation of the cross section using the Barlow test to consider the significance of certain data selections.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The GlueX experiment has produced the world's largest statistics for peripheral photoproduction of mesons with a goal to search for exotic mesons. This document presents results on the search for possible intermediate resonances which decay to $\omega \eta$. Little is known for the states seen in this decay channel such as the $\omega(1420)$ and $\omega(1650)$. This channel also allows to search for the never seen exotics $J^{PC}=0^{--}$, $2^{+-}$, and the elusive $2^{--}$. The $\omega$, in this reaction, is identified via the $\pi^{+} \pi^{-} \pi^{0}$ decay mode and the $\eta$ and $\pi^{0}$ are identified via the decay to 2$\gamma$. Data from the GlueX Phase I was analyzed. This data was obtained at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility utilizing the GlueX detector and a tagged linearly polarized photon beam incident on a liquid hydrogen target. A model using the expected major wave contributors, $1^{+-}$ and $1^{--}$, shows two structure in the region where the $\omega(1420)$ and $\omega(1650)$ are expected. A third structure is seen at threshold with the quantum numbers of an $h_1$ resonance, however, more studies are needed to assert the nature of this structure. Instabilities on the $m=\pm 1$ were shown to come from mathematical ambiguities. This only occurs between the $m=1$ and $m=-1$ projections when both reflectivities are present in close amount. Expanding the intensity equation for a single wave allows to extract coefficients that can help describe the data. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A tangent study is also presented in this document which consists on a direct fit to the line-shape of an isolated N(1535). This baryonic resonance is well established but its Breit-Wigner parameters have only been obtained from partial wave analysis. In contrast, this study obtained the Breit-Wigner parameters using a direct fit and finds the value of the width to be 70.5$\pm$ 9.2 MeV; this is half of the accepted value.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The actinide elements are playing larger roles in modern life, finding uses in nuclear energy, remote power sources, medical uses as radiotherapy isotopes, as well as in geological applications in nuclear tools. However, due to their scarcity and radioactivity, their chemistry is not well understood and often present unexpected behavior due to their position in the periodic table where spin–orbit coupling and relativistic effects are increasingly greater. Exploring their chemistry will provide us with a better fundamental understanding of superheavy elements which also has the practical aspect of aiding us in solving problems such as lanthanide/actinide separation and actinide/actinide separation in the processing and recycling of used nuclear fuel. These separation processes rely on making advantage of differentiation of the lanthanide and actinide series, which often behave very similar to one another. Differentiation between the two series can be increased by complexation with soft–donor ligands which increase orbital overlap and covalent bonding with actinide complexes in comparison to lanthanide complexes, leading to shorter bond distances and structural differences. Differences in lanthanide and actinide bonding can also be further examined by deliberately modulating the metal–ligand bonds by applying external pressure through diamond anvil cell (DAC) techniques. By shortening the bond distances, orbital overlap can be increased to varying degrees depending on the particular element or complexing ligand.First, chapter 1 provides the necessary context and background to the research conducted in this dissertation and chapter 2 covers some of the common characterization and experimental techniques used.
Chapter 3 sets the basis for the dissertation by finishing the trans–uranic actinide series neptunium to californium of mellitate complexes by characterizing two neptunium mellitate polymers and allows for a broad comparison of the bonding differences between the actinide and lanthanide series for the series of mellitate compounds. This study shows the two series behave nearly identically in their bonding and structure.
Chapters 4–7 then examine complexes of neptunium, plutonium, americium, curium, and californium with the 1,2–dithiolate ligand maleonitrile dithiolate (mnt), which is a soft sulfur–donor ligand, contrasting with the hard oxygen–donor mellitate ligand from chapter 3. Spectroscopic, crystallographic, and high–pressure characterizations reveal increases in f–orbital participation in the actinide complexes in comparison to the lanthanide complexes, resulting in bond lengths substantially shorter than expected for their ionic radii as well as f–f transitions greatly stabilized in energy which shift by large amounts under applied pressure. Chapter 8 then broadly compares the lanthanide and actinide complexes. In the actinide series, differentiation between the early part of the series Np–Pu versus the later part Am–Cf is observed, highlighting the unique bonding induced by the mnt ligands.
Chapter 9 begins the second half of the dissertation more focused on high–pressure studies by describing a pressure–induced oxidation in two different samarium(II) complexes with a crown ether and a cryptand ligand. In both complexes, samarium is observed spectroscopically to oxidize from the +2–oxidation state to the +3–oxidation state.
In chapter 10 a cerium mellitate coordination polymer is structurally characterized under pressure using high–pressure X–ray crystallography techniques. This study reveals a cooridination number transition from 9 to 9.5 due to the bonding of a lattice water molecule that is interestingly not visible in ambient pressure crystal structures. In addition, the bond length decreases due to pressure for water and carboxylate oxygens are quantified and agree well with computationally determined bond length decreaes. 
Lastly, in chapter 11, the changes in the absorption and photoluminescence spectra for various complexes of americium, curium, berkelium, and californium are all examined and compared. This study further supports the dependance on the ligand and the metal on the participation of f–electrons in bonding, that soft donor ligands and lighter actinides result in a greater degree of f–orbital involvement. It also reveals the importance of redox chemistry in pressure effects of the spectra as in the case of berkelium, which having an accessible +4–oxidation state, exhibits much smaller shifts and even blue–shifting of transitions as opposed to more commonly observed red–shifting. 
This work provides the first examples of of trans–uranic actinide(III) with a 1,2–dithiolate ligand which exhibits a particularly high degree of lanthanide/actinide differentiation, as well as furthering our understanding of the effects of pressure on changes in bonding and structure in lanthanide and actinide complexes using high–pressure crystallographic techniques.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This thesis revisited a previous topic on how the downstream and/or large-scale midlatitude response to a recurving TC potentially depends on the strength and/or location of the TC.  This study differs from what Brannan and Chagnon (2020) in that this analysis examines ensemble forecasts for individual cases, thus controlling for the high variance in large-scale circulations that occur between different cases.  The two cases focused on in this study are Tropical Cyclone (TC) Sandy (2012) and Tropical Cyclone (TC) Irene (2011).  The question answered in the completion of this project is: How does the location and strength of a TC affect the forecast downstream?It was found that the nature of the interaction/relationship between the strength and location of a TC and how it affects downstream wave behavior is highly case sensitive.  A large, statistically significant modification of the large-scale wave pattern was found for TC Sandy. The sensitivity of the wave pattern to TC characteristics was contingent on the storm propagating far enough north to affect the jet. The interaction in TC Sandy may have been advantaged due to its occurrence during the fall months (strong jet stream that is located not as far north). Specifically, the latitudinal location and MSLP anomaly magnitude (strength) of TC Sandy greatly affected the waves observed downstream.  On the other hand, TC Irene showed less of a relationship between the strength/location and the downstream wave behavior.  This was thought to be due to a lack of a strong jet stream that was located too far north to be affected by TC Irene.  Nevertheless, TC Irene did exhibit an impact on the downstream wave behavior and the location and strength of the storm.  
The main takeaways of this project are that 1) downstream midlatitude effects from a TC are contingent on the location and strength of the TC, and 2) the strength of the interaction is case dependent.  Meaning there might be more similarities between TC Irene and TC Sandy if they were occurring in the same season, instead of the latter being in the fall and former being in the summer.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The electrical power industry faces a never-ending and increasing demand for innovative designs and ideas to provide electrical power with reduced size, a clean environment, and resiliency. Electric transport systems are some of the latest innovative techniques being researched and developed. The high power demands of the power systems of transport platforms need high power density, energy efficiency, and resiliency. High-temperature superconducting (HTS) power cables are a viable solution to meet the ambitious goals. HTS power cables offer a current density ten times greater than conventional ones. HTS power cables can accomplish high power transmission with lower voltage values than traditional counterparts. The high current density reduces the size and weight of the power cables and other electrical components within the power system. HTS devices require a cryogenic environment to regulate the temperature. An electrical insulation system suitable for the appropriate voltage and cryogenic operating temperature is also needed. Therefore, it is essential to understand the dielectric properties of electrical insulation in a realistic cryogenic environment. 
The research performed for this thesis focused on the dielectric properties of cryogenic epoxies as electric insulation material for HTS power cables for electrical transport systems such as electric ships and aircraft. This thesis focused on three areas: a study to understand the various materials used for electrical insulation for power cables, characterization of the dielectric properties of common epoxies suitable for cryogenic temperatures, assessment of their ability to serve as electrical insulation for HTS cables, and a test cable fabricated implementing the epoxies as electrical insulation with liquid nitrogen (LN2), gaseous helium (GHe), and GHe gas mixtures.

            <DISS_para>Object retrieval is used in many popular photo applications. For example, the iPhone photos application has a search bar where objects can be queried to find photos of the given object. The goal of this thesis is to test a novel framework for object retrieval that trains on the running averages of the features of a given object, in our case we looked at backpacks and used models to retrieve those objects. A transfer learning method by using the top layers of CLIP by Open-AI as well as the top layers of SWSL by Meta to extract features of our images then applied different models such as Online Feature Selection with Annealing and Online Least Squares. We tested them on both a small dataset created through scraping images with the Selenium python package as well as the Imagenet1000 validation set from the 2012 challenge. What we found is a method that trains fairly quickly with very high recall but low precision which is hypothesized to be because of the large dataset having objects that are unknown but are similar in features to the queried object. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In today's digital landscape, the widespread availability and simplicity of image manipulation software has contributed to a significant increase in the dissemination of manipulated images. Combined with the rapid spread of controversial content on social media platforms, there exists a critical need to protect individuals and institutions from malicious disinformation campaigns and unjust cancel culture. This calls for robust methods of detecting and combating image manipulation. This thesis focuses on analyzing the capabilities of two state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural networks, CAT-Net and MVSS-Net, in the context of image manipulation detection. By evaluating the applicability of these networks, the research aims to identify and measure the existing gap in safeguarding against the harmful effects of manipulated images.Building upon prior research, the thesis introduces three key experiments to assess the generalization ability of CAT-Net and MVSS-Net. The first experiment focuses on calculating the receptive field size of the networks, shedding light on their maximum capabilities in the face of improving image resolution and quality. The second experiment investigates the networks' sensitivity to manipulations, suggesting sensitivity to minute alterations as small as 100 pixels in total. These experiments provide valuable insights into the networks' strengths and limitations, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of their effectiveness in real-world scenarios.
The final experiment employs a recently theorized concept called the generalization interval to evaluate the networks' performance in detecting complex, real-world image manipulations. The findings from this experiment reveal that neither network exhibits accurate detection capabilities under the forgiving conditions of easy, human-detectable manipulations. However, CAT-Net's architecture demonstrates promising potential for future solutions, displaying commendable localization performance while results highlight strong memorization characteristics in the model.
In conclusion, this thesis addresses the pressing need for effective image manipulation detection methods in the era of widespread access to image manipulation software and the rapid dissemination of controversial content. By evaluating the generalization ability of CAT-Net and MVSS-Net, the research contributes to the ongoing efforts to protect individuals and institutions from the adverse and unjust effects of disinformation. The findings emphasize the importance of advancing the capabilities of deep neural networks and developing more robust solutions to combat image manipulation in various real-world scenarios.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The exigence for this project lies in the current social-media-dominated moment that society finds itself within. This writing technology that’s used in all sorts of applications, from sharing family photos to managing billion-dollar media empires, has completely transformed the way that humanity communicates. Moreover, this composing technology not only shapes us, but is shaped by us in equal measure. Due to this mutual effect that new media ecologies, this project asks how older ideas in our field may be revised and updated to be more congruent with the social media ecologies, and the theory that I chose for revision is the theory of the rhetorical situation, originated by Lloyd Bitzer in 1968. In revising this theory, my project asks the following questions: </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>1.	How might the rhetorical situation (RS) be revised to be congruent with social media communication? 2.	What would a revised rhetorical situation (RRS) reveal about how people communicate on social media? 
3.	What would a revised rhetorical situation elide about how people communicate on social media? </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To test this theory, I applied the RRS to a political trolling account on Instagram. This account, username @TheseColorsDontCum (hereafter TCDC) is a satirical trolling account whose main goals are ostensibly to lampoon the beliefs of the American republican party, whilst posing as a member of that political party. I chose trolling as my test case because trolling’s overall purpose is to halt cooperative discussion by any and every means necessary – no strategy too profane or taboo. As such, there’s a high likelihood that trolling, by its very nature, may frustrate traditional models of the RS. Thus, choosing a “rulebreaker” genre like trolling could be doubly instructive, as researchers can learn doubly from what the RRS can reveal, and what it can’t. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Applying the RRS to the political trolling account on Instagram revealed two guiding communicative elements: the condition of play, and the strategic use of ambivalence in discourse. This play that the various trolls in TCDC’s discourse community would engage in spanned a variety of manifestations, such as playing with their own authorial persona, playing with their language use, as well as playing with the play frame itself, freely moving in and out of the bounds of play at will. With respect to ambivalence, this ambivalence often caused the exigence of a given piece of discourse to be highly destabilized, causing me to record two different exigences: an exigence that a rhetor directly states, and an exigence that can be observed. This agreed-upon commitment to ambivalence that all the rhetors in TCDC employed also worked as an integral community-building tool, allowing community members to speak almost exclusively in intertextual pop-cultural references to one another, completely eschewing the rules of traditional speech. That the RRS was able to uncover such insights – play and ambivalence – suggests that these elements may also be at work on other social media sites and platforms as well. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>What the RRS was less successful at accounting for was the specific technological composing tools that Instagram had to offer. For example, because I had no way of archiving the various “stories” that TCDC posted on their account, seeing as they delete themselves 24-hours after posting , the RRS couldn’t account for that material. Additionally, because Instagram is owned by Meta (formerly Facebook), it is organized by algorithms. However, because social media companies often do not allow individual users to have information about how (or why) algorithms circulate the content they do, the RRS could not account for this undeniable element of social media situations. The RRS likewise could not address the efficacy of hashtagging, and how well (or not) those hashtags succeeded in extending TCDC’s reach to new audience members. However, these deficits that the RRS currently has need not be permanent; in this project’s conclusion, I suggest that many of these current shortcomings can be picked up by researchers in the future.  </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Research examining incarceration in jails has grown in recent years. Much of this work has focused explicitly on pretrial detainees; that is, those housed within local jails who have yet to be convicted. This population makes up a growing share of the jail population, and currently stands at roughly two-thirds of all jail inmates nationwide. The reason that most pretrial detainees find themselves in custody rather than awaiting trial in the community is not because they have been determined to pose an unmanageable threat to public safety, but rather because they could not pay a cash bail amount set by a judge. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Recognizing the role of cash bail in America’s reliance on jail incarceration, past work has attempted to identify the factors underlying judge’s bail decisions, or to examine the negative consequences associated with our system of cash bail. However, this work suffers from three key limitations. First, past work on racial and ethnic disparities in pretrial detention has focused narrowly on judges’ discretion and the factors underlying judicial decision-making. Second, prior research has considered the effects of cash bail and pretrial detention beyond the pretrial stage, including convictions and post-adjudication recidivism; however, this work has not considered the extent to which pretrial considerations shape cumulative disadvantage across the criminal justice system. Third, research on the consequences of bail and pretrial detention has focused primarily on individual-level criminal justice outcomes, largely neglecting the broader impacts of the cash bail system. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Using data from Palm Beach County, Florida and the American Community Survey, and focusing on theoretical perspectives from the sentencing and communities and crime traditions, this dissertation aims to address these limitations through three empirical chapters. The first empirical chapter examines the role of bail schedules (i.e., policy documents that provide bail amount recommendations for different charges) in pretrial release, including whether bail schedules contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in release outcomes. Additionally, this chapter examines judges’ adherence to the bail schedule during the initial court hearing, including whether judges similarly rely on schedule recommendations across racial and ethnic groups. The second empirical chapter extends this by examining whether the bail schedule contributes to adverse outcomes across multiple stages of the criminal case process (i.e., pretrial, conviction, sentencing) and whether the cumulative impact of these negative outcomes is greater for Black and Latino people relative to Whites. The final empirical chapter examines the distribution of cash bail across census tracts in Palm Beach County, Florida and identifies the community-level characteristics associated with high levels of cash bail.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Evidence regarding the impact of bail schedules on racial and ethnic disparities in pretrial release was somewhat mixed. Contrary to expectations, Black and Latino felony defendants were more likely to be released via the bail schedule than their White counterparts. As expected, however, Latino people booked on a misdemeanor were less likely to be released than Whites. I attempt to explain these patterns, but also note that releases via the schedule comprise fewer than one in three cases. In contrast, most individuals booked into the Palm Beach County Jail appear before a judge for a bail hearing. The findings revealed that judges relied on the bail amount recommended by the schedule in roughly half of these hearings. Although departures were more frequently in the direction of issuing lower bail amounts, judges departed upward from the recommendation in more than one in five cases. Furthermore, while downward departures were issued similarly across racial and ethnic groups, judges were more likely to issue upward departures for Black and Latino people relative to Whites. These findings suggest that the bail schedule contributes to racial disparities primarily through its impact on judicial decision-making.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Findings from the second chapter additionally revealed that the bail schedule contributes to cumulative disadvantage across the criminal justice system’s stages. Specifically, those who were detained via the bail schedule fared worse during later stages of the criminal case process, including adjudication and sentencing. Furthermore, among felony defendants, these cumulative impacts were disproportionately experienced by members of racial and ethnic minority groups. Taken together, these findings suggest that local pretrial policies and practices play an important role in shaping pretrial decision-making, and that these pretrial decisions have cascading effects on later criminal justice system stages. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Findings from the third chapter underscore that despite the important immediate and later consequences associated with local pretrial policies and practices, the effects of pretrial decisions--and the decision to issue money bail in particular—extend beyond the individual. Indeed, similar to other markers of criminal justice involvement, including arrest and incarceration, cash bail appears to be spatially concentrated in several areas within Palm Beach County, including census tracts that are characterized by high levels of concentrated disadvantage, high percentages of Black residents, and high levels of criminal justice activity.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>A quasigeodesic is a curve which approximates length up to a multiplicative and/or anadditive constant. In this thesis, we are interested in Anosov flows on three manifolds whose
flowlines are quasigeodesic when lifted in the universal cover. Quasigeodesic behavior of
flowlines make a bridge between the dynamics of the flow and the large scale geometry of the
underlying manifold. For this reason, quasigeodesic behaviors of flowlines of Anosov flows
are widely studied and proven to be very useful, especially in hyperbolic three manifolds.
Though quasigeodesic Anosov flows are very useful, there is no known method to prove that
a given flow is quasigeodesic.
• In Theorem A, we prove that the Generalized Franks-Williams type Anosov flows
are Quasigeodesic. Franks and Williams introduced a new surgery technique to con-
struct non-transitive Anosov flows. Our result gives the first examples of quasigeodesic
Anosov flows on three manifolds that are neither Seifert, nor solvable, nor hyperbolic.
We also provide a new method to prove that an Anosov flow is quasigeodesic.
• In the second Theorem B, we study leafwise quasigeodesic behavior of Anosov flows.
We construct an one-dimensional foliations which are subfoliations of two dimensional
foliations in three manifolds; this construction is motivated by the Franks-Williams
type technique. The subfoliation is by quasigeodesics in each two dimensional leaf, but
it is not funnel: not all quasigeodesics share a common ideal point in most leaves. This
result answer a question negatively. In the course of the proof of Theorem B, we prove
another Theorem C which says that if a subfoliation satisfies certain conditions then
the leaves of the subfoliations are leafwise quasigeodesic.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This paper aimed to examine which factors influence psychologist-in-trainings to use telepsychology in future clinical practice. The primary goal of this paper was to explore the relationships between openness, direct experience, social norms, attitudes, and willingness to use telepsychology among psychologists-in-training. The present study found that openness, social norms, and direct experience positively impact willingness. Furthermore, attitudes mediate social norms and direct experience. Psychologists-in-training who had direct experience indicated a greater willingness to use telepsychology. However, didactic training decreased psychologists-in-training’s willingness to use telepsychology in future clinical practice. Implications and limitations are discussed. Keywords: Telepsychology, graduate students, training, attitudes, willingness.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Approximately 10% of U.S. children are diagnosed with ADHD, and the majority of them retain clinical levels of ADHD symptoms as an adult. Among them, comorbidities are often observed, which can negatively impact a broad range of their everyday life including social, emotional, behavioral, and academic/work functioning. A first-line treatment option of medication is available but it may cause inadequate responses. It is meaningful to diversify psychosocial interventions for the heterogeneous ADHD population. Currently, CBT and mindfulness-based interventions are evidence-based interventions. However, most ADHD intervention studies do not address unique challenges of college students with ADHD. They play a role as an emerging adult as well as a student in formal educational settings. During the transition, college students with ADHD may experience more difficulties navigating their life without the same structures from their parents and schools. This study aims to answer this question: Can adding mindfulness components into CBT-only coaching substantially improve the clinical effectiveness in ADHD symptoms, psychological health, and academic achievement outcomes among college students diagnosed with ADHD? In a non-concurrent multiple baseline single case subject design, four participants completed 12 coaching sessions. The results are conflicting. First, adding mindfulness to CBT-only coaching did not significantly improve ADHD symptoms or academic achievement outcomes. However, in psychological health outcomes, it showed more effectiveness than CBT-only coaching but the levels of significance range from weak to strong. Based on the results and limitations, implications for both practitioners and future researchers follow. In the discussion section, clinical change mechanisms and intervention planning depending on students’ characteristics are highlighted.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This dissertation utilized a reflective narrative inquiry to document the authentic, lived educational experiences of African American, male, ninth grade students who navigated their middle school years during the COVID-19 global pandemic. By honoring the voices and experiences of these school-aged, African American males, I present a contextualized, holistic picture of the African American male’s academic experience during a tumultuous global pandemic. Exploring and documenting the African American males’ academic journey during the extremes of and through the lens of a global pandemic highlight these students’ perceptions of school, academic success, academic supports and support systems, and academic challenges and barriers. It also highlights the importance of teacher-student relationships, social and peer groups, and instructional methods.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Math achievement is an important predictor of progression to later science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education and careers. However, attitudinal factors also play a role, and interventions attempting to improve math attitudes may be important for increasing the number of STEM-aspiring students. To design effective interventions, it is important to understand how these variables might be related, and how these relations develop over time. This study used Latent Change Score Modeling (LCSM) with an accelerated cohort design to examine how three attitudinal variables – math self-concept, math interest, and math anxiety – codevelop in a sample of 2,954 students from a three-wave study covering fall of kindergarten to spring of third grade, and to investigate how patterns of co-development might differ by gender.  Univariate models indicated that math interest and math anxiety decreased, while math self-concept increased over the time period. Levels of self-concept influenced subsequent change in interest, levels of interest influenced subsequent change in anxiety, and levels of anxiety influenced subsequent change in interest. Change in interest also influenced later change in anxiety. Patterns of co-development were broadly similar for girls and boys, with some key distinctions, most notably a lack of significant univariate change in interest for girls and a lack of significant coupling between anxiety and change in self-concept in boys. Findings suggest that interventions focusing on maintaining high levels of math interest and self-concept, and reducing math anxiety, may be particularly fruitful in terms of their effects on other variables, and that interventions specifically focused on increasing math self-concept may be especially beneficial for girls. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Two significant problems oppose recovery from addiction: difficulty sustaining recovery and vocational difficulties.  Research suggests that employment problems are linked with addiction and that vocational improvements can be helpful in early recovery.  Little is known about the vocational lives of people beyond early recovery.  This study explored whether vocational concepts were present at different levels for people in different stages of recovery and whether these variables predicted long-term recovery.  An online survey was given to 173 people in recovery survey about their length of abstinence, career adaptability (CA), vocational identity (VI), satisfaction with life (SWL), and demographic information.  A MANCOVA revealed that SWL was greater for people in the third stage of recovery compared to those in the first but that there were no differences for VI or CA.  The same analysis using greatest length of abstinence instead of current revealed similar findings, but added: VI was greater for people in the third stage of recovery than those in the second.  Multiple Regression demonstrated that only age and income predicted length of abstinence, income was the only positive predictor of SWL, and CA negatively predicted SWL.  The same pattern held in improved models, but VI also emerged as a positive predictor of SWL. The primary variables of interest were not as influential as hypothesized.  However, the importance of income in predicting length of abstinence and SWL could represent improvements in career and vocational lives.  Those in early recovery might be encouraged that SWL was greater in later stages of recovery.  Finally, VI predicted satisfaction in life but was also more prevalent in those who have experienced relapse after a significant length of abstinence.  Future directions for both research and clinical practice are discussed. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The quality of teachers is crucial for students’ learning and human development, particularly in modern multicultural classrooms and rapidly evolving environments. A key focus of teacher preparation is to transform classroom discourse and promote problem-solving skills and critical thinking. In order to foster critical thinking and facilitate rigorous understanding among students, teachers need to acquire ambitious teaching practices that elicit students’ existing knowledge, facilitate discussions, and promote synergistic negotiation. Practice-rooted simulation-based teacher learning programs that provide ample practice opportunities and real-time feedback are essential for systematic knowledge and skills development for teachers before they engage in classroom practicum with human students. Unfortunately, there is a lack of such programs. One way to address this gap is through the use of virtual reality simulation with artificial intelligence (AI)-powered virtual agents. It is also important to provide guidance and support within this type of teacher learning environment. To this end, the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of model-based support (the widgets that are integrated into virtual reality simulation for teacher learning that contain prompts, hints, modeling, and reflection in the pretraining, in-simulation, and post-simulation phases) on teaching knowledge and skills development and teaching self-efficacy in simulation-based teacher learning with AI-powered virtual agents. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>I employed an experimental design in this study to investigate the effects of model-based support in simulation-based learning with AI-powered virtual students on the teaching knowledge and skills as well as teaching self-efficacy of preservice teachers. I recruited 57 preservice teachers to participate in this study. The participating preservice teachers were randomly assigned to either the model-based support with AI-powered virtual agents group (i.e., model-based support group), AI-powered virtual agents without model-based support group (i.e., AI-powered virtual agent only group), and the no-treatment control group. I used pre- and post- teaching knowledge and skills tests and pre- and post-teaching self-efficacy scales to collect the data. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>ANCOVA results demonstrated that participants in both model-based support group and AI-powered virtual agents only group outperformed those in the no-treatment control group on the teaching knowledge and skills test. Bonferroni post hoc comparisons revealed no significant difference between model-based support group and AI-powered virtual agents only group. In terms of teaching self-efficacy, no significant differences were found between the experimental groups (i.e., model-based support group and AI-powered virtual agent only group) and the control group. Further, with regression analyses, I found significant predicting effects of the total duration of model-based support use (the sum of the duration of pretraining support, in-situ  support, and post-simulation support use) on teaching knowledge and skills. Specifically, the significant effects were observed for the pretraining stage and the post-simulation stage, but not for the in-situ stage. The significant predicting effects were not found for teaching self-efficacy.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The implications of the study findings suggest that the design of supports in simulation-based learning for preservice teachers should incorporate preparations for ambitious teaching practices as well as human-AI interactions. It is also beneficial for the preservice teachers to engage in post-simulation reflections. Future research should continue to explore the different designs of learning support in simulation-based learning with AI-powered virtual agents for preservice teachers, particularly the ones that improve intrinsic integration of the learning support in virtual reality simulation-based learning.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This phenomenological study addressed the question, “What is the lived experience of Black female collegiate choral directors in North America?” Participants were eight Black women who currently held collegiate choral conducting positions. I sought maximum variation by selecting participants representing diverse academic (i.e., programs of study, institution types, faculty ranks) and life (i.e., motherhood status, region) circumstances. Participants engaged in two interviews and one journal activity. I sought trustworthiness through triangulation, member checking of transcripts, and peer review of coding. Colaizzi’s seven-step phenomenological approach to inquiry steered the steps in the thematic analysis. Participants exhibited a mindfulness of internal (self) and external (others) reactions to race and gender, creating chronic discomfort and resilience through necessitation. The participants expressed chronic discomfort through statements referring to weaponized biases, isolation (socially and professionally), and extra labor (voluntary and involuntary) and resilience through necessitation emerged as the participants discussed the lack of representation, their rapport with students and peers, and tasks associated with racial uplift. The findings of this study could provide collegiate music administrators and admissions personnel an in-depth understanding of the complexity of issues faced by Black females in collegiate choral music as both students and professors. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Among college students in the United States nationally, non-suicidal self-injurious (NSSI) behaviors have become alarmingly and increasingly common. Among those willing to disclose, recent estimates indicate 25-30% engaged in NSSI in 2020 alone. Prevalence is significantly elevated among students who identify as a sexual minority (i.e., lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer/questioning, etc. [LGBQ+]), with estimates indicating an average of 40% of these students reporting NSSI. However, escalation in severity and prevalence over the last decade has been accompanied by stagnant, low rates of help-seeking among these students, who appear to only be willing to disclose and pursue formal treatment upon experiencing severe distress and suicidality. A review of the existing literature revealed internalized stigma as a key variable that appears to explain both the escalation in self-harm engagement and lack of willingness to seek support. Several gaps in the literature were also identified, including: (1) lack of an expansive, inclusive definition of self-harm, (2) lack of inclusion of self-harm and sexual orientation as variables of interest in nationally-representative research investigating college student help-seeking attitudes and behavior, and (3) lack of investigation into the influence of different types of internalized stigma on the relationship between self-harm and help-seeking, including stigma directly related to self-harm behavior and stigma related to sexual orientation. This study employed a correlational analysis approach to understanding relationships between the study’s key variables, including psychological distress, severity of self-harm engagement, willingness to seek psychological help, and three distinct types of internalized stigma: internalized stigma of mental illness (ISMI), internalized stigma of self-harm (ISSH), and internalized heterosexism (IH). The three variables of internalized stigma and severity of self-harm engagement were also investigated for their ability to predict willingness to seek psychological help. A sample of college students (n = 302), recruited via the online crowdsourcing platform Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk), completed a brief self-report survey of their experience. Measures included the Kessler 10-item Psychological Distress Scale (K-10), the Non-Suicidal Self-Injury Assessment Tool (NSSI-AT), the Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness Inventory—10 (ISMI-10), the Self-Injury Social Reactions Questionnaire (SI-SRQ), the Sexual Identity Distress Scale (SIDS), and the Attitudes Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help Scale—Short Form (ATSPPH-SF). 
Results of correlational and regression analyses indicated that internalized stigma and severity of self-harm engagement were significantly associated with willingness to seek psychological help among this sample. In the overall sample, which included students with and without self-harm engagement, ISMI was the most significant predictor of willingness to seek help, regardless of sexual orientation. However, among students who did engage in self-harm, at any level of severity, the severity of their self-harm was the predominant predictor of their willingness to seek formal psychological help, over and above the effects of internalized stigma. Results also supported significant relationships between ISMI, ISSH, and IH among the target sample of participants who identify with all three of these minority identities: mental illness, self-harm engagement, and LGBQ+ identity. Among LGBQ+ students, self-harm severity was additionally related to IH, such that those with greater IH reported more severe self-harm. 
Surprisingly, when measured dichotomously between heterosexual and LGBQ+ students, no significant differences in severity, internalized stigma, or help-seeking willingness were found between students based on sexual orientation. Additionally, psychological distress was found to be unrelated to any other variable of interest. 
These findings support the existing literature that self-harm is prevalent and severe among college students, and add to the literature by demonstrating that internalized stigma and increasing severity of self-harm explain students’ reluctance to seek the help of formal psychological services. As such, it is imperative that clinicians and other professionals who serve these students are prepared to competently, and compassionately, evaluate and treat severe self-harm engagement, in order to reduce the likelihood of amplifying the effects of internalized stigma that prevent students from seeking help initially. Among other recommendations, results implicate future research to: (1) define self-harm utilizing a comprehensive, evaluative approach that does not require participants to self-identify and label their behavior, (2) further investigate internalized stigma as a barrier to help-seeking utilizing a multi-faceted definition that separately measures stigma related to various minority identities, including specifically toward self-harm engagement and LGBQ+ identity, (3) further analyze internalized stigma as a co-variate in courses of illness that include self-harm engagement, and (4) explore the efficacy of interventions designed to reduce internalized stigma (toward mental illness, self-harm engagement, and LGBQ+ identity) for their ability to potentially reduce self-harm severity, increase willingness to seek formal psychological help, and increase service utilization.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The Jackson’s Gap Group is a thin section (~3 km wide) of sheared, compositionally interlayered metamorphic rocks spanning from west Georgia to central Alabama, representing the southernmost extent of the Brevard Zone. The lithostratigraphic units within the Jackson’s Gap Group are predominately muscovite and garnetiferous schists ranging from graphitic to non-graphitic, which are interlayed with clean and micaceous quartzites and minor metaigneous units. Within the western limb of the Tallassee synform, the Jackson’s Gap Group is separated from the underlying Emuckfaw Group by the Abanda fault and the overlying Dadeville complex by the Katy Creek Fault. The Kowaliga Gneiss is an Ordovician plutonic body that intruded the stratigraphic boundary between the Emuckfaw Group and the Jackson’s Gap Group, resulting in augen gneiss sills intruding and paralleling the oldest portion of the Jackson’s Gap stratigraphy. This intrusional boundary suggests the protoliths of the Jackson’s Gap Group were deposited within closer proximity to the Wedowee-Emuckfaw-Dahlonega back-arc basin than previously thought. Additionally, the metaigneous units within the Jackson’s Gap Group further its association with the Ordovician back-arc system related to the current B-type supra-subduction model of the Taconic Orogeny responsible for formation the southern Appalachians. Within the study area, a cataclastic zone associated with the Abanda fault, around 10 meters thick, contains a wide range of cataclastic rocks that indicate multiple stages of reactivation and cataclasis. Both identified Abanda cataclastic splays do not offset any surrounding Ordovician-Silurian units within the Emuckfaw and Jackson’s Gap Groups. Based on these cataclastic rocks and a proposed Abanda fault outcrop, the nature of the Abanda fault differs from previous conclusions and tips out around the town of Jackson’s Gap, Alabama.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Cultural capital is a key term from the Social Reproduction Theory, and it is defined as the codes and practices that parents pass on to their children (Bourdieu, 1984). Previous empirical studies have confirmed the importance of cultural capital, and it is positively related to students’ reading achievement (e.g., Košutić, 2017; Noble &amp; Davis, 2009). However, few previous studies considered cultural capital from a person-centered perspective, not to mention considering it as longitudinal nor measuring its growth during students’ elementary years. It is also less known how socioeconomic status (SES) relates to cultural capital and how these two factors influence students’ reading achievement together. The goal of the current study was to answer the following research questions: for each cultural capital indicator (i.e., parental expectations, the number of books owned by the child at home, and library vising frequency), how many latent trajectory classes are there? What are the patterns of these trajectory classes? How does SES predict the membership of the trajectory class of cultural capital indicators? Last but not least, how does the membership of latent trajectory classes for each cultural capital indicator predict children’s reading achievement in fifth grade? The current study used a United States national public use dataset, the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Program, Kindergarten Class of 2010-11. The target population was elementary school students and their parents. The sample size for the current study was 18,174. After applying appropriate weights, the sample could represent the whole United States students enrolled in kindergarten in 2010. Cultural capital was measured by three items from the parent interview survey: parental expectation of their children’s educational attainment, frequency of library or bookstore visit, and the number of books at home. Kindergarten year SES is a continuous composite variable based on household income, both parents’ education level, and occupation. I conducted preliminary analyses for descriptive and correlational results. I used growth mixture modeling to answer research questions related to culture capital indicators’ latent trajectory classes. The current study uncovered diverse patterns of cultural capital indicators. Specifically, I identified five latent trajectory classes for parental expectations, and two latent trajectory classes for the number of books owned by the child. However, I identified no unobserved subgroups for visiting a library/bookstore during the previous month, which suggested homogeneity within the population. The results also suggested that there was no growth of possibility of parents taking the child to visit a library/bookstore from first grade to fifth grade. SES significantly predicted latent class membership for parental expectations, as well as membership for the number of books at home. In addition, SES positively predicted the intercept of the latent growth model of library/bookstore visiting. The current study also indicated that the membership of parental expectations latent trajectory classes could predict students’ fifth grade reading achievement, as well as the latent trajectory class membership of the number of books. The intercept of the indicator of library/bookstore visiting during elementary years positively correlated with students’ fifth grade reading achievement. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Online course quality is a prominent issue due to the increasing number of online programs and courses offered by institutions of higher education. To ensure the best student outcomes, it is necessary to implement effective systemic support for quality assurance in online learning. Providing faculty with the environmental supports required to design their courses using quality standards may ensure better outcomes for students. Similarly, if best practices are not well-supported, not only will student outcomes suffer, but so will the reputation of online learning. As complex ecosystems with limited resources, colleges that are developing online programs and courses should know what environmental factors are effective for improving faculty adoption of quality standards. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Quality MattersTM  (QM) is a quality assurance process for online learning comprising a rubric, training, and peer review. Research by QM established the effectiveness of the QM standards when implemented in online courses. Other research suggested that there may be a gap in implementation after training. Although faculty training to design courses around quality standards is intended to ensure the best outcomes for students, faculty often do not demonstrate the adoption of those standards. While QM focuses on three areas of quality improvement to improve the knowledge and skills of faculty, Gilbert’s (2007) Behavior Engineering Model predicts that other factors have an influence on actual performance. As institutions of higher education invest in faculty professional development to improve course quality, additional institutional resources may also be required to support faculty to implement what they have learned. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study explored effective strategies for supporting quality assurance practices that encourage the adoption of QM criteria into online courses at state colleges in Florida. Three research questions guided this study: </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>1. What environmental supports are colleges in the Florida Quality Matters Consortium (FLQMC) providing to APPQMR-trained faculty to facilitate the adoption of QM criteria in their online courses?  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>2. What are the perceptions of faculty who have received APPQMR training about how effectively their QM program supports adoption of QM criteria? </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>3. What are the perceptions of college QMC about how effectively their program supports adoption of QM criteria by faculty who have received APPQMR training? </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para> A sequential, mixed-method multi-case research design was used to collect descriptive statistics and qualitative data to gather information about what environmental supports Florida College System colleges provide to faculty to facilitate the adoption of QM criteria in their online courses. To develop a more complete understanding of the primary research question, an explanatory two-part mixed-methods study collected both qualitative and quantitative data to describe college supports and explore the perceptions of QM coordinators and online teaching faculty. The study included: (1) document analysis and (2) structured interviews with selected participants via Zoom. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study utilized the BEM (Gilbert, 2007) to identify environmental supports and established the use of the BEM to study environmental support in implementations of online course quality initiatives. Further, the Cause Analysis Worksheet (Chevalier, 2008) was utilized to operationalize the three categories of environmental supports as they relate to QM implementation. The categories of environmental support of the BEM were identified through document analysis and interviews with faculty and QMC at six colleges of varying sizes and length of membership in the Florida Quality Matters Consortium. Additionally, the study explored the perceptions of both faculty and QMC about how effectively their QM program supports adoption of QM criteria.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Effective strategies for supporting quality assurance practices that encourage the adoption of QM criteria into online courses at state colleges in Florida were identified in all three categories: information, resources, and incentives. Findings suggest colleges implementing their own programs should provide faculty time to implement QM standards in their online courses and assistance with design and development. To efficiently allocate resources that effect change, colleges that are developing quality assurance programs for online learning can focus on these effective systemic supports to bridge the gap from training to adoption. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Global sensitivity analysis studies how uncertainty in a model's output can be attributed to uncertainties in the model's inputs. This analysis has applications in various fields such as natural sciences, engineering, social sciences, and mathematical sciences. Several global sensitivity analysis methods have been introduced in literature, such as Sobol' sensitivity indices, activity scores, derivative-based global sensitivity measures (DGSM), and Shapley values.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The dissertation introduces two new control variate Monte Carlo estimators based on the truncated sparse polynomial chaos expansion of the function in hand. The control variate estimators are used to estimate the lower and upper Sobol' indices in some applications, and are numerically compared with some of the best Monte Carlo estimators in the literature. The results suggest that the control variate estimators are either the best or among the best in terms of efficiency in computationally expensive problems where a low-order polynomial chaos expansion is not an accurate approximation of the model but highly correlated with it.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We also introduce two new approaches to Shapley values, that are based on the first-order partial derivatives and the finite-differences of the underlying function. The derivative based Shapley value has linear computational complexity in the number of features, as opposed to the exponential complexity of other Shapley value approaches. The finite-difference based method is especially useful when there are high-order interactions or in the presence of noise. The methods are used for global sensitivity analysis and machine learning explainability, and numerical comparisons with activity scores, global activity scores, SHAP, and KernelSHAP are provided.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Muscle atrophy decreases physical function and overall health. Increased glucocorticoid production and/or use of prescription glucocorticoids can result in a myopathy that presents with significant muscle atrophy and weakness. Glucocorticoids cause atrophy by activating the glucocorticoid receptor, thereby transcribing genes that shift protein balance in favor of net protein degradation. While mechanical overload can blunt glucocorticoid-induced atrophy in young muscle, it is unknown whether mechanical overload influences glucocorticoid receptor nuclear translocation, a critical step in the receptor activation process. Moreover, it is unknown whether muscle contractile force alters regulation of glucocorticoid receptor because those susceptible to glucocorticoid myopathy are generally at risk of having reduced muscle force generation capacity. Therefore, Specific Aim 1 sought to determine whether contractile force differentially regulates glucocorticoid receptor activation within the skeletal muscle. Male mice were subjected to a single bout of unilateral, electrically induced muscle contractions by stimulating the sciatic nerve at 100 Hz or 50 Hz frequencies to elicit high force or moderate force contractions of the tibialis anterior (TA), respectively. Dexamethasone (DEX) was administered via intraperitoneal (IP) injection at 1mg/kg to activate the glucocorticoid receptor acutely. Treatment with DEX increased glucocorticoid nuclear translocation and expression of putative target genes, but those outcomes were mitigated by high force, but not moderate force, contractions. The ability of high force contractions to mitigate glucocorticoid receptor translocation coincided with a sustained ability for muscle contractions to increase rates of muscle protein synthesis, which is an outcome that can ultimately reduce the negative shift in protein balance induced by glucocorticoids. Interestingly, moderate force contractions did not increase rates of muscle protein synthesis only in the DEX treated mice. Thus, these data show that force generation is important for the ability of resistance exercise to mitigate glucocorticoid receptor translocation and ultimately activate the processes that will reduce the loss of muscle mass in those with elevated glucocorticoids. While these data and the classic data demonstrate the potential for mechanical overload to mitigate glucocorticoid myopathy by reducing glucocorticoid receptor activation and increasing rates of muscle protein synthesis if the mechanical overload and glucocorticoid treatment are started at the same time, it is unknown whether mechanical overload can increase muscle protein synthesis when the glucocorticoid myopathy is already present. Determining whether mechanical overload can increase rates of muscle protein synthesis in glucocorticoid myopathic muscle is important because long-term glucocorticoid exposure can increase the expression of genes that may prevent activation of pathways like the mechanistic target of rapamycin in complex 1 (mTORC1) that contribute to the increase in rates of muscle protein synthesis. Therefore, Specific Aim 2 sought to determine the extent to which mechanical overload increases muscle protein synthesis during the initiation of glucocorticoid myopathy and after the myopathy has more fully developed. Early myopathy was induced in physically mature female mice via daily IP injections of saline as control or 1mg/kg DEX. After 1 week of treatment, the left TA muscle of all mice was subjected to a bout of muscle contractions as stated in Aim 1. In a subsequent experiment, physically mature female mice received regular drinking water as control or DEX in their drinking water for 2 weeks to fully induce myopathy. After 2 weeks of treatment, mice were subjected to unilateral muscle contractions. In both experiments, signaling through mTORC1 and rates of muscle protein synthesis were assessed. Despite initiation of myopathy following 1 week of DEX treatment, mechanical overload increased protein synthesis and mTORC1 signaling equally compared to control mice. After 2 weeks, mechanical overload activated mTORC1 signaling equally in both DEX and control mice, but protein synthesis was only increased by mechanical overload in control mice, suggesting that the stage of glucocorticoid myopathy alters the anabolic response to mechanical overload. Altogether, our data demonstrate that contractile force and duration of glucocorticoid treatment regulates the ability of mechanical overload to alter the signals that would be needed to minimize the atrophy induced by glucocorticoids.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this dissertation, we develop two novel schemes for solving fully nonlinear PDEs that are based on the theoretical treatments of \textit{second order backward stochastic differential equations} (2BSDEs), established in \cite{STZ12}. The first scheme is a multi-step algorithm which iteratively approximates the optimal quadratic variation using an approximation of the value function and its first and second derivatives. The second scheme, which is based on the maximum principle for 2BSDEs, approximates the solution in an iterative process that combines all time steps into one iteration. Our theoretical results demonstrate the convergence of the schemes for a broad class of problems. Numerical results on an example of fully nonlinear PDEs, the well-known Merton investment-consumption control problem with stochastic volatility Scott's model, will be presented to demonstrate the accuracy and advantages of both of our proposed schemes. Unlike many of the deep schemes in the literature, where only point estimates are provided, the schemes developed in this thesis provides an accurate field estimate of the value function.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Deep convective clouds exert an important impact on the chemical composition of the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) since they can rapidly transport aerosols and chemical species from the planetary boundary layer (PBL) to the UTLS. The impacts on air quality and atmospheric chemistry vary depending on the extent of the transport. This transport can change the composition of trace gases and thereby affect weather and climate. This thesis examines two observed cases of deep convection, an Oklahoma supercell on 29 May 2012, and a mesoscale convective system (MCS) on 11 June 2012, both during the Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry (DC3) campaign. The first objective is to document the rate of simulated trace gas transport from the PBL to the UTLS. We utilize the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) to simulate the deep convection. To reduce errors in the timing, location, and depth of the simulated deep convective clouds, a new type of lightning data assimilation (LDA) is employed (Heath et al., 2016). We also perform a WRF-Chem simulation without LDA. Thus, the second objective is to determine the utility of the LDA scheme. The WRF-Chem runs utilize a nested grid with horizontal grid spacings of 36 and 12 km, and 70 vertical levels extending to 50 hPa. STAGE-IV and IMERG Final Run precipitation observations are used to compare simulated rainfall with and without LDA in terms of their timing, location, and intensity. GOES-13 brightness temperature data are used to calculate observed cloud top heights that are compared with simulated cloud tops with and without LDA. Besides the traditional statistical (grid-to-grid) techniques, object-based verification is used to evaluate the simulated precipitation and clouds. Results show that the LDA technique improves the timing, development, and especially the location of the deep convective clouds. Results also reveal that the LDA method increases the correlation between amounts of simulated CO that are transported from the PBL to the UTLS via deep convection for both cases compared to aircraft observations. Computed mass fluxes reveal that flux densities of the supercell exhibit 13.37% greater CO flux densities and 42.94% greater water vapor flux densities in the surface layer, meaning that the supercell transports more CO and H2O from the surface to higher altitudes per unit area in the supercell region than the MCS case. The MCS case demonstrates a weaker transition from the troposphere to the stratosphere in terms of mass fluxes compared to the supercell case.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this dissertation, I discuss the ways in which a musical cue in a video game expresses a given gameplay context, or ludic function, within a game’s overall design. My study focuses primarily on the soundtracks of games published circa 1980–1995, beginning at the point when music became a common feature of video games and ending with the rise of CD-ROM-based game machines, when the technological possibilities of streaming audio contributed to a fragmentation of musical style across the industry. I address the musical conventions of several common ludic functions in early video game music, describing the ways in which these conventions differ depending on a game’s genre and setting.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>After a review of relevant literature in Chapter 1, I examine video game music derived from preexisting sources (e.g., films, television, and classic cartoons) in Chapter 2, describing the ways in which these compositions established many of the semiotic codes of early video game music. I begin by discussing arcade games from the latter half of the 1970s, which relied almost entirely on preexisting compositions to accompany the on-screen action. Then, I briefly address two game genres popular in early arcades—the maze game and the shoot ’em up—and the ways in which preexisting compositions from film and classic cartoons set stylistic precedents for particular ludic functions in original soundtracks later in the decade.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In Chapter 3, I discuss the musical properties of the most common ludic functions found in action games of the 1980s and early 1990s. My discussion is divided into three sections based on when each ludic function occurs relative to the overall structure of a game: before gameplay begins (title screen cues, menu music, and cues immediately preceding gameplay), during the main part of the game (level background music, power-up cues, and music for boss battles), and after a segment of gameplay (victory music, death and game over cues, and music for ending and credits sequences). I consider the ways in which form, harmony, melodic contour, and other features are commonly connected with particular ludic functions.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In Chapter 4, I focus on a single ludic function—level background music—and its varied musical realizations within a single game genre: the platformer. After an overview of the early history of the genre, I describe the musical conventions used to differentiate among several common location types in platformers: overworlds, underworlds, underwater and sky areas, islands, deserts, and icy/snowy areas. I then discuss common musical strategies for communicating a level’s position within the overall game structure: heroic signifiers for opening levels, static and repetitive music for mid-game areas, and several harmonic schemata used to convey gravitas in the game’s final stages.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In Chapter 5, I discuss ludic function in Japanese role-playing games (JRPGs), a subgenre of role-playing game which descended from Western-developed titles but quickly developed its own unique set of musical conventions. I begin by summarizing the early history of role-playing games, both in the West and in Japan, and the musical conventions established by Koichi Sugiyama in the foundational 1986 JRPG Dragon Quest. Then, I discuss the ways in which different cue types convey the relative safety or danger in several environments and contexts—towns, castles, fields, dungeons, and battles—as well as the features of JRPG victory and game over music, which differ from their counterparts in action games. I conclude by describing instances in which these musical expectations are subverted to convey narrative information to the player.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The purpose of this dissertation is to provide a conductor’s analysis of a specific set of repertoire by Paul J. Christiansen. The selected works were limited to Paul J.’s arrangements of pre-existing musical material. In-depth analysis was limited to works in print and available for purchase still today. The author seeks to facilitate informed performance of these works and provide a general resource for conductors who have an interest in performing the music of Paul J. Christiansen.The study includes a short biography of Paul J.’s life and career, providing a brief historical context for this man’s work. It also includes a short history of the development of the Concordia College choral department, namely the Concordia Choir and Concordia Christmas concert, for which Paul J. was synonymous for nearly five decades.
	An annotated catalog of Paul J.’s many choral arrangements is provided. Brief information about the key, meter, tempo, origin, performance length, date of publication, publisher, and voicing is provided. The study concludes with an analysis of two subsets of arrangements of Paul J. Christiansen: Christmas carols and folk tunes. These subsets of arrangements include the vast majority of Paul J.’s works that continue to be frequently performed and are available for purchase. For each piece, a general overview is provided, followed by a form and suggested performance notes.

            <DISS_para>Strongly correlated spin systems continue to draw significant interest due to the complex interplay between structural, charge, and spin degrees of freedom. This intricate relationship gives rise to a range of novel phenomena, such as topologically protected spin textures (like skyrmions), unconventional electronic band physics (e.g., flat bands), and other emergent states. In this dissertation, we present our results from investigations into three distinct compounds within the category of geometrically frustrated materials, specifically those of the LnTAl4Ge2 variety. We elucidate the process of design and synthesis for these compounds, followed by a thorough characterization of their physical properties, including magnetic, thermal, and electronic attributes.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>First, we outlined the design and synthesis of new materials, specifically LnTAl4Ge2 single crystals, utilizing the molten metal flux crystal growth method. By modulating the molar ratio of the reactive elements and the heating/cooling profile, we successfully produced phase-pure crystals. We then elucidated the crystalline structures of the synthesized LnTAl4Ge2 single crystals using Powder X-ray Diffraction (PXRD) and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS), highlighting that the fabrication of large, phase-pure specimens poses significant challenges. We observed the presence of impurity phases such as AuAl2, LnAl2Ge2, and Ln2Al3Ge4 alongside with LnTAl4Ge2 phases. Furthermore, we found that compounds where the Ln = Ce, Sm, Gd, and Tb can be more easily obtained as phase-pure LnAuAl4Ge2 crystals; similarly, when Ln = Sm, Gd, Tb, Y, and Lu, the production of phase-pure LnNiAl4Ge2 crystals can be more easily achievable.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Then, We focus on examples with novel magnetism and reported the comprehensive study of magnetic, thermal, and electrical properties in the antiferromagnetic phase of TbAuAl4Ge2. Following the discussion of TbAuAl4Ge2, GdAuAl4Ge2 compound is studied, together with the thermal results of YAuAl4Ge2. The temperature and magnetic field-dependent magnetization, heat capacity, and electrical resistivity measurements reveal that both Tb- and Gd-variant compounds exhibit several magnetically ordered states at low temperatures, with evidence for magnetic fluctuations extending into the paramagnetic temperature region. For magnetic fields applied in the ab-plane, there is particularly rich behavior, with several ordered state regions that are separated by metamagnetic phase transitions. Despite Gd being an isotropic S-state ion and Tb having an anisotropic J-state, there are similarities in the phase diagrams for the two compounds, suggesting that factors such as the symmetry of the crystalline lattice, which features well-separated triangular planes of lanthanide ions, or the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction control the magnetism. We also point out similarities to other centrosymmetric compounds that host skyrmion lattices, such as Gd2PdSi3, and propose that the LnAuAl4Ge2 family of compounds are of interest as reservoirs for complex magnetism and electronic behaviors.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Next, we reported and bulk physical properties of SmAuAl4Ge2 single crystals, together with experimental results for LuAuAl4Ge2. Temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal van Vleck paramagnetism due to trivalent samarium ions, with complex antiferromagnetic ordering at TN1 = 13.2 K and TN2 = 7.4 K. Heat capacity measurements show that the transitions at TN1 and TN1 are first and second order, respectively, while also revealing that the Sommerfeld coefficient is not enhanced compared to the nonmagnetic analog YAuAl4Ge2. Together with electrical resistivity measurements, these results show that SmAuAl4Ge2 is a weakly correlated metal, where the combination of van Vleck paramagnetism with the triangular net arrangement of the samarium ions, leads to complex magnetic ordering at low temperatures, resembling what is seen in other LnAuAl4Ge2 (Ln = Gd and Tb) analogues. In addition, positive linear magnetoresistance appears within the ordered states over a wide field range, further establishing SmAuAl4Ge2 and the broader family as hosts for novel magnetism and anomalous magnetotransport behaviors.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Finally, we reported results for GdNiAl4Ge2, which crystallizes in a rhombohedral structure that features geometrically frustrated triangular nets of lanthanide ions. Magnetic, thermodynamic, and electrical transport measurements reveal metallic behavior with antiferromagnetic-like ordering in small magnetic fields, which strongly evolves to produce anomalous hysteresis for magnetic fields applied in the ab-plane. In particular, over a limited portion of the temperature-field phase space, the magnetic susceptibility of the field-cooled curves is smaller than that of the zero-field-cooled curves, and the ac magnetic response exhibits frequency and field-dependent peaks only in the zero- field-cooled curves. This suggests the formation of history-dependent spin structures or domains with complex spin relaxation dynamics, resembling what is seen on other materials with nontrivial spin textures. This establishes GdNiAl4Ge2 as a host for intriguing quantum spin states and further focuses attention on this family of materials.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Taken together, the great sensitivity of these properties to changes in temperature and magnetic fields, as well as chemical tune, make the LnTAl4Ge2 family of materials as a reservoir for an environment to search for strongly correlated magnetism and connect them to broader classes of anomalous magnetic metals, including those with geometric frustration [83, 84, 85, 5, 86], topological protection [87, 88, 89, 90], unconventional Hall effects [91, 92], skyrmion states [71, 93, 7, 27, 94, 36], and possibly a metallic quantum spin liquid behavior [95]. This makes our work a great value in developing the present understanding of magnetism. In addition, our work has attracted solid researchers to further study these materials [81, 152]and will be of great value to the theorists for guiding the improvements in understanding magnetism.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to assess music therapists’ knowledge of autism via a validated measure to explore their perspectives regarding how they practiced music therapy with autistic clients. The participants for this study were 336 MT-BC’s practicing across the United States providing music therapy services to at least one autistic client. The dependent measure was a survey created by combining the ASKSP-R by McClain et al. (2020) with previous demographic, professional and clinical practice items selected from previous research by Kern, Rivera, Chandler, and Humpal (2013) and modified to today’s terminology and practice standards. Results showed that, overall, music therapists had adequate knowledge of autism as measured by the ASKSP-R however there were gaps in knowledge found. Music therapists reported feeling confident providing music therapy services to autistic people. Regarding how music therapists informed their practice, they reported using several different resources, organizations, and training programs such as Autism Speaks, Autistic Self Advocacy Network, Autistic Women &amp; Nonbinary Network, Registered Behavioral Technician training, and applied behavior analysis and safety care training. The free text responses on the professional practice portion of the survey revealed strong feelings about the current controversy over appropriate services for autistic persons. Since the ASKSP-R and portions of the survey used person-first language and deficit based language, several music therapists expressed their concern and opinions through textual responses on the survey, through emails, and social media. While several music therapists showed support for a social model and the neurodiversity paradigm, others showed their support for the medical diagnosis  model, therapies for autism such as ABA, and organizations such as Autism Speaks. This study concludes with my personal responses and recommendations as an autistic person to the study, diagnosis, and services provided to autistic persons. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Teachers play a large role in determining whether or not the classroom climate experienced by students is positive, especially through their visible emotional behaviors (i.e., neutral, positive, and negative emotional expressions). Research suggests that teachers make specific contributions to the classroom emotional climate in actions such as building relationships with students, managing classroom behaviors, and displaying enthusiasm during instruction. The current study explored one specific contribution teachers make to the classroom emotional climate (i.e., teacher displayed affective demeanor) likely associated with maintaining student engagement. The purpose of this study was to capture the unique influences of teacher displayed affective demeanor as it relates to students’ engagement. Secondary analysis using video recordings of 84 first through third grade classrooms were used to explore teachers’ displayed affective demeanor (n = 79) and students’ off-task behavior (n = 539) during reading instruction. Limited research addresses the contribution of teacher displayed affective demeanor as students progress through elementary school and move to new classrooms. This study investigated these associations both concurrently and longer term (across three school years). Specifically, multilevel growth models were used to explore whether and how teachers’ affective demeanor and students’ off-task behavior were associated over time. Two main research aims were addressed: (1) How does teachers’ displayed affective demeanor relate to students’ off-task behavior cross-sectionally in first, second, and third grade? and (2) How does teachers’ displayed affective demeanor relate to growth in student off-task behavior from first through third grade? Teachers’ demeanor characteristics were associated with students’ off-task behavior and distinct associations between students’ off-task behavior and teachers’ demeanor were present in first, second, and third grade. Additionally, an increase in teachers’ positive demeanor was associated with less off-task behavior in the spring of third grade and a more rapidly declining rate of growth in off-task behavior over time. The results suggested that first grade teachers’ positive demeanor contributed to changes in students’ off-task behavior in the same school year as well as the following two school years that students experienced in different classrooms. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The affective salience network is composed of a variety of brain regions, including, but not limited to, the anterior insula, amygdala, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. Based primarily on fMRI studies, previous research suggests that activity in the affective salience network is related to suicidal behavior. The affective salience network’s specific role in suicidal behavior is not known, but one possibility is its core function in the orienting response to salient stimuli, including threat. This orienting response aids in survival and, if diminished to threatening stimuli, may underlie the affective salience network’s relationship to suicidal behavior by contributing to a key construct in leading theories of suicide: capability for suicide, specifically its subconstruct called fearlessness about death. Existing treatments for suicidal behavior are sub-optimal, and thus interventions targeting the affective salience network may prove beneficial in treating suicidal behavior by decreasing capability for suicide. In a first step towards investigating such an approach, Chapter 1 reviews the literature on capability for suicide, the affective salience network, neural measures of affective salience, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and how it can be used to stimulate subcortical areas. Chapter 2 discusses an attempt to use intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS), a type of repetitive TMS, to alter affective salience network activity in healthy young adults by indirectly targeting a key region of this network: the amygdala. In line with previous research using a similar approach, a portion of the rostral medial frontal wall (RMW) that demonstrated high functional connectivity with the amygdala was stimulated to alter the affective salience network’s orienting response to affective pictures. To examine this neural activity, an event-related potential called the late positive potential (LPP) was measured. Analyses did not reveal any significant difference in the LPP between stimulating the RMW and a control site (V1). However, if effect sizes were to hold in a larger sample, the data suggest that iTBS stimulation to V1 reduces the affective salience network’s response to threatening images. 	Chapter 3 discusses future directions based on the results presented in Chapter 2, and ends with remarks on the state of the suicide neuroscience field. Specifically, I discuss the assumptions in the present paradigm, and offer suggestions for how the field can improve. 
	In summary, this work failed to find a significant effect of stimulation to the RMW to alter the LPP. Nevertheless, the data suggests the possibility that V1 stimulation reduces the salience network’s response to threatening images. With further investigation, the relationship between V1 stimulation and salience network activity may inform the scientific community’s understanding of the relationship between sensory information and salience.

            <DISS_para>The Latinx college population is at risk for developing anxiety symptoms due to stressors related to minority contexts. This study examined the role of familism among Latinx college students and how it relates to generational status and anxiety. The sample included 154 Latinx college students attending Florida State University (Mage = 20.4, SD = 1.692; 71.4% female; 74.9% U.S. born). Participants completed surveys via Qualtrics. A path analysis was utilized to examine the mediation from generational status to familism to anxiety outcomes. Results indicated no associations with anxiety. In this study, familism did not mediate the association between generational status and anxiety. The findings of this study highlight familism subscales and their relation to income and gender which imply that family obligation may be impacted by income and gender.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The topic of Orofacial Myofunctional Disorders (OMDs) and how they can challenge instrumental performance is an area of research that is not frequently discussed. My interest in this topic began during my pursuit to improve areas of playing such as tongue positioning and articulation. I felt that I was hitting roadblocks, many of which I struggled to overcome. I wondered what was different about me and why progress in these areas was so challenging. After some reflection, I began to consider whether the tongue thrust diagnosis I received in my teen years could still be manifesting in some way. This inspired my research on Orofacial Myofunctional Disorders, Tongue Thrust Disorder, and their relationship to clarinet performance. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The research in this treatise aims to accomplish three goals. The first is to provide readers with a better understanding of OMDs and Tongue Thrust Disorder and their side effects. The second is to discuss the existing literature researching the relationships between clarinet performance and Tongue Thrust Disorder. Finally, it will explore some pedagogical methods and their effectiveness in cases of tongue thrust. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Atmospheric fronts are responsible for changes in temperature, precipitation, and wind direction, and are often associated with extremes related to the weather, such as cold snaps and flooding, that have significant socio-economic impacts. Winter cold fronts moving across the eastern United States are known to leave residents in states of extreme cold and dangerous weather. These temperatures can lead to an increase in electricity demand, which can result in increased carbon emissions. With several states working to reduce carbon emissions, a better understanding and predictability of fronts and their temperature change impacts would help power companies better budget for carbon emissions and guide capital investment in renewable technologies. In this research, we analyze how several leading modes of climate variability, such as the NAO, PNA and ENSO, influence temperature extremes related to the passing of atmospheric fronts. This manuscript investigates the average temperature anomalies associated with the passage cold and warm fronts for locations in North Carolina, New York, Florida, and off the coast of Florida. Several characteristic patterns defining the passage of fronts in each location have been discussed. With these anomalies characterized, they were compared to the average temperature anomalies associated with cold fronts during the positive and negative phases of the NAO, PNA, and ENSO. The modes were found to influence the characteristic anomalies surrounding cold fronts. Each mode impacted every location differently, but they could cause or suppress extreme temperatures as they related to the passage of cold fronts. A preliminary exploration of the relationship between electricity demand and the passage of cold fronts was also discussed. The influence of frontal strength on spikes in electricity demand was found to result in a higher probability for larger spikes in demand with stronger cold fronts and a lower probability for spikes with weaker fronts. The location in New York was selected to analyze how cold fronts during ENSO may change this relationship that was found between cold fronts and electricity demand spikes. This preliminary investigation proved that there is a relationship between electricity demand spikes and cold fronts and that the modes of variability can impact this relationship. This provides potential for more extensive work to be done in the future to fully quantify the scale relationship between fronts and electricity demand during specific phases of modes of variability.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Spanish composers María Rodrigo Bellido (1888-1967) and Emiliana Zubeldía e Inda (1888-1987) exhibit remarkable personal and professional parallels. Both were born the same year during the Bourbon Restoration in Spain, received world-class training abroad, and were accomplished concert pianists and published composers in an era when most Spanish women were illiterate. Still in their prime, they left Spain and lived the remainder of their lives in the Americas, having key roles in the establishment of collegiate music programs in Puerto Rico and Mexico, respectively. It is difficult to overestimate the quality of their work and significance of their achievements.Their music is endowed with rich individuality and reflects the synthesis of wider European musical trends, national and regional folk music, key mentors’ and collaborators’ influences, and their own unique compositional vision. Both were prolific vocal and instrumental composers, yet neither has received due recognition outside of Mexico and Spain. Very little of their work has been published, and the scores that do exist are often hard to locate and difficult to read. Additionally, the majority of the limited scholarly research published about their lives is written exclusively in Spanish, making it inaccessible to an English-speaking audience.
This project represents an essential English-language biographical resource and a detailed analysis of twenty-five of Rodrigo and Zubeldía’s art songs, with the object of providing greater awareness of and access to this body of work for students, teachers, and professional performers in classical voice. With over 41 million Spanish speakers in the United States  and a growing demand for racial, cultural, and gender inclusivity, this treatise is an important addition to existing literature.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This study examined the effect of anthropomorphism in marketing for new luxury brands and its influence on consumer attitudes and behaviors, with a specific focus on brand recall, attitudes toward the ad, attitude toward the brand, and intentions to purchase. The data was collected using a convenient sample from the Florida State University (FSU) student population and through an online survey resulting in 195 recorded and analyzed responses out of a sample of 237. The results of the study revealed statistically significant findings regarding the effects of anthropomorphism on consumer attitudes and behaviors. Specifically, the findings supported the hypothesis that anthropomorphism in marketing for new luxury brands positively influences brand recall. These results contribute to a theoretical understanding of the use of anthropomorphism in marketing, provide recommendations for practitioners, and suggest avenues for further research in the field of anthropomorphism and new luxury brand marketing. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The relationships between perfectionism and depression have been widely studied among college students (Smith et al., 2020). Research has explained their relationships by suggesting different mediating variables in cognitive, social, and behavioral contexts, specifically based on the Perfectionism Social Disconnection model (PSDM; Hewitt et al., 2006) and the Existential Model of Perfectionism and Depressive Symptoms (EMPDS; Graham et al., 2010). However, research has not examined the simultaneous effects of cognitive, social, and behavioral variables on the relationships between perfectionism and depressive symptoms with consideration of multidimensionality of perfectionism. The multidimensionality of perfectionism can be explained with perfectionistic strivings, narcissistic perfectionism, and perfectionistic concerns. The lack of an integrated model of perfectionism and depressive symptoms have engendered some limitations in comprehending multidimensional perfectionism and depressive symptoms. The limitations include: 1) the unique/conjoint effects of each perfectionism factor were not fully examined and 2) the relative strengths of mediators or their relationships were unclear in the perfectionism-depressive symptoms model. The purpose of this study is to investigate the integrated model of perfectionism and depressive symptoms through a cognitive, social, and behavioral lens by focusing on the three variables representing each domain: perceived life discrepancy, lack of social belongingness, and self-concealment. 	A total of 346 college students aged from 18 to 34 were recruited from a southeastern university and were used for the current study. The sample was composed of 73.9% female (N = 255), 23.4% male (N = 81), and 2.0% others (N = 7). The sample included 65.3% (non-Hispanic) White (N = 226), 12.1% Hispanic (N = 42), 4.3% (non-Hispanic) Black (N = 15), 2.9% Asian (N = 10), 0.9% Middle Eastern (N = 3), and 13.6% Bi/multiracial (N = 47). The sample consisted of 79.5% of students identified as heterosexual (N = 275), while 15.9% identified as LGBQ (N = 55). The sample also contained 2.3% international students (N = 8) and 20.2% students (N = 70) who identified themselves as a first generation in college. The sample spread from freshman to graduate students (8.4% freshman; 23.4% sophomore, 28.9% junior, 28.9% senior +, and 10.4% graduate). A cross-sectional design was used to test the integrated model of perfectionism and depressive symptoms and estimate path coefficients and mediation effects in the model. This research focused on three research questions: 1) Do three factors of multidimensional perfectionism - perfectionistic strivings, perfectionistic concerns, and narcissistic perfectionism - significantly predict depressive symptoms? 2) Do perceived life discrepancy, lack of social belongingness, and self-concealment mediate the relationship between the three perfectionism factors and depressive symptoms, controlling for other perfectionism factors and GPA (integrated parallel mediation model)? and 3) Does self-concealment additionally mediate the relationship between perceived life discrepancy and depressive symptoms and between lack of social belongingness and depressive symptoms in the parallel mediation model in research question 2 (integrated serial mediation model)? GPA was considered as a covariate to control its consistent relationships with perfectionism and depressive symptoms among college students (Huang, 2015; Madigan, 2019; Sörberg Wallin et al., 2019). 
	Research found that perfectionistic strivings, perfectionistic concerns, and narcissistic perfectionism impacted depressive symptoms separately (research question 1). However, only perfectionistic concerns predicted depressive symptoms when the other perfectionism factors and GPA were controlled for. After the integrated model was established, the model presented several significant parallel and serial mediation effects. Research found that perfectionistic concerns impacted depressive symptoms simultaneously through perceived life discrepancy, lack of social belongingness, and self-concealment in the parallel mediation model, in addition to its direct influence on depressive symptoms. Although perfectionistic strivings and narcissistic perfectionism did not impact depressive symptoms directly, they impacted depressive symptoms through lack of social belongingness. Self-concealment did not mediate the relationship of the two perfectionism factors with depressive symptoms. Perceived life discrepancy did not mediate narcissistic perfectionism and depressive symptoms but showed a tendency to mediate perfectionistic strivings and depressive symptoms (research questions 2). However, with the inclusion of serial mediation effects of self-concealment between the other mediators and depressive symptoms (the serial mediation model), self-concealment did not directly mediate the relationship between perfectionistic concerns and depressive symptoms unlike the result in the parallel mediation model in research question 2. Instead, perfectionistic concerns impacted depressive symptoms through lack of social belongingness and self-concealment in sequence. Narcissistic perfectionism and perfectionistic strivings also showed a tendency to influence depressive symptoms through the path from perfectionism, lack of social belongingness, self-concealment, and depressive symptoms (research question 3). Surprisingly, unlike the other two perfectionism factors, perfectionistic strivings played a unique role in decreasing lack of social belongingness or perceived life discrepancy, which later impacted reducing depressive symptoms under the circumstance where GPA and the other two perfectionism factors were controlled for. Among the three mediators, lack of social belongingness functions as a stronger mediator than the other mediators consistently across perfectionism factors. The study implications and limitations of this study were discussed.  </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Despite efforts, evidence suggests adolescent mental health continues to decline. The CDC’s Youth Risk Behavior Data Summary &amp; Trends Report showed a rise in persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness among adolescents from 2009-2019 (Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021). Similarly, the percentage of adolescents having suicidal ideations, plans, and attempts has also increased (Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021). Adolescents spend a significant amount of time inside a school building, making this environment integral to improving adolescent mental health. According to Jacquelynne Eccles and co-authors (1993), many school environments do not support the developmental needs of adolescents. They hypothesized that a mismatch between adolescent needs and the opportunities to meet said needs in school environments is a cause of negative psychological effects, such as poor mental resilience (Eccles et al., 1993). To address this need, this study explores how informal social spaces in middle schools, i.e., unstructured, non-instructional, and relatively unsupervised spaces, can be designed to better support adolescents’ developmental needs.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Adolescence, the developmental years between childhood and adulthood, is often a difficult time for many. Early adolescence (ages 10-15) is the liminal stage of these developmental years and is marked by the onset of momentous biological, psychological, and social changes (Arain et al., 2013). During this time, adolescents attempt to find their place in society, resulting in an increased need for belonging and autonomy (Wang &amp; Hofkens, 2020). Many middle schools lack the infrastructure and programming to support adolescent needs for exploration and self-management. Further, the lack of interactions and opportunities for building relationships can prevent students from satisfying their increased need for a sense of belonging (Wang &amp; Hofkens, 2020). Informal social spaces, such as libraries, cafeterias, and circulationspaces may be a solution for schools helping adolescents meet their developmental needs since these spaces offer students the opportunity to be themselves and interact with each other freely (Wang &amp; Hofkens, 2020). When intentionally designed, informal social spaces have the potential to increase adolescents’ mental resilience and overall mental health by giving them the opportunity to receive genuine support from one another (Vieno et al., 2007).</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Hundreds of millions of liters of oil and natural gas are introduced to the ocean annually, yet the ecological consequences of hydrocarbon inputs into the marine environment are poorly understood. In particular, the role of microbes in oil and gas consumption in the marine environment is not well characterized.  Much of what is known about hydrocarbon degrading microorganisms, particularly those in the marine environment, stems from cultivation-based studies. However, the majority of microbes elude cultivation, which leads to a significant knowledge gap regarding the degradation capabilities of uncultured, indigenous microbes in the ocean. Multi-omics approaches allow for circumventing the need to culture an organism in the lab to study its physiology and provides a definitive link between taxonomy, function and activity of uncultured hydrocarbon degrading microbes. In this thesis, resolving the identities, metabolic capabilities, and activity of uncultured hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms was done through utilization of new computational methods for multi-omics datasets to analyze metagenomes and metatranscriptomes from the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) water column and global ocean by taking advantage of. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapters two and three were solely focused on microbial hydrocarbon degradation, while chapter four included analysis of both hydrocarbon production and consumption. In chapters two and three, genome assembly, gene annotation, and read mapping was used to elucidate microbial hydrocarbon degradation pathways in the GOM (our datasets) and global ocean (previously existing datasets, such as TARA Ocean). Metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) combined with read mapping revealed that previously unrecognized, uncultured microbes are actively expressing genes and pathways for hydrocarbon degradation. For example, in chapter 2, Planctomycetota, Verrucomicrobiota, and Latescibacterota, clades lacking known methane-oxidizers in the marine environment, were identified as novel, non-canonical methanotrophs in the GOM and in the global ocean. These findings help resolve rate measurement and metatranscriptomic data that showed methane oxidation is an active process in northern GOM hypoxic zone, an ecosystem where canonical methane-oxidizing microbes are at negligible abundances. Similarly, chapter three multi-omics data analysis from the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill deep-sea plume, in which methane was the most abundant hydrocarbon, and from the global ocean revealed non-canonical methanotrophs in the Cycloclasticus. This represents a novel finding as this clade lacks members that are known carry out aerobic methane oxidation. Additional clade specific substrate degradation potentials that have not been reported previously included Bermanella genomes that encoded and expressed genes for medium and long chain n-alkanes and cycloalkane degradation, as did Colwellia, Cycloclasticus, and UBA11654. However, DWH Bermanella encoded an alkane hydroxylase, not an alkane monooxygenase, which is an important finding given that alkane hydroxylase has a narrow substrate range (C8-C16) compared to alkane monooxygenase (alkB) (C12-C26), and is entirely consistent with the profile of Macondo oil where C8-C16 were the most abundant non-gaseous n-alkanes. Lastly, SAR324 and UBA11654 contained members that encoded for aromatic hydrocarbon degradation. While chapters two and three evaluated microbial consumption of fossil fuels input to the marine environment, both naturally and through anthropogenic activities, in what is termed the long-term hydrocarbon cycle, chapter four evaluated the complete cycle of hydrocarbon production to consumption in the photic zone, termed the short-term hydrocarbon cycle. The short-term hydrocarbon cycle was evaluated using metatranscriptomic data from the photic zone of the GOM and previously assembled genomic data from over 8,000 MAGs from OceanDNA (Nishimura and Yoshizawa 2022) and close to 1,000 Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus genomes from the Prochlorococcus Portal. This analysis revealed active pathways for the production of pentadecane (C15) and heptadecane (C17) by Prochlorococcus and, to a lesser degree Synechococcus, co-occurring with active n-alkane degradation, including C15 and C17 alkanes, by microbes in the photic zone of the GOM. Additionally, this active n-alkane degradation pathway was similar to the dominant hydrocarbon degradation pathway in the DWH oil spill plume. Specifically, the complete pathway from alkane degradation via alkane-monooxygenase through fatty acid metabolism was reconstructed for 18 bacterial phyla and one archaeal phylum. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Overall, the findings in this dissertation indicate there is a large, diverse, and active group of microbes with the ability to degrade a spectrum of hydrocarbon substrates. Collectively, these analyses of uncultured planktonic microbes link taxonomy and function and provide an opportunity to predict the microbial response to oil and gas input to the marine environment, thus providing new insights into the fate of oil (and gas) when hydrocarbons are input to the ocean, leading to a greater understanding of the ecological consequences to the marine environment.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Childhood trauma has a pronounced effect on both children who have experienced trauma as well as adults who were exposed to trauma as children (Felitti et al., 1998). This sobering reality is even more pronounced for more vulnerable communities (HHS, 2018), such as people of color, women, individuals who identify as LBGTQ+, and individuals of lower socioeconomic status. Exposure to childhood trauma can result in a whole host of psychological as well as physiological effects Felitti et al., 1998; Giano et al., 2020; Sonu et al., 2020). While there exists research on the stand-alone topics of childhood trauma (e.g., type, proximity, duration; SAMHSA, 2020; Zare, et al., 2018) and collective trauma (i.e., natural disasters, terrorist attacks; Blanchet-Cohen &amp; Nelems, 2013; Chriman et al., 2014) minimal research exists on the subject of COVID-19-related trauma and the combination of pre-pandemic childhood trauma. The following study investigated the relationships between pre-pandemic childhood trauma and COVID-19-related trauma in adults during the pandemic while controlling for general mental health difficulties. Being that the pandemic is ongoing, the specific period examined in the current study was from the onset of the pandemic in early 2020, though when the data was collected in early 2022. The study also sought to explore if resiliency and coping had a moderating effect on the combination of these two types of trauma. A convenience sampling method using Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk; www.MTurk.com) was utilized to recruit 127 adults, all over the age of 18, who had previously been exposed to at least one form of childhood trauma before the onset of the pandemic. The study sought to explore the following research questions: (1) Is childhood trauma related to current COVID-19-related trauma in adults during the pandemic, controlling for general mental health difficulties?, (2) Is childhood trauma related to peak COVID-19-related trauma in adults during the pandemic, controlling for general mental health difficulties?, (3) Do coping and resiliency moderate the relationship between childhood trauma and COVID-19-related trauma, controlling for general mental health difficulties? Assessment measures employed by the study include: Trauma History Questionnaire (THQ; Hooper et al., 2011), COVID Stress Scale (CSS; Taylor et al., 2020), Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21; Lovibond et al., 1995), Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced (Brief COPE; Carver, 1997), and the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS; Smith et al., 2008). A path analysis was utilized to explore the relation between pre-pandemic childhood trauma, COVID-19 distress, coping, and resiliency.
Results from the original research questions were not significant and will be discussed further in the results section. Furthermore, results from the final research question, focusing on whether resiliency and coping moderated the relationship pre-pandemic childhood trauma and COVID-19-related trauma, were inconclusive. Additional findings from the study found that both types of trauma were widespread amongst the research participants. Implications for psychological theory development, clinical practice, and possible directions for future research is discussed.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>A commitment is the “pledging or binding of an individual to behavioral acts” (Kiesler &amp; Sakumura, 1966, p.349). Commitment has been examined across many academic areas such as Psychology (Michael, 2021), Sociology (Kemper, 2012), and Business (Carballo-Penela et al., 2020). For example, in Psychology, commitment refers to a state that predicts one’s behavior and maintains relationships with other people (Michael, 2021). In Sociology, commitment is defined as a contribution to maintaining an ongoing connection with all the relevant social groups from one’s personal history (Kemper, 2012). Also, researchers in the business area explained the commitment to sustainability as an element that has a favorable impact on job seekers’ intentions to seek employment opportunities within the organization (Carballo-Penela et al., 2020). Notably, Commitment has been regarded as an essential element of motivating, persisting, and achieving objectives in sports (Hall, 1993), and has also been studied frequently in the Sport Psychology and Management field (Scanlan et al., 1993, p.1). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A commitment is known to have different types of outcomes. Specifically, many researchers conducted studies on how commitment can influence one’s mental health by applying Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). ACT is “a type of behavior therapy that uses processes such as acceptance, mindfulness, and commitment behaviors to create some flexible psychological processes” (Karimi, &amp; Aghaei, 2018, p.2). Applying the ACT in the educational and psychological contexts reduced the psychological problems (e.g., anxiety, depression, and stress) of students (Karimi, &amp; Aghaei, 2018). Thus, exercisers who used the ACT during aerobics had higher levels of subjective well-being and lower psychological distress (Xu et al., 2021). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Commitment influenced an individual’s mental health, yet, there have been no studies on how different types and levels of Sport Commitment may be associated with one’s mental health among college students. Sport Commitment is one’s psychological state of participating in sports due to the desire or perception of obligation or both (Scanlan et al., 1993). The original Sport Commitment Model (SCM) is a representative framework of Sport Commitment for explaining the persistent involvement in sports and is designed for youth sports. (Scanlan et al., 1993). To apply this model to adult populations, Scanlan et al. (2016) updated the original SCM and described it as a theoretical framework to “examine commitment and explain why athletes involve in their sport continuously” (p. 234), however, several studies applied the model to non-athletes such as recreational players as well (Bum, 2018; Casper &amp; Andrew, 2008; Gabriele et al., 2011; Kang et al., 2020; Ko &amp; Kim, 2021; Wilson et al., 2004).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Even though many studies have focused on the determinant of Sport Commitment, only little research has concentrated on the outcomes of Sport Commitment including mental health outcomes and, further, no studies have investigated the potential association between different profiles of Sport Commitment and mental health outcomes among college students who are not student-athletes. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between two different profiles of Sport Commitment (i.e., Enthusiastic Commitment, Constrained Commitment) and levels of various mental health outcomes (i.e., stress, anxiety, depression, happiness, and psychological well-being) among college students who are not student-athletes in the US.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To fulfill the objective of the present study, this research was designed as cross-sectional research. I recruited 300 participants via Prolific, and the 83 items survey was distributed using Qualtrics. As measurements, I adopted the SCQ-2 (Scanlan et al., 2016), DASS-21 (Lovibond &amp; Lovibond, 1995), OHQ (Hills &amp; Argyle, 2002), PERMA Profiler (Butler &amp; Kern, 2016), BRCS (Sinclair &amp; Wallston, 2004) to assess Enthusiastic Commitment, Constrained Commitment, stress, anxiety, depression, happiness, psychological well-being, and resilient coping. After collecting the data, I conducted the descriptive analysis and Canonical correlation analysis to explore the association between two profiles of Sport Commitment and one’s stress, anxiety, depression, happiness, and psychological well-being.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>As a result, it showed that participants who were enthusiastically committed to sports had high levels of happiness and psychological well-being, and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. In contrast, participants who had a higher level of Constrained Commitment tended to have higher degrees of stress, anxiety, and depression, and lower happiness and psychological well-being. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The present study holds significance both in terms of theoretical and practical implications. It contributes to the theoretical expansion of the SCM by examining the mental health outcomes of two profiles of Sport Commitment among college students who are not student-athletes. Additionally, the results highlight the crucial roles of the university in maximizing the level of Enthusiastic Commitment that lead to enhancing mental health among college students. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>	The research questions addressed in this exploratory survey research were: 1) what is the degree of teachers' morale, and what perceptions do teachers have about their district and school leadership, 2) how does the degree of teachers' morale differ by their background characteristics, and 3) how are teacher perceptions of district and school leadership associated with their sense of morale, controlling for their background characteristics in the Friendship (pseudonym) County School District (FCSD)? While many studies have established the link between school leadership and teacher morale, few studies have explored teachers' sense of morale and relationship with district and school leadership using a districtwide teacher survey in an ethnically diverse and economically disadvantaged district such as the Friendship (pseudonym) County School District (FCSD). 
	Based on a districtwide survey of 123 teachers, I found that the overall degree of teacher morale in the Friendship County School District (FCSD) is high. This study also found that the degree of morale was significantly and negatively associated with the level of stress and health impact, showing that teachers who experience more stress and negative job impacts on their mental and physical health are more likely to report a lower degree of morale.
Another significant finding was that the five dimensions of school leadership and, likewise, five dimensions of district leadership are significantly and positively associated with the degree of morale; thus, teachers who perceive their leadership positively along these five dimensions are more likely to report higher morale. Implications and recommendations for district and school leadership for increasing teacher morale are offered.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to first determine whether a librarian’s years of experience positively correlated with their literacy knowledge and efficacy, and to second determine whether structured exposure to specific and targeted education of evidence-based strategies for literacy could enable librarians to improve their knowledge of the tenants of literacy and early language development. 10 librarians from a North Florida Public Library System were surveyed prior to and upon completion of an 8-week professional training course targeting evidence-based strategies for language and literacy development. The pre-training survey, consisting of 7 demographic, 25 knowledge, and 15 efficacy questions, intended to serve as a baseline of the librarians’ knowledge of general language components, acquisition, and development, as well as their level of confidence in employing their knowledge to promote early language and literacy development (efficacy). The post-training survey consisted of the same knowledge and efficacy questions with the addition of 5 free-response questions. Data were collected on the pre- and post-knowledge and efficacy responses. All participants demonstrated an increase in the number of correct knowledge responses and increased efficacy ratings from pre-training to post-training. Additionally, years of experience was found to positively correlate with the librarians’ efficacy ratings pre-training. However, years of experience was observed to have a mild negative correlation with pre-training knowledge. Implications of this study suggest that although exposure to structured training for language and literacy may be helpful in improving knowledge and efficacy in youth service librarians, years of experience in the role does not guarantee that veteran librarians will possess more knowledge than those newer to the field. A wider scope of training and content is needed to ensure strong foundations of knowledge.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Nucleic acid delivery is crucial for several biomedical applications, including tissue engineering, medical implant coatings, cancer treatment and regenerative medicine. Localized delivery of nucleic acids through biomaterial substrates can overcome several difficulties associated with common systemic delivery and maintain high vector concentrations at the target site to enable increased transfection efficiency. In this project, we aim to develop substrate-based nucleic acid delivery coatings that can provide extended and localized release of non-viral gene delivery vectors for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications. In vitro studies are conducted to characterize the absorption and release interactions between surface coatings made of the bio-inspired and naturally derived polymers, including polydopamine (pDA), hyaluronic acid (HA), glycol chitosan (GC), and their combinations, and a model polymeric gene delivery vector composed of polyethyleneimine (PEI). PEI-DNA polyplexes N/P ratio was observed to have a statistically significant impact on the amount of DNA loaded onto each coating, while the surface coating type and concentration were surprisingly found to have no statistically significant effects. Surface-based transfection as well as bolus transfection from these coatings are studied over time for NIH3T3 and HEK293 cells. Surface-based transfection efficiencies were significantly impacted by the coating types and polyplex N/P ratios for transfection on HEK293 cells. However, for transfection on NIH3T3 cells only coating type had a significant impact on the transfection efficiencies. In conclusion, this study adds to our understanding of how different biocompatible materials interact with nucleic acid delivery polyplexes, which aids in the creation of surface coatings that facilitate effective localized nucleic acid delivery for tissue engineering and biomedical implant applications.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Until the past few decades, criminological research has almost exclusively focused on examining the link between various environmental risk factors and criminal behavior. Since then, an emerging body of research has developed exploring the association between different antisocial traits and offending. The culmination of this research has revealed personality constructs such as low self-control, impulsiveness, aggressiveness, sensation seeking, and Machiavellianism, among others to be positively associated with greater criminal behaviors. However, this area of research, also known as propensity-based studies of offending, remains incomplete. The criminological literature has largely overlooked the potential explanatory power of callous-unemotional traits when attempting to identify the diverse factors that predict assorted offending patterns, including chronic levels of offending. To be certain, research in developmental psychology has linked these traits to a host of negative life outcomes typically found within criminological studies, including offending. And yet, research in the developmental literature has yet to uncover why, and under what conditions, this link exists as well as how this association changes based on the variant of callous-unemotional traits being examined. Likewise, research examining the etiology of callous-unemotional traits has many gaps in the literature particularly concerning male-female differences as well as discerning what environmental risk factors explain such development. This dissertation will address these gaps in the literature by examining potential pathways to the development of both variants of callous-unemotional traits as well as associations between the variants and various offending measures (i.e., general, nonviolent, violent, life-course-persistent offending, and illicit drug use). The results revealed that the etiology of both variants of callous-unemotional traits is dependent upon the sex of the individual. Additionally, the environmental factors that predicted callous-unemotional traits were different based on the variant being investigated. The models examining the callous-unemotional traits-crime link likewise found that the association differed based on the variant as well as the sex of the individual. The results of these analyses also find support for the link being nonlinear and partially due to a shared genetic etiology. The implications of these findings are discussed in reference to policy, theory, and future research.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Throughout the literature, there is a well-documented discrepancy between rating of children’s behaviors across different informants, typically parents and teachers. Many different theories have been investigated to address the root of these discrepancies. Previous studies have examined if these discrepancies are the result of informant interacting with the child across different contexts, teacher expertise in typical childhood behaviors, parent mental health and stress, and the quality of the rating forms. The current study sought to investigate such discrepancies in a meta-analytic framework in which eleven different informant pairs were examined rating eight different behaviors categories. It was hypothesized that the informant pairs that interacted with the children in similar contexts, such as Parent-Parent and Teacher-Teacher informant pairs, would demonstrate more similar ratings. This hypothesis was supported. It was also hypothesized that there would be more agreement on more observable behaviors, such as externalizing behaviors. This hypothesis was not supported. It is important to be able to understand when such rating discrepancies occur, because the ability to anticipate such rating discrepancies can be used in both clinical and empirical research.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The warm core structure of a tropical cyclone (TC) has been previously analyzed through aircraft observations, dropsondes, satellite-borne Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) data, and numerical simulations. It has been shown that aircraft that fly through a TC collect data that represent the warm core of a TC well; however, it has been theorized that microwave and satellite data struggle to resolve and represent the warm core structure throughout the entire center of the TC because of the coarseness of the satellite observations. Numerical simulations have been utilized to study the height of the warm core with a maximum around 4-8 km and have found that the height is nearly constant with varying intensities (Stern and Nolan 2012). This study aims to analyze the warm core structure of a TC through reanalysis datasets (ERA5, ERA-Interim, MERRA2), as these datasets are the only ones outside of aircraft and observations, that can provide long duration data of 3-D and 4-D structure. ERA5 has the finest resolution of the three datasets that are analyzed with MERRA2, and ERA-Interim increasingly coarse. The average temperature anomaly with respect to the whole basin from the zonal mean in all basins is about +4-9K in ERA5, +3-6K in ERA-Interim, and +4-8K in MERRA2 with the West Pacific basin having the highest magnitudes of average temperature anomalies. ERA5 typically sees the highest magnitude in terms of maximum average temperature anomaly while ERA-Interim sees the lowest values in all basins, in addition to most of the datasets showing tropical storms being statistically significantly cooler than all other intensities. The height of the warm core, described here as pressure, was subjectively analyzed through the geopotential height anomalies, and was found to be nearly constant with increasing intensity around 350-400 hPa, with the West Pacific having the highest warm core around 300 hPa. These results suggest that the strength of the warm core varies within each basin and within different reanalysis datasets. The resolution of the datasets carries a large role in how well the warm core is represented, however, the strength is comparable to prior works. The height of the warm core in this study showed to be more constant with differing intensities which is different than what was found in previous works where the height of the warm core increased with intensity.    </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>LGBTQ+ students exist on college campuses in greater numbers than ever before. Campus culture directly impacts how LGBTQ+ students experience college and contributes to their overall sense of belonging. Campus culture in turn is shaped by students’ access to resources and the effectiveness of those resources. Students’ experiences, for better or for worse, are shaped by the programming they have access to and the environment the college fosters through these programs. This dissertation in practice examines the relationship between LGBTQ+ students on Emerson College’s campus and the resources they use. 	Utilizing an exploratory case study methodology including focus groups and campus observations, this research examines the following questions: What are the experiences of Emerson’s LGBTQ+ students? How do Emerson’s LGBTQ+ programs and policies meet the needs of LGBTQ+ students on campus? In what ways do Emerson’s efforts enhance LGBTQ+ students’ feelings of belonging?
	This study found that many organizations and campus spaces operate as queer by default due to the orientation of their members, shaping the way that students experience campus culture. As such, other motivators such as race, ethnicity, and background prior to coming to college influence the connections students seek on campus moreso than their LGBTQ+ identity. This study also found that LGBTQ+ students experienced belonging in both LGBTQ+ campus activities and non-LGBTQ+ campus activities, although students do feel a need for more specific LGBTQ+ programming reflective of community struggles. Lastly, findings indicated that students felt that administration and faculty have a major impact on the sense of belonging present on campus as well as the LGBTQ+ offerings of the college, and there is a need for both groups to better their efforts as students feel they are earnest but misguided. 
	The findings of this study revealed multiple implications for practice. Most of all, sense of belonging on campus for LGBTQ+ students encompasses many components, all directly related to their base need for connection. This means their sense of community cannot be pinpointed on any one item being present, but rather on multiple factors that create genuine relationships with others. LGBTQ+ students on Emerson’s campus experience that definition in unique ways unique to Emerson’s campus environment – perhaps most significantly, their sense of belonging being influenced greatly by being in the majority and attending a campus where they are able to interact with other LGBTQ+ students in a variety of settings, not just in specific organizations that cater to that population. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have significantly contributed to the identification of genetic variants by leveraging thousands of loci associated with complex traits and diseases, leading to breakthroughs in human genetics research. However, interpretation of these results is often difficult as the GWAS-identified variants (single-nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]) often have small effect estimates on target traits, limiting their direct application to disease research. Methods such as polygenic risk score analysis have been presented to enhance disease risk prediction, however, the clinical utility of these methods are controversial. Similarly, the identification of genes associated with likely causal SNPs is unclear as identified SNPs explain only a small portion of heritability. Genetic regulations of GWAS findings are often characterized using statistical methods such as transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), but these methods tend to ignore functional mechanisms that play critical roles in gene-regulatory pathways, resulting in loss of predictive power.In this essay we present three integrative methodologies for improving disease risk prediction as well as identifying likely causal genes through incorporation of omics level data and GWAS results for complex traits. First, we propose an integrated PRS method that leverages multiple PRS methods, as well as multiple GWAS datasets, to improve coronary artery disease (CAD) risk prediction over clinically used prediction models (PCE). Our results indicate that our proposed method improves model discrimination for incident CAD cases over the PCE model while also improving risk reclassification in European populations. Second, we propose a Cauchy integrative model that aggregates gene expression levels, DNA methylation, and splicing event information to increase identification of likely causal genes in 24 GWAS complex trait datasets. Additionally, we extend our method to identify causal genes for lung adenocarcinoma risk. Finally, we implement our Cauchy integrative model to identify likely causal omics biomarkers for CAD and propose a penalized regression framework integrative PRS model to improve risk prediction in an African population when limited to a European GWAS and reference panel.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Over the last three decades, traffic crashes have been one of the leading causes of fatalities and economic losses in the world. Since vulnerable road users have specific characteristics, they are perceived to have a higher risk of being involved in fatal road crashes. Therefore, it is essential to focus on mitigating the vulnerabilities of roadway users as well as investigating the key causes of crashes in order to achieve the desired level of roadway safety. It is imperative that we understand the specific needs of vulnerable roadway users and their involvement in crashes in order to address their unique challenges, determine the underlying factors contributing to their vulnerability, and develop targeted interventions and policies that can contribute to improving their safety. The level of vulnerability among roadway users depends on a variety of factors, including their age, level of protection, surrounding characteristics, situational conditions, and the presence of extreme events such as disasters. The majority of vulnerabilities cannot be attributed to the negligence of roadway users, since they are primarily determined by an individual's intrinsic physical characteristics and the conditions imposed by particular circumstances. Therefore, this dissertation provided comprehensive insights into helping vulnerable roadway users by examining them from four distinct perspectives: (a) exploring young-driver-involved crashes to understand vulnerability based on age, (b) investigating pedestrian vulnerability due to their lack of protection, (c) examining the challenges faced by drivers experiencing daytime sun glare-induced temporary visual impairment to assess vulnerability in relation to surrounding circumstances, and (d) analyzing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the entire society to comprehend vulnerability in the context of a disaster situation.The purpose of the dissertation is to examine the spatial patterns of vulnerable-involved crashes in order to identify those locations that pose high risk to them. Furthermore, we develop several robust statistical models according to the type of dependent variables for each group of vulnerable road users. Based on an in-depth regression analysis, we are able to predict crash likelihood and provide clear guidelines for the development of plans, policies, and effective safety countermeasures. In order to accomplish the objective of the study, we introduce a Geographic Information System (GIS)-based methodology to analyze the spatial crash patterns associated with each crash type in terms of focused vulnerability. This is followed by a more detailed examination of selected counties of Florida using both planar Euclidean Distance (ED) and Roadway Network Distance (RND)-based Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). According to the GIS maps developed in this dissertation, there are differences in spatial patterns between vulnerable roadway users involved in crashes. 
In conclusion, this dissertation proposes a number of novel methodological approaches in order to address the following objectives:
•	An investigation of contributing factors influencing crashes caused by vulnerable youth drivers (aged 16-24) and assessment of the correlation between intersection presence near university campuses and likelihood of these crashes,
•	An assessment of the spatial correlation and impact of the network-based distance between locations of vulnerable pedestrian-involved crashes and the centroid of associated land use of various types,
•	An assessment of the adverse effects of daytime sun glare on driving performance and evaluation of the potential actions taken by vulnerable drivers under the direct influence of temporary blindness caused by sun glare,
•	A spatial-temporal investigation of the crash density pattern during the COVID-19 pandemic, assuming all individuals to be vulnerable roadway users, in accordance with the specific socio-demographic features of the study area.
Findings clearly show that intersections near university areas pose a significant problem for youth drivers. Moreover, the part of this study focusing on pedestrians as another vulnerable roadway user reveal that pedestrian-involved crashes were more likely to occur near retail stores and nightclubs. Additionally, daylight has an effect regardless of the type of surrounding land use on the severity of pedestrian-related crashes. This dissertation also investigates the temporary visual impairment caused by sun glare during the daytime as well as the likelihood of potential actions performed by drivers experiencing this adverse circumstance. Furthermore, the results obtained from the investigation of crashes caused by vulnerable drivers exposed to daytime sun glare indicate that the majority of observed actions, particularly on local roadways, involve in the violation of stop signs and red lights. In addition, drivers tend to follow too closely in high-traffic areas when their vision is impaired by sun glare. Moreover, a non-parametric method (Kruskal-Wallis) confirms that there is a significant difference in crash densities during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic period in different counties irrespective of their sociodemographic differences. Finally, the findings indicate that the presence of young populations (e.g., college students) in Leon County is highly correlated with the decline in the number of crashes during COVID-19.
In summary, the results of this dissertation can be utilized by transportation agencies to pinpoint high-risk locations which have a higher likelihood of vulnerable population-involved crashes and to develop more reliable plans targeting the vulnerable population and their special needs. The implementation of safety countermeasures is essential to improving the safety of vulnerable road users. Education campaigns emphasizing defensive driving skills and risk awareness, for example, may be effective in preventing young drivers from engaging in risky driving. Additionally, implementing cutting-edge Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) technologies and offering alternative routes to avoid sun glare may improve driving performance and reduce the number of crashes caused by drivers experiencing daytime sun glare. A pedestrian-friendly environment, which includes crosswalks, adequate lighting, clear signage, and well-maintained sidewalks, also contributes to pedestrian safety. Lastly, promoting alternative remote options for E-learning, e-shopping, teleconsultations, and teleconferencing can reduce the number of trips generated during the COVID-19 pandemic and reduce the risk associated with increased vulnerability while maintaining road safety for all users in the region affected by the pandemic.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The recent reforms in science education envision engaging students in authentic practices of science and habits of mind (NRC, 2012); in other words, engaging students in doing science. Science is a multidimensional endeavor (Davidson, Jaber, &amp; Southerland, 2020; Pickering, 1995). The work of the scientists include various aspects-- conceptual (kinds of knowledge such as facts, laws, theories), epistemological (ways of thinking and understanding such as how to construct and evaluate scientific knowledge), social (social norms and collaborations), and affective (emotional experiences- the joy of a successful experiment or frustration over a failed one). With science being a multidimensional endeavor, there is a need to view and understand students’ disciplinary engagement in science as a multidimensional endeavor as well. Using a qualitative, naturalistic, case study research design, this dissertation generates an in-depth, multi-faceted understanding of the dynamics of students’ disciplinary engagement in science classrooms by focusing on a single instance of disciplinary engagement of a group of four students in a middle school science classroom, examined from three different lenses. The main data sources for the three investigations in this dissertation are the audio and video recordings of classroom engagement and student interviews from a two-day long lesson–Mechanisms of Evolution–in a middle school science classroom. Additional data sources include student artifacts such as lab reports and claim-evidence-reasoning posters. The main analytical tool used throughout this study was multimodal discourse analysis that allowed for a focus both on the verbal and non-verbal cues to make inferences about the conceptual, epistemological, social, and affective engagement of students in small groups. 
In the first investigation, we examine the entanglement of the conceptual, epistemological, social, and affective dynamics that emerge in a small group as students encounter conceptual uncertainties arising from examining ambiguous data in science. Our findings from the first investigation demonstrated the ways in which students engaged in the epistemic work of science–analyzing data, generating claims, evaluating alternative claims, and challenging each other in service of developing a mechanistic reasoning for the scientific phenomenon. However, these findings also portray how overwhelming social and affective experiences along with persistent conceptual and epistemological conflicts have the potential to undermine the rich epistemic work of students. 
While the first investigation examines the dynamics of engagement of the whole group,  the second investigation in this dissertation explores the shifts in discourse moves of a single student in that group with evolving argumentation goals and the influence of the shifting discourse moves on shaping opportunities for  disciplinary sensemaking in a small group. Our findings from the second investigation demonstrated that as the local task goals (i.e., students’ understanding of what is required or what needs to be done at a particular moment) evolve, similarly phrased discourse moves can have different effects on students’ sensemaking opportunities. In other words, depending on the local task goals, the same phrase can be used dialogically or rhetorically, by the same student, resulting in opening up or closing off spaces for sensemaking. 
Complementing the first two investigations that examine the student engagement from the researchers’ perspective, the final investigation in this dissertation centers student voices of their experiences in the lesson. Our findings from the third investigation highlight the differential experiences of students working in the same group when engaging with uncertainty and demonstrate how these four students experienced the same episode in different ways. Too, their perspectives allowed us to understand how their past experiences with one another in the classroom influenced the ways in which they experienced this episode.  The differential experiences highlighted in the student reflections provide further insights into students’ disciplinary engagement in science. 
Our findings from the three investigations considered together suggests that students’ disciplinary engagement in science is not simple and straightforward. Rather, it is “messy” and multidimensional, with students managing both the epistemic and relational (i.e., pertaining to the collaborative work) aspects of science. The case analyzed in this dissertation presents a unique view of how students engaged in rich disciplinary work of science can become overwhelmed with the entanglement of dynamics along the multiple dimensions eventually undermining the epistemic work of the students. This study contributes to the growing body of literature examining the multidimensional nature of students’ disciplinary engagement, students’ negotiations of conflicts and tensions that arise during that engagement, and influential discursive moves that support and sustain disciplinary engagement. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Inland aquatic systems such as lakes, rivers, and wetlands are pivotal in cycling carbon between the landscape and the atmosphere. However, as global air temperatures increase and precipitation patterns continue to change, their roles as net carbon sources or sinks will become uncertain. New carbon sources will become available to aquatic systems in regions such as the permafrost zone in the northern high latitudes or in temperate forested wetlands where increased precipitation connects waterbodies to upland catchments. In dryer regions, the water residence time of aquatic systems will increase, restricting the inputs of organic carbon from the surrounding landscape, but also amplifying its internal production and degradation. This dissertation aims to investigate the sources and molecular properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) across northern high-latitude lakes and temperate North American wetlands and to consider its potential role in the carbon cycle as these regions continue to experience changes in temperature and precipitation. Using a combined approach of Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS), optical and fluorescence spectroscopy, and mediated electrochemical oxidation and reduction, molecular-level DOM composition was revealed and related to large-scale climate and physiographic variables. Specifically, the goals of this dissertation were to characterize DOM in lakes spanning the Western North American Arctic with respect to differences in seasonality and climate (Chapter 2) as well as hydrology and landscape characteristics (Chapter 3). Using these findings, a quantitative relationship between molecular level-composition and bulk electrochemical DOM properties was also assessed (Chapter 4). Finally, DOM properties were surveyed across various wetland types across temperate North American regions and further examined between surface waters and porewaters as well as during different annual hydroperiods (Chapter 5). 
DOM composition and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations varied seasonally across Alaskan Tundra lakes. DOC concentrations were significantly higher in the winter months than in the summer due to ice exclusion concentrating solutes while DOM contained unique signatures indicative of extensive microbial processing. DOM properties also varied spatially in this region with shallower lakes and lakes closer to the northern coast generally containing more aromatic DOM. Expanding this study region further south across boreal ecosystems revealed that DOM aromaticity increased northward as forests transitioned into shrublands and permafrost coverage became continuous. Many lakes across the Western North American Arctic were primarily composed of autochthonous, or internally produced, DOM rather than DOM originating from the landscape. These differences were mainly driven by landscape connectivity where more hydrologically isolated lakes had higher DOC concentrations but less terrestrial DOM than lakes that were hydrologically connected to the landscape. In contrast, DOM from the hydrologically connected lakes had greater electron accepting and donating capacity, likely originating from the surrounding continuous permafrost soils. Furthermore, DOM electrochemical properties correlated positively with bulk aromaticity and negatively with protein-like fluorescence and aliphaticity, allowing for the development of the Reducing Index which quantified DOM electrochemical properties using FT-ICR MS parameters. Finally, temperate North American wetlands had higher DOC concentrations and greater DOM aromaticity than other inland waters such as lakes and rivers. However, these compositional differences were primarily driven by geographical sampling region rather than sampling depth or hydroperiod and possibly related to soil content and vegetation. Using FT-ICR MS, 3,489 molecular formulae were found across all sites and persisted in both wet and dry hydroperiods, representing the signature of wetland DOM. Many of these molecular signatures were also found in the world’s largest arctic rivers, highlighting the role of wetlands in transporting terrestrial organic matter to coastal systems. These studies demonstrate the diversity of aquatic DOM composition and DOC concentrations across expansive regions as related to hydrology and physiographic properties and allows for future work to draw comparisons to similar regions and assess their role in a changing carbon cycle.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In the spring of 1959, thousands of Tibetans fled China, crossing the border into Nepal. They were following the Dalai Lama into exile after years of living under an oppressive regime in Chinese-occupied Tibet. In the decades that followed, tens of thousands of Tibetans would leave their homeland, searching for a better life abroad. As Tibetans found new homes around the world, many stayed close to their homeland, seeking refuge and new opportunities in Nepal. One of the opportunities they were seeking was access to quality education. A generation later, Tibetans born in exile are still seeking the opportunity to become educated. Through in-depth interviews, participant observations, and an examination of artifacts, this study aims to explore how Tibetan refugees in Nepal construct their identities as educated persons through their experiences with differing systems of education, including formalized secular, monastic, and a hybrid of formal and monastic education. Additionally, it seeks to investigate how Tibetans perform their roles as educated persons within the refugee community in Kathmandu. By analyzing their experiences and perspectives, I seek to understand how Tibetan refugees have formulated their identities through their educational experiences, sociocultural contexts, and historical events, as well as how they perform and make sense of their identities as educated persons in the refugee community in Kathmandu.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Considering the broad context that there is a growing number of international students seeking English teacher education in the Western TEOSL programs and the majority of them will eventuallygo back to their own countries to teach, these international TESOL trainees face the challenge of
integrating two different language education systems. Although the social justice movements have
pushed the TESOL field to be more inclusive and empowering, there still seems to be a need for more
focus on how English teachers as the actors of language teaching and learning make sense of their
living experiences and identity formations. Language teaching and learning should be conceptualized as a contextual-specific process shaped by both language teachers’ identities and sociocultural
factors. Grounded in the sociocultural framework, this study utilizes qualitative narrative inquiry
to explore the experiences and identity development of US-TESOL-trained English teachers from
China in terms of their language teaching and learning background, US-TESOL training as well as
the knowledge transfer process from the US to China. The participants’ narratives are collected
through individual interviews, focus group interviews and artifacts. The findings illuminate the
complexity and dynamics of language teachers’ identity reconstructions in the context of international mobility. Overall, this study highlights the multidimensionality of teacher identity and
motivations, the hybridity of teacher agency, transformation and growth in US-TESOL training,
and the unevenness of knowledge transfer and translation.

            <DISS_para>Health and wellness are the cornerstones of life. Unfortunately, even with the COVID-19 pandemic still fresh in our minds people are not consistently pursuing health activities that can bolster health and wellness. In our study, we concentrate on utilizing the health and wellness mobile technology (HWMT) to help people establish healthy lifestyle habits. Using integrative preventive medicine as a backdrop, we contextualized Hull’s (1943) stimulus-response-reinforcement (SRR) theoretical framework to explore the habit formation mechanism. Results of an empirical online survey (n = 696) validated our hypotheses. The stimulus (i.e., health and wellness self-improvement) positively influences the physical health goal. In turn, the physical health goal influences the two-stage response (i.e., stickiness and engagement). Engagement brings individuals positive feelings as the reinforcer (i.e., subjective vitality and sense of accomplishment) that lead to HWMT exploitation and health and wellness related habit formation. The theoretical and practical implications of the study are provided. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This treatise presents a comparative study of selected works of Chen Yi and Andrea Clearfield, exploring their incorporation of Tibetan idioms in their compositions. The motivation for this study stems from the contrasting backgrounds of the two composers and their unique perspectives on music creation. The treatise begins with an overview of the background and motivation, followed by a brief introduction to Tibetan music. The subsequent chapters delve into the compositions of Chen Yi and Andrea Clearfield, analyzing their respective works and examining how they incorporate Tibetan elements. Chen Yi's compositions, namely Tibetan Tunes and China West Suite, are analyzed in Chapter Four, while Clearfield's works, Earth Door/Sky Door and Tse Go La Choral Suite, are examined in Chapter Five. Throughout the study, particular attention is given to the utilization of instruments and traditional Asian pentatonic modes in composing pieces inspired by Tibetan genres and the role of the piano in their compositions. By addressing these research questions, this comparative study offers insights into the specific Tibetan elements employed by both composers, taking into account their diverse cultural backgrounds and experiences. The treatise concludes by summarizing the findings and emphasizing the significance of their contributions to the representation and preservation of Tibetan music within the realm of Western classical compositions.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Speech- language pathologists (SLPs) require up-to-date, evidence-based research to inform their treatment decisions. Current literature on clinical recommendations lacks ecological validity, meaning they do not reflect the realistic environment in which speech sound disorders are treated. This discrepancy impacts the validity of treatment practices in speech sound disorders (SSDs) for both children with SSD in isolation as well as children with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). Using the experience sampling method, we queried school-based speech language pathologists in two data collection periods for both populations (n=106, n=50) three times per day for five days regarding the dynamics of their speech sound therapy sessions. This investigation, specifically, examined target selection for both students with SSD in isolation and IDD populations. Our results indicate that /ɹ/ was the most commonly targeted speech sound in the SSD in isolation population, and /s/ was the most commonly targeted speech sound in the IDD and SSD population.  </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this thesis, we will provide a Finslerian point of view on several objects of classical informationgeometry. Therefore we will generalize the Fisher-Rao metric to a family of Finsler metrics which
we denote by ??-Fisher-Rao metrics. Generalizing a construction of Khesin et al. we construct a
simplifying transformations, that allows us to derive an explicit formula for geodesics on Dens(? )
and that reduces the geodesic problem on Prob(? ) to finding geodesics on an ??-sphere. We then
show that the Amari-Chentsov connection on the space of all positive densities can be interpreted as
the Chern connection of the ??-Fisher-Rao metric and we also show that this equivalence does not
hold on the space of probability densities. For the space of densities we can use this correspondence
to calculate the flag curvatures of the ??-Fisher-Rao metric and show that they are identically zero.
Next if we restrict ourselves to the case of manifolds of dimension one, we can provide a new
geometric interpretation of the non-periodic Proudman–Johnson equations as geodesic equations
of the right invariant homogeneous ? 1,?-Finsler metrics on the diffeomorphism group. We then
show that in the non-periodic case two families of equations, the generalized inviscid Proudman–
Johnson equation, and the ?-Hunter–Saxton equation (recently introduced by Cotter et al.) coincide
for a certain range of parameters. Generalizing a construction of Lenells for the Hunter–Saxton
equation [57], we analyze these equations using an isometry from the diffeomorphism group to
an appropriate subset of real-valued functions. Thereby we show that the periodic case of the
?-Hunter-Saxton equations is equivalent to the geodesic equations on the ??-sphere in the space
of functions, and the non-periodic case for both the ?-Hunter-Saxton and the inviscid Proudman–
Johnson equations is equivalent to a geodesic flow on a flat space. This allows us to give explicit
solutions to these equations in the non-periodic case, and answer several questions of Cotter et
al. regarding their limiting behavior. Finally we derive the geodesic equation of a right invariant
Orlicz norm on the diffeomorphism group Diff(?1).</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation seeks to make a valuable contribution to the fields of public policy and American politics by introducing novel theoretical and empirical insights via the study of the politics of climate change. Climate change represents a daunting challenge for societies across the world, but in no other major country are political parties more polarized  on this issue than in the United States. This dissertation takes a dynamic approach to study the interplay between public attitudes on climate change and positions the parties adopt. This dissertation’s primary goal is to provide a more theoretically motivated and comprehensive look at the endogenous relationship between public opinion and party agendas. 	Recent work in political science and other social sciences researching climate change has primarily used either cross-sectional data to study climate sorting or experiments on top-down forms of opinion change according to which elite cues impact opinions and then inferring the causes of sorting. Yet not enough work looks at the role of bottom-up processes such as how a party’s climate change policies impact voter support for the party and its candidates, let alone empirically compare the contributions of both processes to overall rates of sorting. This dissertation addresses these limitations in prior literature by utilizing a wealth of cross-sectional and panel survey data to understand climate change and environment opinion over time, as well a novel survey experiment to understand whether and how voters hold parties accountable for not supporting climate change action. 
	The contributions described above result in a richer and more complete scientific foundation for studying essential policy considerations in the modern world. This dissertation offers the first direct examination of the interplay between public attitudes and political parties and contributes to a clearer yet more dynamic understanding of climate politics.

            <DISS_para>Ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) is a special type of concrete with high compressive and tensile strength, high durability, and a dense microstructure that results in improved mechanical and durability properties. However, due to the high cement content typically used in UHPC, the carbon footprint of UHPC is generally very high. On the other hand, limestone calcined clay cement (LC3) is a more environmentally friendly alternative to ordinary Portland cement (OPC) with lower carbon emissions during production. Previous research has explored LC3 replacing up to 50% of OPC content in normal strength concrete, which contributes to significant reduction of carbon footprint. The use of LC3 binder in UHPC material though has not been widely explored. This thesis research presents a feasibility study on the development of UHPC with sustainable LC3 binders. Up to 30% of OPC replacement with LC3 binder in non-proprietary UHPC mixtures was investigated; the workability, compressive and tensile properties of the resultant UHPC mixtures were experimentally characterized to determine the influence of LC3 on UHPC.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Allatoona fault is an internal, out-of-sequence thrust fault in the southernmost Appalachian hinterland, extending &gt;280 km. Along the fault’s nearly linear trace it cuts obliquely through Blue Ridge tectonostratigraphy, metamorphic isograds, earlier thrusts, and Pennsylvanian regional cross antiforms; making it the youngest fault in the kinematic sequence of events along the west flank of the Appalachian orogen. In the central segment of the fault, between Hightower, Alabama and Dahlonega, Georgia, the Allatoona fault marks the western/eastern Blue Ridge province boundary, and south of Hightower the Allatoona fault becomes an internal eastern Blue Ridge structure. Just north of Buchannon, Georgia, the Mulberry Rock window (a ~20 km-long breached eyelid window) allows a 3-D view into the structural architecture, kinematics, and trajectories of the regional thrusts. From here, northeast to Dawsonville, Georgia, it carries the Dahlonega Gold belt in its immediate hanging wall, with older faults (Burnt Hickory Ridge and Chattahoochee) carried passively piggyback above the gold belt. The extension of this fault northeast of Dawsonville has inspired controversy for years. However, recent mapping around the complex triple junction between the western, central, and eastern Blue Ridge provinces west of Dahlonega, Georgia has revealed new evidence supporting the continuation of the Allatoona fault northeast of this intersection. For instance, between Dawsonville and Dahlonega, internal Dahlonega Gold belt stratigraphy maintains its northeast-trend, and the Allatoona fault cuts both the structurally underlying “ancestral Allatoona” fault carrying rocks correlated with the Otto Formation, and the Etowah River fault at the base of the Sally Free Mafic Complex. Both the “ancestral Allatoona” fault and the Etowah River fault are folded by the overturned NW-SE Sally Free synform, and this fold in turn is decapitated by the Allatoona fault. Although previous studies suggested that the Hayesville-Soque River fault to the northwest postdated the Allatoona fault, the regional Jasper antiform folds the Great Smoky thrust, the Murphy synclinorium, the “ancestral Allatoona” fault, and the Hayesville-Soque River fault, but is decapitated by the Allatoona fault north of Dawsonville. Although the Canton and Univeter Formations of the Dahlonega Gold belt were displaced 10’s of km northwest along the Allatoona fault and extend &gt;110 km from type sections near Canton to at least Lake Burton, Georgia, previous interpretations have placed the Dahlonega Gold belt in the immediate footwall of the northwest-dipping Hayesville-Soque River fault, with the Allatoona fault apparently being cut by this fault approximately 12 km north of Dawsonville. Mapping efforts for this study, around the complex junction between the western, central, and eastern Blue Ridge provinces, have revealed new evidence that supports the continuation of the Allatoona fault north of this intersection. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>INTRODUCTION: Obesity is associated with increased cardiometabolic disease risk, although the vascular and metabolic features of obesity are often studied independently. Resistance to both insulin-mediated suppression of lipolysis and increases in microvascular blood flow are important risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases. Emerging evidence points to heightened NADPH oxidase (Nox) activity as a critical feature of reduced vascular and metabolic function. Overproduction of Nox-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a major source of microvascular dysfunction in obesity and increased adipose tissue Nox activity is a main determinant of insulin resistance. In addition, Nox-derived ROS is an important component of increased lipolysis; however, the mechanisms by which Nox regulates lipolysis are unknown. In addition, the mechanistic basis for Nox in the intricate relationship between insulin control of vascular and metabolic responses is not well described. PURPOSE: The overall objective of this study was to investigate whether increased Nox-derived ROS production impairs blood glucose profiles by reducing insulin-mediated suppression of lipolysis. METHODS: Sixteen sedentary, non-obese, otherwise healthy males and females (males = 1, females = 15; age: 21.7 ± 5 years; body mass index: 22.7 ± 4 kg/m2) participated in this study. Participants completed three study visits, each after a ten-hour overnight fast. During the first study visit, anthropometric assessments were completed, as well as measurement of fasting blood glucose and blood pressure. During the second study visit, assessments of body composition (via dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, DXA) and maximal aerobic capacity (VO2peak) were completed. The final study visit was the main experimental visit, where participants underwent microdialysis and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic procedures to monitor local adipose tissue (total and Nox-dependent) ROS production and lipolysis (measured as dialysate glycerol) under basal as well as hyperinsulinemic conditions. Total dialysate H2O2 concentrations, including dismutated superoxide, were detected via perfusion of Amplex UltraRed reagent, horseradish peroxidase and superoxide dismutase through microdialysis probes. Further, microdialysis probes were perfused with either isoproterenol (β-adrenergic agonist) or atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) to stimulate lipolysis through independent signaling pathways, then additionally perfused with apocynin (Nox inhibitor) to determine the contributions of Nox to lipolysis. RESULTS: Upon perfusion of apocynin, the dialysate concentrations of H2O2 decreased in the control (without apocynin: 1.17 ± 0.5 M, with apocynin: 0.66 ± 0.2 M; p = 0.003) and isoproterenol probes (without apocynin: 1.09 ± 0.6 M, with apocynin: 0.68 ± 0.3 M; p = 0.03). Isoproterenol and ANP perfusion significantly increased dialysate glycerol concentrations compared to the control probe (control: 56.0 ± 21.9, isoproterenol: 125.6 ± 59.8, ANP: 130.9 ± 47.7 mol/L; p &lt; 0.0001). However, apocynin perfusion had no effect on dialysate glycerol concentrations in the control (p = 0.99), isoproterenol (p = 0.99) or ANP (p = 0.59) probes in the basal state. During the clamp, apocynin perfusion decreased dialysate H2O2 concentrations in control (without apocynin: 1.3 ± 0.6 M, with apocynin: 0.79 ± 0.3 M; p = 0.046), isoproterenol (without apocynin: 1.58 ± 0.8 M, with apocynin: 0.83 ± 0.3 M; p = 0.02) and ANP (without apocynin: 1.60 ± 0.60 M, with apocynin: 0.95 ± 0.3 M; p = 0.04) probes. Hyperinsulinemia decreased dialysate glycerol concentrations compared to the basal state (basal: 56.0  21.9 mol/L, clamp: 32.8  20.2 mol/L; p = 0.02). In addition, dialysate glycerol concentrations decreased in the isoproterenol probe following apocynin perfusion during the clamp procedure (without apocynin: 126.1  38 mol/L, with apocynin: 91.9  25.7 mol/L; p = 0.002). Further, there was a correlation between basal adipose tissue lipolytic rates and Nox contributions to basal adipose tissue lipolysis (r = -0.66, p = 0.005), and individuals with lower insulin sensitivity (glucose disposal rate) tended to have high basal Nox-mediated ROS production (r = 0.56, p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: The novel findings of this study are that Nox is a stimulus of adipose tissue ROS production in healthy individuals, and this effect contributes to increases in adipose tissue lipolysis during hyperinsulinemic conditions. The mechanism by which Nox increases lipolysis involves β-adrenergic signaling and is independent of the ANP pathway. These data have important implications for individuals with insulin resistance and excess adiposity, as basal adipose tissue Nox activity was highest in individuals with lower insulin sensitivity and higher basal lipolytic rates, which may impair blood glucose regulation and vascular function. Overall, these study findings provide in vivo evidence of a novel regulator of adipose tissue lipolysis.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Physical pain is a gendered experience: Women report higher levels of it than do men. This pattern may stem from differences in experiences of the body. Women are socialized to be attentive to its functioning, appearance, and sensations, while men are discouraged from paying much attention to their bodies. Little is known, however, about the precise social and economic pathways leading to gender differences in pain, especially in middle and later life when pain is most prevalent. I examine this issue using data from two waves of Midlife in the United States (2004-2006 and 2013-2014). I consider four possible explanations for gender differences in reports of pain: economic security, health, relationship strain, and stress exposure.   </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Results indicated that women are more likely than men to report experiencing chronic pain and that three out of four explanations contributed to explaining this gender difference. Two of the explanations, however, played more substantial roles than the others. These conclusions held in both the cross-sectional and panel analyses. Results indicated that women’s worse physical and mental health and their lower economic security played the largest roles in accounting for the association between gender and pain. Women’s greater relationship strain, particularly in their partner and family relationships, also contributed to the explanation, but its role was more limited. Stress exposure was the only potential mediator that failed to contribute to explaining the association between gender and pain. This result derived from the observation that men, rather than women, experienced greater exposure to stressful events. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This research responds to the call for more sociological research on chronic pain (Wood and Bourke 2020). More specifically, it adds to the literature on gender and pain by clarifying the processes underlying this well-documented association.  The results of this study point to the role of macro-level social factors, especially socioeconomic inequality, in generating women’s greater experience of chronic pain.  They also reveal the central role that is played by women’s worse physical and mental health, which can be viewed as another consequence of socioeconomic inequality. These results have important implications not only for research on pain but also for interventions aimed at reducing gender disparities in pain. The processes revealed in this study could be further clarified by research that uses multiple waves of data to examine changes in pain as well as potential mediators over time. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The development of a clear vocational identity is a critical task for emerging adult undergraduates (Arnett, 2014). Ego psychology theorists (e.g., Marcia, 1993) argue that exploration contributes to the development of career commitment, and career commitment in the presence of career exploration constitutes one’s vocational identity. Career courses are an evidence-based intervention provided at many colleges for the purpose of career development through structured career exploration (Reardon &amp; Fiore, 2014); however, no study of career courses has investigated whether career exploration mediates the effects of career course participation on career commitment. This dissertation addressed gaps in the literature and solidified connections between theories by comparing students enrolled in a manualized, theory-based college career course and a non-equivalent control group with multilevel modeling and autoregressive path analyses on measures of career exploration, career commitment, and metacognition to observe mediation and moderation effects. Participation in the career course was associated with significant growth in career exploration and career commitment relative to the control group. Career exploration was observed as a partial mediator of treatment effects. Negative career thoughts and career outcome metacognitions differentially moderated the direct and indirect effects of the treatment on career commitment. These findings are discussed at length, followed by review of study limitations and implications for theory, practice, and research. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The need for efficient, reliable, and environmentally friendly transportation is increasing rapidly as countries set target dates for achieving net zero carbon emissions. High Temperature Superconducting (HTS) cables have current densities up to 100 A/mm2, approximately ten times greater than conventional copper cables. This increases the power density of electrical systems that utilize HTS cables and can result in substantial size and weight savings, making them an attractive solution for all-electric aircraft and ships with power system ratings ranging from 20 MW to 100 MW.  Gaseous helium (GHe) is the preferred cryogen for (HTS) devices for transportation applications due to its wider operating temperature range and reduced risk of asphyxiation compared to liquid nitrogen (LN2). However, its lower dielectric strength compared to LN2 poses design challenges. A previous study found that GHe mixed with small mole percentages of hydrogen (H2) results in significant improvement of dielectric breakdown strength. The same level of improvement was not seen when measuring the partial discharge inception voltage (PDIV) of lapped tape insulated cables in the helium-hydrogen gas mixtures. A greater understanding on the electric field enhancement within the electrical insulation of the HTS cable was required to develop materials and approaches to increase the partial discharge rating of the cables. Partial discharge is one of the limiting factors when determining the voltage rating of a cable.
The research presented in this thesis focuses on five prototype cables using cryogenic rated epoxies as electrical insulation. These cables were characterized at 77 K in both pure GHe and GHe mixed with small mol percentages of H2.  The electric field of the cables were varied through the addition of stress cones, techniques used to apply the ground layer application, and the type of cryogenic epoxy used as electrical insulation.  A summary of the conclusions drawn from this research is as follows:
•	The addition of 4 mol% of H2 to GHe led to an average increase in PDIV values of about 57% compared to PDIV measurements in pure GHe for pressure levels ranging from 0.5-2.0 MPa at 77 K. This improvement is a similar ratio to what has been observed with the intrinsic breakdown strength of GHe and He/H2 gas mixtures at cryogenic temperatures.  
•	The addition of stress cones to an EP37 insulated cable resulted in an average increase in PDIV of 45% in pure GHe and 54% improvement in the 96% GHe 4% H2 mixture compared to an EP37 insulated cable without stress cones. Confirming that the addition of stress cones will limit field enhancement and improve PDIV results. 
•	The use of conductive epoxy to form a direct ground connection on an EP37 insulated cable resulted in 64% improvement in pure GHe at 2 MPa compared to an EP 37 cable with a ground layer formed using semiconductive paper and copper tape. This indicated that the use of conductive epoxy instead of semiconductive paper limits the formation of butt gaps between the insulation and ground layers. 
•	The EP29 insulated cable experienced PDIV values 47% and 45% higher than the corresponding EP37 insulated cable in 2MPa pure GHe and in 2 MPa GHe with 4 mol% H2 respectively. EP29 has a relative permittivity of 3.95 compared to that of EP 37 which is 4.4. EP29 has a closer relative permittivity value to GHe (εr =1) which reduces the electric field enhancement at the triple point of the epoxy insulation, GHe, and ground layer.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Sandy beach ecosystems are important for many species for foraging, resting, and reproduction. Marine turtles are one species that use beaches for reproduction. Coastal areas are also attractive to humans as centers of commerce and recreation. Because of this, sandy coastlines are exposed to coastal development and anthropogenic modifications. While research has been done about the impacts of coastal development on species that rely on sandy beaches, little is understood about the cumulative impacts of coastal modifications. This dissertation investigated the temporal and spatial exposure of marine turtle nesting grounds in Florida to coastal modifications (Chapter 2) and examined the relative impact of each type of modification using expert elicitation (Chapter 3). Urban pocket beaches, or gaps between coastal armoring, were examined as potential nesting habitat (Chapter 4). Finally, a probabilistic model was developed to identify areas with high probability of nesting (Chapter 5) that can be applied to specific sites to inform management decisions regarding modifications such as beach nourishment or armoring. In Chapter 2, I examined the temporal (1985-2016) and spatial distribution of coastal construction permits as a proxy for coastal development. The cumulative number of permits throughout the state of Florida increased over time from less than 1,000 to over 4,000 permits issued per year. Over 93% of the 203 marine turtle nesting grounds examined throughout the state of Florida were exposed to cumulative coastal modifications. Of the high-density nesting beaches, twenty-six had high exposure to coastal modifications, highlighting the need for addressing the cumulative impacts of coastal modifications to nesting grounds.
To understand the relative impacts of the different types of coastal modifications at marine turtle nesting grounds I developed a survey to elicit information from experts on the relative impacts of twelve modification types (Chapter 3). The survey utilized a pairwise comparison matrix that compared the impacts of each coastal modification activity. Beach armoring, light pollution, and other shoreline stabilization structures (groins and jetties) were weighted by experts as having the greatest impact while nonpermanent coastal modifications (e.g. special events and beach cleaning) were weighted by experts as having the lowest impact. This information can be used by managers to prioritize efforts and resources to manage marine turtle nesting grounds.
On coastal areas with a high density of coastal armoring, small gaps remain between existing armoring (Chapter 4). These gaps have been given the term “urban pocket beaches” by managers, after a natural formation of small beaches between rocky uplands. It is unclear if urban pocket beaches can provide the same function as natural beaches or offer benefits (e.g. reduced risk of inundation) lost at nearby armored beaches. The linear extent of urban pocket beaches for Florida was identified and reproductive output was compared to adjacent armored beaches and nearby unarmored beaches. I also modeled differences in wave runup exposure at these beaches under current conditions (2016-2019) and future (2060) sea level rise scenarios. Urban pocket beaches account for less than 2% of Florida’s nesting beaches with higher abundances on more armored shorelines. Nesting density of pocket beaches were similar to nearby beaches without armoring. However, female turtles were more likely to nest in urban pocket beaches compared to armored , and pocket beach nests had a higher hatching success. Our models suggest that exposure to wave runup varies by geographic location, but overall pocket beaches provided viable nesting habitat.
	General beach characteristics important for marine turtle nesting are known, but specific patterns that lead to nest site selection are less clear (Chapter 5). To identify variables that influence nest site selection I developed a model to determine how beach morphology can influence probability of nesting. Top models performed accurately over 83% of the time and incorporate multiple marine turtle species in one model. Elevation and distance to shoreline were the variables with the most influence on high probability nesting locations. Areas with a low probability of nesting were located close to the waterline and higher within the dunes while areas with high probability of nesting were located mid beach. This probabilistic model can be used with site specific information to inform management decisions (e.g. beach nourishment) at the local level.
	Marine turtles are exposed to high levels of coastal modifications in the state of Florida and this can impact their ability to effectively utilize their nesting habitat. While they may only be one group of organisms that utilize this habitat, their study can demonstrate how coastal modifications can be detrimental to natural sandy beach habitats and provides transferable frameworks to assess impacts.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Autumn of the Reaper King: Volume One is the first part of a trilogy that opens in the year 2101. Earth has warmed considerably. Deep droughts, harsher storms, and rising sea levels have forced U.S. cities to conserve water and construct flood barriers to hold back the rising oceans. Aiden Ainsley, who built and grew a company that found a way to profit from Earth’s newfound challenges, now leads one of the largest private business empires in the world. But six months ago, the flood barriers Aiden’s company built to protect the city of Miami crumbled under the impact of a hurricane. The city was lost. The federal government, along with nearly every private and corporate entity in the country, is now looking for ways to shut him down. Aiden, meanwhile, has another problem: a progressing Alzheimer’s disease that even the most cutting-edge medicine can’t seem to slow. Amid the fight for everything he’s built, his son Junior, one of the world’s most prolific and successful robotics engineers, invents a technology that could usher in a new era of humankind, and potentially save his father’s life. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Permafrost is an area of ground which continually maintains temperatures below 0˚C and is found across arctic and sub-arctic regions, with 50% of the global soil carbon contained within permafrost storage banks (Trubl et al., 2016). In these high-latitude regions temperatures have risen 0.6˚C per decade over the last 30 years, a rise twice as fast as the global average (Schuur et al., 2015). The thawing of permafrost causes quantities of organic carbon to decompose via soil microbes, with permafrost regions containing twice as much carbon as currently resides in the atmosphere (Schuur et al., 2015). Permafrost thawing is common in Northern areas susceptible to environmental changes such as Stordalen mire, Sweden, where it is feared that the decomposition of permafrost could cause massive soil carbon degradation and the production of both methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) causing dramatic elevations in CH4 emissions and the weakening of the landscape’s carbon sink functionality. When frozen permafrost palsa regions thaw they transition into regions with higher water tables including bogs and wet fens. With this transition, CO2 uptake may increase and CH4 emissions rise (Holmes et al., 2022; Varner et al., 2022), increasing warming potential across Northern areas like Stordalen and accelerating positive feedback loops driven by climate warming (McCalley et al., 2014). Centrally, the first objective of this research was to define the effect temperature increase has on greenhouse gas production (CH4 and CO2) due to anaerobic heterotrophic soil respiration across fen-type peatlands. For this study, anaerobic incubations of fen peat were conducted at temperatures ranging from 1℃ to 25℃ on two depths of peat, 9-19 cm and 28-35 cm. It was found that as temperatures increased both CH4 and CO2 production increased exponentially, with CH4 production exhibiting a Q10 of around 7 while anaerobic CO2 production had a Q10 of roughly 2. The second objective of this thesis was to scale these measurements of methane production versus temperature with measured field temperature data to determine the extent to which seasonal field-measured rates of methane emission can be predicted from modeled in situ methane production rates.  These finding indicated that incubated peat reasonably represents (within a factor of 2) field measured methane emission rates, but misses the additional respiration of dissolved organic carbon released by living plants in the field.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Gulf of Mexico is a hydrocarbon-rich region characterized by the presence of floating oil slicks from persistent natural hydrocarbon seeps, which are reliably captured by synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite imaging.  Improving the state of knowledge of hydrocarbon seepage in the Gulf of Mexico improves the understanding and quantification of natural seepage rates in North America.  We used data derived from SAR scenes collected over the Gulf of Mexico from 1978 to 2018 to locate oil slick origins (OSOs), cluster the OSOs into discrete seep zones, estimate the flux of individual seepage events, and calculate seep recurrence rates.  In total, 1618 discrete seep zones were identified, primarily concentrated in the northern Gulf of Mexico within the Louann salt formation, with a secondary concentration in the Campeche region.  The centerline method was used to estimate flux based on the drift length of the slick (centerline), the slick area, and average current and wind speeds.  Flux estimates from the surface area of oil slicks varied geographically and temporally; on average, seep zones exhibited an 11% recurrence rate, suggesting possible intermittent discharge from natural seeps.  The estimated average instantaneous flux for natural seeps is 9.8 mL s−1 (1.9 × 103 bbl yr−1 ), with an annual discharge of 1.73–6.69 × 105 bbl yr−1 (2.75–10.63 × 104 m3 yr−1 ) for the entire Gulf of Mexico.  The temporal variability of average flux suggests a potential decrease following 1995; however, analysis of flux in four lease blocks indicates that flux has not changed substantially over time.  It is unlikely that production activities in the Gulf of Mexico impact natural seepage on a human timescale.  Of the 1618 identified seep zones, 1401 are located within U.S. waters, with 70 identified as having flux and recurrence rates significantly higher than the average.  Seep zones exhibiting high recurrence rates are more likely to be associated with positive seismic anomalies.  Many of the methods developed for this study can be applied to SAR-detected oil slicks in other marine settings to better assess the magnitude of global hydrocarbon seepage.The new approach used to quantify flux oil fluxes from natural seafloor seepage sites in the Gulf of Mexico based on the dynamic characteristics of floating oil slicks is presented.  It enables rapid analysis of interpreted satellite imagery and permits large datasets to be analyzed.  The method uses the drift path of the oil on water surface, termed the “centerline” of the slick, along with average current and wind speeds to estimate the age of seepage slicks.  The results of the CL (centerline) method compare favorably with the hindcast modeling approach which requires time-resolved analysis of wind and current for each slick.  The CL method yields an average flux estimate within the range of the flux documented by on-bottom capture for a seafloor oil pollution source.  A survey of published flux estimates using a variety of techniques reveals a wide range with on-bottom estimates (0.08–12 ml/s) generally lower than estimates from slicks (1.6–125 ml/s).  Determination of fluxes from three seepage sites in the Gulf of Mexico (GC600, Bush Hill, and TYK) reveals a wide range in seepage rates from 2.4 to 52.9 ml/s and flux distributions.  Comparison of the observed fluxes from seeps with potential fluxes from a source region can be used to constrain source rock parameters (e.g., thickness, richness, area) and to understand the cumulative oil supply represented by seeps over geologic time scales.
Physical processes involved in the ascent of naturally seeped oil from the seafloor and its persistence as a slick are also considered.  Simplified, physics-based models are developed, drawing in part from the extensive literature concerned with anthropogenic releases of oil at sea.  The first model calculates the ascent of oil droplets or oil-coated gas bubbles as they ascend to the sea surface from the seep source.  The second model calculates slick longevity as a function of the effect of wind-driven breaking waves.  Both models have simplified inputs and algorithms making them suitable for Monte Carlo-type analysis.  Using the oil ascent model, we find that slicks from shallower seeps are offset farther relative to their water depth than those from deeper sources.  The slick longevity model reveals four growth modes for seepage slicks: persistent (low wind speeds), ephemeral (high wind speeds), reset (all slicks are cleared from an area by high wind speeds), and aging (slick growth after a reset).  A year’s worth of modeled winds from the Gulf of Mexico indicate average slick ages of ~ 12 hours.  Taking account of the expected oil release duration implied by slick recurrences yields average slick longevities for high recurrence seeps of ~6.5 hours and ~ 5 hours for low recurrence seeps.  Seep flux estimates that include the length of individual slicks and the constraints of local currents and wind implicitly take into account the impact of wind-speed history.  Those that assume a slick age should be re-evaluated in light of the current findings.
The approaches used to quantify natural seepage can be applied to anthropogenic oil slicks on the sea surface.  Ship generated oil slicks (i.e. bilge dumping) are a chronic source of oil pollution to the global oceans.  Anthropogenic inputs are the largest contributor to oil slicks in the global oceans, with approximately 20% generated by operational discharges of vessels.  These slicks are generated by bilge dumping, the illegal discharge of untreated oily wastewater directly into the sea, in violation of international regulations (i.e., MARPOL).  Bilge dump oil slicks are routinely detected in satellite imagery; however, responsible parties are not prosecuted due to lack of surveillance, uncertainty of extent of MARPOL violations, and difficulty tracing the origin of slicks back to the responsible vessel.  This study analyzed 70 SAR satellite detected bilge dump oil slicks to estimate the oil concentration of the bilge water required to generate the observed slicks, as well as estimated persistence time of the slicks, as a function of wind speed.  Bilge dump slick volumes were estimated assuming a range of slick thicknesses (0.04 – 1 μm) and compared to recommended bilge tank volumes for various ship sizes.  In all slick thickness cases, for all bilge tank volumes, the observed bilge dump oil slicks were discharged from bilge tanks with oil concentrations that exceeded the 15 ppm MARPOL oil content limit by at least 3 orders of magnitude.  Slicks generated at wind speeds less than 5.6 m/s were estimated to persist for over 24 hours and those generated at higher wind speeds were estimated to persist for less than 16 hours.  Persistence time was added to the deposition time of each slick, providing a time window to look back at automatic identification system (AIS) data to identify potential responsible parties.  MARPOL regulations have been accepted international standards since the 1970s, but increased satellite surveillance and enforcement would improve its efficacy and the health of the marine environment.

            <DISS_para>ABSTRACT</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the modern era, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have revolutionized diverse fields yet a deficiency in geographical education lingers in the U.S. educational system. This dissertation offers a thorough analysis of this gap, focusing on the potential of the GIS as an innovative solution for enriching geographical education. The Geospatial Semester program (GSS) is used as the case of this study, which is a novel educational model, is designed to provide hands-on GIS experience, enhance students' spatial thinking abilities, and improve real-world problem-solving skills. Despite facing challenges, such as complex GIS technicalities, the program maintains a flexible and innovative curriculum to counter these hurdles. This program emphasizes real-world applications and encourages independent learning experiences, thereby augmenting students' understanding of real-world geographical issues. This study delves into the experiences of teachers in the GSS program, highlighting the significant transition from traditional teaching methodologies to a project-based approach. This shift plays a crucial role in fostering active learning and nurturing problem-solving skills among students. Teachers from various disciplines contribute unique insights to the program, underscoring the versatility of GIS in cultivating a deep spatial understanding, improving students’ problem-solving skills, and its potential to open doors to future college or career opportunities. The research findings highlight the urgent need and potential advantages of integrating GIS into U.S. high schools. While the GSS program may not be exclusively focused on geography, it serves as a distinctive model for geography education by providing students with the vital geographical skills to navigate the dynamic world of GIS. This paper emphasizes the importance of geography education and the significant role that GIS plays in its enhancement. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation responds to the dearth of research in responding practice of instructors teaching in college composition online writing classrooms, especially addressing both how they do it and how “care-fully.” More specifically, the dissertation investigates the responding thoughts and behaviors of instructors teaching writing within the parameters of an asynchronous online format. Furthermore, the dissertation regards the instructors as carers and the students as cared-fors, exploring how teachers’ responses to students (carer and cared-for) are marked by elements of care-fullness. These elements include engrossment (empathy [thinking + feeling] + receptive attention), motivational displacement (the impulse to focus on and contribute to the resolution of students’ challenges), and reciprocity (the desire for dialogic exchange between carer and cared-for). There has been ample research establishing the increased frequency of online writing instruction and its rising prevalence especially during COVID-19. In the wake of the move from face-to-face teaching to online teaching, the need to explore instructors’ responding protocols are also increasing. While response to students’ writing has been a staple in composition studies for more than six decades, little research has focused specifically on fully online situations, particularly those with an asynchronous approach. Furthermore, while care in the context of elementary and middle-school has been researched before, no such research focuses on the asynchronous online situation. This dissertation brings together these disparate elements into a meticulously structured intellectual confluence. In brief, this dissertation examines the following questions through the case studies of two instructors teaching the asynchronous online iteration of a sophomore-level college composition course, mandatory to all undergraduate students at Florida State University, namely, ENC 2135 (Research, Genre, and Context). The research questions the dissertation answers are: 1) How do teachers of online writing instruction describe their response protocols and goals? How, if at all, does “care-fullness” emerge within those descriptions? 2) How do teachers of online writing instruction respond to student papers? How, where, and when, if at all, does “care-fullness” emerge within those response behaviors?  3) What role, if any, does the medium of response play in teacher of online writing instruction response? How, if at all, does medium affect care-fullness? To find answers to these questions, the data corpus consisting of the instructors’ response philosophies and textual comments, along with transcripts of audiovisual conferences and retrospective protocols were collected, coded, and interpretated through observation, transcription, color classification, and tabulation. The coding of the data happened on two levels. The descriptive coding focused on answering the questions: what, who, when, where, why, and how. Likewise, the “care-fullness” coding focused on the occurrences of the elements of the “care-fullness” triad, i.e., engrossment, motivational displacement, and reciprocity. 
The results showed that, first, there is negligible difference in the textual responses of college composition courses taught face-to-face and those taught asynchronously online. The instructors had numerous marginal comments and end comments across the drafts that helped students polish their projects. In addition to the format of responding that follows a series of comments at different locations on and across drafts, the similarity between online instruction and face-to-face instruction also lies in employing Canvas as the Learning Management System (LMS) through which textual responses are shared periodically. Second, the only domain of response that shows a departure from the responding practices of face-to-face college composition course is the mode of teacher-student conference, conducted via Zoom. This is significant because while it provides the immediacy in conversation which imitates a real-world in-person meeting, it is still happening through virtual channels. As a result, it consists of computer screens and Zoom elements like screen sharing. Third, the project shows that “care-fullness” can be performed in diverse ways. As derived from the first case study, balance is a key to care-full responding practices. Diego, the nurturing coach, maintains a delicate balance between personability and professionalism as he ensures that the conversation between him and his students flows smoothly through different mediums of responses. Likewise, the second case demonstrates the harmful effects of cultural forces at play informing the gendered expectations of care that migrate from face-to-face classrooms to online instructional platforms. Samantha, the pragmatic teacher, underscores the invisible labor demands of carework based on gendered perceptions of online writing instructors that if left unmonitored, may contribute to instructors’ burnout. Finally, the project deems “care-fullness” as a necessary factor in all educational environments, but especially so in asynchronous online classes because it is an immensely powerful way to ascertain human presence, establish emotional and intellectual interactions, and intensify human community bonds in a technologically mediated instructional space.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>With the advent of tremendous and complex data sets, the accessibility of data has become easier than before. Data integration thus became a popular method to deal with multi-source data. Identifying a dynamic association among multi-modal data is practical in an explanatory data analysis (EDA) step. In this dissertation, we introduce statistical methods to tackle the issues in integrative analysis: blockwise missing imputation on the multi-modal data and dynamic association analysis. We elaborate on the approaches in the following chapters.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>First, we proposed a new envelope blockwise imputation (EBI) framework to address blockwise missing data in multiview data integration. Blockwise missing imputation is often needed as a preprocessing step for data integration. We develop a simultaneous envelope-based method that takes advantage of canonical correlations of different data sets to impute multiple missing blocks. The method effectively estimates canonical subspaces by fitting a regression model with congregating envelope subspaces, reducing the number of parameters in both predictors and responses. As a by-product, the envelope blockwise imputation method also obtains a more accurate estimate of the canonical correlations than the standard canonical correlation analysis (CCA). We devised an expectation conditional maximization (ECM) algorithm to estimate the envelope parameters. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>  Next, we introduced a conditional cross-covariance reduction (CCR) model to study the dynamic association of two sets of random variables with a conditioned random variable. Sex dimorphism is crucial in various research fields, such as biomechanics and bioengineering. The difference in sex helps us understand certain musculoskeletal diseases, such as temporomandibular disorders (TMD). Especially, identifying an association between skull and temporomandibular joint muscles is essential to verify the sex difference in TMD. We collect data from 10 male and 11 female cadaver heads to study the dynamic associations between skull and muscle. The model identifies the most contrastive relationship between sex by selecting significant variables in skull measurement and temporomandibular joint muscle attachment. We apply a singular value decomposition-type algorithm via sparsity. In the analysis of the human cadaver data, we also introduce a permutation testing procedure to determine the number of variables selected.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Finally, we briefly studied a basis spline transformation method to linearize the multivariate response and predictor under envelope assumptions. By incorporating the envelope parameters to the basis spline transformation, we numerically see that the correlation coefficients of response and predictor are leveraged.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study investigates the institutional proceedingsundertaken by the Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) during its
statutorily directed mission of determining royalty rates and
settling royalty negotiation disputes for the American music
industry. In particular, this study is concerned with the
royalties that songwriters (aka composers) and performers (aka
recording artists) receive through the U.S. statutory regimen
employed by the CRB. This issue is significant given the changes
within musical product “delivery” attributable to the rise of
digital phonorecord delivery services and webcasters in the wake
of the file sharing phenomenon that began in the late 1990s. The
concept of “the public interest,” operationalized here as
facilitating the music industry’s ability to provide quality
music to the citizenry, is given special consideration. Using an
Historical Institutional (HI) perspective, witness testimony and
the final determinations of the CRB during two distinct “rate-
setting” periods are examined within qualitative content
analysis (QCA) to determine the predominant arguments made by
the various stakeholders involved in the proceedings. Next, the
patterns and details of the arguments found during the QCA are
further analyzed to determine the rationale various stakeholders
use in trying to prove the veracity of their positions in an
effort to persuade the CRB judges to rule in a particular way.
Given the legal redactions present in the public versions of
testimony to safeguard proprietary information, an economic
analysis is not used. Rather, the focus of this study is on the
rationale of the arguments forwarded by various stakeholders,
consideration of the public interest within stakeholder
testimony, and the institutional execution of the CRB relative
to its legally codified mission in considering the arguments
from the stakeholders and in applying the law. The results show
that the CRB focuses more on stakeholder arguments than the law,
that it tends to favor “more powerful” stakeholders, that it
gives short shrift to any conception of “the public interest,”
and --from an HI perspective-- tends to follow a path that is in
contrast to it statutory mission.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Mental health is not a new topic in the realm of sport. Despite the fact that the number of student athletes speaking out about the struggles has increased, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) has yet to codify regulations that might curb the problem. The governing body has disseminated supplemental materials on student athlete mental health which have assisted in establishing an institutional logic that is upheld and perpetuated by NCAA member organizations. Further, within the NCAA, football is one of the top financial leaders, but also attributes to some of the highest concussion rates among student athletes. In addition, with the proven connection between concussions and short- and long-term mental health concerns, it is imperative that the NCAA adopts formal regulations to protect student athletes’ mental health   due to moral, legal, and financial reasons.For this dissertation, I will be conducting three separate, but cohesive, studies. First, I will be using legal doctrinal research to establish the duty of care owed to student athletes by coaches in terms of mental health. Through the study, I will also seek to illustrate the legal aspect of how not only coaches, but their employing organizations, and even the NCAA, may be held vicariously liable for actions, or inactions, surrounding student athlete mental health. Next, I will conduct a content analysis of current football head coach employment contracts at the NCAA Division I level. This will be used to show how, or if, individual NCAA member organizations address student athlete mental health within the legal employment contracts of their coaches. Finally, I will conduct a case study on the historical contracts of football head coaches at one prominent NCAA member university (i.e., Florida State University). This study will show the evolution of how student athlete mental health has been addressed in head coach contracts over time and as the NCAA has released more materials on the topic. 
The findings of this study have the potential to influence the NCAA, or its member organizations, to obligate coaches to report student athlete mental health concerns, which in turn, could prevent tragic outcomes. Further, these articles will be used to emphasize the potential role of coaches as reporters, not practitioners, due to the unique relationship they have with their student athletes. Coaches should never be responsible for treating student athletes mental health issues but should be able to identify the symptoms associated with this status and refer the effected athlete(s) to the proper channels.
Finally, by conducting these three studies, I hope to show how beneficial student mental health regulations will be for all actors involved, including the athletes themselves, their coaches, athletic department, and university staff, and even the NCAA as a league. Enforcing policy related to student athlete mental health, specifically within coach employment contracts, could potentially reduce the member organizations’, and by proxy the NCAA’s, chances of being held vicariously liable. Further, when coaches uphold this stipulation within their contractual, their chances of being held negligent for student athlete mental health concerns may also be reduced. Finally, although the NCAA and its member organizations should just ‘care’ about student athletes, by including contractual stipulations and policy for coaches, the student athletes may have a better chance of receiving care and treatment for potential mental health concerns. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Epithelial tissues rely on the activity of stem cells to sustain their structure and proper functioning. These stem cells are responsible for generating various types of cells, that are essential for the tissue's normal homeostasis, through division and differentiation. In order to ensure precise control over stem cell behavior and the decisions they make regarding cell fate, constant communication through a network of signaling pathways between different cell types is necessary.This delicate network of cell-cell interactions however is frequently disrupted in the face of cancer and the development of tumorigenesis. However, the mechanisms by which these interactions are broken and often co-opted to support tumor growth in different genetic contexts are not yet well understood. To shed light on this phenomenon, we have developed several genetically complex colorectal models utilizing a novel genetic platform named PromoterSwitch.
PromoterSwitch allows us to generate large, transformed clones from a small subset of individual adult Drosophila intestinal stem and progenitor cells. By utilizing this platform, we have discovered that genetic alterations commonly found in colon tumors can interfere with the normal process of cell fate determination within the transformed tissue and in neighboring wildtype cells. 
Furthermore, our research has revealed that transformed enteroendocrine cells, which are a specialized lineage of intestinal hormone-secreting cells, play a crucial role in supporting tumor growth via the regulation of the proliferation of intestinal stem cells through multiple mechanisms that depend on the specific genetic background of the clone. These findings suggest potential vulnerabilities that could be targeted for therapeutic purposes such as enteroendocrine cell differentiation and the hormone Tk, which results showed plays a pivotal role in driving intestinal tumorigenesis. 
The findings of our work emphasize the importance of developing and investigating disease models that faithfully recapitulate the intricate genetic landscapes observed in human cancer patients in the context of an otherwise healthy epithelial tissue to precisely mimic the initiation and progression of the disease in humans. Our research also showcases the remarkable capacity of Drosophila as a robust model organism for studying genetically complex diseases in a sophisticated manner. By leveraging the close homology and conservation of epithelial tissue and disease-relevant genes and pathways, Drosophila offers unique opportunities to make groundbreaking discoveries with direct implications for human diseases. Overall, our study demonstrates that disruptions in cell fate decisions and the exploitation of enteroendocrine cells are key factors in tumor growth providing a deeper understanding on the cellular heterogeneity and plasticity observed in the disease that could pave the way for the development of new therapeutic strategies aimed at exploiting these mechanisms for effective colorectal cancer treatment. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Natural disasters in Florida threaten the millions of people who live there. Storm in the most frequent natural disaster that leaves behind unimaginable levels of devastation. Hurricanes are created over warm waters by tropical disturbances and when strong enough, they can travel at a speed of more than 155 mph. Many structures run at the risk of total failure of the structure due to the force of winds and storms. The building and engineering sectors are important participants in reducing risks and restoring the essential infrastructural goods many are accustomed to, even if numerous programs and methods exist to return normalcy to inhabitants after a disaster.The major objective of this thesis is to present techniques for construction alleviation against hurricane wind loading to increase the resilience of residential construction in Florida. This thesis is divided into two main goals in order to achieve the results aimed. The first step is to examine the problems caused by hurricane wind loading on residential structures, the construction advice that can be used to get older buildings ready for this natural disaster, and the associated expenses. The second objective of this thesis is to determine how, if the primary residential structure breaks during a storm, a cost-effective safe room can be built to safeguard the occupants. The initial objective of this investigation is to identify structural weaknesses by reviewing the research. Since the structures are composed of various components, it is crucial to identify which ones require attention. The design pressures and forces can then be investigated to find the best building suggestions by calculating the wind loading pressures of the various structures. An engineer's judgment on the likely cost can be generated after the construction recommendations for various types of structures have been established to educate the stakeholder of the recommendation's cost.
In short, this study aims to ensure that the rooms are risk-free and cost-effective while also being resistant to hurricane wind loads.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Supercritical Carbon Dioxide is of interest in a wide range of engineering problems, including carbon capture, utilization, and storage as well as advanced cycles for power generation. Non-ideal varia- tions in physical properties of supercritical Carbon Dioxide impact the physics of these systems. It is important to understand how drastic changes in thermodynamic properties influence these flow physics in order to aid in and optimize the design of future technologies related to carbon capture and sequestration. In this study, we simulate turbulent supercritical Carbon Dioxide jets to gain a better understanding of these physics. Of particular interest is the impact of pseudo-boiling on supercritical flow dynamics. We use a second order finite volume method with adaptive mesh re- finement as implemented in the reacting flow solver, PeleC, to perform a Large Eddy Simulation of three turbulent jets of supercritical Carbon Dioxide. Additionally, we use the Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation of state to close the system and more accurately incorporate the departure from ideal gas behavior into the turbulent flow physics. We look at a variety of quantities of interest, including but not limited to axial velocity decay and spread, resolved Reynolds stress profiles at different down- stream locations, and resolved turbulent kinetic energy along the axial direction of the flow. Across the three cases, the only parameters that vary are the temperature and density of the ambient fluid. One case is isothermal, where the jet and ambient fluid temperature are the same, while the other two cases are non-isothermal, with one involving injection crossing over the pseudo-boiling point and one with injection moving away from the pseudo-boiling point. Results are contrasted with established theory for ideal gas jets and similar numerical studies involving transcritical injection in order to capture the effects of widely varying thermal properties in the pseudo-critical region. We found that the isothermal supercritical jet exhibits many similar flow characteristics compared to ideal gas round turbulent jets, with minor differences seen in the decay and spreading rate of the jet and in a noticeable anisotropy between resolved turbulent kinetic energy components. The non-isothermal jet excluding the pseudo-boiling point exhibits only small difference compared to the isothermal case. The non-isothermal case involving the pseudo-boiling point displays markedly dif- ferent behavior, with evidence indicative of increased Kelvin-Helmholtz-like instabilities and much faster jet decay and disintegration. These factors impact the degree of mixing in the transition region of the jet, leading to finer-scale vortices and faster transition to ambient properties.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>There is a growing demand for technology that can sense people and objects without imposing excessive overhead. Traditional solutions usually require people to wear additional devices on their bodies and install cumbersome sensors on objects. The prevalence of wireless signals and wireless devices provides us with the opportunity to sense both the human and physical environment. This dissertation showcases how we can leverage wireless signals to sense people and objects without the need for physical contact with their bodies or the objects themselves. To this end, we propose three commodity WiFi-based sensing systems: GoPose, 3D-ID, and LiquidSense, towards smart wireless sensing.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Specifically, we first present GoPose, a 3D skeleton-based human pose estimation system that reuses WiFi devices in a home environment. It works for unseen activities even when the user is moving around, offering on-the-go pose tracking for previously unseen activities. Second, we propose a WiFi vision-based system, 3D-ID, for person re-identification in 3D space. Our system leverages the advances of WiFi and deep learning to help WiFi devices ``see", identify, and recognize people. Finally, we introduce LiquidSense, a new approach to sensing the liquid level that is low-cost, high accuracy, widely applicable to different daily liquid containers, and can be easily integrated with existing home networks without additional cost. These sensing systems demonstrate that wireless signals can be utilized to effectively sense both the human body and objects.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Black queer, transgender, and nonbinary (BQTN) people are among the most vulnerable populations in the United States due to structural racialized and gender discrimination (Clifton, 2021). In the United States, civil and human rights protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, asexual, and intersex (LGBTQAI+)  people have historically been politically and culturally contested within sport and physical culture studies. As a bodyworker and insider to the queer and trans community, I am choosing to use oral history interviews to explore the liberatory bodywork spaces created by and for BQTN bodyworkers in the Southeastern United States. Liberatory bodywork is an expression of various modalities of physical and/or energetic techniques working with the human body for individual and collective transformation and freedom praxis. Liberatory bodywork recognizes the ongoing anti-Black violence and colonialism on our physical beings. Through liberatory bodywork, physical activity, and embodied movement is practiced and taught with an explicit recognition and reverence for the land, participants lived experiences, and personal and collective commitments to freedom. Moreover, liberatory bodywork invites scholars and community members into integrative approaches to understanding human and non-human relations as emancipatory sites and interventions into the ongoing harm of structural oppression. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Though gender identity is not documented in the U.S. Census, the estimated population size of transgender individuals has been collected through national population surveys and has significantly increased over the last decade (Meerwijk &amp; Sevellius, 2017). In 2016, the Williams Institute estimated that 1.4 million adults identify as transgender, and more recently in 2021, more than 1.2 million LGBTQ adults identify as nonbinary.  Yet, in June 2021, the United States introduced (over thirty states to date) record-breaking anti-transgender legislation, focused specifically on eliminating sport participation and gender-affirming healthcare for transgender and nonbinary people (Mosier, 2022). In response to the state’s discriminatory measures, individuals and groups at the local, state-wide, and national levels have organized in the fight for transgender rights, affirming healthcare, and sports participation. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Federal and state anti-transgender sport and healthcare legislative policies are predicated on the structural erasure of transgender people resulting from Western colonial constructs such as gender, race, and sexual orientation hierarchies (Carrington &amp; McDonald 2009; Travers, 2008; White et al. 1995). These value systems permeate institutional practices that reproduce regulatory policies regarding sex, gender identity, and expression by categorizing their cultural acceptability exclusively on a binary basis (Travers, 2008). Further, such laws and regulations become an impetus for further material conditions and symbolic violence that decrease and severely restrict access to basic resources such as housing, healthcare, employment, education, sport, and recreation, to name some (Johnson et al., 2020). The deliberate practice of systemic oppression compounds historical and generational traumas endangering the livelihood and well-being of BQTN people. Such corporealized harm is somaticized and lives inside of physical material bodies, contributing to the shortening of BQTN people’s lives. The immense amount of stress caused by the struggle to simply survive is a great barrier to health and vitality. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Consequently, BQTN communities need resources that contribute to both understanding and addressing the oppressive conditions that restrain access to embodied healing resources, which can alleviate individual and collective harm. Accordingly, this dissertation explores the ways that BQTN bodyworkers in the Southeastern United States navigate sport and physical cultural spaces, in turn, by generating ontological spaces of liberatory bodywork and resisting normative (and oppressive) practices of bodywork. Throughout this process, I draw from the Sankofa tradition, politically engaged sport sociology, and physical cultural studies (PCS) literature. My research study is important because BQTN people have been strategically and systemically disembodied by governmental policies, public discourse, everyday practices, and incomprehensible violence. Further, the dominant hegemonic culture in institutionalized sporting spaces compounds this harm. Consequently, this dissertation confronts racialized and gendered discrimination that leads to the erasure of BQTN people. Despite the social reproduction of power relations that erase BQTN people, we still exist and in particular claim our existence within sport and physical culture. These liberatory and life-affirming bodywork communities do exist and play an important part in BQTN's struggles for body autonomy and self-determination. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The 6.8 billion base pairs of human DNA must be packaged into chromatin to fit into the nucleus. The nucleosome, approximately 150 bp of genomic DNA wrapped 1.65 times around the histone octamer, is the fundamental unit of chromatin. While this organization likely evolved for packaging, it has been co-opted for regulatory processes.	All cells undergo DNA-templated processes such as transcription, recombination, replication, and DNA damage repair. Therefore, the nucleosome architecture must be remodeled to provide access to the underlying genome. Assessment of nucleosomal dynamics in response to certain stimuli reveals the genomic loci that play a role in response to that stimulus. Classically nucleosomal dynamics are assessed by MNase mapping of nucleosome occupancy. MNase digests the internucleosomal linker DNA leaving only nucleosomally protected DNA. Sequencing nucleosomally protected fragments and mapping their genomic location suggests nucleosome locations.  
	One longstanding expectation has been that nucleosome occupancy should be fundamentally different in cell types with different physiologies. Surprisingly, our lab has discovered that disparate cell lines have fundamentally similar basal nucleosome occupancy. We showed that nucleosome occupancy changes only transiently in response to a stimulus returning to basal positions on a timeframe commensurate with the response. The transient nature of these occupancy changes shifted the perspective on studies of chromatin structure and suggested that future studies of nucleosome occupancy dynamics should include high-resolution temporal analysis. More recently, we demonstrated that nucleosomes in their basal positions differ in their sensitivity to MNase, with some locations readily digested with relatively low concentrations of MNase, and others requiring higher concentrations of MNase to be digested. The works presented here used these two analyses, occupancy, and sensitivity, to identify distinctly different features of the functional genome. The present research focused on two disease models using a model of the Kaposi sarcoma herpes virus (KSHV) reactivation and an immortalized cell line from a Cockayne syndrome patient. For each of these models, we have identified transient changes in nucleosome occupancy with temporally resolved MNase mapping. Additionally, we have identified longer-lasting nucleosomal changes with MNase sensitivity.
	KSHV is a gamma herpes virus that is responsible for the oncogenic transformation of infected cells. We used an inducible system to reactivate KSHV, which simulates the lytic cycle of the virus life cycle and is eventually responsible for oncogenic transformation. We measured nucleosome occupancy at 0, 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours after reactivation. We observed changes in nucleosome occupancy at the -1 nucleosome at loci important for viral reactivation and oncogenic transformation, such as the AKT2, PRCC, and CDC6 genes. These loci are enriched for MAZ, PATZ1, WT1, KLF15, EGR2, E2F, and PBX3 transcription factor binding sites (TFBS).  These TFBS are consistent with responses regulating cell growth, proliferation, and oncogenesis. Our nucleosome sensitivity studies revealed persistent changes at loci important in nuclear transport, signal transduction, and oncogenesis, including TPR and TRAF6. We identified TFBS for factors that regulate oncogenesis, including WT1, MAZ, KLF12, PATZ2, and E2E4. We conclude that occupancy and sensitivity studies provide distinct and biologically important aspects of the functional genome.
	Cockayne syndrome B is a progressive autosomal recessive developmental disorder resulting from mutations in the CSB protein. CSB plays multifaceted cellular functions. CSB plays a role in chromatin remodeling, transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER), and oxidative DNA damage repair. We measured nucleosome occupancy in a CSBnull cell line and a CSBWT cell line. We observed changes in nucleosome occupancy at the -1 position in genes that contribute to the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction and hippo signaling pathways. These loci are important in neurological development and organ size development, two important aspects of Cockayne syndrome B. We also observed that these loci are enriched for TFBS that have a role in DNA damage response, DNA repair, and development. Our nucleosome sensitivity studies revealed changes at loci, including NEIL2, which is important in base-excision pathways. Interestingly we identified different classes of TFBS in the sensitivity analysis. These TFBS included ZIC2, ZIC3, TBX1, and TBX15 and are involved in neurogenesis, bone, and cartilage formation. We conclude that occupancy and sensitivity studies provide distinct and biologically important aspects of the functional genome.
	In conclusion, we surmise that nucleosome occupancy and sensitivity can detect two levels of change in nucleosome architecture. Nucleosome occupancy changes are transient and happen in disease-specific genes and global genes, which are common to other genes. Nucleosomes with changes in sensitivity to MNase represent more persistent changes and occur in the genes which are more disease-specific.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Background: As the coronavirus disease continues to spread around the world, millions are being impacted by societal changes and social distancing. When the majority of educational institutions closed campuses, college students were left vulnerable to developing difficulties as they were forced to adjust to these changes. They are already particularly vulnerable to sleep difficulties, which will increase further for those with other mental health problems.Hypothesis: Following school closure, college students will display an increase in sleep difficulties across sleep onset latency, subjective sleep quality, sleep quantity, daytime dysfunction, and disturbing dreams. This relationship will be strengthened in those who experience greater levels of stress, ruminative thinking patterns, or depressive symptoms. Changes to amount of light exposure due to increased screen use will account for a proportion of these difficulties. 
Methods: Secondary data analysis was done using self-report questionnaires administered across four time points, and a fifth time point was collected to further expand the data. Multiple regression analyses evaluated the hypotheses across the 100 individuals (mean age=19.45, 85% female) who completed measures both pre- and post- school closure. Repeated measures regression analysis was utilized across the 1201 individuals (mean age=19.43, 76.7% female) who completed measures solely during a single time point.
Results: There was a significant decrease in sleep quality when looking across all five time points (F(1,1199)=12.49, p&lt;.001), although sleep quality initially did not change from pre-pandemic to the first time point. Worry about COVID-19 was the primary mediator of worsened sleep quality across studies (F(1,94)=4.66, p=.033 and F(1,370)=48.64, p&lt;.001 respectively), although mental health difficulties were not consistent moderators. Screen use changes was only significant within study two (F(1,518)=357.58, p&lt;.001).
Conclusion: These findings help further explain the consequences of COVID-19 stay-at-home orders upon college students. Sleep quality worsened as the pandemic and social distancing measures continued. Those who viewed the pandemic as more of a threat and experienced more worry about it in particular were vulnerable to developing sleep problems, particularly if they were engaging in more social distancing measures. Additionally increased screen use, particularly in relation to having virtual classes, decreased sleep quality. Beyond the role of light exposure and mental health difficulties, beliefs about COVID-19 were a primary determinant of sleep quality changes in college students. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The rising number of students with disabilities who identify as culturally and linguistically diverse (CLD) necessitates the use of culturally and linguistically responsive (CLR) instruction and related supports. Fourteen percent of English learners (ELs) have a disability (with disability as defined by Individual with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). School-based speech-language pathologists (SLPs) often support the communication needs of these students, especially for those students who are eligible for special education and related services as students with a speech or language impairment (S/LI). Characteristics of CLR practices may be reflected in a student’s individualized education program (IEP). However, there is little prior research describing CLR considerations for this population in a school setting. A total of 40 individuals from 14 states, completed an online, 22-item survey to reflect their use of CLR practices in existing IEPs for ELs with speech or language impairments. Participants also rated how often they use various CLR features in therapy and assessments with students who are ELs. Respondents varied greatly in their use of CLR features within an IEP of EL child with a S/LI. Participants reported that they never provide materials/progress notes in the child’s first language and never refer to use of child’s first language within the IEP. In contrast, approximately half of respondents reported that they always engage in culturally relevant practices in therapy. Additionally, most SLPs reported that they always or sometimes collaborate with other professionals in the school setting. Participants indicated that they sometimes use CLR features in goals they write within an IEP for a child who is an EL. The present study provides unique insight on school-based SLPs’ use of CLR practices. This offers implications for future training (i.e., ASHA seminars or school courses) and development of IEPs concerning the incorporation of CLR features and practices for children who are EL. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This thesis is devoted to the study of magnetic properties of strongly correlated quantum matters in one and two dimensions. The study employs predominantly numerical techniques, such as Exact Diagonalization (ED), Finite Temperature Lanczos (FTLM), and Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG), complemented by semi-analytical approaches. 
In the absence of exact solutions or controlled analytic approximations, numerical methods have profoundly impacted our understanding of complex many-body problems. 
Utilizing these numerical tools for investigating the ground state and finite temperature properties of quantum magnets, as well as understanding their non-equilibrium dynamics in cold-atom quench experiments, comprise the two major themes of this thesis. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The first part of this thesis, comprising Chapters~\ref{ch3}-\ref{ch5}, discusses the ground state properties, elementary excitations, and finite temperature behavior of various magnetic systems motivated by recent experimental observations.Elementary excitations often play a vital role in understanding the ground state and the finite temperature properties. 
Chapter~\ref{ch3} focuses on the significance of multimagnon (quasiparticle) interactions and their connection to finite temperature terahertz optical experiments on a ferromagnetic (FM) spin-$1$ quasi-1D compound.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapters~\ref{ch4} and \ref{ch5} jointly contribute to our understanding of magnetism in undoped and doped Mott insulators in magnetically frustrated systems. Chapter~\ref{ch4} discusses ``two coloring" and ``three coloring" exact ground state solutions of the 2D XXZ magnets at special points in bipartite (square) and tripartite (triangular) lattices. 
It further emphasizes the influence of these exactly solvable points on the other parameter space of this model away from the solvable points, which we explore using ED and large-scale DMRG simulations. 
In Chapter~\ref{ch5}, our focus shifts to investigating the mechanism of kinetic frustration in the moi\'re bilayer WSe$_2/$WS$_2$ compound, prompted by the intriguing observation of an increase in the Curie-Weiss temperatures as the density decreases below half-filling. 
While a definitive model for the bilayer system remains elusive, we employ both the Hubbard and $t-J$ models to shed light on their distinct magnetic properties across low, intermediate, and high temperatures. 
Underlying zero temperature phase transitions are analyzed using large-scale DMRG simulations, providing experimentally consistent results.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The second part of this thesis, comprising Chapter~\ref{ch6}, explores a new frontier in condensed matter systems, specifically the non-equilibrium dynamics of isolated quantum magnets, well-suited for cold-atom experiments in one dimension.  We explain the thermalization process in a generic isolated quantum system without a heat reservoir, drawing upon the Eigen State Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH). 
Focusing on the  Quantum Many-Body Scars (QMBS), the states weakly violating ETH, we study the real-time dynamics of two different quantum spin models.
We first analyzed the thermalization of various initial multimagnon states in the FM Heisenberg spin-$1$ chain, leveraging prior insights on multimagnon bound state formation due to onsite anisotropy ($D$).
Both thermal and athermal behaviors akin to those reported for QMBS are observed depending on initial conditions, which we explain with an analytic approximation that is accurate in the limit of dilute magnon density and small $D$. 
Secondly, the resilience of quantum scars in a bond-staggered Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain under a periodic local drive is investigated. Instances are found where the driven spin collectively thermalizes or fails to thermalize with the remaining spins, contingent upon the frequency and strength of the drive.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Characterizations of habitat use and ecological connectivity are essential components of a complete ecological understanding of any organism. Habitat use may be broadly defined as the behaviors that an animal exhibits in any scenopoetic context, while ecological connectivity comprises the multitude processes, whether spatial, geochemical, or genetic, that connect geographically discrete populations or assemblages. Such efforts are particularly important for imperiled, highly migratory species, which are typically comprised of reduced populations that exist in anthropogenically-reduced scenopoetic contexts. These species often face multiple threats with the potential to disrupt habitat use and ecological connectivity, and ensuring that these processes are preserved in these species is critical to their survival. However, these species are difficult to observe due to their vagile natures, and it is therefore difficult to holistically characterize baseline habitat use and ecological connectivity to inform conservation efforts. There is a need for research that seeks to fill in gaps in our understanding of habitat use and ecological connectivity in individual imperiled species, and that augments or develops tools to aid in these efforts, for pplications in both focal species and other imperiled species.Sea turtles (superfamily Chelonioidea) comprise seven highly-migratory imperiled species that face contemporary threats to their existence via the disruption of habitat use and ecological connectivity. Gaps in the current understanding of sea turtle habitat use and ecological connectivity include: 1) Limited knowledge of habitat use at relatively low-abundance nesting beaches; 2) Limitations of approaches used to characterize ecological connectivity between breeding and foraging areas, and to make inferences about habitat use at these areas; 3) Limited ecological knowledge of immature sea turtles; 4) Limited specific knowledge of resource use at high-use foraging areas; and 5) Lack of characterizations of genetic structuring and connectivity utilizing contemporary genetic markers. I undertook a multifaceted approach that utilized loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) as a case study to address these gaps, and to provide information to inform effective management efforts for this and other imperiled, highly-migratory species.
My work took place in four parts. The first (Chapter 2) addressed gap 1 by providing an important update to knowledge of nesting abundance and hatchling productivity for an understudied population of loggerhead sea turtles in the Gulf of Mexico, and highlighting the importance of site-specific management plans for sea turtles. The second (Chapter 3) addressed
x
gaps 2 and 4 by investigating the relationships between epibiont assemblages and tissue stable isotopes from nesting loggerhead sea turtles, and showing that epibionts have the potential to be informative towards sea turtle foraging ecology. The third (Chapter 4) addressed gaps 3 and 4 by characterizing the isotopic niches of foraging adult and subadult loggerhead turtles and providing evidence that loggerheads exhibit intraspecific niche partitioning between adults and subadults. The fourth (Chapter 4) addressed gap 5 by analyzing genome-wide SNPs from loggerheads nesting at four genetically discrete populations in the Gulf of Mexico and providing a higher-resolution characterization of structuring and connectivity between these populations, in addition to identifying putatively informative markers for future population assignments.
This work can serve as a foundation for impactful future studies into habitat use and ecological connectivity of, and the augmentation of management plans for, sea turtles and other imperiled, highly migratory species. Agencies responsible for management of nesting beaches or other reproductive units can make efforts to analyze high-resolution data on threats and productive output to inform management practices at a biologically relevant scale. Further investigations into epibionts in any host species could lead to the identification of indicator species used to determine where individuals have been prior to migration. Spatial, behavioral, and isotopic studies can help determine why and how lifestages partition their resources in loggerhead, and perhaps other species, of sea turtles. Agencies responsible for management of these assemblages can begin to account for that partitioning in management plans. Genome-wide SNPs have the potential to inform genetic structuring and connectivity and generate accurate assignments in species with metapopulation dynamics. Agencies responsible for management of imperiled marine species can take steps to ensure that existing genetic connectivity is maintained and that isolated populations receive adequate protections. Researchers can investigate dispersal, and agencies responsible for management can investigate the direct impacts of threats to specific populations, and ideally work to mitigate those threats, using genetic assignments. My work can provide impetus for these efforts to improve our knowledge of habitat use and ecological connectivity and to augment management efforts in sea turtles and other imperiled, highly-migratory species.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Motivationally significant stimuli activate motivational systems to support perception and action. Rewards are naturally occurring motivationally salient stimuli that activate approach behaviors, for example, effort for a reward. Two theories have been proposed regarding the impact of effort on subsequent reward salience. Effort discounting theories suggest that effort is costly and makes the outcome less salient. Comparatively, effort justification theories posit that the reward is more salient after exerting effort. Existing literature has supported both theories; however, the methods used (e.g., fMRI, behavior) were not temporally precise, so we extend this work by using electroencephalogram (EEG) to better understand the sequential effects of effort on reward processing. The P300 event-related potential has been used as a measure of motivational significance and is related to reward processing. The P300 is also associated with task relevance (experimentally manipulated significance) and stimulus expectations. Literature shows that P300 amplitude to reward feedback is increased following high compared to low amounts of effort, supporting effort justification theories or increased salience of the feedback after effort completion. Critically, however, these studies have failed to control for subjective stimulus expectations known to influence P300 amplitude. It may be that outcome feedback is more unexpected when more effort is required. When less effort is required, there may be no differences between expected and unexpected stimuli because participants can predict relatively well when the cue may be presented. To investigate the influence of both effort and expectancy on P300 amplitude to reward feedback we created a monetary reward task that varied effort and waiting, high and low amounts (duration) of effort (waiting), and expectancy. Expectancy was manipulated by having some trials countdown the number of presses left (countdown) as subjects exerted effort or waited, so participants know when the reward was coming. Alternatively, some trials stayed static (no countdown) and gave no information about upcoming reward presentation. From this task we also investigated mean differences in behavioral response rate, reaction time, and trial duration for effortful trials, and related the P300 amplitude to the behavioral measures. The initial study focused on these within subject differences, but it is known that effort for reward is disrupted in various psychological and neurological disorders, especially depression where anhedonia is a symptom that reflects problematic consummation and motivation for rewards. Indeed, P300 amplitude is consistently decreased in people with depression or anhedonia and may be a good biomarker of motivational salience deficits in people with anhedonia symptomology. Thus, we investigated relationships between P300 amplitude and self-reported anhedonia symptoms. We demonstrated that the amount of effort or waiting required influenced P300 amplitude—high effort amounts or waiting durations had larger P300 amplitudes than low effort or waiting, which varied by expectations. When subjects knew when to expect reward presentation (countdown), there was no difference between high and low amounts of either effort or waiting. Comparatively, when expectations were violated (no countdown), there was a significant difference between high and low amounts (durations) of effort (waiting). Additionally, effort for reward processing seems to be distinct from reward processing following waiting as P300 amplitudes were larger following effort conditions. The present study also demonstrated task effects on behavioral reaction times; when more effort was required, participants were quicker to start the trial, and participants that were faster at pressing across the task (shorter trial durations) had lower P300 amplitudes. Finally, individuals with lower experiences of pleasure or heightened anhedonia symptoms had blunted P300 amplitudes following effort compared to waiting conditions. These results provide evidence for effort justification theories and are interpreted within the motivational significance framework, which suggests salient stimuli in the form of surprising, unexpected, and task relevant reward stimuli may enhance attention and/or facilitate subsequent action by eliciting a larger P300 amplitude waveform. Moreover, the P300 was attenuated to reward feedback during effort conditions in individuals experiencing anhedonia symptomology suggesting disrupted processing of motivationally salient reward stimuli. Our results call for future investigation of expectations on reward processing in addition to task relevance.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this dissertation, I argue for a virtue-epistemological take on doxastic agency, doxastic reasons, doxastic obligations, and doxastic justification. After a brief introduction, in chapter 2 I argue in favor of doxastic involuntarism. I argue that, though the work of theoretical reason is to produce true beliefs, it does not do so in a way similar to how practical reason produces actions. I support this claim by focusing on the debate between doxastic voluntarists and involuntarists. I reframe this debate and then argue in favor of doxastic involuntarism, which has significant implications for theoretical reason. Many proponents of doxastic involuntarism characterize their view as one that denies that we can form beliefs at will. A sometimes-implicit assumption is that the formation of a belief is something that could, in principle, be an action. Their reason for why we cannot form beliefs at will is that there are various obstacles that impede us performing such an action. In contrast, I characterize the dispute between doxastic voluntarists and involuntarists as a dispute over whether the formation of a belief is an action, not over whether it is an action we can perform. I present an understanding of the nature of belief that implies that the formation of a belief is never an action. I use this characterization of the nature of belief in an argument in favor of doxastic involuntarism. In chapter 3, I argue for a new understanding of reasons for belief and doxastic obligations. I argue that, if doxastic involuntarism is true, then we should reconceive what are traditionally called reasons for belief. The truth of doxastic involuntarism would rule out a certain understanding of reasons for belief according to which they are necessary conditions for doxastic obligations. Thus, reconceiving reasons for belief would require reconceiving doxastic obligations. I argue that, in fact, a re-conception of reasons for belief warrants abandoning the notion of doxastic obligations, understood as obligations to form, alter, or relinquish doxastic states. Instead, the only sorts of obligations we would have that concern our doxastic states would be aretaic or practical. 
In chapters 4 and 5, I apply the arguments from chapters 2 and 3 to testimonial beliefs and doxastic justification, respectively. In chapter 4, I argue that a general feature of human psychology provides strong reason to modify or reject anti-reductionism about the epistemology of testimony. Because of the work of what I call ‘the background’ (which is a collection of all of an individual’s synthetizations, summarizations, memories of experiences, beliefs, etc.) we cannot help but form testimonial beliefs on the basis of a testifier’s say so along with additional evidence, concepts, beliefs, etc. Given that we arrive at testimonial beliefs through the work of the background, to be justified in holding a testimonial belief, we must not only have a rational speaker’s say so, but we must also form such beliefs in the right way. If this is right, then, contrary to typical anti-reductionism, justified testimonial beliefs require more than just a trustworthy testifier’s say so—another requirement is that they are formed in the right way. In chapter 5, I argue that what it takes for an agent to be justified in holding a belief is that the agent formed the belief in the right sort of way, which should be understood in terms of virtue epistemology. That is, in contrast to the predominant way of understanding doxastic justification—a deontological view according to which you are justified in holding a belief if and only if it is permissible for you to hold the belief—we should understand doxastic justification aretaically: you are justified in holding a belief if and only if your belief is the result of the operation of virtue. I argue that the aretaic account of justification is superior to the deontological one.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Robert Marcellus was one of the most respected clarinetists and teachers in the twentieth century. He was a performer in the Cleveland Orchestra and taught at both the Cleveland Institute of Music and Northwestern University. His students occupied positions in major orchestras and universities. The purpose of this research was to collect and compare pedagogical information from the experiences of Robert Marcellus’s students from both the Cleveland Institute of Music and Northwestern University. Interviews were conducted with J. David Harris, Diane Barger, David Bell, Steve Cohen, Kathy Jones, Lee Morgan, Michele Gingras, and John Weigand. A similar set of questions were asked to each interviewee. Questions pertained to participants’ time frame in studying with Mr. Marcellus, their experiences in private lessons, Mr. Marcellus’s communication skills, his personality, the studio environment, pedagogy, and syllabus of study. After all the interviews were completed, the results were analyzed to provide insight into his teaching. The information was categorized into six groupings: inspiration, communication, personality, Mr. Marcellus’s studio, pedagogy, and syllabus of study. The groupings were examined based on criteria for the interviewees: location of study, specific years in school, and length of study. Along with the analysis of the interviews, a full transcript of each interview is included. The experiences of his students are valuable in describing the teachings of Robert Marcellus.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Changes in cloud properties in response to surface warming have been consistently identified as the feedback contributing the largest uncertainty in the overall climate feedback parameter, which describes changes in top of atmosphere radiation balance in response to warming surface temperatures. The primary concern regarding clouds are twofold: (i) Clouds have competing influences on the climate. Their high albedo reflects solar insolation, cooling the climate system while simultaneously absorbing and re-emitting the radiation emitted by the Earth, a warming effect on the climate system. (ii) Clouds are inherently a subgrid-scale process for most climate change studies (such as those using global climate models), necessitating the use of a parameterization scheme. Here, an ensemble of models of many types in an idealized configuration of the tropical climate is leveraged to investigate how and why deep-convecting clouds change the way they do, what the resultant cloud feedbacks are from these changes, and how organized convection affects these changes and cloud feedbacks. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Deep-convecting anvils, independent of how cloud fraction is defined, increase in height, increase slightly in temperature, and (generally) decrease in cloud fraction with warming sea surface temperature while mid-level cloud fraction robustly decreases with warming. The response of tropical clouds to warming found in this work follows previously established physical reasoning, confirming this reasoning across a much larger ensemble of models that explicitly simulate convection than previously considered. The cloud feedbacks associated with these changes generally align with results using comprehensive global climate models and observations, especially for cloud feedbacks associated with tropical high clouds. However, when convection organizes, different cloud regimes become more important. There is an established understanding that organized convection alters the mean climate state. If convective organization is absent, the cloud feedbacks have a smaller magnitude. Amongst domains that have convective organization, if a domain is strongly organized, the cloud feedbacks are weaker and sometimes switch sign. This is primarily due to the impact of changes in cloud optical depth in the shortwave, specifically high clouds thickening (as opposed to thinning) with warming in strongly organized domains, as well as more strongly organized domains having more low clouds to begin with. The shortwave cloud optical depth feedback also plays an important role in causing the tropical anvil cloud area feedback to be positive which is directly opposed to the expected negative cloud feedback found in prior work. This calls into question the expectation for and assumptions regarding a negative tropical anvil cloud area feedback, particularly the role of changes in cloud optical depth with warming, especially given these simulations more accurately resolve convection.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this study I analyzed the relationship between access to COVID-19 testing sites and neighborhood characteristics before and after federal funding cuts to determine if socially vulnerable communities were more likely to be affected by testing site closures. This was studied across eight counties in Florida’s panhandle: Leon, Wakulla, Taylor, Madison, Jefferson, Gulf, Gadsden, and Franklin. For the purpose of this study, the study area will be referred to as the Capital Region (as it includes Leon County, which hosts the capital of Florida, and all of Leon County’s neighboring counties). This project has three objectives: (1) To create a Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI) that summarizes the social determinants of health in the region, (2) To investigate how levels of access to COVID-19 testing sites changed over time as a result of testing site closures, and (3) Lastly, to analyze access before and after federal funding cuts, and the change in access, in relation to social vulnerability factors. The geographic scale for these analyses is at the census tract level. To accomplish these objectives, I (1) generated SoVI to measure social vulnerability, (2) calculated the drive-times from the population-weighted centroids of each census tract to the closest, two closest, and five closest testing facilities to measure access; and calculated the difference in drive times before and after federal funding cuts, and (3) utilized Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) to analyze the relationship between drive times and social vulnerability. From the results, I detected which census tracts had the lowest access to COVID-19 testing sites and which were the most affected by testing site closures. I found that SoVI did not have a statistically significant relationship to access to testing facilities when accounting for spatial autocorrelation, which was counter to expectations. However, I found that there was a consistently significant relationship between rural census tracts and high drive times to COVID-19 testing facilities. Rural status was the only significant indicator of an increase in drive time as well. These findings highlight the need for more comprehensive strategies to address healthcare access disparities in rural areas. This study enriches the argument for the essentiality of public health federal funding and provides important insights on how federal funding cuts for COVID-19 mitigation efforts affect at-risk communities, specifically rural ones.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this research is to analyze how geographic accessibility changed as a result of closures to state-funded testing sites and to identify which communities are the most affected. These findings have important implications for policy makers and local planners because they can inform decisions related to the allocation of resources for public health services. Additionally, evaluating how changes in funding affect geographic access to testing can help guide future decisions regarding public health funding and resource allocation.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The intellectual merit of this research lies in its assessment of urban-rural disparities in access to testing sites and social vulnerability at a finer geographic scale than the extant research. Whereas most COVID-19 studies analyze accessibility and vulnerability at the scale of county-level units (e.g., Tao, et. al, 2020; Kim, et. al, 2021; CDC, n.d.), I measured these variables at the scale of census tracts. The application of SoVI will provide local governments with an evidence-based understanding of relative vulnerability across census tracts in the Capital Region and their capacities to prepare for, respond to, and recover from COVID-19. Because there is no standard for the number of testing facilities to consider in the drive-time analysis, I compared the findings from the closest, two closest, and five closest testing facilities and analyzed how the results changed. Furthermore, there are very few studies that examine the relationship between access to testing sites and social vulnerability. One relevant study conducted by Mullachery and colleagues (2022) analyzed vulnerability and access in 30 US cities, but none were in Florida or in rural communities. My project contributes empirical findings on unstudied regions impacted by COVID-19.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The broader impacts of my project are to demonstrate how critical COVID-19 federal funding is for disadvantaged communities. The findings of this study may help policymakers and healthcare providers better understand the needs of rural communities and develop targeted interventions to improve access to testing. The lack of a statistically significant relationship between access to COVID testing sites and SoVI suggests that other factors, such as rurality, may be more important in determining access to healthcare services, particularly for North Florida. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Students with developmental language disorder (DLD) have difficulty understanding and using oral language, and these difficulties negatively impact academic achievement. DLD has a prevalence of 7-8% of school-age students, yet research has shown that less than half of those students are receiving services.  Implementation of a screening tool in early elementary school has the potential to improve identification challenges of DLD in schools. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a comprehensive language screening battery that included seven language measures. The study aimed to identify what language measures were most predictive of overall language ability and determine what language measures resulted in the highest diagnostic accuracy for DLD. One hundred and twenty-six students were administered a screening battery that included sentence repetition, nonword repetition, listening comprehension, expressive vocabulary, receptive vocabulary, synonyms, and paired associate learning. All students were then administered the Core Language subtests from the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals-5th Edition (CELF-5). The CELF-5 served as the reference standard to evaluate the screening battery. A dominance analysis was performed to determine the relative importance of all measures as well as determine what models explained the most variance in the outcome. A series of logistic regressions were then used to determine what measures predicted DLD. Predicted probabilities from the logistic regressions were entered into ROC curve analyses to analyze diagnostic accuracy of various models. 
Results of the dominance analysis revealed that sentence repetition was the most dominant predictor of language ability. Adding additional measures to sentence repetition slightly increased the amount of variance explained, but the changes in R2 were not significant. Results of the logistic regression revealed that sentence repetition was the only consistent predictor of DLD. Preliminary results indicate that including additional measures with a sentence repetition task increases diagnostic accuracy. However, results related to diagnostic accuracy should be interpreted cautiously due to the small sample size of students with DLD (n=17).

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The aim of this work is to carry out convergence analysis and algorithm implementation of a novel sample-wise backpropagation method for training a class of stochastic neural networks (SNNs). The structure of the SNN is formulated as a discretization of a stochastic differential equation (SDE). A stochastic optimal control framework is introduced to model the training procedure, and a sample-wise approximation scheme for the adjoint backward SDE is applied to improve the eﬀiciency of the stochastic optimal control solver, which is equivalent to the back-propagation for training the SNN. The convergence analysis is derived by introducing a novel joint conditional expectation for the gradient process. Under the convexity assumption, our result indicates that the number of SNN training steps should be proportional to the square of the number of layers in the convex optimization case. In the implementation of the sample-based SNN algorithm with the benchmark MNIST data set, we adopt the convolution neural network (CNN) architecture and demonstrated that our SNN is more robust than the conventional CNN. To further demonstrate that our algorithm can be adopted to solve an array of problems (including high dimensional ones), we present the result of learning noisy functions of using SNN and demonstrate that SNN can capture complex noise level of the function very well. We also present results of solving the high dimensional HJB/Linear Quadratic Control Problems, by casting the problem in the control framework hence the SNN formulation.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>After the discovery of carbon nanotubes, boron nitride nanotubes were first theoretically predicted and successfully synthesized in 1995 by an arc-discharge method. Following that, other techniques for BNNT synthesis were discovered; however, growing highly purified BNNTs remains difficult. The research on the physical properties of BNNTs shows that they have a stable broad band gap, excellent mechanical strength, high thermal conductivity, and high oxidation resistance. These properties make them a perfect candidate for future nanocomposites for high-temperature applications. Interesting effects of BNNT addition with the resultant mechanical behavior and thermal conductivity in a matrix are observed when BNNTs are applied to form nanocomposites with polymer, metal, and ceramic matrices. Modeling and simulation methods of nanotube composites are highly advantageous in developing BNNT-based nanocomposites.This report presents a Ph.D. dissertation for assessing and developing multifunctional BNNT composites applicable in space or high-temperature composite structures. The report will cover the critical elements accomplished, focusing on the decomposition and high-temperature stability of BNNTs, high-precision polymer and ceramic SLA 3D-printed BNNT composites, hybrid composites, and nanotube composite modeling techniques.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation encompasses a series of studies aimed at characterizing the articulatory speech characteristics of individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) and healthy control (HC) speakers using perceptual, acoustic, and kinematic measures. The first study investigated group differences in perceptual, acoustic, and kinematic measures, while the second study explored changes in these measures during conversational, less clear, and more clear speaking conditions. The third study examined the predictive power of acoustic and kinematic measures for perceptual outcomes of intelligibility and articulatory precision.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Forty speakers, including 22 with PD and 18 HC speakers, participated in the study. Acoustic and kinematic speech data were collected simultaneously using the Wave System, an electromagnetic articulography device. Participants read the phrases “Buy Bobby a puppy,” “Tess told Dan to stay fit,” and “Carl got a croaking frog,” using three speaking conditions, including conversational, less clear, and more clear speech. Acoustic and kinematic measures were derived from corner vowel tokens and the /aɪ/ diphthong. Perceptual ratings of intelligibility and articulatory precision were obtained from 368 listeners through crowdsourcing.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Linear mixed-effects models were employed to analyze group effects (Study 1), speaking condition effects (Study 2), and the predictive relationship between acoustic and kinematic measures and perceptual outcomes (Study 3). Study 1 revealed that speakers with PD exhibited lower intelligibility and articulatory precision ratings, as well as compressed acoustic vowel space areas (VSAs) compared to HC speakers. Study 2 demonstrated that perceptual measures aligned with expectations (i.e., less clear &lt; conversational &lt; more clear), while some acoustic and kinematic measures followed the predicted trend (i.e., acoustic and kinematic distance), and others did not (i.e., kinematic VSA, F2 slope). Study 3 identified acoustic VSA and kinematic distance as strong predictors of intelligibility and articulatory precision, with a stronger association with articulatory precision.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In summary, these findings provide valuable insights into the effects of speech clarity cues on perceptual, acoustic, and kinematic measures of articulation in speakers with PD. By utilizing a multidimensional framework, a more comprehensive understanding of dysarthria's effects on speech articulation in individuals with PD emerges. Methodological considerations, including speech stimuli, measurement techniques, and speaker dialect, are discussed in relation to the study outcomes.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Deficits in cognitive processing, as measured by P300 activity, have been noted in older adults struggling with depressive symptoms, thus understanding factors that may influence cognitive processing are an important area of interest in the search to improve quality of life during older adulthood. Activity levels, such as physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior, is one such factor. Although literature pertaining to the associations between PA levels, sedentary behavior and depression in older adults appear abundant, much of the recent work investigates the relationship between interventions, such as bouts of exercise throughout a week, workout types, and fitness levels. There is an evident gap in knowledge on the influence habitual activity levels (day-to-day activity) plays on the cognitive aspects of depression in older adults. The goal of our study was to utilize neurophysiological measures collected during a Go/No-Go task, in addition to accelerometers, which collect continuous data on habitual activity levels and self-report measures to investigate the relationship cross-sectional relationship between P300 amplitude and latency, depression symptoms and objectively measured habitual PA in a sample of older adults (n=75). Although no association was found between P300 activity and depression symptoms, heighten depressive symptoms were found to have a significant relationship with longer periods of prolonged sedentary behavior (sedentary bouts, SBs), but not overall sedentary activity. Furthermore, increased No-Go P300 amplitude was associated with higher levels of Daily Lifestyle Activity (e.g. slow walking, grocery shopping) as well as, higher daily incidences of prolonged periods of sedentary and moderate-vigorous activity (MVPA). Moreover, Go-Infrequent latency was shorter among participants who had longer periods of MVPA. Age was found to be associated with increased P300 latency as well as, habitual activity levels, such that older members of the sample engaged in lighter habitual activity and less MVPA. Exploratory analysis revealed subjective reports of time spent walking and in MVPA per day were associated with objectively measured Daily MVPA and prolonged periods of MVPA. In contrast, subjective reports of sitting per day were not associated with objectively measured sedentary activity, showing a potential limitation of subjective measures. Taken together, the current project demonstrates the negative influence prolonged periods of sedentary activity has both on depressive symptoms and cognitive processing as measured through P300 activity, while exploratory analysis illuminated the importance of objectively measured habitual activity over subjective reports as a potential tool to better understand the elements of day-to-day life that impact cognitive and psychological functioning of older adults.  </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Statistical Process Control (SPC) tools are popular for monitoring system performance. SPC tools usually monitor the changes of the behavior of a sequence of noisy observations, called profiles, to validate whether the process of interest is operating under desired conditions over time. The challenges of a good SPC tool include quick detection of out-of-control (OOC) process and minimizing the probability of false alarms when the process is in-control (IC). The task of a change-point detection (CPD) tool, often used in conjunction with an SPC, is to identify the time-point when the process becomes OOC for the first time. We propose multiple nonparametric methods, including regression trees and random forests, to model the functional relationship of the observed profile with possibly multiple predictors/explanatory variables. We use a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic of the residuals at current and past time-points as the monitoring statistic. In addition to the first KS based test, we present a method where we smooth this KS statistic with Bayesian Bootstrap. To obtain our third SPC tool, we apply Universal Residuals along with Bayesian hypothesis testing ideas. In the latter SPC tool, we are able to perform a post-hoc analysis and develop credible intervals of the change-point time. We perform extensive simulation studies to assess the performance of our proposed methodologies and compare them among themselves and with other existing methods. For these comparisons, we use two logical performance metrics: average run length (ARL) and false alarm rate (FAR). We also compare these competing methods in terms of their computational costs. We conclude with a summary of their potential applications, advantages, and limitations of our methods. Our plans for future research include improving the Bayesian Bootstrap method using an informative prior, improving the post-hoc analysis of our Universal Residuals method, and further residual based SPC tools using Kullback-Leibler divergence and the Beta Distribution. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>During S-phase, the mammalian genome replicates in a defined temporal order called the DNA Replication Timing (RT) program. This program is developmentally regulated and is perturbed in diseased cell states, such as cancers and progeria. In recent years, the field has uncovered multiple layers of regulation of the RT program. These layers of regulation range from genome wide (Rif1), to chromosome wide (ASARs) and domain wide (ERCEs). Transcription is a process in the nucleus that tightly correlates with RT and has been suggested to be yet another way the cell regulates its RT program. Here I used a systematic approach to investigate how ectopic insertions of a series of transcription units in a late replicating domain influences the RT of that domain. Through this work, I show that transcription of a small gene is not sufficient to induce a RT advance. Since the only difference between the transcription units used in this study is the promoter itself, I posit that the local epigenetic environment built around the inserted promoter is critical for the ability of the promoter to induce a RT advance. Additionally, I present evidence that transcriptional activation using an inducible promoter can lead to a controlled RT advance. We also identified and characterized chromosome wide regulators of DNA RT, Asynchronous Replication and Autosomal RNAs (ASARs), across human autosomes. Utilizing the known features of ASARs, we identified 68 transcribed loci across human autosomes as candidate ARARs with allelic expression imbalance and asynchronous RT. Indeed, we discovered that five of these 68 transcribed loci share the characteristics and functionality of ASARs and classified them as novel ASARs. We further decoupled the RT of any particular ASAR allele from the RTs of the other allele, other ASARs on the same chromosome, and RT genome wide. Importantly, we showed that the RT of an ASAR allele was independent of the expression profile of the allele, which indicates that transcription is neither necessary nor sufficient to induce early DNA replication of the ASAR.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The evolution of the concept of penance during the Middle Ages in England reflects the influence of many geopolitical sources, as well as the expanding influence/maturation of the Roman Catholic Church and the development of sacramental rituals during this period.  One of these sacraments was codified as a result of the Fourth Lateran Council, which evolved the concept of penitence from an evocation of one’s personal relationship with God into a sacrament presenting the Church as the ultimate authority on the Christian afterlife. Prior to the advent of the Council and its doctrine, penitential writings such as the Soul and Body poems and the dream poetry of the time established penance as largely a personal matter, and the writings were more intended to convince the faithful to take reckoning of their own connections with the divine rather than to enforce penitential doctrine vis-à-vis the Church specifically. As medieval England accepted the Lateran Council’s doctrine and the Christian community began to place more emphasis on concepts such as mandatory Church-based confession and Purgatory, the religious perspective on the afterlife became more nuanced. In adopting a broader perspective on the afterlife, the Church was able to attract more parishioners, which in turn helped to spread the Church’s influence. Given this perceived rise in the importance of penance following the Council, it naturally becomes a topic to be explored in the literature of the period. Perhaps because of his use of the vernacular as well as his placement of classical pagan characters into some texts, Chaucer’s writings are not considered as openly religious as those written by some of his contemporaries; nonetheless, there exists an undercurrent of piety throughout several of his works that merits analysis. The most prominent of these works include Troilus and Criseyde, the Prologue to the Legend of Good Women, and the Canterbury Tales told by the Friar, Pardoner, and Parson. All of these draw attention to the importance of penitence despite their emphasis on classical mythology and then-current social themes. This thread culminates in the Retraction to his Canterbury Tales, which he presents as an apology for the faults found in his complete body of works and as a personal plea for the grace of both God and his audience. Through his use of the Retraction and apologies, Chaucer brought religious and penitential themes to the attention of his largely secular court audience. In turn, because he wrote for the courtiers and not for the Church or a specifically religious patronage, he was provided a forum from which to point out the flaws he found apparent in aspects of the Church and its representatives while still incorporating Christian penitential messages in his writings.Coinciding with his discussions of penance, also notable within Chaucer’s works is the fact that he presents personal intent or “entente” as a theme within his writings. This concept appears within several of the Canterbury Tales, most notably those told by the Pardoner and Friar, but is also referenced in Troilus’s prayers to the God of Love and in Chaucer’s defense of his writings in the prologue to the Legend of Good Women. Given the myriad interpretations of his works, his use of these concepts invites the question of his regard for the import of penitential intent and contrition. This becomes especially important in that it reflects on the Retraction to his Canterbury Tales, wherein he rescinds nearly all of his most famous literary works ostensibly in the name of repentance for having created them. It is possible to interpret the Retraction in multiple different ways as well, from a genuine plea for forgiveness in the face of death to a way to promote himself or escape criticism by the Church. This is indicative of the larger issue surrounding the interplay between Chaucer’s notions of intent and his treatment of penance. When viewed in this light, the Retraction becomes a tool used to draw focus to Chaucer’s true intent in constructing his texts. The goal of this examination is to consider Chaucer’s use and discussion of penitential concepts to argue that he presents a thematic progression regarding representations of penance between Troilus and Criseyde, the Prologue to the Legend of Good Women, and the Canterbury Tales, moving from what may be described as a more personal, albeit playful, take on the concept in Troilus to more institutionalized interpretations in the Legend’s Prologue, the Canterbury Tales, and its accompanying Retraction. This exploration of penitential history resembles the evolution of penitential concepts across the whole of the medieval period.

            <DISS_para>The objective of this study was to gain knowledge as to the impact of the use of light, materiality, and access to nature in reducing stress in hotel lobbies. This topic rose to importance with the rise of the pandemic of 2020 as safety precautions began to change and people stopped traveling completely. In order for hotels to regain business, they would have to rethink their design to accommodate people’s stress levels, as they have become hyper aware of their interior surroundings having been stuck in their homes for long period of time.	With little research president on this topic area, this study sought to gain knowledge from a review of literature and original research on which biophilic design elements are most effective in reducing stress levels of parents traveling with young children to child friendly, resort style hotels. The elements studied were materiality, light, and access to nature. This study examined three hotels of varying affordability in the Orlando, Florida area and the researcher chose to examine three high traffic zones of the lobby including the entry, seating, and check-in desks. 
	After using a snowball sampling technique to reach a sample size of fifty participants, the researcher came to the conclusion that of the three biophilic design elements, access to nature was most effective in reducing feelings of anxiety in high traffic zones of resort style hotel lobbies. A virtual survey helped the researcher come to these conclusions as well as hotel lobby observations and cataloging images and behaviors. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>An experimental study was conducted to examine the effects of shared book reading and video viewing on preschoolers' vocabulary and knowledge acquisition in informational text. The study included 60 preschool children who were randomly assigned to three experimental groups —shared book reading group, video viewing group, and shared book reading plus video viewing group. The content in the book and the video clip was equivalent, since the book was an exact transcript of the video, meaning children received the same information content and similar visual images in both media. What was varied was that the images in the print version were static while in the video were animated with music, which represented the distinct differences between the two media. Baseline vocabulary and knowledge measures about the content of the book/video were administered to all children prior to the experiment. After the pretests, children in the shared book reading group were read aloud the book twice, children in the video viewing group watched the video clip twice, and children in the shared book reading plus video viewing group were read aloud the book once and then watched the video once. Thereafter, children's vocabulary and knowledge acquisition were assessed. The Simple Slopes Analysis revealed statistically significant differences between the groups on the dependent variables of vocabulary and knowledge, controlling for the pretest scores, TOPEL, age, gender, race, and socioeconomic status (SES). In terms of vocabulary acquisition, the results demonstrated that there were significant differences between the shared book reading and two-media groups, and between the shared book reading group and the video viewing group when children’s scores were one standard deviation below the mean, with better outcomes for children in the two-media and video viewing groups. Also, there was a significant difference between the shared book reading group and video viewing group when children’s pretest scores were at the mean, with better outcomes for children in the video viewing group. As for knowledge acquisition, there were significant differences between the shared book reading group and video viewing group, as well as between the two-media group and the video viewing group when children’s pretest scores were one standard deviation above the mean, with better outcomes for children in the video viewing group. Cross-classified generalized random-effects (CCGRE) models were used to explore the extent to which the repetition frequencies and difficulty levels of the words influenced vocabulary acquisition. After controlling the pretest scores, both word repetition frequency and difficulty level explained the variance on vocabulary acquisition, with difficulty level explaining more variance than repetition frequency. The discussion of the findings and null findings is followed by limitations and suggestions for future research. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation aims to present a more compelling and transformative religious-moral framework for environmental behavior. It specifically seeks to offer alternatives to prevalent Anglo-European, Christian approaches such as dominion, stewardship, and theocentric models, which view nonhuman nature primarily as resources to be controlled, conquered, or utilized for the benefit of humanity’s material or spiritual well-being. These frameworks fall short in fostering a truly transformative shift in our relationship with the environment. To achieve this, it a new religious-moral framework that recognizes the intrinsic value of nature and considers nonhumans as ends in themselves is required.One promising approach that comes close to such a model is known as “Christian animism.” Christian animism endeavors to establish a fundamental connection or compatibility between Christianity and Animism, aiming to guide Christians towards more environmentally conscious behavior and worldviews. However, existing scholarly work on Christian animism primarily focuses on constructing theological justifications for adopting this framework, often overlooking the longstanding incorporation of Christian and Animist worldviews among various indigenous groups in North America.
To address this oversight, my manuscript examines how American Indian movements have merged their traditional Animist cosmologies with Christian worldviews as a means of adapting to changing socio-political contexts during the era of colonization. Emphasizing the ecological implications of this adaptive strategy, I align decolonization efforts with the creation of new frameworks for environmental conduct in a time of escalating climate crises. By recognizing the historically marginalized indigenous teachings, practices, and ecological wisdom as legitimate and potentially superior, this research challenges the colonizing “rational” Anglo-European understandings of nature that have arguably contributed to significant global environmental damage.
Employing historical, ethnographic, and textual research methods, I demonstrate how the religious and ecological assemblages of American Indians can enrich and inform the development of Christian animism. In return, I argue that when appropriately contextualized and guided by decolonial methods and objectives, Christian animism can reciprocally contribute to the spiritual and political aspirations of contemporary American Indian environmentalism.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Mental illness is an epidemic sweeping the nation and, more specifically, the world of education (Salerno, 2016).  According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] (2020b), approximately 4.4 million children 3-17 years old in the United States have been diagnosed with anxiety, and approximately 1.9 million diagnosed with depression. Roughly half of the children nationwide have experienced at least one traumatic event in their life (Sacks &amp; Murphy, 2018). For these and other reasons, Schmidt et al. (2015) asserted that mental health and suicide prevention are paramount concerns for schools and districts. Small rural districts and schools struggle with employing and contracting qualified school- and community-based mental health providers.  This qualitative implementation case study examined how small rural school and district staff members understand and prioritize the components of an evidence-based mental health program within a multi-tiered framework being implemented, and sought to better understand how school administrators, teachers, and mental health providers perceived strengths and weaknesses of the interventions associated with this program.Eleven participants made up of teachers, administrators, and district- and school-based mental health providers were selected from an elementary, middle, and high school. After analyzing the district mental health plan and semi-structured interviews, the findings displayed evidence that Suncoast County district staff somewhat to fully understood the components of the plan being implemented.  Six themes were extrapolated from participant responses related to strengths and barriers of the implementation of an evidence-based, multi-tiered mental health program.

            <DISS_para>Sympatric species may overlap in their use of spatial and trophic resources, which can increase the risk of competition. Comparing the ecological niches and quantifying the degree of niche overlap among these species can provide insights into the extent of resource overlap. This information can be used to guide multispecies management approaches tailored to protect priority habitats that offer the most resources for species. Stable isotope analysis is a valuable tool used to investigate spatial and trophic niches, though few studies have employed this method for comparisons among sympatric marine turtle species. For this study, δ13C, δ15N, and δ34S values from epidermis tissue were used to quantify overlap and compare isotopic niches in loggerhead (Caretta caretta), green (Chelonia mydas), and Kemp’s ridley (Lepidochelys kempii) turtles sampled from a shared foraging area located offshore of Crystal River, Florida, USA. Overall, the results revealed high degrees of isotopic overlap (&gt;68%) among species, particularly between loggerhead and Kemp’s ridley turtles (85 to 91%), which indicates there may be interspecific competition for resources. Samples from green turtles had the widest range of isotopic values, indicating they exhibit higher variability in diet and habitat type. Samples from loggerhead turtles had the most enriched mean δ34S, suggesting they may forage in slightly different micro-environments compared to the other species. Finally, samples from Kemp’s ridley turtles exhibited the smallest niche size, which is indicative of a more specialized diet. This is one of the first studies to investigate resource use in a multispecies foraging aggregation of marine turtles using three isotopic tracers. These findings provide a foundation for future research into the foraging ecology of sympatric marine turtle species and can be used to inform effective multispecies management efforts.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation considers the optimization problems that are in the form of minX∈Fv f(x)+λ∥X∥1, where f is smooth, Fv = {X ∈ Rn×q : XTX = Iq,v ∈ span(X)}, and v is a given positive vector. Clustering analysis is a fundamental machine learning problem with broad-ranging applications. Its aim is to group unlabelled data objects into clusters according to a certain similarity measure such that objects within each cluster are more similar to each other than to objects of another cluster. Several clustering problems can be formulated as such optimization problems, such as community detection, k-means clustering, discriminative k-means clustering, and normalized cuts. In this dissertation, three Riemannian optimization approaches for the clustering problems in terms of assignment matrix are proposed, which are ARPPG, AManPG, and Inexact_AManPG. It is proven that the domain Fv forms a compact embedded submanifold of Rn×q and optimization-related tools are derived. Global convergence analysis for Inexact_AManPG is then established. Numerical experiments on clustering problems including community detection, k-means, discriminative k- means, and normalized cut for image segmentation are used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed optimization approaches. ARPPG, AManPG, and Inexact_AManPG algorithms as with many other projection and dimension reduction methods, can have difficulties with time and space complexity when the number of clusters is not reliably known or too large. To address this limitation, we also propose a recursive version of Inexact_AManPG algorithm.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>There is a dominant Discourse that juxtaposes science and Black cultures. This Discourse limits who can be a scientist and creates a racist, seemingly-objective landscape in which Black individuals must persevere. This study examines a Black-centered informal learning space and its STEM tasks, termed FUBU Camp and FUBU STEM, to understand how Black learners perceive their developing racial, scientific, and positional identities with the research question, “How do the Black learners participating in FUBU informal settings approach and make sense of their racial, scientific, and positional identities through experiences as participants within the informal FUBU STEM setting?” I used the factor model of multiracial identity (Wijeyesinghe 2001; Wijeyesinghe &amp; Jackson, 2012), STEM identity development frameworks (Carlone &amp; Johnson, 2007; Hughes et al., 2020), and a positionality framework (Mensah, 2016) to analyze research participants’ voice stories about their experiences in FUBU STEM. In vivo and emotion coding was used to analyze research participants' accounts to create overarching stories of how they approached and made sense of their identities. Results indicate that research participants had various ways of leveraging positional and racial identities in FUBU STEM engagements in ways that helped them see themselves as Black scientists. Findings suggest that current science education conceptualizations of rigorous scientific tasks limit opportunities for Black learners to see themselves in science. Through identity-building tasks, research participants in this study saw expanded terms that incorporated other identities. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Internalizing disorders are a broad category of psychopathology in children characterized by children’s reactions to stress that occur within the self, such as emotional distress related to feelings of anxiety and depression. Perfectionism, which is defined as high standards of performance which are accompanied by tendencies for overly critical evaluation of one’s own behavior, is a well-defined risk factor for internalizing psychopathology in children and across the lifespan. Despite this risk, there is currently a lack of efficacious treatment options targeting perfectionism in children. Therefore, more research is needed to both a) understand maintaining mechanisms of perfectionism in children, and b) continue the development and investigation of treatments targeting those factors. 	Chapter 2 describes the development and evaluation of a measure of a novel construct hypothesized to be relevant to the development of perfectionism in children, parent sensitivity to children’s errors, described as the extent to which parents are distressed by their children’s mistakes. Exploratory factor analysis revealed a stable 3-factor structure consisting of Checking Behaviors, Evaluative Worry, and Emotional Investment. Total and individual factor scores demonstrated good internal reliability and associations with relevant constructs. Mediation models demonstrated that parent sensitivity to child errors predicted overprotective parenting behaviors, which in turn predicted child anxiety symptoms. These data demonstrate that parent sensitivity to child errors may be one important factor that can contribute to parenting behaviors that increase risk for perfectionism and associated psychopathology in children.
	In Chapter 3, I developed and evaluated the efficacy of a novel intervention targeting perfectionism in children. This intervention consisted of a single, virtual study visit in which both parents and children were encouraged to decrease certain behaviors related to perfectionism in children. There were no group differences on primary outcomes of perfectionism or related internalizing symptoms. However, post-hoc analyses suggested that parents and children in the control group decreased perfectionism-related behaviors, and that these behavior reductions predicted decreases in perfectionism and internalizing symptoms regardless of group assignment. Overall, these data suggest that parents and children are able to decrease perfectionism-related behaviors following a single study visit, and that reductions in these behaviors can be an effective approach for treating perfectionism and related internalizing symptoms.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Objectives: The Latinx population is one of the fastest growing minority groups in the United States, with a current population of around 60 million people, they make up roughly 18% of the US population. The current study examined the relationship between ethnic identity, self-efficacy, academic adjustment, and anxiety symptoms in Latinx undergraduates.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Methods: Sample consisted of 155 participants (Mage = 20.4, SD = 1.67; 72.7% female). Ethical approval was granted by Florida State University Institutional Review Board (IRB) (Study ID: STUDY00003509). Participants completed an online Qualtrics questionnaire available to eligible students using FSU’s secure network (Qualtrics Software, 2021). Completion of the survey questionnaire took approximately 35-40 minutes.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Results: No domains of ethnic identity (exploration, resolution, affirmation) were correlated with symptoms of general anxiety (r = .010, p &gt; .05; r = .036, p &gt; .05; r = -.135, p &gt; .05) respectively. Results found college self-efficacy significantly mediates the effect of ethnic identity-exploration on academic adjustment with an estimated standardized indirect effect ab = 0.11, 95th percentile bootstrap CI [.05, .11]; p&lt;.01, and standardized direct effect c = .125 , 95th percentile bootstrap CI [-.04; .281]; p&gt;.05).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Conclusion: As the Latinx college population continues to increase, researchers in this area of development must pay close attention to all aspects of the college environment that may influence Latinx outcomes. Ethnic identity, college self-efficacy, and academic adjustment were all shown to positively correlate with one another, emphasizing the need to continue research on how higher levels of ethnic identity may promote successful academic adjustment</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Genes with moderate to low expression heritability may explain a large proportion of complex trait etiology, but such genes cannot be sufficiently captured in conventional transcriptome-wide association studies (TWASs), partly due to the relatively small available reference datasets for developing expression genetic prediction models to capture the moderate to low genetically regulated components of gene expression. In the first chapter, we introduce a method, the Summary-level Unified Method for Modeling Integrated Transcriptome (SUMMIT), to improve the expression prediction model accuracy and the power of TWAS by using a large expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) summary-level dataset. We apply SUMMIT to the eQTL summary-level data provided by the eQTLGen consortium. Through simulation studies and analyses of genome-wide association study summary statistics for 24 complex traits, we show that SUMMIT improves the accuracy of expression prediction in blood, successfully builds expression prediction models for genes with low expression heritability, and achieves higher statistical power than several benchmark methods. Finally, we conduct a case study of COVID-19 severity with SUMMIT and identify 11 likely causal genes associated with COVID-19 severity.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the second chapter, we introduce a method, Comprehensive omics-phenotype association estimation using \textit{Cis-} and \textit{Trans-}regulated elements (ComPACT), to integrate genetic information from \textit{trans-}loci into classic association studies, by iteratively detect potential outlying locus. Like SUMMIT, ComPACT is also capable of utilizing summary-level data to construct imputation models. However, as an extension of SUMMIT, ComPACT do not require individual-level genotype data to do model tuning. We apply ComPACT to the deCODE summary-level data and construct 233\% more imputation models than the existing method. In addition, we verify that the selected models were statistically robust by validation using an external dataset, INTERVAL, and show that our pipeline had achieved similar prediction accuracy to using individual-level data. Finally, we conduct a case study of Alzheimer's disease and identify 207 likely causal proteins, whereas competing method identify 19 likely causal proteins.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation investigates the practical expressive power of machine learning models as general function approximators and their practical applications in optimal filtering problems. The practical expressive power of these models depends on the choice of \textit{model structure} (deep or shallow), which sets the upper limit of expressive power, and the \textit{trainability} of the model, which enables the realization of the expressive power in practical applications, such as regression and classification. Our primary objective is to enhance the practical expressive power and overall performance of neural networks (NNs) by improving their trainability. In addition to traditional machine learning tasks, we specifically focus on the optimal filtering problem, which holds significant importance in science and engineering. When addressing the representation of filtering density in optimal filtering problems, we adopt a similar rationale for practical expressive power by considering the \textit{model structure}, which determines the theoretical capacity for storing probability distributions, and the \textit{trainability}, which determines the optimization cost for utilizing the expressive power of the model to approximate the filtering density. By carefully balancing these two factors, our aim is to enhance the overall performance of optimal filtering problems.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para> The first part of the dissertation focuses on enhancing the practical expressive power of neural networks by improving their trainability. To achieve this, we first introduce the concept of the general activation transform (GAT) as a generalization of the traditional elementwise activation function in the function space. The GAT can be derived from the general deep neural networks (GDNNs) framework, in which the affine transformations in traditional deep neural networks (DNNs) are replaced with integral transforms, with a finite-rank parameterization of the weight integral kernels. The GAT maps the input vector into the function space by treating the input vector as coefficients of the input basis function, performing activation on the state function, and generating the output through integration with the output basis function. We specifically focus on GAT-ReLU, a variant of GAT with ReLU activation, which exhibits enriched activation patterns and smoother solutions compared to traditional ReLU activation. By selecting proper basis functions (continuous and high-variation), GAT-ReLU enhances the practical expressive power of the model, which is demonstrated by many numerical experiments. Apart from GAT, we introduce transferable neural networks (TransNet) for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by reducing the optimization difficulty through the idea of transfer learning. The construction of transferable neural feature spaces involves re-parameterization of hidden neurons and auxiliary functions. Theoretical analysis validates the high quality of the resulting feature space, characterized by uniformly distributed neurons. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and improved transferability of our proposed method across different PDEs.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The second part of this dissertation concentrates on addressing the optimal filtering problem by different choices of representations for filtering density. This involves considering the model's theoretical capacity for representing probability distributions and the associated optimization cost for approximating the distributions. By carefully balancing these factors, we aim to develop effective approaches for solving the optimal filtering problem. We first introduce an adaptive kernel method that utilizes a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to represent the probability density function (PDF) within the Bayesian framework. The state dynamics are formulated using the Fokker-Planck equation, and the PDE operator is decomposed into linear and nonlinear parts. The linear part is analytically incorporated into the GMM model, while the nonlinear part is approximated using an adaptive kernel algorithm. Bayesian inference is applied to each Gaussian component in the GMM to incorporate observational data. We also provide many numerical examples to validate the performance of the GMM representation in solving nonlinear filtering problem. In addition, We also explore the use of score-based models for solving optimal filtering problems, where the score function (gradient of the logarithm of the PDF) plays a central role in representing the filtering density. We train score-based generative models to approximate samples from the prior distribution, and by combining the learned score functions of the prior and likelihood, we can directly generate samples from the posterior distribution. Score-based models leverage the high capacity of deep neural networks (DNNs) to effectively capture non-Gaussian and high-dimensional distributions. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, showcasing its ability to handle high-dimensional (up to 100 dimensions) and highly nonlinear filtering problems effectively.</DISS_para>
