         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this dissertation, fluorescence and microfluidics-based methods to study biological dynamics of pancreatic islets of Langerhans are described. The approaches discussed are all able to house biological tissues and keep them viable throughout experiments, stimulate them with dynamic secretagogue patterns, and measure their biological responses rapidly and at high resolutions, all in one consolidated platform. Although the methods presented herein were initially developed for the study of pancreatic islet biology, it is expected that these systems are versatile and effective enough to be incorporated as tools for the study of other biological systems.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) from pancreatic islets is the primary biological focus in this work. Pulsatile insulin secretion into the portal vein from the many pancreatic islets of Langerhans is critical for efficient glucose homeostasis. It was demonstrated that under constant glucose (11 mM), groups of islets in a PDMS (polydimethyl siloxane) islet chamber demonstrate asynchronous insulin oscillations which can be directly correlated to intracellular [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]i) in islet β-cells. Stimulation of these cells with the muscarinic agonist carbachol (CCh) promotes transient synchronization of glucose-induced oscillations of ([Ca2+]i). However, only short-term synchronizing effects of these muscarinic agonists have been reported previously in the literature.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The entrainability of glucose-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations to rhythmic pulses of CCh on a longer timescale were explored in this project. A piezoelectrically actuated, pressure-driven fluid delivery system and a PDMS microfluidic device were used to stimulate murine islets with various CCh pulse patterns. Keeping the effective concentration and pulse period of CCh constant (~5.7 μM and 10 s, respectively), inter-pulse rest times were varied and islet activity was measured by [Ca2+]i fluorescence imaging using a Ca2+-sensitive fluorescence reporter, Fura-PE3 (Fura-PE3). For an entrainment mode of x:y, there were x [Ca2+]i peaks per y CCh pulse(s). Periodic CCh pulsing with rest times of 2 and 5 min entrained islets 1:1, although in some cases, the shorter rest time produced 2:1 entrainment, with islets oscillating at twice the CCh period. Rest times of 10 min resulted in 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3 entrainment patterns, depending on the natural oscillation frequencies of the islets. It was also demonstrated that randomly-spaced CCh pulses can synchronize islets, obviating the need for a periodic neural pacemaker to achieve islet synchronization.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>While [Ca2+]i imaging is sometimes an acceptable proxy measurement for insulin in these tissue assays, detection of insulin secretion dynamics in response to secretagogues are preferred. To enable rapid measurements of secretion dynamics from a single islet in a manner that will be convenient for implementation in non-specialized laboratories, an online fluorescence anisotropy competitive immunoassay for insulin on a microfluidic platform was developed. A squaraine rotaxane, SeTau-647, was used to label insulin as a fluorescence reporter in the competitive assay to quantitatively record dynamic insulin output. This fluorophore has a favorable lifetime (3.2 ns) and quantum efficiency (60%) compared to a more general use red dye like Cy5. Performing the assay with both dyes, the dynamic range using SeTau-647 was 45% greater than that with Cy5; S/N of fluorescence measurements using the squaraine rotaxane was 56% higher.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This separations-free assay was then applied to monitor, for the first time, hormone release dynamics from groups of CCh-stimulated murine islets. The piezoelectrically controlled fluid perfusion system delivered 30 s long, 10 µM CCh pulses every 5 min into a glass chip housing groups of 4-5 islets in a 120 nL chamber. Compared to the previously used passive, gravity-driven perfusion system, this more robust and stable microfluidic system enhanced temporal resolution 3-fold to 36 ± 1 s, enough to elucidate insulin oscillation dynamics. With this methodology, distinct 5 min period insulin oscillations were observed indicating 1:1 entrainment by the CCh pulses. Without CCh, islets were unsynchronized resulting in diminished insulin pulsatility. These new insulin measurements support the hypothesis that islet synchronization is controlled by parasympathetic stimuli that periodically or aperiodically provide coordination through cholinergic signaling. The spectroscopic online assay is versatile and can be scaled to higher-throughput screening formats not only for insulin-based assays, but for other biologically significant signaling molecules such as glucagon and somatostatin., With this system, insulin antibody consumption is reduced from $66 for a triplicate hour-long insulin ELISA to $0.90 for a single 1 hour anisotropy experiment.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The next phase of this homogeneous insulin-sensing system involved exploiting the scalability of the fluorescence anisotropy insulin measurement to develop building blocks for a high throughput assay through which online insulin measurements from single islets in parallel could be achieved on a single device. This approach has the potential to rapidly increase the rate and efficiency at which information about islet behavior in specific environments could be learned.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Towards this, a radial microfluidic channel design was fabricated to house several islets in unique parallel chambers. A prototype device was made in PDMS to test the ability of the perfusion system to deliver predictable stimulus profiles to each islet in the radial design. For these proof of concept studies, the prototype, containing a more simplified channel network with 9 parallel islet chambers, was designed specifically for [Ca2+]i imaging. Initial step-change experiments with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) showed the fluid delivery patterns to the radially distributed islet chambers in the PDMS device.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Massive stars play a crucial role in the universe. Yet, our understanding of massive stars remains incomplete due to their rarity, short lifetimes, complexity of binary interactions, and imprecise Galactic distances. An important challenge is to understand the physics and relative importance of steady and eruptive mass loss in the most massive stars. For example, the luminous blue variable (LBV) is one such poorly constrained class of eruptive stars. LBVs are the brightest blue irregular variable stars in any large star-forming galaxy. They can achieve the highest mass-loss rates of any known types of stars, and they exhibit a wide diversity of irregular and eruptive variability. In the single-star scenario, the hypothesis is that most stars above ~30 solar mass pass through an LBV phase. However, the relative isolation of LBVs from O stars challenges this interpretation, and another hypothesis is emerging that the LBV phenomenon is the product of binary evolution. To test these hypotheses, we modeled the dissolution of young clusters and the separation between O stars and LBVs. We find that the single-star scenario is inconsistent with the observed LBV environments. If LBVs are single stars, then the lifetimes inferred from their luminosity and mass are far too short to be consistent with their isolation from O stars. This implies that LBVs are likely products of binary evolution. To further constrain these hypotheses, we must first infer the fundamental properties of LBVs such as luminosity, mass, and age. Ultimately, these depend upon accurate Galactic distances. Using Gaia parallaxes, we find that nearly half of the Galactic LBVs are significantly closer than previous literature estimates; these new distances lower their luminosities and their initial masses. We also infer a closer distance to the massive cluster, Westerlund 1, which hosts an LBV, 24 Wolf- Rayet stars, 6 yellow hypergiants, and a magnetar. Together these Gaia-based distances are more accurate (at least a factor of ten) and have consequences for the late-stage evolution of massive stars.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Individuation is the tendency to treat targets according to their unique traits and characteristics and not their categorical memberships such as race, gender, age, etc. An individual’s musical identity can be considered a unique trait or characteristic; therefore, the purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of melodic and labeling individuation training on young children’s implicit and explicit outgroup biases.  Forty-two young children served as participants and were assigned to one of three conditions: melodic individuation training, labeling individuation training, and mere exposure as a control condition.  Pretests and immediate, intermediate, and long-term posttests were administered on the Implicit Racial Bias Test (Qian et al., 2017a, 2017b) and a sociometric explicit racial bias test. Significant differences were found between time points using IRBT test scores. Significant differences found were short-term.  No significant differences were found between groups using IRBT scores. Further, no interactions between the two factors were found using IRBT scores. No significant differences were found between time points or conditions using explicit racial bias test scores. Further, no interactions between the two factors were found using explicit racial bias test scores. Descriptive analysis showed lower IRBT scores for the melodic individuation training condition than other groups at all time points following the pretest. Open-ended questions following the sociometric explicit racial bias test revealed that participants most frequently cited facial features, clothing, and fantasized scenarios as reasons why they selected targets in hypothetical relationship scenarios.  The findings of this study indicate, that for this population, melodic individuation training may be an effective intervention for reducing short-term implicit racial bias scores; however, explicit racial bias may be more resistant to remediation.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Despite billions of dollars spent and hundreds of studies conducted, there seems to have been progress made in meeting the housing and infrastructures shortages in Less Developed Countries (LDCs) (Akinyemi, 1988; Scott, 1998; Easterly, 2006). Theoretical constructs such as culture, geography and institutions (Huntington, 2000; North et al, 2009; Vanessa Watson, 2002, 2013; Acemoglu &amp; Robinson, 2012) have not been able to explain this deficit. Few studies have provided empirical evidence of factors that encourage citizens of LDCs to participate in community development projects. The objective of this study is therefore to identify such key factors and use them to develop policy recommendations that, when applied would give citizens of marginalized communities more autonomy in the design and implementation of fiscally and environmentally sustainable community redevelopment projects. Using an explanatory sequential mixed methods research design—beginning with a quantitative survey of 1,202 residents of Lagos, Nigeria and followed by an in-depth qualitative interview of a subset of these residents and other stakeholders—this study has determined which of eleven independent variables significantly affect the willingness of residents to participate in self-help community development projects. The quantitative study found that when a citizen group is in-charge (hereby termed “The New Deal”), the following factors are positively correlated with willingness to participate in self-help community development projects: age, home ownership, their home’s physical condition, and the inclusion of their homes, drainage systems and road ways in the work being done. The number of years of residence is negatively correlated with willingness to participate. Education level shows no association to willingness to participate in this procurement modality. The study further found that the aforementioned willingnesses to participate is increased when community elders express support for, or corporations donate money to, the project. The level of participation is unchanged when the government encourage citizens to participate. When the government is in-charge (hereby referred to as “The Status Quo”), the result is similar (though less eagerly, see Table 5.4) for most of the explanatory variables, except education is now negatively correlated; road improvement and age now show no association to willingness to participate. The subsequent qualitative study offered further explanations in support of the above findings, as well as clarification of anomalous findings of the quantitative study. Grounded theory application in the qualitative study found water, electricity, and security provisions as additional factors that affect residents’ willingness to participate. The overarching conclusion of this research is that while residents are willing (to varying degrees) to participate in community redevelopment projects in all three procurement modalities examined (i.e. Citizen Group, Government, or NGO in-charge), they are more eager to do so when they are given significant control over the management and ownership of the project (i.e. Citizen Group in-charge). This conclusion and associated findings helped develop a conceptual framework for a transformational approach to community development in LDCs. The two key tenents of this conceptual policy framework are: a) A collaborative planning approach with pivotal roles for community elders; and b) Alternative funding sources that include leveraging residents’ buying power. These tenents formed a new paradigm for procuring community development projects nicknamed “The New Deal Paradigm.” Successful implementation of this study’s policy recommendations would empower communities in LDCs to self-initiate, self-fund, and self-implement holistic redevelopment of their homes and surroundings, thereby creating jobs, improving health, and in the process, improving the trajectory of individual lives.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to investigate the perspectives of music educators whose parents did not possess a bachelor’s degree in contrast to the perspectives of music educators who had at least one parent that had attained, at minimum, a bachelor’s degree. Specifically, the researcher sought to explore four broad areas as it relates to continuing-generation and first-generation students who majored in music: (1) their demographics (2) their financial considerations (3) their college preparations as well as factors that influenced their pursuit of higher education, and (4) their campus experiences during college.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The participants (N = 440) for this study were music educators that were a part of the Tennessee and Florida Music Education Associations. Of the participants, 220 were first-generation college students, and the remaining 220 participants were continuing-generation students. Results indicate that the majority of first-generation participants were white and were even in terms of gender. First-generation participants had a greater tendency to rely on personal funds and federal aid to fund their undergraduate tuition but also had a more significant percentage of advanced degrees than continuing-generation participants. During their undergraduate years, first-generation participants were more likely to be employed and work more hours during college. In terms of their motivations to go to college, first-generation participants frequently cited their parents and their desire for a better life as the main motivating factors for wanting to attend college. When deciding which college to attend, the proximity to the institution in relation to home was a key component for many first-generation participants. First-generation participants were also more prone to have completed their pre-college applications without any assistance. These same participants were more likely to live with their parents during their first year of college and were less likely to participate in extracurricular activities. While first-generation participants, by and large, felt no pressure to attend college, continuing-generation participants felt that college was a requirement. Additionally, first-generation participants were largely unaware of programs that could help them in their transition to college and felt that their undergraduate faculty overall showed concern for student's development.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Efficient and effective visual search is important for organisms to survive, and failures of the search process (not detecting the searched for target or discovering it too late) can have dire consequences. One example in which search performance can have dire consequences is the search for camouflaged targets, for example in the context of the search for camouflaged enemy soldiers during military operations. The act of finding camouflaged targets is difficult and error prone, but Boot, Neider, and Kramer (2009) and Neider, Boot, and Kramer (2009) found that with practice camouflaged visual search performance can be substantially improved, and surprisingly that these improvements transfer to completely novel camouflaged targets and camouflage environments with little or no cost. This finding is surprising given the overwhelming evidence suggesting that training gains from one task typically do not transfer to even slightly different tasks. However, is this truly a case of broad transfer, or is transfer the result of specific strategies encouraged by the way previous studies constructed their stimuli and camouflage environments? Specifically, previous studies used structured, regular, repeating, and grid-like camouflage environments that might have allowed participants during training and transfer to simply develop a strategy of looking for breaks in this pattern. To address this issue, an experiment was conducted in which participants practiced searching for non-camouflaged targets, camouflaged targets embedded in regular, grid-like camouflage environments, or camouflaged targets embedded in unstructured, irregular camouflage backgrounds. After three days of training, participants then completed two camouflage search tasks: searching for novel targets in structured and unstructured camouflage environments. This comparison aimed to determine whether previous transfer was the result of specific strategies encouraged by the training and transfer stimuli. A third transfer task involved x-ray baggage screening to provide additional evidence for the possibility of far transfer. In general, it was found that participants in the structured and unstructured camouflage group showed a high degree of transfer to the structured camouflaged transfer task. This is surprising as participants in the unstructured camouflage group experienced a deficit in performance as they trained from session 1 to session 3 and did not demonstrate transfer to other unstructured camouflage environments. Participants appeared to be learning how to use salient deviations from camouflage backgrounds to locate whole objects in the camouflage visual search field in both camouflage training conditions, but this strategy appeared to be most effective and transferable when the background is repeating, regular, and grid-like. Far transfer as shown in previous camouflage visual search studies may be due to the stimuli and the structure of the task used rather than true far transfer, as all conditions there was not advantage at for camouflage trained participants compared to non-camouflage trained participants when transferred to the realistic x-ray baggage task.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Reintegration programs promote technical and vocational education and training (TVET) for ex-combatants, with the aim of helping them develop skills, assume new social roles, and gain community acceptance. This in-depth interview study with ex-combatants from Colombia participating in TVET examined the reasons and motivations they had for enrolling in technical education, and their perceptions of whether and how TVET contributed to their social reintegration, a critical factor in preventing further violence. Findings about ex-combatants’ reasons and motivations illustrated that through education, participants seek to be respected and recognized, set an example for their children, experience a moral transformation, and develop autonomy. These findings suggest that TVET’s assumptions that ex-combatants are only motivated by material factors such as money and employment are too reductionist. Further, findings about the role of education in the social reintegration of ex-combatants illustrated that some forms of TVET promoted psychosocial recovery, and built social support. Conversely, other types reinforced isolation and segregation. This study further found that TVET overlooked ex-combatants’ feelings of stigmatization and limitations to socializing imposed by violent contexts. These findings suggest the need to complement educational programs for economic development with approaches that develop social bonds and trust between ex-combatants and their communities.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Although behavioral consistency provides a theoretical basis for a variety of personnel selection procedures, this concept is not well defined and is operationalized differently across selection procedures. This lack of clarity limits understanding the validity of behavioral consistency-based selection procedures, as well as the identification of elements of these procedures that contribute to or detract from validity. There are two primary aims of this dissertation. The first is to provide a better understanding of what behavioral consistency entails and how it manifests in different selection procedures. In doing so, I employed the modular framework of employee selection (Lievens &amp; Sackett, 2017) to highlight similarities and differences among various behavioral consistency-based procedures. Second, I also used this framework to guide a meta-analytic investigation of the criterion-related validity of these procedures. Across 78 applicant samples (N = 26,377), I found that only 52% of behavioral consistency-based procedures utilize behavioral ratings (e.g., other procedures used KSAO-based ratings). In addition, the rating types used in the selection procedures were consistent with those used in the job performance evaluations in only 23% of cases. Further, the constructs targeted in the selection and job performance measures were consistent only 46% of the time, and meta-analysis revealed that higher levels of consistency increased criterion-related validity. Thus, a fundamental premise of behavioral consistency theory, namely consistency, often is absent in the operationalization of these procedures, which has implications for validity. Finally, two factors from the modular framework moderated predictive validity, such that a fixed stimulus format across applicants demonstrated lower predictive validity than less consistent formats, and response formats that were job-relevant tended to have higher predictive validity. Findings support behavioral consistency theory and highlight the importance of carefully operationalizing its fundamental premises, as well as the unique influence method factors may have on the criterion-related validity of behavioral consistency-based selection procedures.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation considers the theological writings of Vincenzo Gioacchino Raffaele Luigi Pecci (1810-1903), better known to history as Pope Leo XIII.  During his papacy (1878-1903), Leo began many important new traditions which have had a lasting impact on the development of the Catholic theological tradition.  While most scholars tend to focus on Leo’s social teaching, as expressed in his 1891 encyclical Rerum Novarum, I show that Leo made considerable contributions in other key areas.  Further, Leo’s papacy represents a critical lynch-pin in the development of the modern Catholic church.  In particular, I argue that his call for the revival of Thomas Aquinas as a key theological voice to respond to the challenges of the Enlightenment (Ch. 1), his arguments about the prudential use of the historical critical method of biblical studies (Ch. 2), and his numerous statements on the relationship between the Catholic Church and the modern state (Ch. 3) have all led to lasting and considerable theological developments.  By drawing attention to Leo’s work in these areas, I show that he is not merely a figure of history, but one whose teachings and arguments still reverberate within the Catholic church.  In addition, by giving a more complex treatment of the context of his writing and the wider scope of his theology, I problematize some of the common characterizations of Leo as a “conservative” pope.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In the present work, excited state proton transfer (ESPT) was investigated for a variety of applications with two main areas of focus; its excited state super acidity and its uniquely large apparent Stokes shift. When a molecule absorbs a photon in enters an excited state in which the electron density of the molecule rearranges. In some molecules this electron density shift occurs away from a proton which causes the proton to become more labile and therefore more acidic. The increased acidity allows for proton transfer to occur either inter or intramolecularly. In the first chapter of this work intermolecular ESPT was used to enantioselectively protonate a silyl enol ether to generate a chiral cyclic ketone. Utilizing the axial chirality of Br-VANOL coupled with its ESPT capable aromatic alcohols, 1-phenyl-2-(trimethylsiloxy)cyclohexene was protonated to yield an enantiomeric excess (ee) of 35%. This property was extended to a variety of other silyl enol ethers to demonstrate the versatility of this method. During our investigations into this system we attempted to use BINOL, a compound with similar axial chirality to VANOL, but observed no ee under the same conditions. Later this was found to be the result of an excited state racemization process that occurs after BINOLs proton transfer. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Further attempting to use ESPT to influence the chirality of atropisomeric compounds we coupled chiral auxiliary groups to BINOL then irradiated the molecule to induce the racemization event which was detrimental to our last system mentioned above. In the presence of a suitable proton acceptor irradiating BINOL causes ESPT to occur, and BINOL enters a planar excited state.  From this planar excited state BINOL relaxes then rotates one direction or the other as it reenters the ground state. The addition of a chiral auxiliary group induces a preference for rotating in one direction over the other initially resulting in ee of 25% for our prototypical system. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this work was that the ee of the molecule was found to be entirely dependent on the nature of the chiral auxiliary group, and that starting from any other ee of BINOL coupled to the same chiral auxiliary group yields the same ee. These results indicate the presence of a photostationary equilibrium ee. Changing the chiral auxiliary group to Boc protected phenylglycine yielded an ee of up to 63%. After the generation of the enantioenriched compound the chiral auxiliary group is easily cleaved by LiOH at room temperature to yield pure enantioenriched BINOL.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The second half of this work is focused on the unique photophysical properties of ESIPT (excited state intramolecular proton transfer), most notably its potentially large apparent Stokes shift.  When a fluorophore undergoes ESIPT the electron density shifts away from the proton containing moiety and towards a proton accepting moiety. The result of this reorganization is that the fluorophores tautomerizes into a “keto” form. From this keto state it may relax to the ground state by emitting a photon which can be red shifted by hundreds of nanometers which presents as an apparent stokes shift. Our first application of this feature was to utilize ESIPT dyes in a metal organic framework (MOF) to generate different colored emissive materials. By varying ratios of the R, G, and B linkers we were able to create a variety of different colored emissive materials including several shades of white with high color rendering index. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The final chapter of this work utilizes this same ESIPT apparent stokes shift as a highly versatile sensor for detection of metal ions and hydrazine.  By designing a fluorophore with a chelating moiety, we observed large spectral shifts when metal ions were successfully bound to the fluorophore. The changes to the photophysical properties was found to be dependent upon which MII ion was bound. Most notably ZnII was found to increase the quantum yield (QY) of this molecule to a maximum of 60%. When the ESIPT active positions were protected the emission was turned off, allowing it to then be turned back on with a suitable cleaving agent. This allowed for the rapid visual detection of hydrazine.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation is composed of three related papers, all using natural experiments from the state of Wisconsin to examine critical issues in education policy such as the importance of school funding and teacher compensation reform for student outcomes, and the role that teachers' unions play in the teacher labor market. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The first chapter examines the impact of additional school spending on educational outcomes. In Wisconsin, state-imposed revenue limits cap the total amount of revenue that a school district can raise for operating expenses. If a district wishes to exceed revenue limits to increase operational expenditures, it must hold a local “operational referendum.” I leverage close elections in a dynamic regression discontinuity (RD) framework that compares school districts that narrowly approve a referendum to those in which the initiative is narrowly defeated. Importantly, Wisconsin law requires school districts to hold separate referenda for operational purposes (e.g., instruction and support services) and for bond issues targeted to fund school facility investments. This allows me to estimate the independent effects of additional operational and capital expenditures. I find that narrowly passing an operational referendum leads to a 5% increase in per-pupil spending. Increases in operational funds result in a 25% reduction in the dropout rate, an increase in test scores of approximately 10% of a standard deviation, and a 15% increase in postsecondary enrollment. In contrast, narrowly approving a bond referendum leads to a sharp and immediate increase in capital outlays. These additional funds are primarily used to repair, maintain, or upgrade existing structures and are not associated with improvements in student outcomes. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The second chapter examines the impact of performance-pay teacher compensation schemes on the quality of new teacher supply. I exploit a shift toward performance pay in Wisconsin induced by the enactment of Wisconsin's Act 10 in 2011, which severely reduced the influence of teachers' unions in the state and gave school districts autonomy to redesign their compensation schemes. Following the law, half of Wisconsin school districts eliminated salary schedules and started negotiating pay with individual teachers based on performance. Comparing the quantity of teaching degrees in Wisconsin institutions before and after Act 10, and relative to those in similar states, I find that Act 10 led to a 20% increase in teaching degrees. This effect was entirely driven by selective universities, which suggests that the quality of the prospective teacher pool in Wisconsin increased as a result of the union reform. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Finally, the third chapter examines the short-run impact of a weakening of teachers' unions on student achievement. The chapter exploits plausibly exogenous variation in the timing of exposure to Act 10 due to differences in the expiration dates of pre-existing collective bargaining agreements across school districts. I find that the law reduced average test scores on the state's standardized exam by approximately 20% of a standard deviation. Results from quantile regressions indicate that this effect was largely driven by declines in the lower half of the student achievement distribution. I explore plausible mechanisms behind the observed decline in achievement, and present evidence that the law led to a significant increases in teacher turnover.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) is a widely accepted marker of prostate cancer recurrence. Genitourinary surgeons and oncologists are particularly interested in whether a surgery using robotic device improves times to PSA recurrence compared to non-robotic surgery for removing the cancerous prostate. Such survival times, as time to PSA recurrences, are typically interval-censored between consecutive clinical inspections. In addition, success of medical devices and technologies often depends on factors such as experience and skill level of medical service providers, thus leading to clustering of these survival times. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We present three novel methods for median regression of clustered interval-censored survival data. The first method is based on transform-both-sides model with Gaussian random effects to account for within-cluster association. Our second method ensures marginal Laplace distribution for the transformed log-survival times with a Gaussian copula to accommodate clustering. The third method, obtained as a special case of the second model, has Laplace distribution for the marginal log-survival times with Gaussian copula for within-cluster association. We provide Frequentist and Bayesian analysis for the three competing models with a comprehensive comparison among them based on model properties and computational ease. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Popular parametric and semiparametric hazards regression models for clustered survival data are inappropriate and inadequate when the unknown effects of different covariates and clustering are complex. This calls for a flexible modeling framework to yield efficient survival prediction. Moreover, for some survival studies involving time to occurrence of some asymptomatic events, survival times are typically interval censored between consecutive clinical inspections.  In this article, we propose a robust semiparametric model for clustered interval-censored survival data under a paradigm of Bayesian ensemble learning, called Soft Bayesian Additive Regression Trees or SBART (Linero and Yang, 2018), which combines multiple  sparse (soft) decision trees to attain excellent predictive accuracy.  We develop a novel  semiparametric hazards regression model by modeling the hazard function as a product of a parametric baseline hazard function and a nonparametric component that uses SBART to incorporate clustering, unknown functional forms of the main effects, and interaction effects of various covariates. In addition to being applicable for left-censored, right-censored, and interval-censored survival data, our methodology is implemented using a data augmentation scheme which allows for existing Bayesian backfitting algorithms to be used. We illustrate the practical implementation and advantages of our method via simulation studies and an analysis of a prostate cancer surgery study where dependence on the experience and skill level of the physicians leads to clustering of  survival times. We conclude by discussing our method's applicability in studies involving high dimensional data with complex underlying associations.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>“Book of Soft Joys” is a book-length manuscript of poetry. The poems are somewhat confessional, but their purpose goes wider than the speaker’s individual experiences, as they also examine community, romantic bonds, and how the animal world intersects with the supposedly sanitized human world. A heavy fixation on the spiritual underscores all of the poems, as the narrator’s answer to their troubles is a reliance on a higher power. The majority of the work consists of short narrative poems, poems that operate as miniature prayers. The poems do not arrive at a neat understanding of reality or wholeness, but they attempt to apply relevant lessons to the speaker’s experiences of falling in love, romantic troubles, friends’ suffering, and animal death that permeate the manuscript. The speaker’s aim is to grow in love, compassion, and awareness of reality, regardless of what sacrifices must be made to achieve those goals, and the collection is dedicated to pursuit of those principles, as well as vulnerability and honesty.</DISS_para>

      <DISS_content>
         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In the late 20th century, the Mohawks and Onondagas developed and sharpened their skills in their fight for environmental justice. These two federally recognized tribes in upstate New York faced a series of ecological challenges that resulted from decades of industrial development and municipal sewage discharges. By the 1990s, their lands sat adjacent to four Superfund sites, and the cultural and economic implications were devastating for Indigenous communities. Mohawks and Onondagas could no longer rely on the plummeting populations of once beautiful local fish populations and PCB toxins in the water made breastfeeding a dangerous proposition for Mohawk women. Their respective responses reveal how Indigenous communities responded to their respective ecological problems, and points to the diverging possibilities to protect lands and sovereignty in Indian country.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The Mohawks utilized various measures when confronting the realities of the industrial pollution that encompassed their reservation. Filing lawsuits, protesting, publicly denouncing industries and environmental agencies, demanding rights as sovereign nations when discussing site remediations, and creating a sophisticated environmental program were all measures undertaken as the Mohawks in large part successfully challenged the status quo and the establishment in seeking environmental justice. The Mohawks’ accomplishments are representative of their resiliency and perseverance in navigating various jurisdictional obstacles and regulations in their fight to have their voices heard on behalf of their community and environment as their reservation straddles the Canadian/American border.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	As the most traditional of the Iroquois nations, the Onondagas have taken their role as “environmental stewards” seriously in using creative methods such as gaining the support of their neighbors, receiving recognition on the world scene, and launching a major land rights case as they sought to fulfill their obligation to protect their ancestral lands’ environment. For much of the 1940s-1970s, the Onondagas focused on pressing the federal and state governments on issues relating to the sovereign rights of their tribal members and the Haudenosaunee Confederacy as bureaucracy limited progress in the remediation of their sacred lake. Yet, they started responded unrelentingly in the later years of the 20th century as environmental agencies and government officials began to take meaningful action in cleaning up the lake. To this day, the Onondaga Nation remains committed to protecting their ancestral lands in New York.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Additionally, the emergence and evolution of Indian and environmental policy throughout the United States and New York specifically accounted for the everchanging ability of the two tribes to engage actively and successfully in seeking environmental justice. The degree of implementation of these policies along with outside pressures also at times proved challenging for the two nations in their desire to reclaim their polluted environments and maintain cultural traditions.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Climate change is decreasing watershed glacial coverage throughout Alaska, impacting the biogeochemistry of downstream ecosystems. We collected streamwater fortnightly over the glacial runoff period from three streams of varying watershed glacier coverage (0-49%) and a subglacial outflow to assess how glacier recession impacts the relative contributions of glacier and terrestrial plant derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) inputs to streams. We show a decrease in the fraction of modern dissolved organic carbon (up to ~3,200 years old radiocarbon age) with increasing glacial meltwater contribution to streamflow. We use a dual isotopic mixing model (δ13C and Δ14C) to quantify the relative contribution of terrestrial and glacial sources to streamwater DOM. The endmember contributions were further compared to DOM molecular compositional data from Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry to assess whether DOM composition can be linked to streamwater DOM source in watersheds with varying contributions of glacial runoff. This approach revealed the glacial fraction was positively correlated with percent relative abundance of heteroatom containing DOM molecular formulae, aliphatics, and peptide like formulae, while the terrestrial fraction was positively correlated with condensed aromatics and polyphenolics. These results provide information about how the retreat of mountain glaciers will impact the composition and thus biogeochemical role of DOM delivered to downstream ecosystems. Our findings highlight that combining a traditional isotopic mixing model and ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry data can provide novel insights into how changes in watershed landcover impact the source and chemical properties of streamwater DOM.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This treatise explores chamber music involving flute of the Swiss-Russian composer Paul Juon. Three works are discussed in two chapters: the first focuses on his Sonate for flute and piano, Op. 78 and the second on two chamber pieces, the Divertimento for flute, oboe, clarinet, horn, bassoon, and piano, Op. 51 and Quintett for flute, oboe, clarinet, horn, and bassoon, Op. 84. Through these works, cultural, harmonic, and rhythmic analysis of his compositional style from 1912 to 1928 will be discussed in a historical context.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A full chapter will discuss Paul Juon’s heritage and unique life growing up in a Swiss-German family in the nineteenth century Russian Empire, infusing an uncommon artistic dichotomy of two cultures. From these beginnings, elements of Russian music and folk traditions in particular are analyzed in conjunction with his later German training in Berlin. Juon’s long career in cosmopolitan Berlin from the fin de siècle of the nineteenth century until 1934 did not silence any of the “Russianness” of his artistic output, creating an entirely individual and distinctive musical voice during his lifetime.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Through the chosen chamber works, the treatise highlights Juon’s style in respect to rhythm, meter, harmony, instrumentation, part writing, structure, and style. Historical and contemporary influences coming from his composition studies and fellow colleagues are compared and contrasted for evidence of Russian, German, and overall European stylistic components.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The last chapter surveys all recordings, editions, and available sheet music of each piece by Paul Juon. The significant impact of access and available resources sheds light on Juon’s relative obscurity outside Europe and Russia with possible outlooks for future research and performance.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The overall goal of the current dissertation is to improve understanding of how parents’ socialization and contextual factors influence children’s development of learning-related cognitions, particularly implicit theories of intelligence and failure mindsets. To achieve this goal, the present dissertation replicated a study that was originally conducted with parent-child dyads from a non-rural community with parent-child dyads living in a rural community (Haimovitz &amp; Dweck, 2016). Using the data from the original study and the replicated study, this dissertation is comprised of two studies which examine how parents’ and children’s learning-related cognitions, children’s perceptions of parents’ learning-related cognitions, and contextual factors are interrelated.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Study 1 tested core ideas from emerging theories of intergenerational transmission to document the accuracy of children’s perceptions of parents’ implicit theories of intelligence and failure mindsets and determine if the link between parents and children’s implicit theories of intelligence I and failure mindsets is explained by the accuracy of children’s perceptions of parents’ implicit theories of intelligence and failure mindsets. Study 1 considered if any of these linkages differ by family structure, parents’ level of education, and child’s gender. Overall, findings did not support that intergenerational transmission of learning-related cognitions occurred between parents and children for both implicit theories of intelligence and failure mindsets via the theoretical framework presented. Our results indicated a direct link between parents’ and children’s learning-related cognitions, which connotes some intergenerational transmission, albeit small in magnitude. Thus, our findings reject the premise that children’s accurate appraisal of mothers’ learning-related cognitions is an essential step in explaining the process of intergenerational transmission of learning-related cognitions. The results point to the importance of children’s perceptions of parents’ learning-related cognitions in the process of intergenerational transmission of learning-related cognitions. No latent mean differences emerged in mother’s learning-related cognitions, children’s perceptions of mothers’ learning-related cognitions, and children’s learning-related cognitions scores across all contextual factors. Statistical tests indicated no significant differences between correlation and regression coefficients across selected contextual factors, yet some noteworthy contextual differences emerged.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Study 2 determined the potential role of parents’ failure mindsets, or beliefs about the experience and consequences of failure (Haimovitz &amp; Dweck, 2016), in linking parents’ and children’s implicit theories of intelligence. Additionally, informed by human ecological theory (Bronfenbrenner, 2001) which argues that “context matters” this study explores the potential modifying effects of selected contextual factors (e.g., community type and gender) on associations of parents’ implicit theories of intelligence and failure mindsets with children’s implicit theories of intelligence. The primary finding of this study is that that parents’ failure mindsets explained a portion of the relationship between parents’ implicit theories of intelligence and children’s implicit theories of intelligence through complementary mediation in conjunction with other possible mediators not included in the present study for the entire sample and across community type, child’s gender, and parents’ gender. Observed differences in parents’ implicit theories of intelligence, parents’ failure mindsets, and children’s implicit theories of intelligence across community type, child’s gender, and parents’ gender were documented.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The goal of this dissertation is to explore Online News Association’s history, how it is situated within the nonprofit journalism association world in the United States, and explore major ONA initiatives including the role it has played in developing emerging female digital news leaders. In addition to capturing highlights of ONA’s 20-year history, one of the major outcomes was to record the views and perspectives of women identified as emerging digital news leaders who have graduated from the ONA Women’s Leadership Accelerator.  The core study group was 20 women who have completed the ONA WLA, and most are under the age of 40. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with the study participants in 2019 and early 2020. The female emerging digital news leaders shared their views and perspectives on ONA WLA as well as barriers and opportunities they see in the quickly evolving digital news spaces. Using a grounded theory approach, a thematic analysis was conducted to better understand the impact of ONA WLA and capture some of the female emerging digital news leaders’ work experiences in the 21st century.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Findings suggest that ONA is a change agent and thriving in the journalism association world at a time when some legacy journalism companies and organizations are struggling.  The ONA WLA training was often described as a “transformative” and “life-changing” experience by participants who praised the power of their cohort relationships and one-on-on mentoring.  Since completing the ONA WLA program, at least 60% of the 20 women interviewed have been promoted, assumed additional responsibility or changed jobs including 20% who are entrepreneurs.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Ecological dynamics perspective studies in sport assume that repeated interactions among teammates in real-time activities yield compound variables that specify behavioral characteristics of teams (Araújo &amp; Bourbousson, 2016). Based on the principles of the Social Network Analysis (SNA) approach, the Game-Based Interaction Networks (GBIN) method is used to quantify the passing synergistic proprieties of team ball sports during live matches. The current study was aimed at uncovering the unobserved collective patterns that distinguish among teams at different stages of expertise, while investigating the consistency of the structured networks over a prolonged time of one competitive season. The study included 66 soccer matches from the 2018/2019 season, from the La-Liga Spanish league, English Premier League, and German Bundesliga. Deploying a standardized taxonomy of sport expertise (Swann et al., 2015), one-way MANOVAs revealed that world-class elite teams were more likely to maintain higher density ratings, lower centrality ratings, and superior performance outcomes when playing against competitive-elite teams. Multiple linear regression analyses were applied to test the predictive power of the coefficient factors on each performance criterion. The results of the multiple regression analyses revealed that both, average clustering coefficient and weighted out-degree centrality, significantly accounted for 33% of the variance in overall number of passes, and that average clustering coefficient accounted for 23% in the variance of passes accuracy percentage, 9% of the variability in goals allowed, approximately 17% of the variance in goals conceded, and nearly 13% of the variability in expected goals. Moreover, one-way MANOVAs revealed that world-class elite teams presented relatively similar indices when playing against each other. Additional one-way MANOVAs revealed similar network topology among the competitive-elite teams. Visual network configurations support the observations of these results. Overall, the findings in the current study call for further applied and theoretical applications endorsing the GBIN method as an operational definition of team coordination in team sports. Limitations, future directions, and implications are discussed in detail.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>As part of their inherent work, museum personnel (both staff and volunteers) in almost every role, across every museum type, size, and subject communicate complex, interpreted, shared, disputed, communal, fallible, changing, and plural forms of knowledge — this is contentious knowledge. Yet, scholars have not previously explored the personal epistemology (the construction of meaning) of museum personnel — people with varying backgrounds, levels of education, and unique personal, physical, and sociocultural contexts, experiences, and epistemologies. From contentious knowledge, what meaning(s) do they create for themselves with the implication of potential transmission to visitors? The purpose for this exploratory qualitative descriptive study was to investigate the epistemic relationships between museum personnel and contentious knowledge. The study included a comprehensive literature review of contentious knowledge within cultural heritage institutions, reflective judgement — a theoretical framework to describe personal epistemology within contentious contexts (King &amp; Kitchener, 1994, 2004), and readers theatre — an interactive pedagogical research approach to investigate meaning making (Tanner, 1993). Set in a large academic museum in the southeastern United States, the study included 11 participants (purposefully sampled from a population of 257 staff and 497 volunteers) whose regular duties included contact with museum visitors. The study imitated a professional development session leading participants through a readers theatre experience: an oral group reading of a prepared script embedded with a nonfiction contentious narrative, a post-reading guided group discussion, and individual written reflections. Summarized results included: (1) all participants centered and grounded their meaning making around the contentious nature of museum work using various levels of reflective thinking and (2) all participants described their readers theatre experience as a positive, reflective, and non-threatening group learning experience that helped them discuss potentially difficult and “hot topics” (Cameron &amp; Kelly, 2010, p. i). Museum scholars interested in contentiousness, socially constructivist learning, and/or readers theatre pedagogy can use these fundamental results for theory-building approaches in research for museum education and visitor-centered curation to foster more inclusive, meaning-filled museum experiences for both personnel and visitors.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Teaching thinking skills, the use of cognitive and metacognitive strategies, to enhance literacy and reading comprehension knowledge and skills has been the subject of ongoing work by researchers and educators. There have been substantial efforts by researchers to design instructional interventions and test their effects on students’ literacy and reading comprehension. While these efforts contribute to a growing literature base, there is still a paucity of work connecting research on instructional interventions with practice in educational fields. The purpose of this study was to explore the design process and decisions made by an instructor, teaching assistant, and researcher to create and implement a learning task where college students learn the use of cognitive and metacognitive skills for reading comprehension in an online learning environment. Reciprocal Teaching (RT) (Palincsar &amp; Brown, 1984) is an instructional method for guided practice in applying cognitive strategies to the task of reading comprehension. In this study, the participants designed and refined a total of three versions of the Online Reciprocal Teaching (ORT) task, which was originally adapted from the RT method. This qualitative case study used the design and development research approach (Rickey &amp; Klein, 2007). The data sources from the four iterations of design over three semesters include the researcher’s field notes, student surveys, teaching assistant interview, and extant data including students’ submitted assignments. Results indicate that situational factors such as time, workload, course context, participants’ personal teaching experiences, their perspectives for effective teaching and learning, and design project features (e.g., design and development research approach and researcher-practitioner’s partnership) affected the instructional design processes and decisions. The design and development process followed the common phases from diverse Instructional Design theories and models. Through the ongoing design and research process, the participants more frequently made teaching- and learning-supportive design decisions, and smoothly integrated the designed intervention into the existing online course. They also found ways to make some situational factors flexible that were initially considered as fixed and constrained conditions. Thus, situational factors such as the specific course design or context became more teaching- and learning-supportive conditions. Based on the findings, this study suggests that situational factors should be considered as essential variables in developing high quality online learning experiences. This study also confirms that the design and development research approach is useful to integrate newly designed instructional interventions into real classrooms while increasing instructors’ motivation and engagement in the design process and facilitating them to make changes in practice.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Windover archaeological site (8BR246) is one of the few mass pre-historic burial sites in North America. The 168 skeletonized men, women, and children were interned in a peat bog accompanied by cultural materials such as bone and stone tools, textiles, flora, and fauna. This anerobic peat environment has functioned to slow the rate of decay and shelter the organic material; preserving the bone, stomach, and brain contents of the individuals for nearly 8,000 years, since the dawn of the Archaic. A δ13C‰ and δ15N‰ stable isotope analysis of 40 sampled male, female, and subadult femurs has facilitated the formulation of a dietary reconstruction for each of these age and sex cohorts. The supplementary file of the FSU Department of Anthropology’s Technical Analysis/Destructive Sampling Agreement form contains an inventory of the individuals sampled within this investigation. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>These dietary reconstructions, facilitated by δ13C‰ and δ15N‰ comparisons obtained from flora and fauna directly associated with the burials, are compared amongst the male, female, and subadult cohorts. These comparisons have functioned to provide  insight into Windover’s subsistence practices and the dietary cultural practices of individuals of different ages and sexes. The causes of these dietary differences are examined through pathological data from Windover and ethnographies/dietary reconstructions of hunter-gatherer communities. This thesis draws upon the chemical structures of bones to gain knowledge of this long extinct society’s culture and customs.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Reward-processing research utilizing event-related potentials (ERPs) has helped to refine conceptualizations of internalizing psychopathology over time. Leveraging the millisecond-level temporal resolution of ERP measures, this line of research has delineated measures that capture temporally distinct reward-processing deficits within depression. Alternatively, concurrent research concerning effort-expenditure for rewards has yielded a conceptual model that distinguishes among motivational sub-components of reward processing, describing the role of specific neural circuitry in attenuating effortful reward pursuit within depression. The current study sought to integrate methodologies applied within these lines of research to identify distinct temporal components of reward processing which index sub-component-specific deficits highlighted by the effort-expenditure literature. To achieve this, the current study utilized a modified effort-expenditure version of a well-validated reward-processing task to measure the effects of effort expenditure on subsequent neural indicators of reward-processing within a sample of depressed participants (n = 24) and healthy controls (n = 32). Overall, results indicated that effort-expenditure reduced attentional allocation towards completion of effort trials and reduced the perceived motivational salience of feedback stimuli. Group comparisons revealed that depression impacted the modulation, by effort-expenditure, of attentional allocation towards effort-expenditure trials and anticipation of feedback stimuli Thus, implying that depression dysregulates pre, but not post-feedback processes governing motivation and attribution of motivational salience.</DISS_para>

      <DISS_content>
         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The inspiration for this novel is rooted in the social protocols surrounding who is allowed to mother a child and explores a protagonist who challenges that system. I wanted to explore the radical idea of a teenage girl kidnapping a baby—a neglected niece—and how she avoided capture. My intention was to craft a loving relationship between the primary characters Kate and Bea while also exploring the severity of the crime. Kate stole Bea. She committed a crime that would justify punishment. While the book is based on a crime, the intent was not to sensationalize, glorify or even examine the criminal act. Instead, the focus is on what happens afterward: coping with the guilt and justification of actions, recovery once justice has been issued, and moving into adulthood with the knowledge that one's childhood has been based on a lie. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the past ten years, news outlets have reported cases of child abductions where the teen or adult child had discovered their own kidnapping. Carlina White found a photo of herself on the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children after she became suspicious when her "mother" failed to produce a birth certificate. The courts sentenced her "mother," Ann Pettway, to 12 years in prison in 2012 (Kleinfield 16). Alexis Manigo discovered her own kidnapping when she tried to apply for a job and did not have a correct social security number. Her "mother", Gloria Williams, is still on trial but could get life in prison. In an interview with The New York Times in January 2017, Manigo said she never suspected anything and only felt love for the woman who raised her (Robles A10). These types of cases of missing children are still under investigation and prosecuted even almost twenty years after the abduction of the child. Kidnapping laws in the United States become federal cases once an abductor transports a child over state lines, and minimum sentencing is twenty years. I’ve chosen to write the events of the crime to occur in 1973 before alerts about missing children would have been national news.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Because the plot of the novel centers around the abduction of a child, it explores themes regarding motherhood and expectations of mothers both inside and outside the family. The story focuses on two women who both love a child and never learned how to develop and maintain supportive female friendships and, as a result, develop a fierce rivalry. In Adrienne Rich's essay "Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence," she explains that the assumption that all relationships are heterosexual establishes a system which conditions women to expect the inevitability of dependence upon a man, and this inevitability implies that female friendships past the age of puberty are superfluous. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>“The denial of reality and visibility to women's passion for women, women's choice of women as allies, life companions and community, the forcing of such relationships into dissimulation and their disintegration under intense pressure have meant an incalculable loss to the power of all women to change the social relations of the sexes, to liberate ourselves and each other. (1607) </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Women cannot band together to change the system which oppresses them if they do not create healthy allies to confront that system. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>I am also interested in exploring the scope of how women’s sexism—assuming the superiority of men and the subservience to men— influences their decisions. In the text, Feminism is for Everybody, bell hooks examined how a patriarchal system contributes to male arrested development. Men indulged by the women who support them cannot mature. “Patriarchal masculinity encourages men to be pathologically narcissistic, infantile, and psychologically dependent on the privileges (however relative) that they receive simply for having been born male” (70). The arrested development comes from entitlement as well as the women who protect that male entitlement. Women who protect the patriarchy have an inability to support other women. According to hooks, women can only create strong bonds with other women “by confronting the ways women – through sex, class, and race – dominated and exploited other women” (3). Until women come to terms with their own domination of other women, they cannot form strong female friendships. Kidnapping another woman’s child would be an act of domination linked to the expectations associated with the role of mother. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Essentially, I’m proposing a story about two women in a battle for dominance over a child under the umbrella term of “motherhood”, and by exploring “mommy-shaming,” I will reveal how patriarchal concepts limit women’s ability to support other women.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Overall, this dissertation’s intent is to create fiction that utilizes narrative to show the nuances of motherhood, an empathic viewpoint of the execution of a crime, and how female relationships are necessary for psychological survival. Through extensive research and execution of craft, this novel will present rich characters and spark a conversation about how women treat other women.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>ABSTRACT</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this treatise is to introduce and discuss Victoria Bond’s keyboard works and to preserve their individual origin stories. As of February 2020, there are two piano concerti, eight unique works featuring keyboard as the only traditional instrument (several of these exist in multiple versions and/or involve an actor, narrator, or other accompanying media), and an ever-expanding host of chamber works involving piano. While the chamber works and concerti merit future study, this treatise will focus on the eight works featuring keyboard instruments as the only traditional instrument.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Confusion regarding the dating of some of Bond’s pieces has already resulted in conflicting information being published in print and online. This treatise attempts to shed light on some of the most prominent cases. This current study does not, however, attempt to address all conflicting published information, but rather to provide a preliminary account of the creation of Bond’s keyboard music, describe her approach to writing these works, and generally to provide information that would be of interest to performers, audiences, or future researchers before source information and oral history are lost.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Quiet Sounds originally drew its inspiration from what the title suggests, the quiet sounds of these five string instruments. These sounds take on a different character as they are amplified to “normal” volume, providing an exciting palate of new sounds. However, the entire piece is not derived from the quiet sounds, but the last two-thirds explore what was hidden in them, the music behind these ideas. The second section of the piece contrasts greatly with the first. From the cacophonous world of rubbing, scratches, and scrapings, a magnificent wall of harmony emerges. This section is ruled by a pulsating engine and develops rhythmic motives that were present in the first.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	This first section could be thought of as a dream, a dream that is ended by the ensuing reality of pitch and harmony. However, the opposite might be interpreted as well – this I want to leave open for the audience. As the section continues, the largest climax of the piece ends the second section on one very long, high intensity chord. It is at this climax where we see a return of silence from the instruments. The very first minute of the work is completely silent, the only noises coming from the dancers. This concept returns here, although now reverb is applied to stage sounds as if to imply that the dancers’ movements are larger than reality. When the strings come back in, they have also been influenced by this new mood, with reverb on all of their sounds as well. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Now, the audience might perhaps revisit their interpretation of the first section. Was that reality, and this the dream? After all, this last section derives its material and structure from that material explored with the “quiet sounds,” although now with pitch. On the surface this third section might be closely related to the second section, but at its core is only a variation of the first. But as in a dream, things are not remembered so precisely but are expanded upon in strange ways. Finally, the piece ends with a very long coda, in hopes that the audience will find rest in a contemplative state of rest and satisfied intrigue.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Increased stress and blunted reward processing are important risk factors and correlates of Major Depressive Disorder. The experience of acute stress has been shown to reduced fMRI correlates of reward processing; however, few studies have demonstrated that acute stress reduced event-related potential (ERP) measures of reward processing. The current study examined whether acute stress (i.e., cold pressor) blunted the Reward Positivity (RewP)--an ERP measure of reward processing--and whether current depressive symptoms moderated the impact of acute stress. The sample included 104 college students preselected for high and low depressive symptoms. Participants completed a reward task during three different condition, presented in counterbalanced order: an acute stress condition, a control condition and a distraction condition. The findings suggest that the RewP was blunted in the acute stress condition compared to both the control condition and the distraction condition; however, the RewP did not differ between the control condition and the distraction condition. Furthermore, the results suggest that current depressive symptoms did not moderate the impact of acute stress on the RewP. Overall, the current study provides evidence that the experience of acute stress dampens reward-related neural activity and that current depressive symptoms do not impact the effects of acute stress on reward processing.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In two articles, this dissertation explores how collegiate gamers reproduced gender hierarchies within gaming spaces. Both chapters employ interviews with collegiate gamers from a large southeastern university. The first article (chapter 2) investigates the processes through which gamers produced gendered notions of space to ritually position women in lower strata of the gaming gender hierarchy. Women, because they faced harassment from men, traded place for peace, locating themselves at the margins and minimizing their presence within gaming spaces. Men, who faced no sexualized harassment, normalized the seeming absence of women while justifying their dominant position within gaming culture. These processes maintained the overall marginalization of women within gaming culture by reproducing notions of women as outsiders and men as natural gamers. In the second article (chapter 3) I examine how gamers use identity talk to gender themselves through the telling of self-narratives. Players represented themselves as gendered through narratives of play, framing similar gaming behaviors as either masculine or feminine. This retelling of gaming practices was rooted in larger, cultural meanings of gender and in repackaging their gaming in gender-congruent manners, gamers reproduced gender within gaming spaces. Ultimately, this research presents how video gamers maintained gaming as a male dominated social space by reproducing a gender order that valued men’s play and minimized women’s play.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Decolonization and Southern Society explores the transformation of the American South in the fifteen years after World War II – the era of decolonization. Focusing principally on rural east central Mississippi, this study draws connections to other states like South Africa, Southern Rhodesia, and Kenya, where white settlers similarly doubled down against the era’s liberalizing trend. Settlers’ existential fear of decolonization manifested, in part, in their desire to become less dependent on labor. State assistance and fortuitously-timed technological innovations enabled settler landowners to dispense with their tenants and sharecroppers, rendering the landowners less economically vulnerable to political change, and severely limiting the reach of such change. Other reactionary tactics, including political chicanery and outright violence, made settler states tough nuts to crack. By 1960, the range of possibilities for a decolonized world had narrowed significantly. This study adds to a growing body of work exploring why the civil rights advances of the 1960s were not enough for the South’s most vulnerable residents. It also gestures toward the generative possibilities of viewing twentieth-century US history through the lens of settler colonialism.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The ability of animals to traverse arboreal structures is uncanny and breath-taking. A simple google search of "animals climbing trees" will display video captured of adult brown bears bounding at jaw-dropping and fear-inducing speeds up a vertical branch-less tree. Not too much further in the search will you find a video of a tiger approach and pounce up a vertical tree-like structure in the pursuit of dinner hanging above; doing so with such ferocity and momentum that in the pursuit of the dangling meat above, the tiger may be seen shaking the tree-like structure itself. This google search may come to an  entertaining end as a bobcat preys upon a squirrel along a wide set tree. The squirrel significantly smaller, but a far savvier climber, may be seen running up, down and circling the bobcat in its far from narrow escape of the tunnel-visioned, disappointed and still hungry, bobcat.\\</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Following this short-lived and eye opening google search it should be no surprise why roboticists have turned to nature to reveal and implement the scansorial capabilities of animals. For inspiration look no further than the gecko (Hemidactylus garnotii) and cockroach (Blaberus discoidalis). Despite their differences in attachment method, number of legs,  body shape and body size these two animals traverse-vertical planar surfaces using unified climbing principles. This revelation of unified climbing principles, observed amongst remarkably different animals, shed light on an  irreducibly simple climbing model, known as the Full-Goldman template. Roboticsts have taken this template model and hit the vertical ground running, designing and refining climbing platforms capable of dynamic locomotion on building materials such as brick and stucco. Despite the success of implementing these climbing principles on planar real-world surfaces, the absence of the revelation of animal's principles of climbing on arboreal structures has led to a lack of bio-inspired robots climbing arboreal structures dynamically. \\</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To shed light on these principles and take steps toward extending the remarkable achievements of dynamic bio-inspired-climbing robots to vertically-curved surfaces, a roll based controller and fixed tail controller are compared on their ability to produce successful steady-state climbing on a cylindrical substrate. The conceptualization of these results is made more clear by the visualization tool introduced here as the plane of attachment, generated by drawing a line that is coincident with where the right and left foot engage with the substrate. To explore the merit of roll based controller's ability to compensate for the inward plane of attachment and produce dynamic maneuverability on vertical cylinders, a feedforward and feedback set of roll-based controllers are introduced and evaluated on a cylinder of 1ft. A new electromechanical rear-foot design for dynamic climbers is introduced that use  switches to detect contact with the substrate, allowing for more accurate and consistent posture control, as well as radius estimation, afforded by a novel geometric model, improving controller robustness to deviation in curvature.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Women Under the Stars is a creative dissertation in poetry. It follows a series of female speakers  as they examine the ways in which their identities have been informed, complicated, and, at times, determined by the narratives they have inherited, encountered, and created. As these speakers attempt to understand the ideologies of those around them, as well as their own, they are made to confront situations in which they have harmed themselves and/or been complicit in the suffering of others. The speakers within Women Under the Stars give voice to their experiences in an effort to begin the process of healing, which involves recognizing and honoring those relationships, both personal and communal, that have contributed to their lives.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This paper analyzes Russian labor camps as represented in 19th and 20th century literature. A background on the history of the development of labor camps is provided in order to help develop a significant understanding of how and why the labor camps of the 19th and 20th centuries developed and who the people were who had been sent to them.  The paper compares the literature starting in the 19th century with the depictions portrayed in Fyodor Dostoevsky’s fiction and the observations of Anton Chekhov, with the literature of the dissident writers in the Soviet Union during the 20th century. Alexandr Solzhenitsyn’s and Sergei Dovlatov’s memoirs are analyzed and compared with the fictional story of Vasilly Aksyonov. This paper will show the development of labor camp literature in two time periods, and will also express the changes that occurred in the labor camps during these different time periods.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Scholarship on collaboration has long extolled its benefits, which include developing student awareness of audience (Howard, 2001; Newkirk, 1984), promoting better writing (Bruffee, 1984; Foote, 1998), promoting increased understanding of the topic (Bruffee, 1984; Wolfe, 2005), and developing crucial social skills (Bruffee, 1984; Foote, 1998; Smith &amp; MacGregor, 1992; Trimbur, 1989). The scholarly conversation on collaboration began with the field’s shift towards the social turn (see Bruffee, 1984; Cooper, 1986; Faigley, 1992; LeFevre, 1987; Lunsford &amp; Ede, 1990; Reither &amp; Vipond, 1989). Kenneth Bruffee (1984) famously articulated “To think well as individuals we must learn to think well collectively—that is, we must learn to converse well,” emphasizing the importance of collaborative learning in the writing classroom. For the most part, we have assumed that collaboration is an implicit skill that students know and value in classroom spaces, and as a result, we have not yet complicated our understanding with the perspectives of disabled students. By disregarding this population of students, the unspoken assumption is that all students are nondisabled and that collaboration is universally accessible. However, as nearly 11% of our national student population reports a disability, this is not representative of our student population (National Center for Education Statistics, 2009). Consequently, we have under theorized and studied the ways disabled students grapple with collaboration. This dissertation addresses this gap beginning to investigate neurodivergent students’ experiences with collaborative writing. Neurodivergence is commonly defined as neurological functioning that diverges from societal norms (e.g. depression, autism, attention deficit disorder, dyslexia, etc.) (Walker, 2014). This subset of disabled students is important to study for two reasons. First, scholarship on disability tends to focus on physical, apparent disabilities (e.g. blindness, deafness, mobility impairments, etc.) over nonapparent, nonphysical disabilities. Second, the majority of student disabilities are related to neurodivergence (United States Government Accountability Office, 2009).  By considering disabled students’ experiences in our pedagogical approaches, individual instructors can become advocates and activists in their classrooms by creating more inclusive and accessible educational spaces.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To guide my exploration into this topic, I outlined five research questions: (1) What do students self-report regarding their experiences working on collaborative writing assignments? (2) What strategies do neurodivergent students report employing when working on collaborative writing assignments? (3) How do neurodivergent students describe the support their teachers do or do not provide during collaborative writing assignments? (4) How do neurodivergent students describe their relationships with their teammates during collaborative writing assignments? And, (5) what recommendations do neurodivergent students have regarding accessible collaborative writing assignments? To answer these questions, I drew from an interdependent qualitative research paradigm methodology and collected qualitative and quantitative data through surveys and interviews. Finally, I analyzed my data using an inductive thematic analysis. From these methods, I was able to make several tentative findings and point towards pedagogical implications and further areas of study. Drawing from this data, this study offers some insight into how neurodivergent students navigate collaborative writing assignments and provides some tentative pedagogical starting places to improve collaborative writing assignments.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The aim of this thesis is to explore the complex identity of the banlieusard within the French society. The banlieue, known in English as the “projects”, is home to underrepresented and marginalized descendants of North- and West- African immigrants as well as of some white European immigrants or white French individuals. Established in tall housing estates located on the wider outskirts of Paris, the banlieue is a space constructed through the systemic disenfranchisement of working-class people across genders, ethnicities, and race and also constructed through associations with economic and societal flaws such as crime, unemployment, poverty etc. In face of these challenges, the banlieusard(e) attempts to claim his/her Frenchness but finds himself trapped by society’s negative perception. Similarly, they are also physically trapped in their space of high-rise buildings and trapped in a social and economic sphere with preconceived beliefs making it difficult for him to integrate and contribute to French society. Existing studies emphasize those negations by pointing out social issues such as failure to integrate or a space of violence. Through my corpus, I instead emphasize resistance and the agency of the banlieusard(e) rather than pointing out his/her marginalization by society’s preconceptions. Therefore, the spatial arrangement of the projects where he lives redefines, deconstructs, reconstructs and reverses the center/periphery dichotomy, in which the center becomes the banlieue and as a result, its outcast status is diminished. The banlieue indicates the necessity to examine negative stigmas created by the institutional discourse and by space. In doing so, I will use varied selection of novels, films, rap and stand-up comedy texts that truly provide a more general vision and a broader interpretation of the banlieue. This study uses a more expansive definition of diversity to include identity categories not usually represented by the scholarship. In Chapter One, I analyze the male character who finds himself in a spiral of violence as a consequence of the fear and resentment he has towards society. There is intense anger underlying the writing of the novel Dit Violent (2006) and the cinematography of the film La Haine (1995). At the same time, the novel and film subvert mainstream comprehension of the supposedly violent or hate-filled banlieusard reflected in the works’ titles, making affect the central subject of my analysis. Male characters in both corpuses re-establish the banlieue as a private, protected, safe space and provide a land(E)scape of/from perceptions of the banlieue. Indeed, my analysis of Mehdi in Dit Violent and Saïd, Hubert and Vinz in La Haine de-objectifies the “savage” banlieusard by analyzing him through the lens of positive emotions such as love and laughter and redefines him from a humanistic point of view. To deconstruct the space of the banlieusard is to deconstruct his tough image. In chapter Two, the female banlieusarde is scrutinized in the novel Kiffer sa race (2008) and in the film Divines (2016) through the question of gender. The main characters break the image of a submissive woman banlieusarde. Despite different outcomes, characters show agency in a patriarchal environment, and adopt masculine roles as a strategy to successfully position themselves in the hegemonic discourse. The relationship between the banlieusarde and her space illustrates her domination of it through her physical position on top of buildings in both the movie and the novel. Her domination of her space is also displayed in her wandering and idleness, which at the same time serve to create a collective gendered identity and reverse it, giving the character and her actions an androgynous nature. To deconstruct her space is to deconstruct her body and gender. In chapter Three, I demonstrate the social consequences of rejection that leads the main character in the film Désintegration (2011) to be subjected and entrapped first by societal and then by fundamentalist ideologies, which results in his alienation from society. The notion of exclusion requires a close examination of the serious consequences of the political discourses of islamophobia that are psychologically internalized by the banlieusard. The enclosed space allows fundamentalism to subvert the ideology of the French republic and fight back against its symbolic violence. It is assumed that violent action motivated by fear or hatred provides the banlieusard in his dystopian space with a utopian alternative space – and therefore identity - in an imagined hereafter. Deconstructing the space is deconstructing French ideology. Finally, the last chapter of my dissertation shows that rappers and comedians take back the hegemonic discourse by using institutional stereotypes and allow the viewer/audience to witness the French political scene. By being on stage, a sub-space, artists narrate the banlieue by deconstructing the space of stereotypes by re-appropriating them. Themes of previous chapters, such as revolt, resistance, alienation, or dehumanization, are embodied in the lyrics of the rapper and the texts of the stand-up comedian. The artists do not seek French integration but self-reliance through their accounting and appropriation of the past in order to recreate a present. In other words, they recreate a utopian existence which had been denied to them. Performers do not just aim to entertain but they deliver engaged texts. Those activist artists have the privilege to speak freely and gives a voice to the banlieue’s thoughts, values and observations and allow the characters studied in novels and films, and by extension, the underprivileged to be heard.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Natural disasters such as hurricanes have been affecting thousands of people annually with devastating consequences such as loss of life, vegetation and infrastructure. Vegetation losses such as coastal erosion, downed trees and infrastructure disruptions (e.g., toppled power lines) often lead to roadway closures. These disruptions are also life threatening for the victims in the affected region. Emergency officials, therefore, have been trying to find ways to alleviate such problems by identifying those locations that pose high risk in the aftermath of hurricanes. In order to help emergency agencies achieve this goal, this dissertation explores the design and implementation of a remote sensing technology-based methodology for coastal community resiliency assessment. Specifically, it seeks to: (1) develop and adopt a modern remote sensing technology for rapid assessment of damage caused by hurricanes; (2) identify reliable indicators for detecting the impacted region and damage severity after hurricanes; (3) develop a comprehensive debris damage assessment given different storm intensities/strengths; and (4) compare the proposed storm debris prediction model findings to those obtained from existing estimation methods. Chapter 2 of this dissertation presents a Google Earth Engine and MATLAB-based remote sensing application to coastal barrier islands. This application especially focuses on the well-known critical width concept as a measure of resiliency of barrier islands to coastal overwash. Our results reveal the potential use of the developed application of remote sensing for detailed barrier island analysis and for future improvements of barrier island resilience parameterizations. Chapter 3 presents another Google Earth Engine and Geographical Information Systems-based remote sensing application as a two-stage model to analyze the impact of Hurricane Michael on the City of Tallahassee, Florida. The proposed innovative application was used to develop city-wide hurricane risk maps for the entire city at the level of census blocks. Our findings showed that the Northeast side of the city had high risk levels, which is a region where more 65+ populations live, and the disruptions on that side of the city can lead to dramatic consequences due to the fragility of these seniors in the aftermath of hurricanes. Chapter 4 developed a third Google Earth Engine and Geographical Information Systems-based remote sensing application designed to perform an assessment of the damage caused by different hurricanes and storms on example coastal communities. The method used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in order to estimate the greenness change before and after the hurricanes hit. The findings on the estimated debris were also compared with the debris calculated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) model. The proposed application was utilized to conduct a comparative analysis of the impacts of different storms and hurricanes on the Bay County, Florida with a focus on the demographic factors such as the population and roadway network. Results of the analysis show that sub-urban areas, urban areas, moderate and high roadway density areas generated more debris and NDVI changes than rural and low roadway density areas. The results of NDVI change approach indicate that USACE debris model is overestimating the debris volume for the hurricanes that are category 3 or greater. Particularly, higher intense hurricane would enlarge this error. The applications developed in this dissertation focused only on coastal regions; however, the proposed methodology can be successfully extended to any other location given the data availability. The proposed risk index and damage assessment can also be enhanced using relevant data on power outages and socioeconomics.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>We report a study on the magnetotransport properties and on the Fermi surfaces (FS) of the ZrSi(Se,Te) semimetals. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, in absence of spin orbit coupling  (SOC), reveal that both the Se and the Te compounds display Dirac nodal lines  (DNL) close to the Fermi level  Ef at symmorphic and non-symmorphic positions, respectively.  We find that the geometry of their FSs agrees well with DFT predictions.  ZrSiSe displays low residual resistivities, pronounced magnetoresistivity, high carrier mobilities, and a butterfly-like angle-dependent magnetoresistivity (AMR), although its DNL is not protected against gap opening. As in Cd3As2, its transport lifetime is found to be100 to 1000 times larger than its quantum one. ZrSiTe, which possesses a protected DNL, displays conventional transport properties. Our evaluation indicates that both compounds most likely are topologically trivial. Nearly angle-independent effective masses with strong angle dependent quantum lifetimes lead to the butterfly AMR in ZrSiSe</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Accompanying firms’ globalization and market expansion worldwide is a dramatic increase in firm structural intricacy and interorganizational relationship complexity. The firm’s relational complexity in the value chain has been recognized in the literature as one of the key factors driving firm performance. However, the literature discusses this role almost exclusively from the supplier (upstream) side and overlooks relational complexity of the firm’s customer (downstream) side. The result is a lack of comprehensive research, in the marketing literature, exploring the structural complexity of the firm’s customer (downstream). This dissertation addresses a significant gap in the marketing literature. It develops a pioneering study of the structural complexity of a firm’s distribution channels, including customers in the B-to-B context, and analyzes the moderating role of marketing capability with the individual effects of structural complexity in the firm’s customer base. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The study bases its research framework on a multidimensional complexity approach with  four key variables. These  include: 1) horizontal complexity; 2) vertical complexity; 3) spatial complexity; and 4) covert (eliminative) complexity from the supply base literature. In addition to these 4 existing variables three newly-developed variables are added to the research study. The new variables are market foreignness complexity, supplier-centric complexity, and customer-centric complexity. To test the theoretical framework, the study used merged secondary data sets and analytical approaches such as Stochastic Frontier Analysis to measure a firm’s marketing capability and Koyck Transformation to reflect potential spill-over effects from the past establishment to provide more unique, objective ways of understanding the complex relationship structures of multinational corporations (MNCs) with their marketing capability. By merging two commercial data sources from compustat and mergent, the current study obtained a sample of 567 firms and scrutinized the role of the seven types of a firm’s customer base complexity and the moderating role of marketing capability on their impact on firm performance. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>As this study had predicted, and consistent with the extant literature, we found that high marketing capability leads a focal firm to high performance. However, our findings also highlighted that marketing capability interplays with the structural complexity of a firm’s customers in quite interesting ways. When horizontal complexity or customer-centric complexity is high, marketing capability shows a negative interaction with these two complexities, which can be explained by redundancy, diseconomies of scale, or the substitution view. In other words, those relationships that are doubly positive (i.e., large customers with excellent marketing capability) may not measure up in driving outcomes, due to redundancy.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>However, when covert complexity or supplier-centric complexity is high, marketing capability discloses a remedial interaction with supplier-centric complexity (or covert complexity), alleviating its negative effects on firm performance. In other words, the negative effect of covert complexity or supplier-centric complexity is mitigated by a high level of marketing capability. Associated implications of these findings are offered to guide practitioners and researchers alike.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Interactions between the lower atmosphere and upper ocean on diurnal time scales are assessed in the tropical Atlantic Ocean by combining over 20 years of observations from the Prediction and Research Moored Array in the Tropical Atlantic (PIRATA) with reanalysis, satellite, and model data. In the first section of this study, analysis of surface winds and pressure from PIRATA moorings along 23$^{\circ}$W reveals semi-diurnal patterns in the 10-meter zonal wind anomalies and a diurnal pattern in the 10-meter meridional wind anomalies. Past research on the diurnal and semi-diurnal wind patterns observed in the tropical Pacific concluded that the zonal semi-diurnal wind patterns are consistent with migrating atmospheric thermal tidal (ATT) forcing. However, causes of the diurnal cycle in the meridional winds remains elusive. This work extends the past analysis in the tropical Pacific to show how the nonmigrating ATT drives the diurnal cycle of the meridional winds and how that leads to an offshore early morning precipitation maximum during the boreal summer in the tropical Atlantic basin.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Secondly, data from the Tropical Atlantic Current Observation Study (TACOS) at 4$^{\circ}$N, 23$^{\circ}$W is analyzed to better understand air-sea coupling in the equatorial Atlantic Ocean on short time scales. This particular PIRATA mooring offers high-temporal resolution (10 minute – 1 hour) wind, current, temperature, and salinity data from 2017 to the present. Equipped with 11 current sensors, this site uniquely resolves the diurnal cycle of vertical shear. Throughout the first deployment of the TACOS mooring (March, 2017 - March, 2018), the presence of a shear-variance layer was observed. Spectral analysis confirms that significant oscillations in the seasonal thermocline, due to the passage of internal tides, modulate the velocity field, altering the shear. During those times that experienced high diurnal SST amplitudes, the deepening nocturnal mixed layer interacts with the shear-variance reservoir, thereby enhancing marginal instability.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Upper-ocean processes are then compared between the PIRATA/TACOS observations and the Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO) model in the last part of this study. Similarities and discrepancies in mixing processes, static stability, upper-ocean currents as a response to wind forcing, and other air-sea components are discussed. Discrepancies between the dynamic and thermohaline fields persist throughout the record of the analysis time period, thereby contributing to differences in the stratification and shear, resulting in the model being ``over mixed".</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The aim of this qualitative study was to understand women’s experience of becoming a mother through art-making process. New mothers often experience adjustment hardships due to a mismatch between pre-existing stories and their real lived experiences of becoming a mother (White &amp; Epston, 1990) as well as an overflow of contradictory emotions (Boulton, 1983). However, the women’s struggles during the peri-natal period has received little attention and research (Fahey &amp; Shenassa, 2013). In order to support mothers’ transition and gain empowerment, the eight-phase art therapy protocol was implemented to explore how art-making can deepen our understanding in becoming a mother. This study was a twofold process of sharing my personal narrative and artworks on becoming a mother, followed by those of three art therapist mothers who have given birth within the past three years. Three mothers in this study were given up to eight weeks to complete eight-phase art therapy protocol. The data were collected using face-to-face interviews, journals, memos, and follow-up emails. Feminist narrative analysis was used to analyze the qualitative data. Findings suggest that engaging in visual processing through given art therapy protocols allowed mothers to reflect, resonate and possibly shift some perspectives on their pre-conceived thoughts on motherhood and gain empowerment over their own journey of growing into a mother. The findings shed light on how engaging in the eight-phase art therapy protocols allowed mothers to transfer complex emotions to an image, providing a sense of safety and deeper understanding to self-acceptance and growth. Although the number of mothers in this research was limited, the positive experiences and sense of empowerment expressed by the participants and myself yields to further implementation and development of the art therapy protocols in the future. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>My proposed MA in American Dance Studies thesis analyzes the power and reach of the online dance world in the 21st Century. The project specifically engages with the past decade’s trend of dance spectatorship’s online presence, fueled by the viral nature of social media and fast-paced, snackable videos on social media. I seek to understand how dance becomes visible through social media and popularized across platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube. To this end, I highlight the branding methods utilized by the social media accounts that post online dance content in a time when users, especially millennials, are increasingly reliant on computers and mobile devices to access information and entertainment. Because we live in a technologically capable, capitalist society, it is important to look at dance’s capitalist output. A clear example of this is the viral dissemination of commercial dance. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Commercial dance revolves around the core idea that dancers’ performances are geared towards selling a product, idea, or experience using a range of movement foundations, predominately riffing on jazz and hip-hop styles.  Ultimately, I am asking: what is the relationship between 21st Century modes of communication and the online commercial dance world? Why is online commercial dance so popular and how is it relevant for audiences? Through a synthesis of scholarly research on marketing, social media, and viral commercial online dance, this thesis delves into the phenomenon of online dance in the 21st Century and explores commercial dance’s role within that realm, fundamentally questioning how popular dance is an insightful tool for understanding larger questions about the role that marketing plays in influencing and reflecting current sociocultural attitudes and trends.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Men tend to outperform women on spatial tasks. Some argue that these performance differences result from innate factors or evolutionary pressures, while others claim they are the result of differences in culture or experience. Some now argue that strategy selection differences account for differences in spatial performance, such as in video games. The current study made use of a spatially demanding video game called Space Fortress. Previous research has shown that the performance gap in Space Fortress game play between men and women decreases over time. However, the current study demonstrated that the speed of improvement for women was increased when they were instructed to modify their strategy selection with joystick movements, to the extent that the gap in performance observed in the most spatially-demanding component of the game between the genders disappeared altogether. This experiment aimed to track the changes in performance over three two-hour sessions, scheduled one to seven days apart, in which women of different skill levels were either given a joystick intervention or were simply asked to play without any intervention. Of particular interest was the performance of initially low-performing women who either received the intervention or were instead in a control group that played the game for the same amount of time. It was hypothesized that, if the initially low-performing women provided with the intervention were contrasted with a control group of men of all skill levels, as well as contrasted with the control group of initially low-performing women, the initially low-performing women who received the intervention would display reduced difference from the men in ship control performance, and would perform better than the initially low-performing control women, in the final session. As predicted, the intervention enabled their ship control performance, the main indication of spatial ability within the game, to be significantly better following the intervention than this performance was in the initially lower-performing control women. In addition, the initially lower-performing intervention women did not perform significantly differently from the men in ship control in the final session. Improvements in ship control performance were also associated with reductions in some joystick behaviors which are typically overdone when ship control is poor. These findings provide causal evidence that in some cases, gender differences in using spatial cues are not due to spatial ability per se, but to the choice of a poor strategy that might be easily modified.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Chapter One examines the role of activist investors in firms’ decisions to conduct open market share repurchases. Compared with firms making ordinary share repurchases, firms making activist-involved repurchases have more cash holdings, are more undervalued, experience better subsequent stock performance and similar improvements in operating performance, and eventually repurchase more shares. Moreover, repurchasing firms in which an activist investor claims to take a passive role exhibit no undervaluation, and repurchasing firms that make multiple repurchases exhibit share undervaluation only in repurchases where an activist is involved. In all, our findings suggest that activist-involvement is associated with improved corporate repurchase decisions. Chapter Two contributes to an emerging literature that examines the timing of actual open-market share repurchases as opposed to repurchase program announcements. The key distinction from prior research is that I classify a series of firm-month repurchases that occur in close proximity as a single repurchase decision. This approach yields new insights into the timing of actual repurchases. A typical firm experiences abnormal price declines before it begins repurchasing shares, no abnormal stock performance while it continues repurchasing, and abnormal price increases after it stops repurchasing. Additional tests reasonably rule out alternative explanations that changes in cash or growth opportunities (as opposed to timing motives) drive the observed relationship between series of repurchases and stock prices. Taken together, these findings suggest that firms time repurchases to periods when stock prices are low.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Many proteins in the nucleus are involved in the regulation of DNA-templated events. Numerous studies have linked changes in the chromatin structure and the transcriptional program of a cell in response to a stimulus or during differentiation. The nucleosome is the primary unit of chromatin structure and commonly thought to be a primary regulator of nuclear events, although the exact mechanisms remain unclear. Recent studies have shown that certain nucleosomes can have different sensitivities to micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion, resulting in the release of populations of nucleosomes dependent on the concentration of MNase. Mapping MNase sensitivity of nucleosomes at promoters genome-wide reveals an important functional nucleosome organization that correlates with gene expression levels and transcription factor binding. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In order to understand nucleosome distribution and sensitivity dynamics in human cells during an induced genomic response, we mapped nucleosome position and sensitivity using multiple concentrations of MNase. We have illustrated chromatin structural changes in multiple cellular contexts: during an immune stimulus, in multiple breast epithelial cellular states, and during serum starvation. This allowed us to characterize the nature of chromatin reorganization at transcription start sites (TSSs) occurring in a response-specific manner. Our results indicate that nucleosome distribution and sensitivity dynamics are integral to a cellular response to a stimulus and pave the way for further studies that will deepen our understanding how the cell executes a given genomic response. Supplementary tables related to all sequencing data are listed in Appendix N.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Cellular nutrient deprivation by serum starvation provided an important experimental system to observe local chromatin changes at promoters and additionally study this genomic response within individual nuclei. Many gaps remain in our understanding of the relationship between the local chromatin environment as assayed by genomics (nucleosome maps, regulatory factor binding, histone post-translational modifications) and higher-order nuclear architecture. Current methods to survey the protein catalogue in the cell are biased by the selection of a protein immunoprecipitation target, thus here we have crosslinked and sheared chromatin under harsh sonication conditions to observe the basal chromatin-associated protein content in our cells via LC-MS/MS.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Finally, utilizing stable cells with nuclear localized GFP-F-tractin, a filamentous actin-binding protein, we observed the formation of transient nuclear actin filaments following serum starvation. We have shown that changes in chromatin structure and gene expression occur in the same time frame as that of the actin network formation. Supplementary videos are listed in Appendix O. We have also shown the nuclear localization of Profilin-1, an actin-binding transport protein, via immunofluorescence microscopy. These results suggest a transient nuclear actin network may work together with other structural and motor proteins identified by proteomics to efficiently regulate the genome in response to a stimulus. Our results validate and extend previous studies implicating non-canonical proteins in nuclear processes and demonstrate the potential of unbiased proteomic assays to give insight into chromatin-based regulation of the genome.</DISS_para>

      <DISS_content>
         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>A large body of research links family-related factors to various child, adolescent, and adult outcomes.  Research has identified a broad range of outcomes that are affected by family structure, processes, and dynamics, such as education, employment, mental health, and substance abuse (Giordano 2010; Miller and Barnes 2015; Murray, Loeber, and Pardini 2012; Turney 2014).  This diverse body of research has prompted scholars to examine the impact that family has on offending outcomes.  They have identified factors such as low family income, single-parent households, family conflict, and divorced parents to be associated with a child’s risk of offending (Cernkovich and Giordano 1987; Farrington 2010; Loeber and Loeber-Stouthammer 1986; Rankin and Wells 1990; Wasserman and Seracini 2001; Wright and Cullen 2001).  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Another family-related factor that has received some attention for its influence on offending is family size (i.e., the number of children in a family).  The main conclusion from this literature is that youth with large family sizes have a higher likelihood of being delinquent (Biles and Challinger 1981; Brownfield and Sorenson 1994; Farrington 1987; Farrington, Coid, and West 2009; Glueck and Glueck 1950; Hirschi 1969; Jones, Offord, and Abrams 1980; Lees and Newson 1954; LeFlore 1988; Lauritsen 1993; Mercer, Farrington, Ttofi, Keijsers, Branje, and Meeus 2016; Nye 1958; Parrott and Strongman 1984; Robins, West, and Herjanic 1975; Sampson and Laub 1994; Slawson 1925; Touliatos and Lindhom 1980; Tygart 1991; Walsh and Petee 1987; West and Farrington 1973).  Although there are a handful of studies that have examined the relationship between family size and delinquency, this dissertation argues that—in light of several research gaps and limitations in the literature—the true family size effects remain unclear. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	This dissertation contributes to scholarship on families and offending and, more specifically, family size and delinquency, in several ways.  It examines the nature of the relationship between family size and delinquency by identifying whether the pattern is positive or negative, significant or nonsignificant, and linear or nonlinear.  Multiple indicators of family size are also examined to explore heterogeneity in offending depending on sibling relatedness.  To check consistency in the relationship, these patterns are examined across several datasets.  This dissertation also explores theoretical pathways that help to explain the family size-delinquency relationship.  Specifically, social control and strain measures are tested as mediating mechanisms.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Data for this dissertation come from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth.  These data have several attributes that make them ideal for this study:  they include, for example, large adolescent populations, males and females, and, importantly, comprehensive measures of family size, delinquency, and controls.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Analyses of the data point to several key findings.  They highlight that there does appear to be some evidence of a relationship between family size and delinquency, but that patterns are dissimilar to those presented in the bulk of existing studies.  Specifically, the effects of family size appear to be curvilinear in nature.  Findings also show heterogeneity in offending outcomes when family size is measured by sibling relatedness.  Furthermore, the relationship between family size and delinquency is explained through social control mediating mechanisms.  This dissertation concludes with a discussion of the implications of these findings for theory, research, and policy.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Hydrologic studies of lakes tend to not include groundwater inputs as they are seen as a negligible amount to the water budget.  However, there are certain environments such as Geographically Isolated Wetlands (GIW) in which groundwater dynamics are essential to understanding the periodic wet and dry periods of these environments.  This drying and wetting cycle plays a large role in the breeding period of a number of amphibians and in the role that GIWs play in removing nutrients from water systems. While there are a number of methods to measure and estimate groundwater seepage in lakes, they are not very accurate on the whole.  The purpose of this project is to develop and test a new seepage meter.  The design of the seepage meter a PVC tube inserted into lake sediment where the head within the tube is drawn down and the recovery curve is recorded.  Through laboratory and numerical experiments, it was shown that preforming a linear regression on derivative values of the recovery curve against the hydraulic gradient provides a more accurate seepage estimate than the traditional method of analysis.  While the seepage meter is not as accurate as hoped, there are positive signs that it can be improved with increasing experimental sampling size, using a more reliable on-board pump, and improving the design of the seepage meter body.  The seepage meter has shown that it can work within a field environment and produced optimistic data from preliminary field tests.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation examines new interventions into the historiography of chattel slavery. In reading several texts by Black women authors and artists—including Octavia E. Butler’s Fledgling (2005), Jesmyn Ward’s Sing, Unburied, Sing (2017), Rivers Solomon’s An Unkindness of Ghosts (2017), and Janelle Monáe’s visual album Dirty Computer (2018)—I argue these works represent an emerging genre of slavery literature. Though none of these texts seemingly has anything to do with transatlantic slavery on the surface, each is in fact deeply indebted to exploring what Saidiya Hartman refers to as the “afterlives” of slavery (6). Unlike the traditional neo-slave narrative, as theorized by Bernard Bell in The Afro-American Novel and Its Tradition (1987) and Ashraf H.A. Rushdy in Neo-Slave Narratives: Studies in the Social Logic of a Literary Form (1999), these texts—what I term “speculative bondage narratives”—do not routinely adopt the formal or thematic conventions of the slave narrative. In fact, chattel bondage is often not a defining feature of these texts at all. Instead, speculative bondage narratives examine the transformation of human bondage across time and space as a way of exploring the lasting and ever-present impact of slavery on Black communities. Instead of adhering to the strict conventions of previous theorizations of the neo-slave narrative, speculative bondage narratives reject strict notions of genre, and they often resist a definitively antebellum temporality. Through their restaging of slavery and the institutions which arose from it within our contemporary moment and into imagined futures, speculative bondage narratives speak to and illustrate the interminability of the traumas engendered under chattel slavery. The phrasing “bondage narrative” allows the authors of these narratives to examine other forms of subjection beyond chattel slavery, while the term “speculative” refers to the incorporation of speculative elements or premises into the novel, which allows the authors to conjecture as to the ongoing consequences of the “peculiar institution.” The word “speculative” further gestures toward the rich history of Black writers’ engagement with the genre of speculative fiction, which frequently intersects with the literature of slavery. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>My theorization of the speculative bondage narrative is deeply indebted to Black feminist theory, which frames much of my understanding of this new genre. Saidiya Hartman’s framing of the “afterlife of slavery” in Lose Your Mother: A Journey Along the Atlantic Slave Route (2006) provides the language for my investigation of the ways the specter of slavery continues to haunt literature specifically, and Black communities more broadly. Similarly, Christina Sharpe’s notion of living “in the wake” of slavery, as well as her concept of “wake work,” as defined in In the Wake: On Blackness and Being (2016), play a significant role in how I interpret the purpose of speculative bondage narratives. First and foremost, the speculative bondage narrative seeks to unpack the ways slavery continues to haunt Black life today, as well as how it will inevitably continue to do so going forward. In this regard, Hortense Spillers’ examination of transgenerational trauma and the “rupture” of the African diaspora, as explored in “Mama’s Baby, Papa’s Maybe: An American Grammar Book” (1987), provides further structure for my investigation of the spectral presence of slavery, as well as how that haunting presence influences subsequent generations. Because of the lack of scholarly attention to texts which primarily or solely explore the aftereffects of slavery (as opposed to directly examining the institution of slavery itself), the speculative bondage narrative operates as a corrective to some of this oversight, while simultaneously advocating for a more flexible definition of genre, ultimately allowing for a more nuanced discussion of the ramifications of slavery and more open pathways to resistance for Black communities.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Kennedy Space Center (KSC) at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS) launches spacecraft for NASA and private companies throughout the year. Since spacecraft are expensive to build and launch, a complicated set of guidelines has been developed to ensure their safety. The Lightning Launch Commit Criteria (LLCC) of the guidelines pertain to natural lightning and spacecraft triggered lightning. This research has investigated the Cumulus Cloud Rule, the most commonly violated component of the LLCC. Using the network of field mills at KSC (the Launch Pad Lightning Warning System (LPLWS), fields of electric potential gradient (PG) are analyzed near cumulus clouds.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study focuses on cumulus having cloud top temperatures (CTT) between +5°C to -20°C. Each cloud of the dataset must be independent from nearby clouds, cannot be part of other convective systems, and must be located within the field mill network. The clouds are found using data from the TDR 43-250 weather radar at KSC/CCAFS. Thermodynamic profiles are obtained using radiosonde data from the KSC/CCAFS site (KXMR). Hydrometeor type is determined using a hydrometeor classification algorithm (HCA). The clouds are selected during Florida’s warm season months, May through September.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>CTT is an important aspect of the Cumulus Cloud Rule of the LLCC since values specify an ascending vehicle’s stand-off distance from the cloud. Colder CTTs require greater separation. However, present results show that PG versus distance is not directly related to CTT. For example, colder CTTs did not lead always to greater PG or PG values farther outside the fair field range. Results also reveal that cloud growth rates during the early stages of development vary. Inversions cause slow growth followed by rapid growth of the cloud. The median cloud growth from a warmer CTT (+5°C) to a colder CTT (0°C) was found to be less than 5 min, which translates to a median cloud growth speed between 10 to 15 ft s-1.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation includes mainly four chapters. The first chapter studies change-points in human brain functional connectivity (FC) and seek patterns that are common across multiple subjects under identical external stimulus. FC, represented mathematically as a covariance or a correlation matrix,  relates to the similarity of fMRI responses across different brain regions when a brain is simply resting or performing a task. While the dynamical nature of FC is well accepted, this paper develops a formal statistical test for finding {\it change-points} in  times series associated with FC. It represents {\it instantaneous} (or short term) connectivity by a symmetric positive-definite matrix, and uses a Riemannian metric on this space to develop a graphical method for detecting change-points in a time series of such matrices. It also provides a graphical representation of estimated FC for stationary subintervals in between the detected change-points. Furthermore, it uses a temporal alignment of the test statistic, viewed as a real-valued function over time, to remove intersubject variability and to discover common change-point patterns across subjects. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The second aims to quantitively compare the dynamic nature of human brain functional connectivity (FC) using a distance measure and use the distance feature for classifications at network level across multiple subjects under external stimulus or during resting state. It represents dynamic FCs by a sequence of SPDMs, and uses a Riemannian metric on this space to quantify the dissimilarity between such trajectories. It also proposes a metric-based dimensionality reduction technique for SPDMs to improve the method's efficiency with tolerent information loss. Both methods are illustrated using data from Human Connectome Project (HCP) database for multiple subjects and tasks. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>While the first two chapters mainly focus on studying medical imaging problems, the third and fourth chapters aim to provide solutions to some computer vision tasks. The third chapter talks about classifications of covariance trajectories in the application of video action recognition. One can first extract features from video frames using existing CNN frameworks. Each frame is represented by a covariance matrix estimated from the extracted features and,  thus, a video is represented as a sequence of covariance matrices. Next, the dimension-reduction approach introduced in Chapter 2, based on the chosen Riemannian metric of SPDMs,  are applied to bring down dimensions of individual covariances for comparing these reduced trajectories.  Finally, the distance features acquired from these trajectories are used for video classification. The fourth chapter introduces a new approach of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) based on a nonparametric geometric transformation called the {\it square-root velocity function} (SRVF). In the proposed framework, the output feature vectors of the last dense layer in the discriminator are treated as real-valued functions rather than a vector of numbers. The geometric central moments are then defined using a certain distance, termed {\it Fisher-Rao distance} (FRD), between data points and a reference point in a function space. By using SRVF transformation, calculating FRD in the original function space is equivalent to calculating $\mathbb{L}^2$ distance between their corresponding transformed objects. Thus, computing FRD between objects become fast and </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The understanding of the evolution of a Tropical Cyclone (TC) has been a topic of research for several years. During the hurricane season not all thunderstorm events embedded in the African easterly waves or otherwise evolve into organized convection with a closed low pressure system, manifesting into TCs. In this work we suggest that one of the ways to objectively analyze the evolution of the TC is to understand the evolution of the conversion of the available potential energy into kinetic energy on the scale of the disturbance. This study explores the energetics of the interaction between Streamfunction (Psi: ψ)-Velocity Potential (Chi: χ) in the numerical simulations of the TCs. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Using the output of separate 48-hour WRF simulations of three Atlantic TCs: Cindy and Irma of 2017, and Michael 2018, we analyze the time history of the conversion of their kinetic energy from the irrotational to the non-divergent components of the winds. All of these TCs had varied intensities with Cindy being the weakest and Irma being the strongest over the simulation period, which WRF simulated with reasonable fidelity in the evolution of their peak intensities. We show that at 850hPa, the fractional conversion of the kinetic energy from the irrotational to the non-divergent component of the wind increases as the TC intensifies and is higher for the stronger TCs than weaker TCs. Contrastingly, in the outflow level of the TC this transfer of kinetic energy is weaker for stronger TCs than the weaker TCs. Our analysis reveals that when the gradients of the streamfunction and velocity potential are large and oriented parallel to each other both in the large-scale TC environment and in the region of the primary circulation of the TC, then the TC is favored to intensify with robust conversion of the kinetic energy of the irrotational flow(〖 K〗_χ) to kinetic energy of non-divergent flow (〖 K〗_ψ ) at 850hPa. In contrast, however in the outflow layer, we require a slower conversion of 〖 K〗_χ to 〖 K〗_ψ for a TC to intensify otherwise it leads to increased inertial instability and weakening of the TC.   We arrive at similar conclusions when we contrast the evolution of the tropical cyclones from its genesis to intensifying stages. Likewise, when we examine the sensitivity of the simulations of the tropical cyclones to the choice of microphysics, we find that parameterizations that engenders strong conversion of  〖 K〗_χ to 〖 K〗_ψ at 850 hPa and weak conversion of 〖 K〗_χ to 〖 K〗_ψat the outflow level leads to the simulation of stronger TCs. Therefore, analyzing this conversion rate of kinetic energy of the flow field helps in understanding the evolution of the intensity of TCs.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>There is a high prevalence of personality disorder (PD) traits among individuals involved in the criminal justice system. Cluster B personality and psychopathic traits are the most prevalent traits that occur within individuals involved in the justice system. Additionally, cluster B personality traits often co-occur with psychopathy. There are few investigations conducted to understand the high co-occurrence of cluster B personality traits and psychopathy. The triarchic model of psychopathy is a framework that focuses on dispositional constructs with known neurobiological and developmental correlates that may be particularly useful in elucidating the overlap between cluster B personality symptoms and psychopathy. This study investigated how the triarchic model relates to cluster B personality symptoms and whether the relationships differ by sex using regression and multigroup path analyses. Two independent samples completed self-report measures of personality disorder traits. Sample 1 consists of 420 adults, and Sample 2 consists of 529 undergraduate students. Disinhibition positively predicted all cluster B PDs. Meanness positively predicted ASPD, NPD, and BPD, and negatively predicted HPD. Boldness positively predicted ASPD, NPD, and HPD and negatively predicted BPD. The triarchic traits were more strongly related to ASPD symptoms in males compared to females. Overall, our study elucidates why psychopathy and cluster B PD pathology commonly co-occur and provides insights into how these disorders fit within new dimensional models of psychopathology.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This study focuses on the majolica recovered from three Spanish Mission sites in Apalachee Province of La Florida (1633-1704). I focus on the rim and foot ring thickness to determine whether there are observable manufacturing trends in the majolica collections recovered from these sites. This information is then combined with the typological analysis to determine if there are differences between early mission sites and mid-to-late ones. This is important because the available documentary record contains historic mission names which have been given to identified archaeological mission sites. Because Mission San Luis is the only mission site whose location has been known through time, it is difficult to know which archaeological sites are which named missions. The goal of this thesis is to develop measures that assist determining the occupation time range of archaeological mission sites.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>To date, Object Data Analysis is the most inclusive type of data analysis, as far as the object spaces are concerned.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>It extends multivariate data analysis, landmark based shape analysis, and in the infinite dimensional case, it extends functional data analysis. For more details, see Patrangenaru and Ellingson (2015).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Imaging data, especially electronic imaging data is the most common type of data of our times. In Statistics, often times, an object is a certain feature extracted from raw imaging data. Big data of complex type, including 2D shapes or projective shapes of 3D scenes, or textured surfaces can be today extracted from digital camera images, using a synergy of Statistics, Computational Algorithms and Geometry, to retrieve such object data. In Statistics, objects are represented as points on metric spaces called object spaces, that are not linear. Object spaces, such as Kendall shape spaces (see Kendall (1984)), affine shape spaces (see Patrangenaru and Mardia 2005), or projective shape spaces (see Patrangenaru et al.(2010)) are often times compact, a property that is not shared by the good old numerical or functional spaces in multivariate or functional data analysis.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Typically an object space $(\mathcal M, \rho,\mathcal B_\rho),$ where $\mathcal B_\rho$ is the Borel $\sigma$-algebra generated by open sets of $(M,\rho),$ should have some level of smoothness, to make estimation of location parameters possible, the ideal structure being that of a smooth manifold, with as much symmetry as possible (see Patrangenaru and Ellingson (2015)\cite{PaEl:2015}).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A case in points is that of object spaces that are smooth manifolds; for example $P\Sigma_2^5$ can be identified with a real projective plane $\mathbb RP^2.$ Recall that a manifold is a metric space that is locally homeomorphic to an Euclidean space. Unlike in multivariate data analysis, where the object space is $\mathbb R^m,$ for some fixed dimension $m,$ in object data analysis, we have no linear structure on the object space. Therefore the regression model $y_i = F(x_i)+ \varepsilon_i$ does not make sense , when applied to a manifold valued response situation, because $y_i - F(x_i)$ is not</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>well defined operation. Therefore a new approach is needed to address regression with a response $Y$ on an object space.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We are also concerned with  attempt to study quantitatively perceived color. Ideally, our research would lead to 3D reconstruction of a surface, based on its digital camera colored images.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Interest in online rating data has increased in recent years in which ordinal ratings of products or local businesses are provided by users of a website, such as Yelp! or Amazon. One source of heterogeneity in ratings is that users apply different standards when supplying their ratings; even if two users benefit from a product the same amount, they may translate their benefit into ratings in different ways. In the first chapter we propose an ordinal data model, which we refer to as a multi-rubric model, which treats the criteria used to convert a latent utility into a rating as user-specific random effects, with the distribution of these random effects being modeled nonparametrically. We demonstrate that this approach is capable of accounting for this type of variability in addition to usual sources of heterogeneity due to item quality, user biases, interactions between items and users and the spatial structure of the users and items. We apply the model developed here to publicly available data from the website Yelp! and demonstrate that it produces interpretable clusterings of users according to their rating behavior, in addition to providing better predictions of ratings and better summaries of overall item quality. In the third chapter, we develop a stochastic variational inference based approach to implement the multi-rubric models.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Do Sul (2019) is a work written for chamber orchestra based around the baião rhythm originating from the northeast of Brazil. This rhythm forms the basis for many genres of music originating from this region of Brazil such as forró or xóte. The rhythm is in duple meter and uses a dotted eighth note on the first beat with the final sixteenth note of the first being tied to a full quarter note on the second beat. This simple rhythmic pattern allows for extensive variations. Do Sul explores a portion of these variations.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>		The work begins by introducing the baião rhythm subtly and moving through multiple variations of the rhythm before finally stating the rhythm clearly later in the work and then disintegrating once again representing a tragis outcome for this central rhythm. Do Sul essentially begins with the variations before revealing the source material.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>		Do Sul in Portuguese means "from the south." The title represents the origin of the work's basis coming from places in the far south, such as Brazil. The title also hints at the Amerindian as well as African origins of this rhythm.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Possibly affecting at least 1.5 million Americans today, cardiomyopathy greatly contributes to the reign of heart disease as the number one killer in the United States.  Consisting of four main disease manifestations (hypertrophic, dilated, restrictive, and arrythmogenic right ventricular), this heterogeneous group of myocardium diseases can cause an array of dysfunction often leading to heart failure related disability or death. Interestingly, cardiomyopathy has been associated to sarcomeric variants. Therefore, the goal of my dissertation research was to elucidate calcium sensitivity in the attenuation of two mutations with opposing cardiomyopathy phenotypes, to dive deeper into a possible treatment method for a strong calcium sensitizing cardiomyopathy mutation, and to further classify transcriptomic as well as sex differences observed within our cardiomyopathy mouse model. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In order to test the hypothesis that two mutations with opposing effects on myofilament calcium sensitivity, a cardiomyopathy indicator, could attenuate disease manifestation, we interbred the HCM-associated cTnT-I79N mouse model and the DCM-associated cTnT-R141W+/- mouse model which exhibit calcium sensitivity and de-sensitivity, respectively. We analyzed the skinned cardiac muscle preparation, echocardiography, fibrosis content, heart weight, and ex vivo pacing of the progeny of these two breeding pairs. Overall, we found that attenuation was possible for the progeny with a lessened calcium sensitivity in cardiac preparations, attenuated hemodynamics, lessened fibrosis content, and complete ablation of arrhythmia and electrocardiogram QRS widening. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>With the previous study pinpointing calcium sensitivity as a promising venue for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy treatment exploration, we looked to the main calcium sensor subunit of troponin and the HCM cTnC-A8V mouse model that had been previously characterized in our lab for more answers. Importantly, the previous study provided a proof of concept that a cardiomyopathy phenotype could be attenuated in utero as we were studying the bred progeny of our mutant mice pairing. However, in a true human experience, a patient would be diagnosed post disease manifestation. To mimic this scenario we chose to design an experiment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy “treatment” post disease manifestation. Multiple studies have elucidated the role of phosphorylated regulatory light chain (RLC) plays in enhancing contraction. Furthermore, cardiac myosin light chain kinase (cMLCK) has also been extensively studied in its dedicated role as an RLC phosphorylator. Pinpointing cMLCK as a viable target for therapeutic treatment of a calcium sensitizing HCM mutation, we decided to breed a conditional cMLCK knock-out mouse with our cTnC-A8V mouse model. This proved a conditional cMLCK knock-out cTnC-A8V mouse, which we could allow to progress through natural disease and choose when to “treat” the effects of the mutation by knocking out a main RLC phosphorylator. In effect, this would test the hypothesis that a lessening of myosin head availability to bind, by the dephosphorylation of myosin heads, would therefore decrease contraction in a mouse model whose hypertrophy is majorly impacted by its hyper-contractile phenotype due to a genetically heightened calcium sensitivity. To study the effects of this experimental set-up analysis was done on echocardiography, heart weight to tibia length ratios, histopathology, fibrosis quantification, Pressure-volume loops, protein quantification through western blots, and RNA sequencing, before and after treatment. This project is currently underway. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The last experiment is a branch off of the cTnC-A8V experiment, which specifically views the transcriptomic profile of the HCM mouse model to discover dimorphisms. After analyzing the echocardiography of some of the cTnC-A8V mice, slightly noticeable sexual differences seemed hidden in the morphology. Sure enough this became evident in analysis. Therefore we ran RNA sequencing on male and female cTnC-A8V mice and their controls to further explore this sexual dimorphism. This study uncovered multiple avenues for further HCM exploration and may explain many of the physical differences we see between the male and female HCM hearts. This experiment has concluded and is currently being reviewed for publication.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Overall, calcium sensitivity and its role in contraction, stress, and thus, hypertrophy, plays an important role in cardiomyopathy and can be attenuated. The HCM cTnC-A8V mutation exhibits sex differences especially in metabolism and hypertrophy response. Furthermore, cMLCK has proved itself a promising therapeutic target for HCM.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Conceptual teaching requires the secondary music educator to focus their attention on musical concepts that can be used to address various technical deficiencies. This can be as simple as teaching a student how to tune independently of a tuning device or encouraging students to perform without a conductor. The tendency in music education to evaluate ensemble programs via assessment rubrics puts pressure on music educators to place a great deal of focus on technical achievement often to the detriment of musical expression and meaning. To that end, the conceptual teaching of sound, articulation, balance and blend, and student engagement will be discussed within the corpus of this work. To enhance the argument for conceptual teaching, five master teachers have been interviewed for this study. Three of these candidates are high school band and orchestra teachers, one was a long-time middle school band director, and the final is a collegiate orchestra director. The success of a secondary instrumental ensemble relies on the mindset of the educator, on how he or she instructs individual students to perform, think, and conceptualize musical ideas. This assertion frees educators from the limiting formula of success based exclusively on teaching with a focus on technical skill.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Although several studies have examined race and gender differences in gun-related attitudes, little is known about how racialized and gendered attitudes might contribute to the gun policy preferences and gun ownership rates of Americans. Using Wave 4 of the Baylor Religious Survey, this dissertation estimates a series of binary logistic regressions to model gender and racial attitudes on gun policy preferences and gun ownership. I find that racial attitudes are strongly correlated with gun policy preferences among whites. I find that gender attitudes also matter for gun policy preferences. Moreover, I find that there is gender variation in how adherence to gender role ideology influences gun ownership and gun policy support. The results indicate that Americans who report more implicit resentment or more traditional gender role attitudes are more likely to support policies that would increase the number of armed people in schools and allow more people to carry concealed firearms and less likely to support policies that would limit the possession of handguns, semi-automatic weapons, and high capacity magazines. These associations persisted with adjustments for age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, household income, marital status, the presence of children, religious identity, religiosity, political orientation, region of residence, and urban residence. These analyses demonstrate that the gun preferences of Americans are partly determined by their racial and gender beliefs. Importantly, this includes policies that have overwhelming support in the population, such as requiring mental health screenings or requiring gun safety courses for ownership. I conclude that implicit resentment and traditional gender role belief are consistently associated with less restrictive and more precarious gun policy preferences among white Americans.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Research evidences a link between eating disorders and suicidal behaviors, and capability for suicide has been proposed as a mechanism underlying this relationship. Negative body attitudes and experiences (BAE) are another promising set of explanatory variables, central to eating disorder pathology and theoretically aligned with capability for suicide. This study investigated direct pathways between BAE, particularly body protection, and lethality and frequency of past suicide attempts, as well as indirect pathways through capability for suicide (pain tolerance, fearlessness about death) and severity of eating pathology. The study also evaluated whether BAE differentiated among suicide attempt, ideation, and non-suicidal groups. Adults currently receiving eating disorder treatment (N = 352; 55.5% outpatient; 92.8% female; mean age 28.1 years) completed self-report measures of BAE, eating pathology, capability for suicide, and suicide-related variables. The PROCESS macro was utilized to test proposed direct and indirect pathways, and a Dunnett’s T3-corrected MANOVA evaluated differences in BAE across suicide groups. Results indicated low body protection was significantly directly associated with increased lethality and quantity of past suicide attempts. Only the indirect pathway through pain tolerance in predicting attempt frequency was significant. Further, body protection and lack of body familiarity differentiated among all suicide groups, while body attitudes and comfort with touch differentiated attempters from non-attempters, and body care differentiated non-suicidal participants from those with attempt or ideation history. Findings suggest BAE, particularly low body protection and lack of body familiarity, may merit consideration in studying the propensity of those with eating disorders to engage in suicidal behavior.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>At the end of the twentieth century, southern states boasted the largest number of private schools of any region within the United States, accounting for thirty percent of the nation’s independent elementary and secondary institutions.[1] Most of the schools, and almost all found in rural communities, date back to the late 1960s and early 1970s when the federal government began to sue individual school districts to enforce desegregation orders. Commonly referred to as “segregation academies,” the schools became white havens where parents could isolate their children from the black students infiltrating their classrooms. Many couched their decision to leave public schools as a desire to protect their children’s “quality of education.” This phrase is best interpreted within the broader context of southern educational history. For over one hundred years, White Southerners showed little interest in their schools at all. Most provided only the rudimentary requirements of traditional education as students in the South consistently lagged behind their peers in other regions of the country in literacy and graduation rates. It is only after integration that “quality of education” enters the public Southern lexicon. The adoption of the phrase in conjunction with establishing private schools reveals the early creation of color-blind rhetoric segregationists could hide behind as society shifted.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Though segregationist academies arose throughout the Deep South, this work focuses primarily on Georgia with supporting evidence from South Carolina, North Carolina, Florida, and Texas. Oral histories, letters to southern politicians, educational reformer reports, and legal briefs delivered to the Supreme Court in response to Brown v. Board provide opportunities to examine the development of racially neutral language as well as gain insight into how community members viewed their schools. Ultimately, white southerners prioritized an education that reinforced segregationist norms and maintained the existing social structure.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This treatise provides an examination of Flausino Vale’s background and a performer’s guide to the 26 Prelúdios Característicos e Concertantes para Violino Só. It considers technical elements, such as performance practice issues and extended techniques, and the meanings of titles, as well as other Brazilian cultural elements that are necessary to create a convincing performance of the preludes. The first chapter discusses Vale’s life, the historical period in which he lived, and composers and artists who influenced him. The second chapter explains cultural aspects that influenced his compositional style and provides a discussion of each prelude. The third chapter provides a graded repertoire list in which the preludes are paired with traditional violin repertoire, as well as a dictionary of terms Vale uses in the preludes. Vale is one of the few Brazilian composers who has managed to integrate traditional Brazilian culture with traditional Western music, and this study integrates this information.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Theatre scholars and practitioners alike recognize the contributions of Jerzy Grotowski.  His avant-garde, experimental, site-specific, immersive, participatory, ritual, and laboratory theatre research, signal turning points in world theatre. In 1970, Grotowski surprised the theatre world by announcing he would no longer engage in the production of theatre for public consumption.  Grotowski’s apostasy set him and his colleagues on a course that would deepen and expand the possibilities for performance in the twentieth, and now twenty-first centuries.  In 1986, Grotowski established a site called the Workcenter in the Tuscan countryside where the penultimate artistic phase of his life would continue after his death: Art as Vehicle.  In 2007, Mario Biagini, a protégé of Grotowski’s who worked at the Workcenter since 1986, established the Open Program performance group at the Workcenter of Jerzy Grotowski and Thomas Richards.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The Open Program extends Grotowski’s legacy into new terrain while maintaining continuity with Grotowski’s contributions.  Critical attention to the threads they pull through from Grotowski’s life work also show the largely under-reported and under-theorized political purchase of Grotowski’s corpus, ranging from lectures and publications to research and performance practices.  The Open Program explicitly builds community and produces performance work in response to troubling political climates locally and globally. Since 2014, the Open Program has engaged in intentional community-building in the Bronx borough of NYC, slowly occasioning an explicit politicization of their performance practices. Their project opens up new social and political territories and conceptions of work in the Grotowski lineage that, for me, call for a use of two terms: “total work,” that is, work seen beyond the boundaries of conventional theatre work; and “radical hospitality,” that is, a movement, with others, toward a “third” place, where ownership and accommodation, transactional calculation and objectification, are no longer the operative categories for engagement, but rather another mode of exchange and attention is generated, if only in precious moments.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>I draw upon participant observation, archival research, and extant literature to assemble a historical narrative that follows Grotowski’s life work into 2017.  The project serves a historiographical purpose, being the first lengthy monograph in English to connect Grotowski’s well-recognized contributions to the Open Program.  In order to fill in the historical record I rely on structured and unstructured interviews, as well as site-specific research and documentation in New York City, in Open Program hard drives, their archive-in-progress at Vallicelle, and in Mario Biagini’s personal library.  My access to this invigorating overflow of information came as a result of extended fieldwork engagement several times in the Bronx, in Pontedera for a Summer Intensive and extended two week stay with international participants, and in a stint with the entire Workcenter in Paris for a robust schedule of film screenings, workshops, panel discussions, and presentations of Workcenter work.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Throughout the duration of these studies, beginning largely when I first encountered the Open Program on Election Night, 2016, I examine the conditions which led to their Bronx-based work with special attention to its political and ethical implications for artists, community advocates, and scholars at the intersections of art and life, aesthetics and politics.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Introduction. Schools across the United States are ramping up security in hopes of preventing shootings and other forms of school violence. There are two types of school security environments: inclusionary and exclusionary. Inclusionary security is intended to monitor and socialize students, while exclusionary environments are intended to remove students from the school. Many schools are supplementing increased security with social support programs and organizational involvement, for a more holistic approach to safety. Although these solutions are widespread, we know little about their implementation and relationship to the school environment. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Theoretical Framework. I employ three theoretical traditions to explore the relationship between security environments, social support programs, organizational involvement, and various outcomes including academic performance, disciplinary action, and parental engagement. Critical race theory primes my approach to this issue, in that implementation of these measures is likely to vary by racial composition of the school in such a way that maintains systematic racial inequality. The mechanisms that maintain this inequality align with Foucauldian surveillance and punishment. These tools of surveillance and punishment may negatively impact the ability of stakeholders to form deep, trusting relationships. From the lens of these theories, I ask, “how do punitive and non-punitive efforts within schools reproduce, or challenge, racial inequality in schools?” </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Methods. In this dissertation, I examine the relationships between security environments, social support programming, organizational involvement, and academic performance, disciplinary action, and parental engagement overall and by school racial composition using the nationally representative 2015-16 wave of the School Survey on Crime and Safety. I explore the implementation of security measures, programs, and organizational involvement by school racial composition using bivariate analyses. I use regression analyses to examine the relationships between security environments, programs, organizations and academic performance, disciplinary actions, and parental engagement. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Findings. I find evidence that exclusionary security environments function more punitively than inclusionary environments, and their effects may be particularly salient in majority-minority schools. I also found that social support programming may be a promising intervention to reduce disciplinary actions within majority white schools, and that law-enforcement based organizational involvement may be detrimental.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Conclusion. Exclusionary security environments bolster pathways from schools to prisons, especially in majority-minority schools. They may also sustain existing racial gaps in academic performance and parental engagement. There is little evidence to suggest that social support programming and organizational involvement improves the overall school environment, or counteracts the negative impacts of exclusionary environments. I posit that when examining organizational involvement in the future, scholars adopt the delineation made in this dissertation between law enforcement-based organizations and community-based organizations, as law enforcement-based organizations may function as part of the exclusionary environment. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>All analysis is subjective, but certain methodologies focus on more positivistic aspects of music, or sometimes give a sense of objectivity by virtue of being widely accepted or deemed rigorous. This dissertation explores the opposite angle, offering three analytical vignettes of chamber music by women composers that put subjective impressions and ideas in the spotlight. Avoiding organicist ideas allows the listener experience and motivating questions to serve as the entry point for analysis. Furthermore, it allows other aspects of the music, or even ideas separate from the music, to receive analytical focus. New approaches will allow for more and changing works to be brought into the discussion. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>All analysis is subjective, but our best-accepted methodologies—the ones that are often considered most “rigorous”—tend to focus on musical elements that are relatively easy to delimit and on relationships that are tightly-knit. This dissertation explores the opposite, offering three analytical vignettes of chamber music by women composers that put subjective impressions and ideas in the spotlight. Laying aside organicist expectations allows listener experience and motivating questions—what is heard in the music that draws the listener in or cannot be forgotten about—to serve as the entry point for analysis. Furthermore, it allows other aspects of the music, or even ideas separate from the music, to receive analytical focus. New approaches will allow for more and different works—including those previously excluded because of their lack of compatibility with available methodologies—to be analyzed brought into the discussion.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In Chapter 1, I describe Judith Lochhead’s three-part approach to analysis, as well as discuss other works that have contributed to my thinking. These sources include music theory and musicology texts, feminist theoretical works, disability theory, and critical race studies. Chapters 2-4 each focus on the work of a different composer using Lochhead’s general approach of investigating, mapping, and speculating. In Chapter 2, I analyze Roulette and A Wonderful Day by British-American composer Anna Clyne, relating my hearing of the human sounds on fixed media to feminist scholar Donna Haraway’s “Manifesto for Cyborgs.” Haraway’s explanation of the cyborg, a creature of a post-gender world, shapes my understanding of Clyne’s music, specifically the engagement between human and machine. Through this lens I consider the implications of minimalism and the role of the performers in the broader presentation of the pieces. In Chapter 3 I engage with the gendered through-lines of emotional labour in Kate Soper’s “Only the Words Themselves Mean What They Say.” I identify multiple modes of presentation as a way of considering the text and interaction between performers. In Chapter 4, I draw upon biographical information and my own curiosity about Sofia Gubaidulina’s Silenzio to investigate representations of sound and silence in the piece. I read that repetition, register, and timbre are utilized to explore and musically represent different kinds of silence. Chapter 5 provides a summary and discussion of my analytical goals, and includes ideas for future projects.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The improvement of critical thinking ability among university students is widely accepted as a goal of higher learning.  However, as an objective it frequently remains loosely defined in curriculum, and there is little agreement regarding how best to encourage its development in learners.  This dissertation investigated the use of a pedagogy that infused explicit critical thinking learning objectives into subject matter instruction, and utilized formative feedback to encourage learning and metacognition.  Two groups were recruited for this study, which was conducted over twelve weeks of a semester. The treatment group received modified assignments that featured infused critical thinking instruction, and the control group was immersed in course content with no explicit critical thinking instruction or feedback.  Although there were no significant differences between the two groups in class performance measures, the treatment group displayed significant gains in critical thinking ability that was not seen in the control group.  In addition, treatment participants reported changes in metacognition in response to their instruction, despite the metacognitive measures failing to indicate a significant difference from the control.  The implications of the findings on future research into this instructional approach were discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation analyzes the organization of pitch in Benjamin Britten’s parables for church performance: Curlew River (1964), The Burning Fiery Furnace (1966), and The Prodigal Son (1968). On account of their varied influences (including medieval, modernist, and non-Western music), these three works raise questions about the suitability of mainstream tonal and post-tonal analytical techniques. This dissertation proposes that the pitch organization of these works be understood as the selective combination of certain features of an ambiguously-articulated tonality. Often, Britten transforms motives by using both modal alteration and post-tonal pc-based operations. The motivic iterations that result reflect the organizational influence of the diatonic collection without necessarily contributing to a sense of tonality. Elsewhere, Britten distills properties like stepwise motion and the distinction between collection membership and non-membership from tonality, applying them to other pitch structures. These varying approaches to pitch organization frequently correlate with the characterizations, actions, and narrative of the stories as they unfold.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter 1 provides background on the parables for church performance before reviewing literature that touches upon the major areas of theoretical inquiry. These areas include previous analyses of Britten’s music, gender, sexuality, and disability studies, approaches to twentieth-century tonal music and post-tonal diatonicism, and analytical approaches to non-Western music. Chapter 2 critically examines some published readings of tonality in the church parables, finding some disagreement and a general trend of oversimplification. The analytical portion of the chapter takes as its point of departure Britten’s development of borrowed modal melodies. As diatonic subsets, these borrowed melodies may be modally altered; within the modernist contexts that Britten introduces, they may also be chromatically transposed and inverted. Polyphonic combinations of modally-altered melodies lead to innovative counterpoint and speculative dissonance treatment. Since Britten borrowed these modal melodies from sacred music, their analysis relates to the religious themes of the works.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter 3 examines the role of chromaticism in music written for the Madwoman, Nebuchadnezzar, and the Tempter—three roles all debuted by Britten’s partner, Peter Pears. Musically, Britten depicts the Madwoman’s madness through the use of inversional symmetry, fuzzy transposition, and tonally incongruous pitch classes and sets. In music associated with Nebuchadnezzar, Britten dissociates ornamental gestures from their traditional contexts and applies them to the octatonic collection. Concealed pitch-class symmetries add to the othering of the Tempter, especially against the musical backdrop of the stable tonality associated with the Father (a foil of sorts). Analysis reveals that chromatic pitch organization contributes to the characterization of these principal roles. Chapter 4 traces a similar analytical thread through the parables, now focusing on secondary and supporting characters. In Curlew River, chromaticism, near relations, and fuzzy relations serve to musically set the Ferryman in relief against the modal music associated with other minor characters. Modal alterations of a motive in The Burning Fiery Furnace suggest the interpretation of the diatonic collection as a “container,” a metaphor for the circumscription of Nebuchadnezzar’s courtiers’ power. Chapter 4 also highlights strict harmonic and melodic coordination in music associated with the Father’s Servants that musically depicts repressive diligence.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter 5 considers the pitch organization of select passages in the church parables that display the influence of non-Western music. In certain passages, Britten synthesizes sonorities inspired by a Japanese instrument (the shō) with Western approaches to harmonic progression and voice leading. By tracing the influence of shō performance practice on the parables, this chapter furnishes yet another perspective on the vestiges of tonality to be found in Britten’s later music.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This dissertation studies childhood maltreatment and its implications for mid-life adults’ mental and relational functioning through two distinct manuscripts, each taking a different focus on the topic. The first manuscript considers whether experiencing emotional and physical abuse during childhood creates vulnerability for midlife adults’ responses to daily interpersonal stressors (e.g., arguments).  Specifically, it examines if reports of abuse by parents during childhood moderates the relationship of adults’ daily interpersonal stressor exposure and severity with daily negative affect. The second manuscript considers a possible relational pathway linking child maltreatment with adult mental health. Specifically, this analysis tests if the quality of adult’s romantic relationships mediates longitudinal associations of childhood maltreatment with depressive and socially anxiety symptoms, and it considers differences between men and women. Data from both studies are from the multifaceted Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS) study. Results of the first study indicate that retrospective report of abuse by mothers was associated with a greater number of daily interpersonal stressors, more severe daily interpersonal stressors, and higher average negative affect.  By contrast, report of abuse by fathers was associated only with greater average negative affect. Results from multilevel modeling yielded no evidence that experienced abuse during childhood, by either mother or father, moderated associations of daily interpersonal stressors or their severity with negative affect.  In the second study, it was demonstrated that relationship quality was a potential mechanism linking child maltreatment to depressive and social anxious symptomology for both men and women. Further, gender differences were not found for either direct or indirect effects.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The Eating Disorder Inventory provides a theoretically informed multidimensional assessment of eating disorder symptoms and associated psychological factors, including Perfectionism, Maturity Fears, and Interpersonal Distrust.  Research suggests that these psychological factors predict eating pathology, including Drive for Thinness and Bulimia, over time.  However, it remains unclear whether prognostic value changes across increased durations of follow-up, depends on type of eating pathology studied, and depends on whether participants are drawn from the community versus have an eating disorder at baseline.  The present study examined whether the strength of the predictive ability of psychological factors on eating pathology differs based on temporal duration, symptom outcome, and sample source.  Data were obtained from a longitudinal study of eating and health behaviors in a sample of college students (N=900, 69.4% female) and a subsample with eating disorders (ED) (N=127) who completed assessments at baseline and again at 10-, 20-, and 30-year follow-up. Secondary analyses were conducted to determine the independent predictive ability of three Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI) psychological factors (Perfectionism, Maturity Fears, and Interpersonal Distrust) on the EDI eating pathology factors of Drive for Thinness and Bulimia at increasing durations of follow-up in the full sample and in the ED subsample. Multivariable regression analyses indicated that higher Perfectionism predicted increased Drive for Thinness at 10-, 20- and 30-year follow-up in the full sample with effect size increasing from 20- to 30-year follow-up. Additionally, Maturity Fears predicted both Drive for Thinness and Bulimia in the full sample at 20- and 30-year follow-up with increasing effect size from 20- to 30-year follow-up. In contrast, Interpersonal Distrust predicted lower Drive for Thinness, with trending significance, at 30-year follow-up in the full sample only. In the subsample, Perfectionism predicated Drive for Thinness at 10- and 30-year follow-up, and effect size decreased from 10- to 20-year follow-up and increased from 20- to 30-year follow-up. Maturity Fears predicted both Drive for Thinness and Bulimia in the subsample at 10-, 20-, and 30-year follow-up with decreasing effect sizes from 10- to 20-year follow-up for Drive for Thinness and from 20- to 30-year follow-up for Bulimia.  Results point to the long-lasting influence of Perfectionism and Maturity Fears as risk and maintenance factors for elevated eating pathology. Results particularly emphasize the utility of addressing Perfectionism and Maturity Fears in college-based interventions for eating disorders as well as in treatment.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The current study investigated the processing and acquisition of Spanish cognates among (L1) English - (L2) Spanish intermediate level bilingual speakers. Research has extensively shown cognates are processed faster and more accurately (see for example De Groot, 1992, 1993; Dijkstra &amp; Van Hell, 2001 Kroll et al., 1998; Dijkstra et al., 1999; Lemhofer and Dijkstra, 2004). Previous studies have also examined the effects of instruction on the processing and acquisition of cognates and show positive outcomes associated with the role of cognate awareness (Treville, 1996; Otwinowska,2009) and explicit instruction (Caplan-Carbin 2006; Dressler, 2011; Mólnar, 2010). However, these studies seem to diverge on how instruction per se is perceived and therefore operated. The present study examined the impact of implicit and explicit of vocabulary instruction on the processing and acquisition of L2-Spanish cognates and non-cognates. Findings from lexical decisions tasks before and after treatment (N= 130 intermediate English-Spanish learners) indicate instruction is not shown to have a direct positive impact in the processing or acquisition of L2 cognates in Spanish. Results show lexical processes in general (cognates and non-cognates) can benefit from any type of target language input which may or may not include types of formal language instruction (implicit or explicit). However, the combination of explicit and implicit instruction prevents learners from processing non-cognates faster in the posttest. The higher degree of morpho-phonological features English and Spanish cognates share doesn’t seem to speed up L2 lexical processing in comparison to non-cognates. The present study gives implications for models of bilingual word processing, such as the Distributed Lexical/Conceptual Feature model (Kroll and De Groot, 1997).</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Black men graduate at low numbers across all racial and gender groups in doctoral programs.  Historically, racial microaggressions and inadequate socialization are highlighted as recurring challenges in graduate degree attainment for students of color.  The purpose of these studies is to explore the influence of racialized stress on the experiences of Black men in the academy.  My first study investigates the socialization of Black men in graduate school and junior faculty roles, and the second study focuses on racialized encounters within their academic journey using Smith’s (2004) Racial Battle Fatigue model. The final paper will position a new theoretical framework for Black men in the academy using findings from the first two papers. Collectively these studies are based on qualitative interviews with 30 Black men from 24 four-year Research Intensive predominately white institutions. This collective body introduced the Racially Responsive Early Career Socialization Model as a method for understanding Black men in the academy. Ultimately, this work will be used to strengthen how we understand the experiences of Black men and how the academy can best assist in the doctoral degree attainment.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Sexual violence is a continued and pervasive problem on college campuses. As such, colleges and universities have done a lot of work in recent years to improve the availability and access to prevention and interventions services. However, there is still a large gap in understanding the needs and experiences of students other than the cisgender female in reference to sexual violence. This lack of understanding contributes to the continued perception that campus sexual health service centers are “women’s centers” and an incomplete understanding of how to effectively serve other populations. This dissertation attempts to address that gap by assessing the association between gender identity and both experiences of sexual violence as well as mental health, physical health, and academic success outcomes after an incident of sexual violence. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	A secondary data analysis of the National College Health Assessment was performed utilizing students who identify as a cisgender female, cisgender male, transgender female, or transgender male and had reported experiencing at least one incidence of sexual violence in the past 12-months. Results show a difference in experience of sexual violence with cisgender males who have experienced sexual violence being more likely to have experienced multiple forms of sexual violence in the past year as compared to their cisgender female peers (OR: 1.96), while transgender men were more likely to experience unwanted sexual touching as compared to both cisgender women (OR: 1.56) and cisgender men (OR: 1.14). Also, transgender women were more susceptible to negative outcomes related to sexual violence with significantly higher rates of substance use in both number of illicit substances (M = 8.76, CI: 8.09, 9.44) and days of monthly substance use (M = 28.92, CI: 26.55, 31.29) when having experienced multiple forms of sexual violence. Across the board students who had experienced sexual violence had lower grade point averages and were struggling academically. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The results encourage service centers to consider the intersectional nature of gender identity and experience of sexual violence when designing both prevention and intervention programs. Further, understanding the differing ways that individuals of unique gender identities may respond to an experience of sexual violence provides insight on how to design those services and to identify vectors of outreach for identifying persons who have experienced sexual violence.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Writing is essential for communication in literate societies, and its successful acquisition and development is central to academic achievement. As such, there is a critical need to foster children’s emergent writing skills during the preschool years. Beginning writers gradually develop componential skills within the domains of handwriting, spelling, and composing that ultimately enable them to translate thoughts and ideas into printed words to convey a message. Teacher participation in writing interactions is essential for beginning writers who need guidance in various aspects of writing (e.g., forming letters, spelling words, composing messages). Thus, the current study was motivated by the need to advance understanding of teachers’ current instructional practices for supporting preschool children’s emergent writing skills. The key aims were: 1) to describe preschool teachers’ supportive strategies for writing using a novel observational measure; and 2) to determine whether teachers’ beliefs about writing is associated with their instructional practices for writing. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para/>
            <DISS_para>Thirty teacher-child dyads completed a picture description writing task in which they were asked to write sentences describing a set of three pictures. A researcher-developed coding scheme was used to document teachers’ supportive strategies during the writing task. The coding scheme included ten different strategies. Teachers’ strategies were classified by the domain of writing addressed (i.e., handwriting, spelling, composing), and the type of strategy used. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Descriptive analyses revealed a wide variation in teachers’ instructional practices for writing. However, teachers’ strategies generally required them to be highly supportive and afforded limited high-demand learning opportunities for children. Directives, modeling, and close-ended requests were among the most frequently used strategies. Moreover, teachers applied strategies to support spelling to a significantly greater degree than handwriting. Lastly, correlational analyses showed that teachers’ beliefs about writing were significantly associated with their rate of spelling mediation. Accordingly, current findings help to expand the description of teachers’ writing practices in preschool and show the extent to which teachers’ instructional methods align with recommended best practices. Information from this study may be used to identify areas for which teachers require professional development to further support emergent writing development in preschool.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Hip-hop culture and music in South Carolina (SC) are rarely discussed in the field of ethnomusicology. My thesis crosses the intersections of ethnomusicology and Black geography to investigate how Black hip-hop artists in Charleston, SC make space for themselves and other Black people in the locale. Through personal interviews with eleven artists, video analysis, lyrical analysis, music description, participant observation, and archival research, I come to understand that Black hip-hop artists in Charleston are Black place-makers that make space to define themselves, celebrate, “come to voice,” and push boundaries. This work is notable not only because of the paucity of literature related to ethnomusicological studies of Southern hip-hop, but because it connects to issues like gentrification, and racial disparities that are present throughout all the United States, not only Charleston. My interviewees present a fresh perspective, outside of the Northern urban plight narrative in hip-hop culture. As Southerners (some by way of locales outside of Charleston), these artists assert that they deserve a space in the city of Charleston regardless of how they may be displaced by those who have power.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In the growing field of heritage language acquisition numerous studies have been done in the last twenty years. However, one structure that has not been studied in detail is double-que questions (DQQs) in Spanish. Therefore, this dissertation analyzes the production and comprehension of double-que questions in child and adult heritage speakers of Mexican Spanish. DQQs are structures with que ‘that’ + wh­phrase (e.g., what, who, where, etc.) and a verb of saying like preguntar, ‘to ask’. They are used in Spanish for indirect questions to report what was said before, as in the following example from Suñer (1991): </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para> Me 	preguntaron	[que] 	[a quién]	invitarás	tú	al	concierto. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para> to­me 	they asked    	[that]  	[whom]  	will­invite 	you   	to­the 	concert </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para> ‘They asked me whom you will invite to the concert.’ </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para/>
            <DISS_para>In this example, the verb is followed by the complementizer que that antecedes the wh­phrase a quién ‘to whom’, forming a DQQ structure to report what was asked about the concert.  This construction is not available in English. Moreover, in English, indirect questions can only be expressed with the verb ‘to ask’, while in Spanish different verbs of saying can be used, such as decir ‘to tell’, gritar, ‘to yell’, and contestar ‘to reply’.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this dissertation, participants include child and adult Mexican monolingual control groups that were compared to child and adult heritage speakers of Mexican origin. Children have been used in previous studies (e.g., Polinsky 2011) to determine incomplete acquisition and language attrition.  Therefore, these groups will be compared, and this will allow us to determine whether incomplete acquisition or language attrition can explain the potentially divergent uses of DQQs. The data came from a production task, a preference task, and an acceptability judgment task. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In sum, this study contributes to the little research done on DQQs and mainly on the very little research on heritage speaker children. Unlike previous studies, it uses oral production and oral comprehension tasks. Importantly, by using different groups of bilinguals, it investigates whether divergent uses of DQQs in heritage speakers are due to incomplete acquisition or language attrition.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation examines the ways in which institutions of theological higher learning cultivated particular spatial perspectives among reformed evangelicals committed to the success of America’s republican, democratic experiment. These “spatial” perspectives facilitated how evangelicals thought about, constructed, and engaged different types of space—from the space of their physical bodies to the spaces of their town, region, city, state, nation, and world. Reformed evangelicals worried that if left to their own devices, America’s republican citizenry would divulge into anarchy. Organizing and regulating space from within a proper, ‘orthodox’ theological outlook, served as a check upon America’s emerging republican spirit. I position the work at the intersection of American religious history, the history of higher education, spatial theory, and more recent scholarship on religion and imperialism. In this work, I argue that institutions of theological higher learning emerged as a result of an intertwined theological and spatial contestation between evangelicals and non-evangelicals. The theo-spatial politics present in the founding of these institutions functioned to broaden the spatial perspectives of ministerial students who increasingly looked beyond their local communities for vocational opportunities. Such a broadening resulted in the creation of various conflicting regional and national identities that contributed to the rising sectional crisis that preceded the American Civil War.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Landscape influences various areas of the Oceti Sakowin such as their history, community, spiritual belief, sovereignty and natural resources. However, their land, the center of who they are, continues to be affected by capitalistic methods of production. Because the American government possesses a capitalistic perception and production of land, it generates a repetitive cycle of dispossession, exploitation, and marginalization of Native Nations through the use of a capitalist mode of production. The connection Native tribes have to their land is the drive that propels them to resist against corporate and federal intrusion. This is seen in cases such as the opposition towards the Dakota Access pipeline, the reclaiming of the Black Hills, and the current objections of the Keystone XL pipeline. Dispossession, allotments, assimilation processes, federal policies, and land exploitation are the result of a capitalistic perception of land that continues to marginalize Indigenous Nations. For the purpose of this project, it focuses mainly on the connection between landscapes, dispossession and its outcomes, exploitation, prosthetic memory, and resurgence. This research observes how Landsberg’s prosthetic memory concept is used in Indigenous resurgence movements to gain support through the cinema and social media. Essentially, prosthetic memory is an asset in reestablishing an Indigenous based perspective of land and stop the repetitive cycle of the capitalistic production and view of land.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This treatise presents a selected, graded list of violin repertoire that focuses on irregular and mixed meter. The repertoire selected for this project features works for violin and piano, violin solo, and violin duet, and includes pieces at the intermediate and advanced levels. This list is meant to serve as a resource for violinists and violin teachers to prepare their students for performing works including irregular and mixed meter in orchestral, chamber, and solo settings, and to incorporate more contemporary music into their students’ repertoire. This treatise takes a pedagogical approach by pinpointing technical and musical features for each piece, along with a suggested piece of the same general level from the standard repertoire. Additionally, this treatise provides preparatory exercises and recommended materials to supplement rhythmic training in the private lesson.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Multivariate statistical monitoring schemes are useful tools for quality improvement in industries like manufacturing, healthcare, and transportation among others. Practitioners use monitoring methods to detect significant changes in metrics of interest. This dissertation focuses on the problem of spatial-temporal surveillance of count data collected sequentially over time from a geographical area, such as the number of disease cases in a region or the number of crashes on a roadway with a purpose of detecting changes in rates of events. The research makes contributions to address in several challenges that are known to adversely affect the change detection performance of traditional statistical monitoring techniques. Among the challenges addressed are temporal autocorrelation and seasonality, non-homogeneity due to varying sample size, and parameter estimation errors in count data monitoring. We develop several new cumulative sum monitoring methodologies for count data to address these particular challenges. Comparative simulation analyses demonstrate advantages of the proposed approaches relative to some existing methods when accounting for temporal autocorrelation and seasonality, non-homogeneity from varying sample sizes, and parameter estimation errors in monitoring specific models of count data. Traffic crash data from the Florida Department of Transportation is used to illustrate the performance of the proposed methods for detecting shifts in crash count data.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) induces acute alterations in cerebral blood flow (CBF) autoregulation and cerebral artery contractility, which increases the risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases, as well as ischemic and hemorrhagic events. Progesterone modulates vascular tone in both males and females. Specifically, Progestin and adipoQ receptor family member 7 (PAQR7) is a plasma membrane progesterone receptor expressed in the arterial smooth muscle tissue of both animals and humans. Much of our knowledge of PAQR7 function comes from studying smooth muscle from conduit vessels (umbilical artery and vein) and has not been investigated in resistance size cerebral arteries that control local brain blood flow and tissue perfusion. While progesterone has successfully treated aspects of TBI in experimental models, this effect has failed to translate in human clinical trials, potentially due to its effects on multiple receptor subtypes. Here, we investigated the effects of TBI on the expression of PAQR7 and its smooth muscle vasodilatory action in cerebral arteries 24 hours following a moderately severe TBI in male Sprague Dawley rats. A combination of one-way and two-way ANOVA along with student’s t tests were used to examine statistical significance. Pressurized arterial myography of endothelium-denuded middle cerebral arteries exhibited robust vasodilation to pharmacological activation of PAQR7 (p&lt;0.0001, n=6), adenylyl cyclase (p&lt;0.0001, n=6), protein kinase A (PKA; p&lt;0.0001, n=6), and protein kinase G (PKG; p=0.0021, n=6; one-way ANOVA). PAQR7-induced vasodilation (10-5M, p&lt;0.005, n=6) was abolished with SQ 22536, an adenylyl cyclase inhibitor (p=0.9480, n=6), as well as cAMPS-Rp, a PKA inhibitor (p=0.7473, n=6), or Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS, a PKG inhibitor (p=0.5123, n=6). Basal myogenic tone at physiological pressure (~70mmHg) was significantly lower in TBI as compared to sham arteries (p&lt;0.0001; n=12), and KCl-induced vasoconstriction (60mM) was significantly attenuated in TBI arteries (p&lt;0.0001; n=12). Neither total PAQR7 protein expression (Western blotting; p=0.5931, n=7) nor PAQR7 mRNA expression (qPCR; p=0.5751, n=7) was significantly affected by TBI. Pharmacological activation of PAQR7, adenylyl cyclase, PKA, and PKG all induced vasodilation in a concentration-dependent manner in sham arteries (10-9M to 10-5M); but this response was absent in arteries from TBI animals (p&gt;0.05). While inhibitors of PKA and PKG had no effect on baseline myogenic tone, administration of an adenylyl cyclase inhibitor (10-5M, p=0.0360, n=6) significantly enhanced myogenic tone in sham arteries, but this effect was absent in TBI arteries. Moreover, PAQR7-induced vasodilation (10-5M, p&lt;0.005, n=6) was abolished with inhibitors of adenylyl cyclase (10-5M, p=0.9480, n=6), but not PKA (10-5M, p=0.7473, n=6), or PKG (10-5M, p=0.5123, n=6) in sham arteries; however, inhibitors had no effect on PAQR7-induced vasodilation in TBI arteries (P&gt;0.05). The results of the current study support a generalized state of arterial smooth muscle relaxation and resultant hyperemia (tissue hyperperfusion) 24 hours following TBI. Indeed, arterial responsiveness to components of vasodilatory signaling and vasoconstrictor capacity are attenuated following TBI. The concomitant attenuation of myogenic tone (larger resting diameter at physiological pressure) along with reduced vasoconstrictor capacity could render downstream capillary networks vulnerable to rupture. TBI-induced vasodilation (attenuation of smooth muscle arterial tone) may be targeted to mitigate the hyperemic phase of altered CBF and improve TBI outcome.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The smalltooth sawfish (Pristis pectinata) is a critically endangered species endemic to the Atlantic Ocean. The only known viable populations have been found along the coast of Florida as well as in the coastal areas of the Bahamas. In this study, we use passive acoustic telemetry as well as satellite telemetry to track the movements of large juvenile and adult smalltooth sawfish. For the acoustic telemetry part of this study, we make use of hundreds of receivers in the i-Tag, FACT and ACT arrays along the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf coasts to track the movements. Between 2016 and 2019, 42 large juvenile and adult smalltooth sawfish were implanted with V16 transmitters with 10-year battery lives. As of November 2019, 22 females and 16 males implanted with the transmitters have been detected on more than 350 receivers ranging from off the coast of Brunswick, Georgia to the lower Florida Keys and along the Gulf coast to Appalachee Bay. This study also uses data from 15 satellite tags deployed from March 2011 to March 2017. We use observer data from the shrimp, shark bottom longline and gillnet fisheries to identify areas of high fishing pressure based on fishing effort using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). We also analyze the differences in exposure risk based on demographics within the population to determine if any demographic is more vulnerable. Another objective of this study is to identify areas of high sawfish density based on our telemetry data and build a model to predict sawfish aggregations based on several environmental factors including water temperature and day length.  Lastly, we employ network analysis to understand how the sawfish are using the Florida coastline. This information can be used to assess the success of the current protections provided for the species and the critical habitats on which they depend.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Hispanics and Latinx-identifying individuals are the second largest ethnic population in the United States. It is estimated that this group will grow to 24% of the population by 2065.  As the demographics of our student population change, voice teachers seek new and creative ways to engage their pupils and support the community. There are many existing resources that are familiar to the seasoned professional looking for Spanish-language art songs, such as the Hal Leonard Anthology of Spanish Song and collections like the Tonadillas by Enrique Granados, Cuatro madrigales amatorios by Joaquín Rodrigo, and Cinco canciones populares argentinas by Alberto Ginastera. The folk songs of Manuel Ponce are also experiencing increasing popularity. However, in a country where there is a rise of women in traditionally male-dominated professions that is not reflected in assigned vocal repertoire, an appropriate question may be: ¿dónde están las compositoras? This treatise considers the question as it relates to the continuing contributions of Latina composers to classical art song repertoire in the United States.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>There are many Latina identifying women, both foreign born and daughters of immigrants, who are traversing an untrodden path by pursuing careers as composers in the world of classical song literature. Their diverse faces represent the beauty of Latinidad; there is no one way to identify as Latina. Mari Valverde is the daughter of a long line of Mexican Americans whose national identity traces back to the reassignment of the US-Mexico border during the nineteenth century. Mari also identifies as a trans woman and uses her compositions to affect positive social change. She carefully selects texts that serve the soloists or ensembles who commission her work as part of benefit concerts that bring awareness to human rights issues. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Tania León is a Cuban born Afro-Latina who benefited from the United States sponsored Freedom Flight program. She escaped a politically unstable country and combined the dance music of her homeland with jazz and other twentieth-century compositional genres to create her own individual style. Gabriela Lena Frank is the daughter of a Peruvian/Chinese mother and a Lithuanian/Jewish father. Her work explores what it means to exist as a multicultural American in the twenty-first century through the juxtaposition of traditional Peruvian instruments with the traditional Western string quartet or symphony orchestra. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>These three women tell us a story we have yet to hear in the mainstream repertoire of song literature. What does it mean to be an immigrant woman in a new land? How do women who have witnessed hundreds of years of machismo culture in their life experiences find the courage to dictate their own stories? What kinds of texts do they gravitate toward, and what do their compositional styles say about their journey? Is there something in this literature that can spark the interest of students who do not see themselves represented in standard song literature and who seek something that speaks to their heritage and identity? How would audiences respond to this repertoire? Why aren’t the works of Latina composers programed more often? </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This treatise seeks to close the gap between compositional output and public awareness of song literature composed by Latinas in the United States. Through exposure to and analysis of the works provided, voice teachers and performers alike can become more familiar with non-standard song literature by Latina composers.  The document is organized by composer and contains information in assigning the repertoire to singers by taking into account pedagogical and musical considerations. The reader may also use this information to cultivate a recital program.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Complex analyses involving multiple, dependent random quantities often lead to graphical models – a set of nodes denoting variables of interest, and corresponding edges denoting interactions between nodes. Such graphical data emerges in a variety of areas: chemistry molecules, video graphs, social networks and so on. The edges of graphs are not limited to scalar values. Examples includes road networks, blood vessels, brain fiber tracts that can be represented graphs made of curves with arbitrary shapes (edges) and connected at arbitrary junctions (nodes). To develop statistical analyses for graphical data, one needs mathematical representations and metrics for matching and comparing graphs, and other geometrical tools, such as geodesics, means, and covariances, on representation spaces of graphs. This dissertation utilizes a quotient structure to develop efficient algorithms for computing these quantities, leading to useful statistical tools, including principal component analysis, linear dimension reduction, and analytical statistical testing and modeling. In the end, a novel functional data alignment method is presented that combines global shapes with local landmarks. All the proposed methods are demonstrated using datasets taken from a variety of problem areas.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Food allergy is a globally recognized health problem, which is estimated to affect 8% of children and 10% of adults in the USA. Within the USA, 90% of the food allergies are due to peanut, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, egg, milk, wheat, and soybean, commonly known as the big eight. With recent reports of the high prevalence of sesame allergy (more than 1.5 million children and adults) in the USA, the current list of big eight is poised to change. Oilseeds such as peanuts, tree nuts (cashew, almond, pistachio, etc.), soybean, and sesame make up a significant portion of the current food allergens. Complex oligomeric legumin-like proteins belonging to the cupin superfamily have been recognized as major food allergens in such oilseeds. Inadequate characterization of legumin-like proteins/allergens in their purified native forms and variable clinical allergenicity of different oilseeds deserved systematic investigation. Therefore, the current study was focused on oilseeds from unrelated sources such as tree nuts (almond, Brazil nut, cashew, and pistachio), soybean, and sesame. The specific objectives were to 1) chromatographically purify native legumins from almond, Brazil nut, cashew nut, pistachio, sesame and soy seeds, 2) study select biophysical and biochemical properties of purified native legumins, 3) evaluate cross-reactivity of purified native legumins, 4) compare the effect of in vitro pepsin digestion on proteolysis and allergenicity of purified legumins. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Legumins were purified using different low-pressure liquid chromatography techniques. Purified legumins eluted as single peaks on a size exclusion chromatography column. In solution, LC-MS/MS analysis of proteins further confirmed the purity of proteins where each legumin showed the highest match with the gene-derived amino acid sequence of the legumin. Estimated molecular weights and hydrodynamic radii of purified legumins varied significantly (P &lt; 0.05) from 269 kDa to 331 kDa and 61 Å to 80 Å, respectively, with sesame legumin being the smallest in size and radius. Purified legumins of almond, Brazil nut, cashew, pistachio, sesame, and soybean registered sedimentation coefficients of 13.4S, 12.5S, 13S, 13.4S, 13S, and 11.9S, respectively, with soybean legumin being the most asymmetrical in shape. Amino acid composition of legumins revealed glutamic acid and glutamine to be the dominant amino acids in all legumins. Numerous amino acids showed significant (P &lt; 0.05) variation across multiple (&gt;3) legumins; however, only alanine and threonine showed significant (P &lt; 0.05) differences across all six legumins. Spectral properties revealed all proteins to had their absorbance maximum at 278-279 nm wavelength with differences observed in their local structures. β-sheets dominated all legumins with almond and cashew legumins containing the lowest (34.6%) and the highest (44.2%) percentage of β-sheets, respectively. Electrophoresis of legumins in their native, denatured, and reduced forms revealed differences in their overall charge, size of the protomers &amp; polypeptide profiles, and subunit composition, respectively. None of the legumin proteins was glycosylated.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Cross-reactivity of purified legumins, when probed with their seed-specific rabbit antisera, revealed purified allergens to be cross-reactive with each other in their native, denatured, and reduced forms. Sesame legumin showed the strongest cross-reactivity with other legumins, while soybean showed the weakest based on immunoblotting. The basic subunit of legumins was found to be more cross-reactive compared to the acidic subunit. IgE from nine allergic patients showed a trend similar to the antisera tested. Homology modeling of reported strongly reactive IgE epitopes of almond, cashew, and soybean legumin, when mapped on to the three-dimensional structure of legumins, revealed common epitopic regions in all legumins. Soybean legumin exhibited the highest variation in the epitopic areas compared to other legumins. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In vitro pepsin digestion of legumins under the same experimental conditions revealed legumins to be stable to pepsin and low pH. Soybean legumin was found to be the most resistant to pepsin digestion. Seed-specific antisera could recognize all digested legumins within the two-hour of digestion. Reactivity of allergic patients IgE to the digests was observed until at least 15 minutes of digestion with intact disulfide linkage until the two-hour of digestion. Considerable pH-induced aggregation existed throughout the digestion. The persistence of disulfide bonds and the formation of pH-induced aggregates were speculated to be the primary reasons for the stability of these proteins under the tested experimental conditions.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Voices of the Earth was the composer’s first large-scale work attempting to interweave musical styles from across global history with natural soundscapes, combing natural and primordial sounds (like thunder, rockfalls, and animal calls) that are gradually transformed into sounds from today's world and beyond, which indeed have changed remarkably with all the inventions and innovations over time.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The work consists of four movements, played without pause. The story begins with the writing on the wall that came from the end of the Little Ice Age and the beginning of the Industrial Revolution with the appearance of “Anthropogenic Clouds.” When first world nations became aware of these pollutants, they made many “Ecobling” products. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Clearly, the cost of this increasingly international society has been a “Polluted Planet.” What is next? The composer finished this work during the beginning stages of the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States, and many people were asking that question. The world might just become a “Desolate Badland,” a wasteland haunted by jackals and vultures.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Wizard rock is a community of musicians that creates and performs music based on the narrative, characters, and tropes found in J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series. In this dissertation, I explore several key questions regarding wizard rock practice: how does heroism inform the work of wizard rock musicians? How does collective engagement with Harry Potter through music create a sense of belonging and aid this community in constructing a system of morals? In what ways does this value system reflect the wizard rock community’s ideals of egalitarianism and moral cosmopolitanism? Finally, how does critical reception of the Harry Potter series through these musical works, along with an idealist approach to community organizing, encourage social activism? </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	These questions are framed by transmedia storytelling, a multi-layered approach to narrative fiction popularized by media franchises like Harry Potter. In the 2000s, as social networking and communication technology developed at an exponential rate, transmedia storytelling became a vital tool. At the same time, the so-called millennial generation was coming-of-age; young people experiencing a paradigm shift in communication, marketing, and global connection. As the largest percentage of Harry Potter fans, millennial sensibilities are reflected by the activity of the Harry Potter fan community. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	With this project, I combine ethnographic fieldwork with historical research to thread wizard rock through this narrative of transmedia storytelling, millennial culture, fan creativity and activism, and community-building. In particular, I focus on Harry and the Potters, Tonks and the Aurors, and Lauren Fairweather as case studies – all wizard rock musicians who use their lyrics and performance spaces to speak directly to Harry Potter fans through reference to the series, often with an emphasis on participatory culture. Each of these musicians have worked in the field of wizard rock for more than a decade and still perform today. My study follows wizard rock musicians and their fans in their multi-layered engagement with the Harry Potter series. Throughout this dissertation, I consider the vast impact of the Harry Potter phenomenon through the lens of wizard rock, articulating the universal sense of morality, idealism, heroism, and belonging cultivated by wizard rock musicians in the Harry Potter fandom.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>After the discontinuation of Polycose, the most commonly used maltodextrin in past taste research, investigators have had to rely on other sources. Two newer sources, marketed as replacements, are Maltrin M580 by Grain Processing Corp. and SolCarb by Medica Nutrition. Due to their unique recipes and production methods, it is not possible to say whether the two maltodextrin sources are the same, or even similar, without behavioral tests or chemical analyses directly comparing the two. However, these are not pure stimuli and may contain volatile organic compounds (VOCs) or other contaminants. Here both Maltrin and SolCarb underwent vacuum filtration using a Neo-Pure CTOV-2510 Carbon Block Filter. The solutions, both filtered and unfiltered, were then presented to mice at varying concentrations in a brief-access test over the course of two weeks to determine if mice 1) treated the two sources of maltodextrins differently (measured using lick responses) or 2) altered their lick responses based on filtration. It was found that the source of maltodextrin had little impact on the lick responses of mice, though mice did appear to initiate more trials to Maltrin during the first week of testing. Filtration had a significant effect on lick response in both the first week and across the two-week period. Nevertheless, these effects were modest at best and the results suggest that both Maltrin and SolCarb can reliably be used in maltodextrin research.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Research has shown the acquisition of strong foundational skills (including counting and calculations) is linked to successful outcomes in higher level mathematics and post-school experiences (Jordan, Glutting, &amp; Ramineni, 2010).  However, students with autism often struggle with gaining these foundational skills because of issues with organization, planning, mental flexibility, and other processes associated with working memory (Happe, Booth, Charlton, &amp; Hughes, 2006).  These difficulties sometimes require modifications, changes, or enhancements to traditional mathematics instruction for students with autism to be successful.  Therefore, this research explored the effects of converting the concrete-representational-abstract (CRA) instructional sequence (a known emerging instructional practice) into a newly emerging instructional practice of virtual-representational-abstract (VRA).  The current study replaced concrete manipulatives and concrete graphic organizers with virtual manipulatives and virtual graphic organizers presented via an iPad app (i.e., GO worksheet). The researcher used Model-Lead-Test embedded in the VRA instructional strategy to teach single-digit addition skills (with sums &lt; 10) to three elementary (6-years old) and one secondary student (11-years old) with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).  A multiple probe across participants design was employed to evaluate the effectiveness of the VRA intervention package on the acquisition of single-digit addition skills (with sums &lt; 10).  Findings of this study demonstrated a lack of a functional relation for all four participants.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Dominance and prestige represent two fundamental strategies people use to navigate social hierarchies. Despite a growing literature on the psychology of dominance- and prestige-oriented leaders, less is known about how those strategies operate at relatively low positions in the hierarchy. The current research investigated whether, among people at lower ranks within a social hierarchy, dominance and prestige would be reflected in relatively high levels of malicious versus benign envy, respectively. Two correlational studies (Studies 1 and 2) demonstrated associations between individual differences in dominance and prestige and the tendency to display benign and malicious envy. Two additional studies used experimental procedures to activate orientations toward dominance and prestige and examine benign and malicious envy in the context of hypothetical scenarios (Study 3) and a laboratory group interaction (Study 4). Across the four studies, individual differences in prestige were positively associated with benign envy, and negatively associated with malicious envy. Individual differences in dominance were positively associated with both malicious and benign envy. Across the two experiments, being in a status hierarchy (intended to prime prestige), relative to a power hierarchy (intended to prime dominance), caused people to display higher levels of benign envy. Across the two experiments, no effects on malicious envy were found. The current research illustrates the value of investigating the psychology of subordinate group members from the perspective of dual strategies theory.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Standardized testing, as a practice, has existed for almost two centuries within the United States, having gained both advocates and negative critics over time. Criticisms often include issues concerning test fairness and biases toward different racial, ethnic, and cultural groups. Empirical studies of racial biases in standardized testing have generated mixed results, with a major focus placed on end-of-year and college admissions assessments. In response to the far-reaching impact of standardized tests, the changing demographics within the U.S., and concerns of the cultural appropriateness of different assessments, many test-developers and researchers take care to assess test fairness and validity by analyzing test composition and differential group performance with robust statistical methods, like Differential Item Functioning (DIF) analysis and Differential Test Functioning (DTF) analysis. Other less popular standardized tests are not typically scrutinized as intensely as end-of-year high-stakes tests, with analyses often relying on the total score or mean score comparisons between different groups, leaving the greater potential for biases to present in these assessments. In line with criticisms of testing is the idea of removing [mandatory] standardized tests from the education system, with a potential alternative to measuring student achievement and progression relying heavily on teacher evaluations of students. However, teacher-evaluations are likely problematic in terms of bias, as individuals are not without their own implicit and explicit biases. This necessitates an empirical study of standardized testing bias versus teacher assessment bias. With this, the goals of the present study were threefold: 1) examine a standardized test, the Woodcock-Johnson III Picture Vocabulary scale (WJPV), for racial biases using DIF analysis, 2) examine a teacher-report of student achievement, the Academic Competence subscale from the Social Skills Rating Scale Teacher form (SSRS-T),  using DIF analysis, and 3) identify which measure, at the scale/test-level, exhibited more Differential Test Functioning (DTF) related to race. It was expected that racial biases would present on both measures of achievement, operationalized by DIF and DTF. Results indicated 11 of 17 WJPV items showed DIF and six of nine SSRS-T items showed DIF. In relation to test effects, the WJPV appeared to exhibit more DTF (STDS= -0.22, UTDS=0.95) compared to the SSRS-T (STDS=0.02, UTDS=0.42). The results suggest that both methods of measuring student achievement, standardized assessments and teacher-reports, exhibit bias in terms of differential item and test functioning by race. Also, in the case of the variables included in this study, the standardized test (WJPV) contained more items with DIF that was both significant and large in magnitude.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This treatise explores the history of the bandsemble and an experience of bandsembling through a public lecture recital. The first chapter, “Introduction,” defines the term “bandsemble” and provides historical context on the emergence of the bandsemble and the rhetoric used in contemporary music projects. Chapter 2, “The History,” argues that the bandsemble belongs to a strong tradition of experimentalism in United States chamber music, through highlighting influential composers and performance projects from the past three centuries. Chapter 3, “The Experience,” details the concept of bandsembling as modeled after musicologist Christopher Small’s theory of musicking. It then details the various elements of a bandsembling lecture recital and concludes with a thematic analysis of audience responses to four survey questions. Lastly, Chapter 4, “Conclusions,” contains my final thoughts on the future of the bandsemble and bandsembling.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Advances in technology require the advancement of understanding and creating new materials. Quantum materials - materials exhibiting  quantum behavior- are a hot topic in condensed matter physics.  Perhaps the most well known new materials are the quantum materials termed superconductors, materials with no electrical resistance below a temperature Tc, but there are many more. For example, materials exhibiting frustration of interactions such as inter-atomic forces,  are theorized to lead to another type of quantum material (quantum spin liquids) which could be the key to the next big advance in technology. The synthesis of such a new material proves to be a challenge.  This dissertation explores 1D systems grown through slow evaporation or gel methods, and  frustrated 2D systems grown through electro-crystallization and hydrothermal means. The synthesis and results will be described.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This thesis explores Russia’s perception that it has a strategic security interest in Ukraine, and particularly in Crimea, and evaluates whether there are valid reasons to support that perception.  These issues were brought into sharp focus as a result of the Euromaidan Revolution in Ukraine in February, 2014, and the subsequent Russian seizure and annexation of Crimea. Due to their significance, this thesis begins with a brief discussion of the Euromaidan and Russia’s seizure and annexation of Crimea.  The following chapters focus on Russia’s perception that in spite of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russia remains a great power, and it must be respected as a great power and afforded the privileges within its neighborhood that come with that great power status. The following chapters focus on Russia’s perception that NATO expansion has reached the point of constituting an existential military threat to its strategic security interests, especially with regard to Ukraine and Crimea, and they explore how Russia responded when it perceived that its strategic security interests in Ukraine and Crimea were threatened. They also evaluate whether Russia’s response was justified.  The thesis concludes that there are valid historic and territorial reasons to support Russia’s perception that it has a strategic security interest in Ukraine, and particularly in Crimea, and its perception that NATO constitutes an existential threat to its strategic security interests in the Black Sea theatre. Further, while Russia’s seizure and annexation of Crimea and its invasion of the Donbass were illegal under international law, and illegal under several bilateral and multilateral agreements, Russia’s actions could have been anticipated. And, from Russia’s viewpoint that the Euromaidan Revolution itself was an illegal, unconstitutional “coup”, no one should have been surprised that Russia felt justified in likewise breaching international norms and agreements in its seizing and annexing Crimea.  Finally, the thesis concludes that in the case of Crimea, real politik will prevail, Russia will not return Crimea to Ukraine and neither the U.S. nor its Western allies will intervene to alter that result.  That being said, the thesis concludes that it is in the best interest of Russia, Ukraine and Crimea that the parties find economic, not military, solutions to the present territorial disputes, recognizing that Russia is not going to surrender Crimea and that an economic and political settlement would be the best means to restore active commercial and political relations between Russia and Ukraine.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Sponges form symbioses with a wide array of mesofauna including polychaetes, crustaceans, brittle stars, and bivalves. These organisms use the sponge for food and shelter, but their effect on the sponge is largely unknown. The facultative association of mesofauna with their sponge hosts coupled with the ability to subdivide sponges to control for genotype and size make this a tractable system to study community ecology and the ecology of symbiosis. I posed three questions in my dissertation: (1) How does mesofaunal community composition of the Caribbean fire sponge, Tedania ignis, vary spatially and temporally? (2) How does a change in the regional species pool influence the invasibility and stability of mesofaunal communities? and (3) What is the effect of polychaete worm feeding on the sponge host? I used the Caribbean Fire Sponge to address these questions because it is the dominant sponge on mangrove roots in the Caribbean and it hosts abundant and diverse mesofaunal communities. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To examine the spatiotemporal variation of mesofaunal communities, individuals of T. ignis were collected from a mangrove channel and seagrass meadow annually for three years and associated mesofauna were counted and identified. Mesofaunal communities were strongly influenced by habitat, which was particularly surprising because the environment that the mesofauna experience is mediated by their sponge host. This suggests that abiotic filters restrict dispersal from the regional species pool. Importantly, this study revealed that the regional species pool is dynamic – even when taxonomic composition was relatively stable through time there was turnover of species within a guild across years. In addition, local processes such as disturbance from a cold snap had large, but temporary effects on mesofaunal community composition. This study revealed that mesofaunal communities associated with sponges are influenced by both local and regional processes that occur at different spatial and temporal scales. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To examine how a change in the regional species pool influenced the invasibility and stability of mesofaunal communities, I set up reciprocal transplants annually for three years between T. ignis from a seagrass meadow and T. ignis from a mangrove channel. Mesofaunal community composition differed significantly among transplants. Sponges that were transplanted back to the native habitat had mesofaunal communities that were distinct from each other and these differences may be explained by environmental filtering or differences between the mesofaunal regional species pool in the mangrove and seagrass site. Sponges that were transplanted between habitats had mesofaunal communities that resembled those of both the habitat source and the transplant site, but there was a stronger influence of the transplant site on the mesofaunal community composition. The change in the composition of mesofaunal communities moved between habitats suggests that a change in the regional species pool can precipitate turnover of species within a mesofaunal community. In addition, species that were gained (or lost) following the transplant tended to be species that occurred as epibionts, had weak ties to the sponge host, and only occurred in one habitat.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Finally, to assess the effect of polychaete worm feeding on the sponge host, I tested two hypotheses: (1) mesofaunal symbionts are more likely to colonize their native host than a novel host and (2) polychaete feeding is costly to its sponge host. Field surveys and choice experiments revealed that different species of Branchiosyllis polychaete occupied different species of host sponges. Manipulative experiments revealed that polychaete feeding is costly to T. ignis. Sponges without polychaetes grew faster than sponges with polychaetes. A surprise was that polychaete density was influenced by brittle stars that live on the sponge and consume the polychaetes. The positive indirect effect of the brittle star on the sponge host has important implications for the sponge’s fitness and underscores the context-dependent nature of symbiosis.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>In order to understand ecotour compliance to the marine mammal viewing guidelines it is essential to evaluate compliance as a holistic system. This requires not only assessing compliance levels to guidelines, but also assessing captain and passenger knowledge and perceptions of guidelines, and how passenger experience is affected by compliance. This is particularly important in areas of thriving ecotourism that have a focus on marine mammals. To address the need for this multi-faceted approach to assess compliance, this study 1) assessed ecotour compliance levels to the NOAA Southeast U.S. marine mammal viewing guidelines while interacting with bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in Southwest Florida, 2) evaluated captain and passenger knowledge and perceptions of the guidelines, and 3) explored how passenger experience was affected by compliance. Ecotour compliance was assessed via 16 observations of eight boat-based dolphin ecotours during March - April 2019. Captains’ knowledge and opinions of the guidelines, as well as their perceived compliance with the guidelines, were obtained through an online questionnaire distributed after the field observations were completed. Passenger knowledge and perceptions of the guidelines, as well as how compliance affects their experience, were determined through paper surveys given in person after their ecotour trip was over. Of the 12 NOAA viewing guidelines, ecotour captains violated 44% of guidelines on average. Captains generally knew and supported the guidelines, with 75% knowing all 12 guidelines and 88% agreeing that they are both necessary and fair. Captains were also aware of their own violations, yet still demonstrated low compliance levels, potentially due to a lack of understanding concerning the effects of noncompliance on the dolphins. Passengers also supported the guidelines and valued compliance, with 89% agreeing that compliance is important for dolphin health. However, they did not have enough knowledge about the guidelines to recognize captain violations, with 67% reporting no knowledge and 99% reporting their captains were responsible despite witnessing violations. Most passengers (60%) were willing to pay more for compliant tours, and 84% reported that captains violating the guidelines would negatively affect their trip. Suggestions on possible ways to increase compliance are made based on our results.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation seeks to understand the human decision-making process, not only in the context of neoclassical economics, but also in consideration of social and psychological factors. Through both qualitative and quantitative methodologies, I analyze two frequent but poorly understood decision-making processes: the decision to leave a tip and the decision to commit a crime. More specifically, my dissertation investigates the following questions: how do behavioral nudges influence the tipping decision and how does the civil rights restoration influence an individual's probability to re-offend. Although different in subject matter, the common direction of my research agenda is to understand the economic decision process by utilizing a wider set of considerations faced by the individual. By addressing these questions, my research contributes a richer understanding of the human decision-making process to the field of economics. The first two chapters of my dissertation seek to understand how nudges influence consumer behavior in the context of tipping. To understand how defaults influence tipping behavior, I take advantage of two unique tipping contexts where the behavior nudge has come in the form of a default tip suggestions. The first tipping environment I analyze is the New York City taxicab industry. Over time, one of the two primary taxicab technology providers changed its payment prompt, making it possible to compare tipping behavior before and after the change using difference-in-difference estimation strategy. Due to the richness of the data, I am able to tease apart the influence from various factors and estimate that increasing tip suggestions resulted in an increase of 5.35 percent of a cab driver's hourly wage. Furthermore, passengers were primed by the higher tip suggestions as manually entered tip amounts increased. Although, the probability of selecting a default tip suggestion decreases which may demonstrate that fairness concerns motivate passengers when suggestions may be beyond the reasonable social norm. The conclusions from this research demonstrate the possible negative consequences of behavioral nudges when viewed as unfair or unreasonable. The second tipping environment I study is in a local coffee shop. In this environment, I take advantage of changes in the presentation of tip defaults by the point of sale application, Square. When purchases exceed $10, tip suggestions change from those presented for purchases less than $10. This allows me to compare how tipping behavior differs for purchases that are similar using transaction level data from the local establishment by implementing a regression discontinuity approach. Estimates show that an increase in tip suggestions from $1, $2, and $3 to 10%, 15%, and 20% results in a $0.10 increase in average tip amounts. By utilizing these two tipping environments, I am able to investigate if behavioral factors influencing the decision to tip is stable across various contexts. The second portion of my dissertation analyzes the relationship between civil rights restoration and rates of recidivism. In the majority of states, a person convicted and adjudicated of a felony offense loses the right to vote, the candidacy to sit on a jury, the ability to hold public office, and the ability to possess a firearm. Florida is currently one of only a handful of states that does not restore civil rights upon completion of a sentence. Instead, persons with a prior felony conviction must apply for civil rights restoration eligibility of certain occupational licenses and state-funded scholarships. To explore this relationship between clemency status, rates of recidivism, and occupational licensing restrictions, I utilize historical changes in administrative policies as my method of identification. The Rules of Executive Clemency have changed over the past 26 years such that approval has become automatic for those eligible between 2007 and 2011. Outside of this period, clemency required an application, hearing, and a mandatory waiting period. It is unknown if such policy changes influenced job opportunities, voting behavior, or educational attainment, any of which may discourage convicted felons to re-offend. This research contributes to the field by exploring this possible relationship. To estimate the relationship between civil rights restoration and recidivism, I utilize data from individuals who have been incarcerated for a felony conviction. The main source of this information is the Florida Offender-Based Information System (OBIS) from the Florida Department of Corrections, along with publicly available clemency information provided by the Florida Department of Offender Review. To identify economic conditions which contribute to rates of recidivism, I utilize county statistics, including unemployment rates, average hourly wages, law enforcement expenditure, and high school graduation rates. I use duration analysis as well as seemingly unrelated probit regressions to estimate the impact of clemency reform on recidivism. My research on this subject is the first project to identify and estimate the specific channels through which civil rights restoration may influence criminal behavior. The conclusions drawn from this research will inform policy-makers on the effectiveness of clemency, especially amid the ongoing effort of criminal-justice reform in Florida and across the nation.</DISS_para>

      <DISS_content>
         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In the early morning hours of 6 October 1973, the fourth iteration of the Arab-Israeli conflict began when Egyptian and Syrian troops crossed Israeli controlled lines in the Sinai Desert and Golan Heights respectively, in an attempt to retake territory seized by Israel in 1967. As the conflict, known as the Yom Kippur or October War, developed, and Israel’s military answer fell far short of expectations, the administration of American President Richard M. Nixon (1969-1974) struggled with a way to respond to its ally’s growing need for military resupply.  Although there was not an official treaty between the two states, in the years since Israel declared independence in 1948, the nations had grown slowly closer as this small country the size of New Jersey purchased larger amounts of military equipment and systems from the United States.  The Soviet Union, which had allied with Egypt and Syria in the decade prior, responded to needs on their end with a military airlift of consumable supplies into the region almost immediately after the conflict began.  But the Soviet Union, unlike the United States, shared a close border with the region.  As calls for aid resounded from Foggy Bottom to Capitol Hill, Nixon agreed to provide a badly needed resupply.  But the fast pace of the conflict and long distances required precluded the use of naval shipments to deliver the requested heavy armaments.  With civilian airlift also unavailable for a variety of reasons, on 12 October 1973, Nixon authorized the use of American military airlift to move the supplies.  Because allied states on mainland Europe feared an Arab reprisal via a threatened, and soon to come, oil embargo, American bases in England and Germany were off limits to the effort.  With a distance of over six-thousand miles to cover, and a reluctant partner in Portugal, the US Air Force’s Mobility Airlift Command launched Operation Nickel Grass. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The following dissertation is not a play-by-play narrative of the airlift operation.  While the tonnage moved across the globe at unprecedented speeds, is clearly impressive, that story has been told.  Nor is this a purely foreign policy discussion.  Again, that account has been told. This dissertation, instead, examines the lead-up and execution of Operation Nickel Grass </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>from the perspective of American civil-military relations and the use of military assets to further foreign policy goals.  Though this dual lens approach, this study steps through the development of American airlift capability relative to the evolution of foreign policy in the Cold War years. Despite being a symptom of major change, as the first new American military operation in the era of détente, Operation Nickel Grass is relatively unknown outside of the US Air Force mobility community.  Done on an ad hoc basis, absent traditional, detailed military plans, the operation – and projection of power – could have just as easily failed as succeeded. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The purpose of this dissertation is to shed light on the impact of Nickel Grass as not only an ad hoc operational success, but also contextually as a precursor to change in the way the United States used military force to project power in non-kinetic ways as a reflection of civil direction translated into military action.  This study situates the operation as a central uniting factor across multiple elements – foreign policy, domestic concerns, and military change to demonstrate how the Nixon administration’s distracted use of military means to counter the Soviet Union altered the status quo toward a new unintentional truth.  As an expression of non-traditional military power projection that altered perceptions and therefore reality, Nickel Grass changed the relative balance of power in the Middle East when it pulled the United States closer to Israel.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>I would like to thank my major professor and dissertation advisor, Clifton Callender, for his advice and guidance over the past year while composing Prometheus and other projects along the way. I would also like to thank the other members of my committee, Liliya Ugay and Mark Wingate for their support and feedback on my dissertation. Additionally, I want to say thank you to Alex Jiménez for his continued support, mentorship, and investment in me from the beginning of my time at Florida State University as the Ellen Taaffe Zwilich Fellow. Working closely with him and the orchestras at Florida State University was a truly life-changing opportunity. Lastly, I would like to thank the many composers and teachers who have been influential in my life and compositional development, including Stephen Montague, Scott McAllister, Dan Visconti, and the late Ladislav Kubik, for their unwavering support, encouragement, and invaluable lessons.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Outside of the support I have received from those in academia, I want to say thank you to all of my family and friends, but especially to my mother, Carolyn, and my sister, Melissa, for their constant support, and my brother, Zach, for his support and feedback, and for regularly checking all of my percussion parts to make sure they actually work. Lastly, I would like to also thank my wife, Laura Houston, for her continued love, encouragement, and understanding as I pursued my degree at Florida State University. Without the constant support of these people, I would not have had the courage to take risks and achieve all that I have so far in life.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This treatise aims to present an introduction to the violin/viola doubler. It begins with a brief historical background of composers and performers who played both instruments.  Next is a discussion of five works that incorporate the doubling.  This includes Richard Strauss’ Elektra, Arnold Schoenberg’s Pierrot Lunaire, George Perle’s Solo Partita, Benjamin Yusupov’s Viola Concerto, and Henri Poussier’s Sursauts.  After that, two composers and their commissioned works are presented: Justin Giarrusso’s Souvenance and Cassandra Venaglia’s El Camino.  The treatise concludes with a discussion of performance and compositional considerations for the violin/viola doubling.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Although many extended techniques have been included in compositions for clarinet since the early 1900s, very few resources address the inclusion of these techniques in the clarinet curriculum. Specifically, there are very few resources that address the pedagogy of these techniques. Instead, the primary focus of research on extended techniques for clarinet has been on the study and interpretation of works by specific composers or the execution of one type of extended technique. The purpose of this research is to provide a pedagogical resource that addresses the inclusion of extended techniques in the undergraduate clarinet curriculum as a necessary skill for current performance practice and as a tool for further fundamental development. It aims to provide an overview of extended techniques and their history as well to give a concise pedagogical guide that explains each skill. Each chapter will contain sections of exercises, etudes, and solo pieces that will aid in the process of mastering these skills in a more constructive and in-depth format. Five extended techniques have been chosen for inclusion in this document: portamenti, microtones, singing and playing, multiphonics, and double tonguing. These techniques have been selected for their frequent appearance in repertoire and their perceived usefulness for fundamental skill development. Three appendices will be included at the end of the document providing a list of additional works with these extended techniques, a multiphonic fingering chart for the French system clarinet, and a microtonal fingering chart for the same.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>More than half a million 18- to 25-year-olds received treatment for a substance use disorder (SUD) in 2018. Because young adulthood is the time when individuals typically enter higher education, it follows that some of those individuals were or became college students. This subpopulation of students faces unique challenges in that they must deal with both the chronic nature of an SUD and the high-risk environment that exists on college campuses (Satinsky et al., 2017). As higher education institutions look to support students in recovery while they pursue their academic goals, some have looked to establish collegiate recovery programs (CRPs). However, the creation and successful implementation of a CRP is challenged by the complexity of the issue, both on an individual and institutional level, and lack of a standardized CRP model. The subject university in this study is in the early stages of establishing a CRP and a key component of the program development process has been the establishment of a recovery task force comprised of administrators, faculty, and staff from across campus. This study systematically investigates, through semi structured interviews, the task force’s approach to development of a health initiative geared toward students in recovery from an SUD, and examines the impact that organizational communication and individual identity play in the programmatic conceptualization and design. It includes a detailed a historical perspective on substance use disorders (SUDs), as well pertinent information about SUD prevalence, impacts, and treatment. Definitional debates around the concept of recovery and recovery pathways, including the collegiate recovery movement, are also examined, in addition to the extant research on organizational communication, information needs, and formative research methods.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Bronfenbrenner’s ecological systems theory highlights the influence multiple systems can have on one’s development. Taking into account multiple systems that can influence one’s identity, the introduction of ethnic-racial socialization (ERS) as a practice to further influences one’s identity at multiple systemic levels was introduced to create framework of Black males’ academic identity development. This study utilized aspects of Bronfenbrenner’s ecological system theory and ERS practice to test different variables related to the formulation of Black males’ academic identity, educational expectancy and academic achievement. The purpose of this study was to develop and test a model that incorporates family, school, and communal factors in predicting Black males’ educational expectancy and academic achievement. Multiple system levels, including family, school and communal support were tested at different time points as related to educational expectancy and academic achievement. The nationally representative sample, High School Longitudinal Study: 2009, was used for this study. The research utilized this national representative study to analyze a sample of Black students’ (N = 1,280) support, parental expectations regarding students’ educational success, students’ education expectancy, and academic achievement. The use of only Black participants was purposeful in this study, due to the underrepresentation of Black students in indicators of high academic achievement and the overrepresentation of Black students in indicators related to low academic achievement. Because estimates suggest 40% of Black males drop out of high school, the study tested hypotheses related to support and academic achievement, support and educational expectancy, and educational expectancy and academic achievement. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To test the hypotheses, confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation modeling, and hierarchical linear regression were utilized to test regression paths, mediation, and moderation models related to the variables of interest. Results showed mixed support for the study hypotheses. While preliminary measurement model modification indices led to dismantling the family support variable and eliminating indicators from school and communal support, the final measurement model demonstrated good model fit. After testing the measurement model, a full structural model with the observed variables related to support, educational expectancy, and academic achievement were tested. The results from the full SEM model indicated a significant relationship between educational expectancy and academic achievement. The final model implored bootstrapping to test the direct, indirect, and total effects of the full SEM model with control variables. The results indicated that communal support had a significant relationship with academic achievement through parents’ educational expectations for students. Additionally results indicated that family financial support had a significant relationship with academic achievement through parents’ educational expectations for students. Moderation analysis was used to test if parents expectations for students moderated students educational expectancy and total grade point average (GPA). The results did not significantly support moderation. Overall, findings support a systemic, multi-level influence of support on Black males’ academic identity development and later academic achievement. Strengths of the study, limitations, and implications for future research and school professional and mental health clinicians were presented.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This study examined facets of mindfulness as mediating the associations between anxious and avoidant attachment with sleep disturbances. In addition, the study tested whether the indirect links between anxious and avoidant attachment and sleep disturbances was strongest through the mindfulness facet acting with awareness. A sample of college students (N = 535; Mage = 20.17) completed measures of anxious and avoidant attachment, facets of mindfulness, and sleep disturbances. The study hypotheses were examined using mediation analyses and pairwise contrasts tests using structural equation modeling procedures. Results revealed the mindfulness facets nonreactivity and nonjudging significantly mediated the link between anxious attachment and sleep disturbances. Results also revealed the indirect paths from anxious attachment to sleep disturbances through the nonjudging and nonreactivity facets to be greater in magnitude than its direct association. The implications of study findings are discussed in relation to research and clinical practice and in consideration of the study limitations.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The thesis details the attempts at and the eventual implementation of the Volkskirche by the German Christians in the region of Thuringia between the years 1932-1939. The Volkskirche represented the ideal, new form of Christianity that the German Christian Movement wished to implement in Nazi Germany, and this new church aimed to center itself around the racial ideology of the Nazi party. All inferior influences on the church in Thuringia would eventually be eliminated in the new Volkskirche that included the complete elimination of the Old Testament, a revised New Testament, and the removal of all people of Jewish blood from the church. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	However, the creation of the new Volkskirche by the German Christians did not occur immediately, nor without opposition. The Sports Palace Rally in November 1933 (see chapter two) demonstrated that too swift of an implementation of their new ideals could cause backlash across Germany. After the fiasco at the Sports Palace Rally the national movement fragmented, and the region of Thuringia remained one of the strongest and most united of the regional groups to form. In Thuringia, men like the original founder of the movement in Thuringia Siegfried Leffler and Bishop Martin Sasse would gradually push their agenda in the Protestant church, passing decrees incrementally over time in order to acclimate the German people to their ideology. In conjunction with this, opposition to the movement diminished over time. In Thuringia, Dr. Wolfgang Schanze, a member of the Confessing Church, continually used his newspaper to challenge many of the ideas of the German Christians, but by 1937 both his paper and his congregation were disbanded due to lack of membership. The diminishing of opposition combined with the power men like Sasse had over the press and the church council in Thuringia allowed him to dominate the distribution of ideas in the region. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	By November 1938, the German Christians in Thuringia revealed their true intentions for the future of the church with Kristallnacht. Rather than oppose the violence on that night, Bishop Sasse openly endorsed and applauded the pogrom that resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Jewish people and the arrest of thousands more. He did so through the use of Martin Luther’s later writings in the form of a pamphlet that sold over 30,000 copies in the week following its publication. The pamphlet further demonstrated the reliance by the German Christians on non-biblical writings in order to argue in favor of their new Volkskirche’s racial reconfiguration of Christianity, along with the mass popular support the movement had gained for its more radical ideas since 1933. Following Kristallnacht, Sasse proposed and succeeded in the creation of The Institute for the Study and Eradication of Jewish Influence on German Church Life at the University of Jena whose goal became the complete and total eradication of all Jewish influences within the Protestant church. The creation of the institute, along with new laws banning anyone of Jewish descent from attending church represented the successful creation of a new Volkskirche in Thuringia. The new church did not come into being overnight, but rather, gradually over time as the German Christians eroded their opposition and slowly implemented their plan in the region to create a new church for protestants in Germany in the form of the Volkskirche.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this thesis I posit that sound – including music, the voice, and ambient and environmental noises – is necessary for creating immersive environments in tabletop role-playing games (TRPGs). It is the first ethnomusicological study to examine the role of sound in these TRPGs, although previous, related musicological scholarship has focused on video game and computer role-playing games (Cheng, 2014; Miller, 2012). Throughout the thesis, I draw on my own experiences with these games, participant-observation and observation of other TRPG groups, and interviews I completed with eighteen informants. Through analysis and interpretation of data collected using these fieldwork methods, I examine specific examples of how music is used in gaming sessions, explore how the use of music relates to Daniel Mackay’s “imaginary-entertainment environment” (2001), and offer the term “movie simile” to describe common comparisons that players make between film and TRPG soundtracks. My theoretical framework on voice draws from Brian Kane’s model (2014) to discuss how players utilize echos, logos, topos, and technê to create meaning and worlds in their games, as well as to illustrate how real-life experiences with the voice affect a player’s reception of natural and character voices. Additionally, I offer the term “haptic audition” to describe how tactility and space affect the ways in which players experience these sonic gaming environments. Throughout the thesis, I describe my model of sonic and perceptual layers that include the musical layer, the vocal layer, and the third and fourth layers, which include ambient and environmental noises, respectively.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Over the past decades, the time interval between launches of new product generations has been shortened significantly due to fierce market competitions. To cope with expedited product development, manufacturers need to design and rearrange the manufacturing system in a flexible and cost-effective way while ensuring system performance. A responsive manufacturing system requires the changes in three different levels, including the supply chain network (inter-enterprise level), assembly system configuration (plant level), and task scheduling (process level). This dissertation research focuses on the impacts of product assembly designs (assembly hierarchy planning) on three levels of the flexible manufacturing system to enable algorithm and theory that support emerging manufacturing paradigm to cope with the high variety, small-batch size, and frequent product change. Specifically, three studies are conducted including: (1)  Co-design of supply chain network and subassembly planning considering the reconfiguration of supply chain structure for factory-in-a-box manufacturing; (2) Assembly system configuration design for reconfigurability under uncertain production evolution; (3) Improved co-scheduling of multi-layer printing path scanning for collaborative additive manufacturing. This research proposes the optimization models and algorithms for the joint decision-making considering assembly hierarchy planning in three levels of flexible manufacturing systems and uses commercial optimization solvers, customized heuristics, metaheuristics, or hybrid algorithms to solve the different sizes of problems. The outcome of this research can provide a quantitative guideline to the designer and manufacturer in the early stage of product development and benefit cost-effective strategic planning of flexible manufacturing systems at different levels.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this treatise is to create opportunities for environmental engagement: in the performance space, through programming environmentally-conscious repertoire including environmental sound art; and in the classroom, through the use of creative projects designed to combine musical composition with sound-specific technology, all in an effort to increase environmental awareness. The term environmental sound art is a relatively new one and can be understood in numerous ways. The definition suggested by Jonathan Gilmurray as “encompassing a collection of artistic practices in which environmental sound constitutes the medium, material, and/or subject matter for the work” will be adopted. In addition to environmental sound art, environmentally-conscious repertoire includes any programmatic work in which the composer translates environmental elements into the work through the evocation, imitation or inclusion of the environmental element. Two methods for realizing this engagement are detailed: the first Apollonian, or objective (realizing that objectivity is always questionable), and the second Dionysian, or subjective. The demonstration and creation of procedures which make environmentally-conscious repertoire more accessible will contribute to the world view of performers and audience members by encouraging them, through musical interactions, to experience environments, both those familiar and new to them, in meaningful ways. This project provides exposure to and dissemination of these works, specifically environmental sound art, to a more diverse and inclusive population of performers and audience members. As a result, this project has both aesthetic and activist goals and aspects.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This thesis consists of three independent projects in the field of algebraic geometry.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The first of these is the focus of Chapter 2. There we define a family of integer sequences we refer to as the family of secant indices of projective subvarieties. If $X\subseteq \PP^n$ is a subvariety, its sequence of secant indices is denoted $\mathfrak{L}(X)$ and records the maximal finite intersections of $X$ with linear subvarieties of $\PP^n$. We prove several properties about these sequences, develop a method to compute term-wise lower bounds and compute these lower bounds for Veronese and Segre varieties. We state several questions and conjectures regarding these sequences which to our knowledge are open.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter 3 concerns a project studying the so-called duality defect of projective subvarieties. Given a projective subvariety $X\subseteq \PP^n$, one may consider its dual subvariety in dual projective space $(\PP^n)^\vee$. For low codimension smooth $X$, it would be a consequence of Hartshorne's conjecture that the dual of $X$ is always a hypersurface. This expectation is known as the duality defect conjecture, and in Chapter 3 we push a combinatorial approach of Holme and Oaland further to verify that the conjecture holds in the codimension $3$ case for projective spaces of odd dimension, and also to derive a degree bound that any counterexamples would have to satisfy.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapters 4 and 5 concern Segre classes of closed subschemes of projective bundles. By extending a given homogeneous ideal to progressively larger polynomial rings, one obtains an infinite sequence of closed subschemes of progressively higher dimensional projective spaces which are cones over the preceding subschemes. The Segre classes of these subschemes are related by the Segre zeta function defined by Aluffi. In Chapter 4, we generalize this Segre zeta function to subschemes of projective bundles over a smooth base variety. In Chapter 5 we explore a realization of the Segre zeta function in the context of equivariant algebraic geometry.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This work is an investigation into the Landgraviate of Hessen-Kassel and its most dynamic ruler: Friedrich II.  This middling principality was precariously situated between several power-hungry European states and needed to innovate and capitalize on its relative strengths to survive and prosper.  Hessen had a long history of renting its troop for foreign use. Friedrich expanded these efforts and reinvested profits from this soldier trade into his military and state apparatuses, which allowed this enlightened absolutist to build a financially and politically stable alternative to the nation-states which emerged in the Age of Revolutions.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Using archival sources from both sides of the Atlantic, this work paints the picture of a proactive state looking towards the future. Though the Hessian army was an oppressive institution, it was at the forefront of meritocratic organization and innovative educational initiatives designed to improve its efficacy and efficiency. While this revolutionary army could not keep the Napoleonic Wars from sweeping Hessen-Kassel from the map for over seven years, it nevertheless showcases ways in which small European states could become integral players in the diplomatic games of their powerful neighbors and wield influence disproportionate to their size.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This thesis presents the methods of statistical shape analysis in two-dimensional data with the application of nanoparticle shape. We can treat each shape as a random quantity and we are interested in defining probabilistic rules. We introduce a statistical modeling multivariate shape data with a specific probability distribution. Modeling involves two main steps: determining the appropriate distribution into a given data set, which is called "best-fitting" and estimation the parameters of that distribution. Especially nite mixture models are practical to use because our shapes data can be seen as the result of two subpopulations, called components. This comes from the result of clustering shapes into two groups. We propose using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM), which is a representation of normally distributed subpopulations with their own mean and covariance. This is a novel idea and we would like to define the GMM in tangent spaces of a shape space with the center of a Karcher mean of each cluster. We see that the density is higher with the larger number of shapes belong to a particular cluster and the density is lower when there is observed a small number of shapes.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>There exist several approaches for estimating parameters of a probability distribution, including analytical, graphical and numerical. We use a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), where the mathematical formula is expressed by a likelihood equation of the data set. However, the likelihood equation could not be calculated analytically and the numerical technique seems reasonable to use. The iterative algorithm termed an expectation-maximization (EM) is a practical manner to solve the likelihood equation. Accordingly, the EM starts from some initial estimation of the mean and covariance and then proceeds to iteratively update them until convergence is detected. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The approach presented in this thesis is based on the application of the shape of nanoparticles. During the production, growing nanoparticles is a dynamic process where shapes and multi-component reactions (e.g. splits and merges) between nanoparticles rapidly change. Analysis in real-time would produce a large number of shapes and it could be dicult to nd important patterns. Statistical methods for determining a few common trajectories provide an adequate summary of the evolution of shape's gold nanoparticle and diminish the time of analysis large number of images. Here we describe a general approach for representing a shape. Determining the shape of gold nanoparticles allows scientists to investigate chemical and physical properties. Nevertheless, an analysis of shapes involves advanced mathematical tools. Initially, appropriate mathematical representations and descriptions of shapes need to be developed.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Shape descriptions are basically classifieded into two approaches: contour-based and region-based approach. Contour-based methods are more popular because of many applications related to the identification and detection of an object. This paper reviews various techniques from contour-based representations, for example, sets of nite points called landmarks or functional representations named square-root velocity functions (SRVF). The essential advantage of using the last representation is its invariance to re-parametrization also with standard transformations, such as translation, rotation and scaling, and the capability of point to point registration. SRVF called also elastic curves are they are used to represent nanoparticle shapes.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>An important goal in this study is to classify nanoparticles according to their shapes. Clustering shapes involves many challenges, including variations like deformation or incomplete shapes, which is associated with choosing an appropriate description. Secondly, the shape space is an infinite-dimensional space and most clustering approaches (for example K-means) offered for Euclidean spaces cannot be applied for clustering shapes.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Over the past few decades, a vast literature has grown up documenting the systematic errors in intuitive thinking. This literature does not suggest that all intuitions are unreliable, but only specific contexts. These contexts are the focus of this paper – specifically those associated with the use of heuristics. Indeed, I argued that experimental philosophy provides the exact context in which intuitions are unreliable and the folk are likely to use heuristics. To do this, I interact heavily with the empirical data from the psychological literature and establish that the way surveys are administered is known to cause satisficing. Next, I examine the vignettes and the results pointing out that the vignettes are also contextually suspect, and the results indicate the unreliability as indicated by low self-efficacy. Finally, I offer an alternative explanation of the results – heuristics. Together, I take these to make a strong case that the best explanation for the experimental results is one of heuristic failure, and thus the results cannot be a suitable guide in philosophical analysis.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Elasmobranch fishes are a highly vagile group that often cross state, regional or international boundaries. Delineating migratory patterns that cross jurisdictional boundaries is essential for effective management, especially when confronted with fishing pressures and regulations that vary over space and time. In addition to migrating individuals, studying critical life stages, such as neonates, is important for fisheries management. The broad goal of this dissertation was to develop a robust understanding of the spatiotemporal ecology of the bonnethead, Sphyrna tiburo. Our objectives were to quantify migration metrics (duration, distance, etc.) and assess the effects of ocean temperature on these metrics, to delineate the species’ pupping grounds and to determine if the bonnethead uses magnetic-based navigation. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We used passive acoustic telemetry to track the migrations of 44 bonnetheads for up to 1506 days across ~ 1070 km of Southeastern United States Atlantic coastline. Bonnetheads are a widely distributed small coastal shark in the western hemisphere. The majority of these sharks exhibited strong site fidelity to the North Edisto River in South Carolina and returned annually, residing in the estuary from April to November. Climatic migrations then occurred and overwintering habitats were located throughout Georgia and mid-Florida waters. We present the interannual effects of varying ocean temperature on the seasonal migrations of individual sharks. We found that interannual variations in sea surface temperature had significant effects on the migration distance, duration, and date of arrival to overwintering habitats of individual sharks. An electivity analysis suggested that overwintering locations are selected based upon ocean temperature and not physical location. Given the significant effects of sea surface temperature on migration, future migrations may be altered due to climate change and warming seas. Given the degree of site fidelity observed, our work also has robust implications for the management of this species, as animals with strong ties to specific locations are put at high risks of localized extirpation. The data generated from this study can be used to generate predictive models that can estimate overwintering areas based upon sea surface temperature. These areas can then be protected during migration should the stock become imperiled.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>While monitoring the residency of S. tiburo in the North Edisto River (NER) we noticed a repeated absence of acoustic detections that aligned with the temporal span when parturition occurs. This absence from the NER suggested they may be giving birth outside of the estuarine waters. We used acoustic telemetry to track pregnant females and found they left the NER for ~2 weeks every year. During this time, they underwent a migration down the coast of the United States into the coastal waters of southern South Carolina and Georgia. We also analyzed fishery-independent surveys and found neonates began to appear in nearshore trawls during this same time period. The mature females caught in these surveys also lost ~1 kg of total body weight from summer to early fall, which we suspect indicates a birthing event. Additionally, an independent study from the same region demonstrated that bonnetheads were post-partum in September. Collectively these data illustrate that bonnetheads emigrate from the NER while pregnant, migrate down the coast, give birth and return to the NER. These data are important for the management of the bonnethead because their primary source of mortality is as bycatch in the shrimp fishery, which has spatiotemporal overlap in these nearshore waters. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In our first two research chapters, we highlighted the migratory behavior of the bonnethead and demonstrated that they are capable of migrating over 1,000 km and successfully returning to a target location. In order for these movements to be possible, having a map sense may be important, and the earth’s magnetic field appears to be an important component of this behavior for other taxa.  Whilst sharks have been at the forefront of sensory physiology research on sensitivity to electromagnetic fields, whether they use Earth's magnetic field for navigation is unresolved. Here we use a “magnetic displacement” experiment to show that sharks can use the map-like information from earth’s magnetic field to orient. Bonnethead sharks captured along the panhandle of Florida and exposed to a magnetic field mimicking a southern latitude within their range in the Gulf of Mexico oriented homeward, whereas orientation was random when exposed to a field that mimicked a northern latitude outside of their range (in the continental U.S.A.). Likewise, orientation was random when sharks were exposed to a field that controlled for nonspecific effects of the testing procedure. Given that sharks have prior experience of more southern magnetic fields than the control site, but never of more northern fields, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that sharks learn magnetic features for navigational tasks. The apparent ability of sharks to discriminate position using magnetic cues may also explain the sensory basis by which genetic structure of shark populations are maintained and how cryptic speciation can occur - despite no geographic barriers among reproductive locations.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Rising partisan prejudice in the U.S. has rendered relations between the two political sides increasingly volatile. Meanwhile, an uncivil and hyper-partisan political climate has likely fomented social tolerance for, and even approval of, hostile political expressions. Drawing upon prior theorizing about the prediction of behavior, the current work explores two potential motivators of political aggression. In two studies, we demonstrate strong relationships between the desire to politically aggress and both personal acceptance and perceived social approval of political hostility. We first examine the relationships between key motivating factors of political aggression (N = 170). A second experimental study (N = 184) demonstrates that decreasing the perceived approval of political hostility attenuates the desire to aggress against a political outgroup. Taken together, these findings suggest that perceived approval of political hostility plays a key role in motivating politically aggressive behavior. Implications, including what factors might mitigate political aggression, are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this document is to present different challenges, issues, and potential complications which have become commonplace in contemporary wind band literature—specifically in percussion parts—with suggested solutions for reassignment and arrangement for optimal performance practice. Examples presented from the wind band repertoire may aid colleagues and composers to become cognizant of best practices for percussion orchestration and arrangement. These examples will illuminate how the percussion orchestration and composer’s ideation of the personnel and overall logistics required for a work drastically affects the likelihood of successful rehearsal and performance.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The repertoire performed by 19th century and early 20th century wind bands consisted primarily of music that required small percussion sections in which each player was to perform on one instrument only, e.g. one timpanist, a cymbal player, bass drummer, snare drummer, and whatever auxiliary players were needed. As more works were produced in throughout the 20th century, this one-to-one format of orchestration morphed to a “Player-Based” system where a single percussionist needed to play more than one instrument at a time. This change may be attributed to available players required to cover multiple parts in the instrument-based format as well as the expansion of percussion section instruments and sounds available to composers.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In order to orchestrate in this “Player-Based” format, an understanding of many parameters relating to common percussion performance practices, specifically logistics, is incredibly important for both the composers and conductors of wind band music. This knowledge will create conditions under which a successful performance of any work may take place, where as a lack of understanding will create challenging situations for percussionists when the assigned parts are impossible to negotiate and execute as written or arranged. This treatise should be used as a resource and starting point for the orchestration and part-assignment process.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This treatise is a pedagogical study that violin teachers can use to help their students develop and transmit musicality in their performances. Due to the broad nature of the topic, the treatise focuses on teaching violin students to approach melodic lines through an expressive "lens." The treatise is based on the assumption that musicality is a learned skill that students can, with guidance, obtain and develop. It provides methods for developing musical intuition, making musical choices based on theoretical analysis and historico-cultural context, teaching expressive playing through the application of violin technical tools, and creating strategies for expressive practicing.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The presented methods incorporate sources from violin methodology, physiology of violin playing, music theory, music history, and music psychology. In order to demonstrate the practical application of these methods, I provide an analysis of musical examples representing various styles and genres. These examples include solo violin works, concertos, and chamber sonatas by Bach, Mozart, Brahms, Tchaikovsky, Shostakovich, and Ravel.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This study focuses on exploring Chinese English-major students’ motivational reasons for studying English (e.g., because of interest/enjoyment, pressure from others, or future career goals). To discover students’ motivational reasons for studying English, I used self-determination theory (SDT) by Deci and Ryan (1985) as my theoretical framework. Based on the SDT framework, the results of the cluster analysis indicated five distinct motivational-reason groups for English majors: Ambiguous, Typical, Instrumental, Complex, and Mastery. In addition, the characteristics of students in each motivational-reason group were examined in terms of their achievement goals (i.e., mastery-approach goals, mastery-avoidance goals, performance-approach goals, and performance-avoidance goals), skill-specific foreign language anxieties (i.e., writing, reading, listening, and speaking anxieties), and general foreign language self-efficacy. Two sets of MANOVAs, with follow-up ANOVA-comparisons, were used to describe motivational-reason group-differences regarding achievement goals and foreign language anxieties. One ANOVA was used to determine group-differences regarding general foreign language self-efficacy. The results indicated significant differences across students in the five motivational-reason groups regarding their achievement goals, foreign language anxieties, and general foreign language self-efficacy. Further discussion about the results and educational implications is provided.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Until Henry Li moved into the house across the road, Rose Gillespie didn’t have any friends. Her main relationships were with her parents, therapists, teacher, and caregivers, and the great burden of her life is that though she has the capacity to think fully, she is most of the time unable to express her thoughts, and her body often doesn’t obey her mind. She longs to be understood. Rose is a nine-year old English girl who has a learning disability (the British term encompassing intellectual and developmental disabilities) and is considered nonverbal; Henry, an eleven-year-old Chinese American boy whose life intersects with hers. Henry’s family relocates to a village in northern England called Wythen-upon-Swyven, where Rose’s family has lived for much of her life. Throughout that summer and the following school year, the two children become close friends through the experiences they share. Angelique Adebisi, a Black British twenty-four-year-old postgraduate student, is Rose’s main support worker and therefore accompanies them throughout. Though Rose has an adventurous spirit, the restrictions surrounding her make it difficult for her to find outlets for her energy; but together with Angelique, Rose and Henry manage to have all manner of escapades.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The world of the novel is not quite our own. In these characters’ world, it is widely known that the tales told in books and movies are sometimes real, other times not. The discovery of truth-coins—artifacts from stories, e.g. a shard from Aladdin’s lamp—helps humanity determine whether these stories are true; none, however, can ever be ruled out for certain. Truth-hunters make it their job to find truth-coins. Thanks to Rose, the trio ends up entering the truth-hunting business, and they soon discover that a lot of artifacts wash up around Wythen-upon-Swyven. After an eventful day out, they find themselves on a quest to retrieve the silver shoes from The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Along the way, the trio meets faeries, talking mice, bird enthusiasts, and other children and adults of the human variety. In the midst of their more fantastic adventures, the three of them also go through the more ‘mundane’ hardships and joys of life, ranging from suffering through the first day of school to having fun at the playground to breaking up with a long-term boyfriend to going to the beach. Reality encompasses all these things. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Will these three very different individuals be able ultimately to develop meaningful friendships with one another? Are their relationships resilient enough to handle all the ups and downs of life that they experience? And will they find the silver shoes? This novel is about the things we search for, and, once in a while, find. It delves into the loneliness that a ‘nonverbal’ person with a learning disability, and every person to some extent, in different ways, grapple with in the face of not being understood, and how this loneliness might lift. The Solitude and the Sand attempts to trace how people try to understand each other, and fail in their attempts, time and again, and fail again, and then, on occasion, suddenly brush fingers, find themselves for a moment illuminated.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The knowledge of actinide chemistry significantly lags behind the rest of the periodic table. Understanding the fundamental behavior of these elements is crucial for actinide separations and nuclear waste storage. Many separation strategies utilize various ligands to effectively coordinate specific actinides, however this remains an underdeveloped area of research. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>It is generally accepted that actinides have slightly more diffuse f-orbitals which allow for more covalent character in the bonds they form with ligands, resulting in more stable complexes with softer donor ligands. This has resulted in the design of selective ligands to specifically bind actinides for effective separation. By carefully selecting solvents, a wide variety of ligands can be utilized in order to understand the relative participation of actinide frontier orbitals (6p, 6d, 5f, 7s, 7p) in bonding, and understanding these bonding differences is important for how they may be utilized for future designs of ligand systems for actinide separations.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The first part of this work focuses on f-element Schiff base coordination complexes in order to produce a clearer picture of the bonding between actinides and ligands. Schiff base ligands and their derivatives are of popular interest because of their ability to coordinate many different metal ions and stabilize them in a variety of oxidation states. First, a series of homoleptic tetravalent f-element and transition metal complexes have been synthesized, allowing for a comparison of coordination complexes containing metal cations in the formal 4+ oxidation state by structural, spectroscopic, and theoretical analysis. Utilizing the same ligand, this study was extended to the uranyl and neptunyl dications in the 6+ oxidation state. Furthermore, a series of heteronuclear complexes featuring a trivalent f-element and divalent transition metal were examined through crystallographic, spectroscopic, and magnetic analysis.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The second part of this work focuses on periodic trends in bonding and Lewis-acid catalysis of the lanthanides and mid actinides utilizing a neutral nitrogen donor cryptand ligand. An imine-cleavage methodology is used to generate bimetallic complexes from the ligand across the f-block. In this study, a divergence of coordination activity is observed between the early and late lanthanides in structure and bonding, and is extended to the actinides. Synthetic methods also show the importance of the starting material as well as the pH, in the generation of mono vs. bimetallic complexes. Lastly, a similar study was conducted utilizing different starting materials to focus on the monometallic cryptand complexes of Ce and Pu.</DISS_para>

      <DISS_content>
         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The eukaryotic genome is encased by a double membrane structure, the nuclear envelope (NE), forming the outer structure of the nucleus. The NE is highly dynamic and separates the nucleoplasm from the cytoplasm. The NE is involved in processes such as the maintenance of nuclear architecture, chromatin organization, DNA replication, gene expression, and signal transduction. Maintaining NE dynamics is crucial for cellular health, as compromised NE integrity is a key indicator of various pathologies and also of cellular aging. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The outer nuclear membrane (ONM) of the NE is contiguous with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whereas the inner nuclear membrane (INM) is compositionally distinct but contiguous with the ONM through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). In order to ensure homeostasis between these membranes, degradation systems are in place at both the INM and ONM/ER. INM-associated degradation (INMAD) is required for both protein quality control and regulated proteolysis of INM proteins. Two INMAD pathways utilizing the membrane bound E3 ligase complexes, containing either Doa10 or Asi1-3, have been previously defined, and we have revealed a novel branch mediated by the nuclear ligase anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). APC/C-mediated INMAD functions with the E2 ligases Ubc6 and Ubc7, and is responsible for the degradation of the SUN protein, Mps3, through the ubiquitin proteasome. Mps3 is the sole SUN protein in budding yeast and physically interacts with the KASH-like protein within the luminal space of the NE. This interaction creates the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex. The LINC complex spans the NE and is critical for transducing mechanical forces from the cytoskeleton to the nucleus. Dysregulation of the LINC complex, such as the overaccumulation of SUN proteins, in mammals leads to catastrophic disruption of NE integrity, resulting in a range of disorders termed laminopathies. Our finding that the budding yeast SUN protein is regulated by APC/C has implications for the conserved nature of INMAD processes and is crucial to understanding many laminopathies in humans. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Another complex crucial for maintaining NE integrity that spans the NE is the NPC. NPCs are large multi-subunit structures that form an aqueous channel embedded in the NE, allowing for passage between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Functional NPCs are essential for nucleocytoplasmic transport, a process required for maintaining NE integrity and cellular health. NPCs were previously hypothesized to be extremely stable complexes, but recent work in budding yeast meiosis has revealed a unique aggregation of NPCs during anaphase II that is believed to occur as a quality control mechanism, constricting NPCs from the gametes. The aggregated NPCs were found to cluster with senescence factors, including oxidatively damaged protein aggregates and rDNA circles, implying this sequestration is a reorganization of the NE and functions to rejuvenate the resulting daughter cells. However, at the molecular level neither the mechanism regulating NE reorganization, nor how daughter cells are rejuvenated are entirely clear. We have found that the meiotic sequestration of NPCs (MSON) compartment is dependent on the Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport (ESCRT)-III complex, providing the first mechanistic insight into meiotic NE reorganization with implications for cellular rejuvenation. During meiosis, the LEM-domain protein, Heh1, and the ESCRT-III component, Chm7, function with the AAA-ATPase Vps4 to form constriction sites similar to those observed during asymmetric cell division in mitosis. Constriction of the NPCs is an essential process in meiosis to ensure the rejuvenation of gametes, as hindering this sequestration results in a deterioration of the daughter cells’ replicative lifespans. Our finding that ESCRT-III/Vps4 mediates the sequestration of NPCs during meiosis II is relevant to the understanding of aging and other NPC related diseases such as early-onset dystonia.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Maintaining nuclear integrity is a critical factor in cellular health, mediated in part by the LINC complex and NPC, both of which are highly conserved in composition and in function. Perturbation of the regulatory mechanisms acting on these complexes leads to a variety of diseases and aging disorders in humans, underlining the significance of elucidating these factors in budding yeast. Our work establishes the first known case of APC/C-mediated protein degradation at the NE, and also the first example of an ESCRT-III mediated mechanism for meiotic NE reorganization. These processes are critical for coordinating nuclear morphogenesis and cell-cycle progression, while providing mechanistic insight into the poorly understood phenomena of cellular rejuvenation. These studies have broad implications, therefore, for better understanding of laminopathies and age-associated diseases in humans.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>With the recent advances in the field of Machine Learning, there have been several developments in modern power systems computations. Meanwhile, causality has also received a lot of recognition in various fields such as economics, social sciences, biology, etc. In this thesis, we focus on integrating causal theory into power system applications also utilizing machine learning algorithms for validation and predictive modeling in the areas of resilience and power system planning. This thesis proposes a novel causality analysis approach called the Causal Markov Elman Network (CMEN) integrated with deep neural networks to characterize the interdependencies and interrelationships between various heterogeneous time-series from multi-network infrastructure networks. The CMEN performance, which comprises of inputs filtered by Markov property, successfully characterizes various multivariate dependencies in an urban environment. The thesis also proposes a novel hypothesis of characterizing joint information between interconnected systems such as electricity and transportation networks. The proposed methodology and the hypotheses are then validated by Information Theory distance-based metrics. To optimize the performance of CMEN, a deep learning algorithm is also adopted and named as Deep Neural Network Causal model (DNNC). For cross-validation, the CMEN &amp; DNNC causal models are applied to a case study application of the electricity load forecasting problem using actual data from the City of Tallahassee, Florida. Another case study application of the proposed causal methodology is characterizing the co-dependency between different infrastructure networks based on real-world data from Hurricane Hermine and Hurricane Michael.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The mammalian olfactory bulb (OB) has a vast population of dopamine (DA) neurons, whose function is to increase odor discrimination through mostly inhibitory synaptic mechanisms. However, it is not well understood whether there is more than one neuronal type of OB DA neuron, how these neurons respond to different stimuli (whether transient or prolonged), and the ionic mechanisms behind those responses. In this dissertation, I used a transgenic rat line (hTH-GFP) to identify fluorescent OB DA neurons for recording via whole-cell electrophysiology. These neurons were grouped based on their localization in the glomerular layer (“Top” vs. “Bottom”) with these largest and smallest neurons grouped by neuronal area (“Large” vs. “Small,” in μm2). I found that some membrane properties could be distinguished based on a neuron’s area, but not by its glomerular localization. All OB DA neurons produced a single action potential when receiving a sufficiently depolarizing stimulus, while some could also spike multiple times when receiving weaker stimuli, an activity that was more likely in Large than Small neurons. This single spiking activity is likely driven by the Na+ current, which showed a sensitivity to inactivation by depolarization and a relatively long time constant for the removal of inactivation. These recordings showed that Small neurons were more sensitive to inactivation of Na+ current at membrane potentials of -70 mV and -60 mV than Large neurons. The hyperpolarization-activated H-current (identified by voltage sags) was more pronounced in Small than Large DA neurons across hyperpolarized membrane potentials. Lastly, to mimic a more physiological stimulus, these neurons received ramp stimuli of various durations and current amplitudes. When stimulated with weaker/shallow ramps, the neurons needed less current to begin and end firing (which is indicative of a longer duration of spiking when receiving weaker rather than stronger stimuli) and they produced more action potentials at a slower frequency. These spiking properties were further analyzed between the four groups of neurons, and these analyses support the difference in spiking induced with current step stimuli. Thus, there may be more than one type of OB DA neuron, and these neurons’ activities may support a possible role of being high-pass filters in the OB by allowing the transmission of stronger odor signals while inhibiting weaker ones. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To better understand the long-term, asymptotic properties of the OB DA neurons, I also used modified (prolonged) ramp stimuli to further delay depolarization block and to potentially see if these neurons can produce tonic spiking. These recordings were used to construct bifurcation diagrams, which gave further insight into the spiking properties of these neurons that may not be evident from just the recording traces. Some OB DA neurons produced tonic spiking in response to slow (60-second) ramp stimuli while others did not. Additionally, when recording neurons that produced tonic spiking with slow pyramids (ramp protocol followed immediately by a mirror version of that protocol), I saw evidence for potential bistability (two possible equilibrium states through the same set of parameters). To test if these neurons displayed bistability, I used modified pyramid protocols (with extra depolarizing and hyperpolarizing stimuli), in order for the neuron to transition from a non-spiking to a spiking equilibrium. While I was not able to perturb these neurons from their non-spiking (depolarization block) to a spiking equilibrium, I saw that prolonged hyperpolarizing stimuli did allow these neurons to become momentarily disinhibited. Thus, while in depolarization block, a potential inhibitory synaptic input (e.g., GABA) can cause these neurons to produce a brief, phasic response that can drive minor inhibition in the OB. Overall, these results show that the OB DA neurons have a rich biophysical profile that causes them to be more responsive to weaker, rather than stronger stimuli, which likely contributes to their role as high-pass filters.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This dissertation studies the conformal type of planar polygonal complexes using vertex extremal length and describes the metric space of isomorphism classes of rooted planar polygonal complexes and its properties. The metric space can be divided into a hyperbolic subspace and a parabolic subspace by considering extremal length on planar polygonal complexes. The hyperbolic space is a union of countably many closed nowhere dense subsets forming a first category subset in the metric space, or a meager set, while the parabolic space is of the second category forming a comeager set. The parabolic complexes in a topological space are thus seen to be the generic type of complexes. We discuss some interesting properties of subsets, including Cantor subsets in the metric space. Moreover, we examine properties of expansion complexes, one specific type of planar polygonal complexes, and study the relationships between parabolic expansion complexes and hyperbolic expansion complexes.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This treatise studies and compares two twentieth-century works and the pianistic challenges they exhibit: Karlheinz Stockhausen’s Klavierstück VII and Tristan Murail’s La Mandragore. Historical background is provided on Karlheinz Stockhausen and Tristan Murail as compositional pupils of Olivier Messiaen. Messiaen’s consideration of sound components such as timbre and resonance are discussed, including Stockhausen’s continuation of this trajectory. The French spectral school is explored; it evolved in the 1970s with some of Messiaen’s pupils, most notably Murail. Timbre and timbral-harmonic complexes are the focus of spectral works rather than melody, harmony, or tone row processes. In addition to timbre being used as a formal component in spectral compositions, auditory perception of timbre is the main compositional goal in these works. Timbre is explored in piano music through long-lasting pedals and consideration of the overtone series. A performance guide for Stockhausen’s Klavierstück VII and Murail’s La Mandragore is provided to facilitate the learning process of these two works. These two piano pieces are both undervalued and underperformed, and this treatise seeks to inspire other musicians to listen to, and hopefully to perform, these great works.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Prescribed burning is a land management technique conducted at Eglin Air Force Base (AFB), Florida (FL), by Jackson Guard.  Sometimes a fire-induced cumulus cloud, called a pyrocumulus (pyroCu), forms over a surface fire.  A towering pyrocumulus can lead to downbursts that challenge Jackson Guard teams’ capacity to keep fire behavior under control.  There has been limited effort devoted to forecasting pyrocumuli accurately.  This thesis presents three methods of modeling for predicting pyrocumulus formation prior to scheduled burns at Eglin AFB: numerical, statistical, and qualitative.  The numerical modeling approach entailed simulating 14 burn dates using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model’s coupled fire-atmosphere module, WRF-Fire.  A Rate-of-Spread (ROS) parameter was developed for simulating the outcomes of future burns, with the prescribed burn model matching observed pyrocumuli at a 71% success rate.  The statistical modeling approach used a sample of 31 burn dates to build, train, and test predictive equations constructed using logistic regression.  With an ensemble of 12 equations, the statistical model performed with 74% accuracy in hindcasting the observed outcomes.  By only using two of the better-performing equations, the truncated statistical model was able to match observed outcomes 77% of the time.  In the third approach, a qualitative model was built and tested on the same 31 burn dates’ thermodynamic soundings and burn parameters.  The categorization algorithm was converted into a flowchart, with decision points trained to optimally predict the sample’s observed outcomes.  The qualitative model hindcasted pyrocumulus formation at a 74% success rate.  These approaches to prediction yielded three distinct operational tools for Jackson Guard, with arguably good success at matching observations.  Thus, a fruitful proof of concept was accomplished through this research.  Furthermore, each of the three methodological frameworks can conceivably be tailored for fixed-site prescribed burn operations outside northwestern Florida.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This treatise proposes a narrative approach for analyzing Missy Mazzoli’s solo piano works based on the theory of Byron Almén. The first part of Chapter 1 is devoted to explaining narrative approaches, based on gestures, semiotics, markedness, and plot archetypes. In the second part, minimalism and the different definitions in minimalist music will be discussed. The second chapter introduces performer-composer Missy Mazzoli and her musical influences, including specific composers whose styles have impacted her own, as well as the inspiration she draws from the human experience. The third chapter includes analyses of three of her solo piano works—Orizzonte, Isabelle Eberhardt Dreams of Pianos, and Heartbreaker—using Almén’s theory of musical narrative, and provides performance suggestions. Utilizing a narrative approach for the interpretation of post-minimalist music can provide access to similar pieces of this style for both performers and listeners.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The gas within dark matter halos of galaxies and clusters contains information about the baryon content of the universe that is not found anywhere else. Precise understanding of the nuances of this gas is critical to understanding the fundamental laws of the universe. There is a constant feedback loop between theoretical modeling of that gas and observations searching for its structures. Since this gas is not directly detectable, we must search the universe for traces of how it affects its surroundings. One such probe is how the gas alters the temperature of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) when the photons of the Big Bang scatter off of the electrons in that gas through the Thermal Sunyaev-Zel’dovich (tSZ) effect. This inverse Compton scattering of the photons creates a measurable decriment of the temperature spectrum of the CMB in the 0.5-2 keV energy band. In addition, there is another powerful probe of halo gas in this energy band: X-ray emission. This emission comes in two forms: the first is X-ray emission from the gas itself due to its temperature, the second is the Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) X-ray emission from the supermassive black holes at the center of clusters. With these two types of X-ray emission, we can make two independent estimates for the baryon content of these clusters. We can combine these probes of the gas content of these halos statistically using power spectral analysis. From these power spectra, we can compare various models of the gas with actual data. In this thesis, we explore the feedback loop in the study of halo gases by looking at current experiments in the field for detections of halo gas and modeling current and future missions to make predictions on what detectors will see in the near future.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Using communication technologies to threaten, harass, or control one’s romantic partner, or cyber dating abuse, has become a significant health concern among young adults. Previous research has shown that romantic partners use text messaging to promote emotional and relational connectedness and find texting to be an important emotional resource in their relationship. However, the growth of social technologies has also expanded the number of outlets for those involved in dating violence to harass, control, and abuse their partners The most common forms of cyber dating abuse occur when technology is used to exert control over one’s partner (e.g., monitoring where one’s partner is or what he/she does, putting one’s partner down) and unwanted invasion of privacy (e.g., the use of social network passwords without the partners permission, pretending to be one’s partner through a technology platform). Given the considerable amounts of aggression in U.S. college aged romantic relationships and the increasing amount of reciprocal partner aggression, the previous research on cyber dating abuse calls for a closer look at how varying levels of influence may play a role in the experience of those involved. Therefore, the current study explored the overarching question: how do multiple levels of influence (individual, partner, family) impact the experience of cyber dating abuse? More specifically, this study tested models of cyber dating abuse perpetration and victimization by examining partner attachment, family environment, and emotion regulation as predictors. Emotion regulation was also examined as a mediator between two predictors (partner attachment and family environment) and cyber dating abuse perpetration and victimization. The study sample consisted of 320 participants, recruited from undergraduate courses at a large public university, who reported being in a serious romantic relationship. The results of this study indicate that emotion regulation mediates the relationship between family environment, partner attachment and cyber dating abuse perpetration. Additionally, these findings suggest that although emotion regulation seems to predict cyber dating abuse victimization, it does not mediate the link between family environment or partner attachment and victimization. The results of the current study lend important information to clinicians, educators, and policy makers who should look to target funding and intervention efforts at critical, attachment-forming periods of development that might impact later involvement in cyber dating abuse. Clinicians can help those who are already involved in abuse by providing psychoeducation about the way internal working models of the world, established early in life, inform attitudes and behavioral decisions in adulthood. Additionally, the substantial overlap between those reporting they have been victims and those reporting they are also perpetrating the abuse suggests that couples therapy should include discussions about couple interactional cycles (e.g., pursue-withdrawal cycles) that emphasize emotion as a driving force. Based on this study, future research should develop and test interventions for cyber abuse that specifically involve bolstering emotion regulation skills in participants and that bring awareness to the five aspects of emotion regulation the extended process model suggests individuals are able to utilize in romantic relationships. Further, social norms regarding appropriate interpersonal communication and behavior within the online sphere should be empirically explored and perhaps discussed in therapeutic and educational settings with those experiencing cyber dating abuse. Altogether, by exploring the role that emotion regulation plays in influencing cyber dating abuse outcomes for young adults in romantic relationships, professionals may have another tool to promote inter- and intrapersonal well-being within this population.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Plum Queen is a historical novel submitted as a creative dissertation in fiction. It traces a complex, lifelong friendship between two women: Phoebe Eberhardt, the heiress to an agricultural fortune, and Lenore Foster, the brilliant daughter of a working-class widow, in settings that move from California orchards to 1930s Paris to the post-WWII Manhattan art scene.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>As well as being a story of female friendship, mothers and daughters, and class, it is a queer story: later in life, Lenore comes to realize not only that Phoebe was her first love, but also that their mothers were having an affair throughout the girls’ childhoods. The novel is interested in the many compromises women, both straight and queer, make in order to function in society, and how different women conform and rebel in different ways.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>College student-athletes are exposed to highly demanding and stressful lifestyles. Accordingly, the NCAA has recently reported an increase in mental health concerns among athletes. As such, research aiming to understand constructs that help promote optimal functioning, prevent pathologies, and foster facilitative responses to stress seems increasingly relevant within sport contexts. Researchers have previously demonstrated dispositional gratitude to be associated with various indicators of positive mental health and well-being, such as increased satisfaction, positive affect, and decreased negative affect in general and sport settings. However, four primary gaps and limitations exist within the sport literature: 1) assessments of well-being have been incomprehensive; 2) few studies have utilized sport-specific measures of dispositional gratitude; 3) the cognitive and emotional mechanisms by which gratitude influences well-being have not yet been thoroughly been investigated; and 4) the explicit relationship between gratitude and athlete resilience has not yet been empirically established. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of sport and general dispositional gratitude on sport well-being and athlete resilience, while also examining the potential mechanistic role of cognitive appraisals and sport enjoyment in each of these relationships. It was hypothesized that general and sport dispositional gratitude would significantly directly and indirectly effect sport well-being and resilience through challenge appraisals, threat appraisals, and sport enjoyment. NCAA Division I-III athletes (N = 494) completed an online questionnaire including a demographics survey, Gratitude Questionnaire—6, Sport Gratitude Questionnaire—6, Sport Mental Health Continuum–Short Form, Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale 10-Item, Stress Appraisal Measure, and Sport Enjoyment subscale of the Sport Commitment Questionnaire—2. A path analysis was conducted to examine the predicted indirect effects of general and sport dispositional gratitude on sport well-being, and resilience through cognitive appraisals and sport enjoyment. Potential gender differences were examined with a multi-sample path analysis. Results of the path analysis revealed significant total effects on sport well-being and resilience for sport dispositional gratitude only. Various significant indirect effects were explicated, with potential differences by gender.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The use of music therapy interventions within pediatric healthcare is becoming increasingly popular because of the unique outcome music is able to provide. The purpose of this study was to investigate how music therapy within in-patient pediatric healthcare is portrayed on the social media platform YouTube. The search term pediatric medical music therapy was entered in the search box on YouTube. To narrow the search, only the first 150 videos that (1) contained the terms music therapy or music therapist with or without credentials in the title or description, (2) were published during or between 2015 and 2020, (3) were 10 minutes or less in length, and (4) were related to pediatric inpatient medical music therapy were considered for further analysis. This resulted in a total of 41 videos for analysis. To determine the results, a content rubric created by the investigator was used to analyze video-specific and therapy-specific categories. Video-specific categories included identification of music therapist, further contact info provided, patients seen in video, parents or guardians seen in video, and adequate audio and visual quality. The therapy-specific categories included therapist qualification, patient goals, patient issues and needs, music therapy interventions, research referenced, and music therapy accurately explained. Overall the results showed that only 46% (n = 19) of videos accurately explained music therapy. The remaining 22 videos did not explain music therapy at all or misrepresented the field. There are many other factors that were examined which have the opportunity to establish credibility and adequate education on music therapy. To advocate for the profession, it is crucial that videos published on YouTube are accurate and provide sufficient information to avoid misrepresentation.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This dissertation proposed three objectives for the study the fate of heavy metals in the environment, including: (1) Investigation of heavy metal removal in different matrix with traditional and advanced methods; (2) Characterization and simulation of heavy metal complexation processes; and (3) Quantification of facilitated heavy metal transport under different geochemistry conditions. Based on previous research experience, four specific topics were presented to address the proposed objectives.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In CHAPTER ONE, background information including heavy metal contamination, possible sources of heavy metal, and common remediation techniques were summarized. In CHAPTER TWO, electromagnetic wave induced heavy metal removal was studied as a new technique. The removal efficiencies were heavy metal species dependent. The removal could achieve 90% and 70% for copper and lead, while that of iron, nickel, and zinc were relatively low. Using as a pretreatment, the electromagnetic wave would significantly improve the removal efficiencies of traditional chemical extraction using organic acid and chelating agent. In CHAPTER THREE, a submerged anaerobic biofilm reactor was designed as a sustainable pretreatment method to remove heavy metals in landfill leachate. At steady state, 95% of iron was removed, while the removal efficiencies of nickel and lead were only 24% and 10%. The dissolved metal speciation modeling and a batch experiment were conducted to investigate the reasons for incomplete heavy metals removal. It was found that the complexation of heavy metals with humic substances and bisulfide inhibited their removal. And a longer hydraulic retention time would contribute to further nickel and lead removal. In CHAPTER FOUR, cadmium adsorption onto zeolite and bacteria was investigated by a batch experiment, while facilitated cadmium transport by four different bacterial strains was investigated by column experiments under different introduction scenarios. It was found that the adsorption of cadmium highly affected by the functional groups on the bacterial surface. The bacterial transport and facilitated cadmium transport were coupled with each other and depended on the formation of bacterial complexation. The breakthrough curves were simulated by the attachment–detachment model in Hydrus-1D. Damkohler number and reversibility were both control factors for the mass recovery of Cd and bacteria. In CHAPTER FIVE, the effects of mobile bacteria and phytate on uranium transport at contamination site soil were investigated in column experiments. It was discovered that uranium can barely be mobilized by de-ionized water but can be significantly transported with the aid of mobile indigenous bacteria. In the presence of phytate, bacterial-facilitated uranium transport was hindered. And pH was found to play the key role for uranium immobilization in the presence of phytate. In the end, a summary of this dissertation was given in CHAPTER SIX.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Concurrent with the rapid increase in population on Earth in recent centuries has been an increase in fossil fuel combustion, clearing of land and burning (slash and burn agriculture), as well as increasing natural wildfires, all of which have led to additional sources of combustion materials to the atmosphere. The concentrations of thermogenic aerosols have risen dramatically globally with associated increases in deposition on glacial surfaces after atmospheric transport. Glaciers are arguably the most susceptible ecosystem to climate change and anthropogenic activities. A number of studies have suggested anthropogenic sources of organic matter (OM), particularly fossil fuel combustion byproducts, to be a major source of OM to glacier environments predominantly due to the old age of exported OM. However, the source of OM in glacier environments remains a topic of debate and has also been postulated to come from a host of other origins, including the deposition of OM from terrestrial sources, subglacial OM reservoirs, and supra and subglacial biological sources. With respect to glacier OM sourced from fossil fuel combustion byproducts, one disconnects is the chemical composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in glacier ecosystems does not definitively indicate a fossil fuel source. The aim of this research is to examine the potential of photochemical processes to impact the composition of DOM from a suite of common sources to glacier environments, and to assess how similar these sources of DOM are posting photochemical degradation to glacier DOM. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this study, eight endmembers are chosen as sources of OM that are either found directly on, or can be readily deposited onto, the supraglacial surface. Firstly, photoirradiation for all the endmembers was undertaken using the normal daylight range in a solar simulator. The pre-irradiated endmembers and post-irradiated endmembers all exhibited different values of chromophoric DOM (CDOM) absorbance parameters and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations. By comparing the photochemical degradation and how the final values compared to glacier DOM measurements, the systematic shifts in the data highlights that photochemical degradation can make DOM from the diverse range of potential endmembers look more similar to DOM found in glacier environments. The experiments demonstrate the posited endmembers for glacier DOM can indeed maintain their old radiocarbon age (i.e., diesel particulate matter) but change from a broad compositional standpoint (i.e., SUVA254) to looking like DOM exported from glacier environments. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>As the optical parameters like SUVA254 are broad compositional metrics, the next step was the examination of exact molecular formula assignments via Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS). The molecular diversity of DOM found across the sample endmembers exhibit similarity of relative abundance (%RA) between photodegraded endmembers and glacial outflow samples (i.e., molecular level compositional convergence). The results presented in this thesis provide new insight into the impact of photochemistry on DOM with relevance to glacial DOM sources. Photochemistry could result in DOM that looks like glacier DOM at both the broad and molecular scale. These results highlight that sources of OM in glacier environments may be from these, and similar endmembers, and explain how glacier derived DOM can be both ancient (i.e., fossil fuel derived) and highly biolabile (driven by the DOM composition)</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Over the last decade, ridesharing has been widely used by people to satisfy their daily transportation needs in the context of accessibility. Many people use smartphone apps such as Uber and Lyft for this purpose, which makes their life easier and helps provide accessibility. While these advances regarding the ridesharing has provided many benefits, there are still a lot of questions to be answered related to their potential benefits and the problems they can create. The literature review clearly indicates that the sharing economy is becoming more and more common and people begin to accept these new ideas and technologies to get more benefits. Additionally, as an important component of the sharing economy, the ridesharing in big cities causes a big impact on people’s daily transportation behavior. Several researchers have seen the need to develop studies to analyze the impact of ridesharing to people’s trip modes. However, the analysis of the ridesharing in the literature lacks a temporal comparison (i.e., comparison for different times), which may influence the travel time, travel cost, trip origins and destinations greatly. As such, this thesis provides a comparative Geographical Information Systems (GIS)-based analysis based on the real-life ridesharing data in order to provide a better understanding on their benefits and problems. Using this comparison as a basis, this thesis looks into issues such as traffic congestion and delays that can be observed due to increasing ridesharing especially in metropolitan areas. On the other hand, the thesis also assesses the benefits of ridesharing in the context of accessibility and safety. In order to achieve this, 1-year ridesharing data is obtained from the City of Chicago official website, and analyzed and processed using Python. In order to make an analysis easier given the big dataset, this thesis focuses on the months of March, June, September, and December and presents a comparative spatiotemporal analysis with a focus on months, time of day and location. This is also supported by the demographical data such as population, income, age and commercialization for Chicago. Descriptive statistical analysis is also conducted based on the collected data to draw more concrete conclusions. Based on the GIS and statistical analyses, several important conclusions are drawn given the ridesharing patterns of Chicago.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The findings of the study show that the trip cost and trip distance are both positively associated with travel time, which is expected. There are other spatial and temporal conclusions that are drawn. At different times of the day, we observe that the actual cost and travel time for shared rides are different. Data suggests that peak hours always have more congestion and people need to pay more to get to their destinations during the peak hours. There are also more trips during peak hours than others. When we consider different seasons, it seems that the ridesharing companies charge more in March whereas they charge less in December. This may be due to the fact that Chicago gets less tourists in the month of December, therefore the companies try to attract the local customers by reducing the fare. Spatially, the most frequent places that are visited via ridesharing include the downtown Chicago, the central business district, and the airport. Also, findings indicate that people with high income use ridesharing more than others.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The results of the thesis can be very useful for the ridesharing companies to adjust their strategies for the City of Chicago especially with a consideration in the temporal variation presented. Future work can focus on a more detailed socioeconomic analysis of Chicago ridesharing users.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Each year millions of people develop suicide plans. These plans are consistently cited as critical indicators of suicide risk by clinicians, researchers, and suicide prevention agencies. Having the ability to accurately predict suicide plans, even without a full understanding of the causal risk mechanisms underlying them, would allow us to better identify individuals who require intervention – a critical step toward suicide prevention. The present study sought to describe the nature of suicide plans in the short term and predict suicide plans and related outcomes. Secondary data analysis was performed on an existing longitudinal dataset composed of 1021 participants. Participants were asked to complete suicide-related measures at baseline and 3-, 14-, and 28-days post-baseline. Analyses focused on three key outcomes: (a) suicide plans, (b) suicide preparatory behaviors, and (c) suicidal intent. To describe the nature of suicide plans in the short term, cross-sectional associations were calculated between these outcomes and relevant psychological constructs.  To examine our ability to predict these outcomes, univariate logistic regression, multivariate logistic regression, and machine learning models were implemented. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Results indicated that nearly all participants in the study sample endorsed a lifetime history of suicide plans. While most participants endorsed thinking of their suicide plan over the 28-day follow-up period, intent to act on these plans was only moderate on average. All suicide plan features (i.e., method, time, place) generally demonstrated consistent, yet small, cross-sectional associations with related constructs. Univariate predictors performed at approximately chance level prediction accuracy, and in general, predictive model performance was poor for traditional multivariate and LASSO models and excellent for Random Forest models. Overall, predictive results supported a complex conceptualization of risk for suicide plans, preparation to act on plans, and increased suicidal intent. The study limitations and implications for research and clinical practice are discussed. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation describes the development of several Cu(II)-promoted coupling reactions involving alkynes, including Cu(II)-mediated cyanation of terminal alkynes using NaCN, and Cu(II)-catalyzed oxidative formation of alkynyltriazoles by intercepting alkyne homocoupling reaction using organic azide. 1-Cyanoalkynes, the products from the cyanation of terminal alkynes, are effective to deliver 4-cyano-1,2,3-triazoles regiospecifically via ruthenium-catalyzed cycloaddition with organic azides (RuAAC). Mechanistic experiments indicate a ruthenium catalytic cycle that is different from the reported RuAAC mechanisms. Also, the mechanism of Cu(II)-catalyzed oxidative formation of alkynyltriazoles was studied in detail by using N-heterocyclic carbene copper complexes and ESI-MS technique. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter 1 provides the background on Cu-promoted coupling reaction involving alkynes. Cu-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition and its applications are also summarized in that chapter.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter 2 presents the work on Cu(II)-mediated formation of 1-cyanoalkynes and their reactivity in Ru-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloadditions. First, a facile method to synthesize 1-cyanoalkynes is introduced. This method uses a combination of Cu(II) perchlorate and sodium cyanide. DIPEA and 1-methylimidazole (or imidazole) are applied as the base and the supporting ligand, respectively. A series of 1-cyanoalkynes are synthesized and applied in ruthenium-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition. Experiments indicate that 1-cyanoalkyne reacts faster than terminal alkyne and other electro-poor internal alkynes. Supported by kinetic experiment and computational study, a catalytic cycle different from the reported RuAAC mechanism is proposed.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The development of Cu(II)-catalyzed oxidative formation of alkynyltriazoles is described in Chapter 3. The reaction starts from terminal alkynes and organic azides with copper(II) acetate as the catalyst and the basic additive DBN. The method is evaluated in a broad scope of azides and alkynes. The reactivity rankings of azides and alkynes are concluded after the substrate scope expansion, and a systematic approach to optimizing yield is provided. Mechanistic experiments are applied regarding the dependence of each reaction component and the role of basic additive in the determination of oxidative products. Comparing to existing methods, this work provides the larges substrate scope and a detailed mechanistic study.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter 4 demonstrates the mechanistic study of Cu(II)-catalyzed oxidative formation of triazoles using air-stable copper(I) complexes of N-heterocyclic carbenes. The reactions are analyzed by NMR and ESI-MS technique. The effect of copper source and the additive, DBN or potassium carbonate, are studied using both analytical methods. DBN inhibits the cycloaddition step while potassium carbonate allows the cycloaddition to occur. ESI-MS is applied to detect potential reaction intermediates and to study the effect of additive on the formation of NHC-copper complexes. Base on the results from NMR and ESI-MS experiments, the effect of additive on the selectivity of oxidative products (alkynyltriazole and bistriazole) is illustrated.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The supporting information file includes the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of 1-cyanoalkynes, 4-cyano-1,2,3-triazoles, and 5-alkynyl-1,2,3-triazoles synthesized in this dissertation. The images of isotopic patterns for the copper complexes identified from ESI-MS experiments are attached in the supporting information file. This file also includes X-ray crystallography data of some 4-cyano-1,2,3-triazoles.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In recent years, researchers have become increasingly interested in deep learning. Extensive and high-quality data are essential for deep learning. For example, PubMed is a popular and free search engine with more than 30 million biomedical literature. Also, Protein Data Bank (PDB) provides data about the three-dimensional (3D) shapes of proteins, nucleic acids, and complex assemblies to help researchers. However, those databases are not easy to use. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation applies deep learning methods in text mining and computational structural biology to improve the accessibility of public literature and the usability of the Protein Data Bank. The first study introduces a new approach to find out the most relevant articles from the PubMed database for a queried sentence with an assumption that the articles cited in the sentence are among the most relevant. We used a large volume of citation data from full-text PubMed Central articles to build a high-quality database for training deep learning models. We developed a structured query language (SQL)-based search engine combining with deep learning models to improve the search results significantly.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The second study refines protein structures by using 3D structures and sequence information from Protein Data Bank (PDB) based on deep learning models to improve our understanding of proteins. First, we generate thousands of conformations for a segment of a protein with the torsion angle prediction model. Furthermore, we chose the best protein conformation by applying the energy function model. Through the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) layer, our model accepts inputs with different lengths. Combining with the torsion angle prediction model and energy model, we can refine a protein structure.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Professional musicians have become increasingly independent of record companies and other investors that would seek to make a financial gain from the artist’s success. With the availability of relatively inexpensive professional recording equipment, musicians can now purchase and own the electronics they need to create their own high-quality recordings. However, the creation of a great recording requires more than a financial investment; it requires an understanding of acoustics, recording techniques that have produced great recordings of the past, and modern audio processing methods. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The purpose of this treatise is to create a guide that will assist classical guitarists who wish to make their own professional recordings. This guide will include the documentation of nine significant guitar recordings from the last 60 years, and it will attempt to quantify sound relationships among these recordings via modern sound analysis tools. The documentation and sound analysis of these recordings will then be used in conjunction with current digital audio techniques to generate a guide for emulating a favored sonic architecture. This treatise should also provide guitarists with adequate knowledge concerning the production of professional recordings using modern recording tools.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The U.S. emerging adult population has been increasingly considered at-risk of developing stress-related mental health problems (e.g., depression). Thus, it is important to address the potential causes of these steady increases in observed reports of psychological distress and major depression among emerging adults. Scholars have pointed to the salience of the parent-child relationship when examining child mental health outcomes. More recent observations of the parent-child relationship suggest a trend in parental overinvolvement occurring among emerging adults as they enter college, however, further work is necessary to understand the nuances of this parenting phenomenon The purpose of this study was to create a multidimensional measure of overparenting, investigate whether there exists overparenting profiles, and examine their association with emerging adult’s mental health symptoms. Data were collected from undergraduate students who fell within the emerging adulthood age range. Results of the measurement analyses provided support for a brief yet multidimensional measure assessing overparenting in four domains (career/academic, financial, personal/social, health). Further analyses revealed that 4 profiles of overparenting existed (High/Academic, Career, and Health-Focused, Moderate/Academic and Career-Focused, Moderate Overparenting, and Low Overparenting). Emerging adults who were identified in the High/Academic, Career, and Health Focused group were likelier to report greater mental health symptoms compared to all other groups. Implications, future directions, and study limitations are further discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Collegiate athletes face requirements and obligations that can have a toll on their athletic and academic experience. Burnout is among the adverse consequences that these demands can cause, potentially leading to decreases in performance, motivation, and even dropout. Although research efforts on athlete burnout have been prolific, there is a dearth of studies on potential interventions to prevent or treat this syndrome. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of an online writing intervention in treating burnout in collegiate athletes through a randomized control trial. Specifically, it was hypothesized that increases in presence of meaning in sport through writing would lead to decreases in burnout symptoms. Screening involved 425 NCAA Collegiate athletes from a variety of sports, with 157 qualified participants, 86 agreeing to participate, for a total of 65 participants completing the intervention. Results from a series of repeated-measure ANCOVAs showed marginal improvements in constrained commitment and presence of meaning in sport for the intervention group, with no other changes in burnout or related constructs. Manipulation check results using the LIWC software suggest the writing intervention elicited the content they were they were designed for. Findings are discussed in light of new research on meaning in sport, theoretical approaches of athlete burnout, and future research directions in both domains.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Understanding the theory of how massive stars die is an important astrophysical challenge.  An important result in  core-collapse supernova (CCSN) theory  is that spherically-symmetric, one-dimensional simulations routinely fail to explode, yet multi-dimensional simulations  often explode. Numerical investigations suggest that turbulence eases the condition for explosion, but how is not yet fully understood. We develop a turbulence model for neutrino-driven convection, and show that this turbulence model reduces  the condition for explosions by about 30%, in concordance with multi-dimensional simulations. In addition, we identify which turbulent terms enable explosions. Primarily, turbulent dissipation (TD) provides extra heating, adding significant thermal pressure, and reducing the condition for explosion. An explosion  condition presents a clear diagnostic to explain why stars explode, and the convection  model allows us to explore how turbulence enables explosion. Having understood how convection aides explosion, we incorporate this convection model in approximate one-dimensional CCSN simulations. This is the 1D+ method.  This convection model lowers the neutrino luminosity required for explosion by ~30%, similar to the reduction observed in multi-dimensional simulations. Qualitatively, the critical conditions in the 1D+ and the two-dimensional simulations are similar. These 1D+ simulations are consistent with the profiles and explosion conditions of equivalent two-dimensional CCSN simulations but are ~100 times faster, and the 1D+ prescription has the potential to be ~100,000 faster than three-dimensional CCSN simulations.  The 1D+ technique will be ideally suited to test the explodability of thousands of progenitor models.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The United States stands out as the most economically unequal industrialized democracy. The wealthiest Americans hold nearly as much income today as they did prior to the Great Depression. Despite decades of rising inequality, in which shared prosperity gave way to unequal growth that primarily benefited the affluent, public support for redistribution has not increased meaningfully. This is puzzling because it runs counter to canonical models of democracy, inequality, and redistribution, which assume that the public will favor increased redistribution when inequality rises. It is also puzzling because majorities of Americans claim to be concerned about rising inequality, believe that the rich have too much and the poor too little, and appear to be well-aware that inequality has risen over the past several decades. This dissertation seeks to examine the nature of public opinion toward income inequality and economic redistribution as well as the puzzling relationship between rising inequality and public opinion toward redistribution in the United States.  Rather than ignorance of, or apathy regarding, inequality, I argue that low trust in government and negative attitudes toward a growing and highly-salient immigrant population, have helped contribute to the lack of mass responsiveness to rising inequality. Furthermore, generally low levels of political knowledge mean that citizens are failing to connect strongly their opposition to inequality and favoritism of the lower classes over the upper classes, with support for government policies meant to reduce income disparities.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Physical processes that enhance heavy rainfall in association with warm season (April-September) fronts are investigated over western North Carolina. In this region of complex terrain encompassing the basins of the Upper Catawba River, the South Yadkin River, and the Upper Yadkin River, quantitative precipitation estimates and forecasts exhibit known biases, and a variety of large-scale atmospheric patterns can lead to heavy rainfall and flash flooding. The focus is on events with space-time dimensions on the meso-beta scale (horizontally up to 200 km and temporally up to about 12-18 hours). The most frequent internally forced mesoscale weather features that produce such heavy rainfall episodes in the region are mid-latitude fronts. External mechanical forcing due to the orography of the southern Appalachians also plays an important role in shaping the rainfall intensity and distribution.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A 17-year climatology comprised of 98 heavy rainfall cases is constructed using daily 4-km stage IV precipitation analyses. Cases are categorized according to the type of front (cold or stationary), front location (if stationary) relative to the study area (north, south, or over the basins), time of year (April and September vs. May-August), and time of day of peak rainfall. Classical warm front cases are too few to be included in this study. Results show that the majority of warm season heavy rainfall episodes tend to peak in the afternoon or evening, but there is a notable exception regarding events associated with stationary fronts located south of the basins. These episodes have a nocturnal maximum in rainfall in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, suggesting an interaction between the small-scale mountain-valley breezes and a mesoscale easterly low-level jet.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The front type clusters are further evaluated utilizing the latest fifth-generation reanalysis (ERA5) produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Through the use of percentile rankings, the raw values of precipitable water and convective available potential energy are transformed into more meaningful and useful quantities that show well-defined maxima in and around the study region. For cold fronts as well as April and September cases of stationary fronts south of the basins, correlation analysis shows that the presence/strength of an atmospheric river plays a key role in determining the amount and areal extent of heavy rainfall. Also quantified is the low-level upslope flow, which helps regulate the spatial and temporal variability of heavy rainfall for nearly all frontal regimes in the study. In addition, rainfall events associated with stationary fronts to the north of the basins are heaviest when those fronts retreat farther north and west, coincident with a stronger Atlantic high pressure cell which increases the low-level moisture transport up the slopes of the Blue Ridge Mountains. For stationary fronts over the basins, the cases with the heaviest, most widespread rainfall are associated with a sharper west-east moisture gradient from the mountain ridges to the North Carolina Piedmont.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Self-control predicts moral behavior. Traditional theory explains this finding by suggesting self-control works to inhibit antisocial impulses, which everyone experiences. However, Aristotle argued that by practicing virtue, people’s moral thoughts, feelings, and actions align such that they no longer experience antisocial impulses. Moreover, self-control is associated with experiences of weaker temptation and reduced conflict when selecting value-consistent choices in non-moral domains. Therefore, we suggest that, rather than increased inhibition, reductions in temptation partially account for the link between self-control and value-consistent, unselfish decisions in the moral domain. Study 1 supported the reduction hypothesis and demonstrated greater harmony among the morally-relevant thoughts, feelings, and decisions of people higher (vs. lower) in trait self-control. Study 2 (preregistered) conceptually replicated Study 1 by employing an online, behavioral measure of temptation across more numerous moral decisions: mouse tracking. Study 3 (preregistered) extended Study 2 by also examining the strategies those high in self-control employ to automatically pursue goals, here in the moral domain—namely, moral habits and the construal of immoral acts as impossible. Study 3 replicated the finding that people high (versus low) in self-control more often make unselfish choices on proscriptive (ought not) moral decisions and extended this finding to prescriptive (ought to) moral choices, but did not replicate the finding that people higher, versus low, in self-control display less moral temptation. Together, findings suggest that self-control facilitates the integration of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors with moral values, and may aid the automatization of their application, consistent with Aristotle’s conception of virtue.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation presents a series of electron paramagnetic resonance investigations on molecule-based magnetic materials. We begin with an introduction to the field of Single-Molecules magnets in the Ch. 1 introduction. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>   In Ch. 2 we present angle-dependent high-frequency EPR studies on a single-crystal of a trigonal Mn_3^III cluster with an unusual structure in which the local magnetic easy-axes of the constituent MnIII ions are tilted significantly away from the molecular C3 axis towards the ‘magic-angle’ of 54.7 degrees, resulting in an almost complete cancelation of the 2nd-order axial magnetic anisotropy, DS ̂_z^2, associated with the ferromagnetically coupled total spin ST = 6 ground state. This contrasts the situation in many related Mn_3^III single-molecule magnets (SMMs) that have been studied intensively in the past, for which the local MnIII anisotropy tensors are reasonably parallel. As such, the tilted nature of this particular Mn_3^III compound, presented herein provides a unique opportunity to study how molecular geometry influences the interactions that are responsible for quantum tunneling of magnetization in high-symmetry SMMs. This is accomplished by angle-dependent EPR measurements that provide a full mapping of the molecular magneto-anisotropy.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>   While chemists have routinely synthesized exchange coupled clusters consisting of transition metals in the context of SMMS for many years, only recently has the generation of magnetic exchange in lanthanide clusters been the subject of considerable interest. In Ch.3 we investigate a unique linear trinuclear lanthanide cluster, in which its neighbors are linked together by single carbon bridges via unique metallocene ligands. While Ch. 2 demonstrates a scenario in which a coupled geometry can be antagonistic to SMM behavior, here we show a trinuclear lanthanide cluster where the axial anisotropy is demonstrably larger compared to its analogous monomer sub-unit, suggesting the presence of a strong ferromagnetic exchange between neighboring lanthanides. As such, the study focuses on identifying the nature of anisotropy in the trimer from a series of powder EPR studies.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>    Ch.4 continues on this line of investigation with regards to lanthanide SMMs, where we present magnetic resonance studies on an Yb(trensal) complex using a unique far infrared (FIR) spectroscopy set up. Previous AC susceptibility measurements of Yb(trensal) demonstrated a rather extreme scenario, where, despite possessing a relatively large zero-field energy barrier to magnetization reversal of ~900 cm-1¬, a Arrhenius fit to the temperature dependent relaxation yielded an unrealistic activation energy of just 38 cm-1. This suggests a rather sizeable contribution from Raman relaxation, which can be attributed to strong coupling between the crystal field and the vibration degrees of freedom available to the system. Here, we present frequency domain magnetic resonance (FDMR) measurements in the FIR range to spectroscopically characterize the spin-vibron coupling associated with the previously observed Raman relaxation in Yb(trensal).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>   The last two chapters in this dissertation take quite a departure from the matter of SMMs, and as such are written to entirely be self-contained. In Ch.5 we present studies on bisdithiazolyl (and related) organic radicals. In the field of organic materials, these particular radicals are attractive to study since their magnetic properties can be carefully tuned by varying and substituting their chalcogen and halogen content. In this work, we focus specifically on heavy halide substitution in two families of molecule: ‘single-orbital’ IBSSEt (1) and ‘multi-orbital’ IBBO (2). Structural differences result in a ferromagnetic ground state in 1, while 2 orders as a spin canted antiferromagnet. Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) measurements on 1 show that substitution of I for Cl has no effect on the exchange anisotropy (EA). However, antiferromagnetic resonance (AFMR) measurements show that substituting I for F has a dramatic effect on the EA. Our analysis demonstrates that the sensitivity to the halide’s larger spin-orbit coupling is dictated by the molecular orbitals that dominate the exchange. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>   The last chapter presents instrumentation development in the context of Pulsed EPR. Recent advances in high-power microwave electronics allow for the integration of an Arbitrary Waveform Generators (AWG) into a high-frequency (94 GHz) spectrometer, providing a high level of control over the phase, frequency and amplitude of the excitation pulses over a bandwidth of up to 1 GHz. This makes fast/efficient EPR experiments feasible in the time domain, with dramatic improvements in sensitivity and resolution, providing access to microscopic information that is not accessible via previously existing methods. Here, we demonstrate preliminary results on a model radical and Gd(III) system to demonstrate the added benefits of pulse shaping afforded by the AWG.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>My motivation for developing this project started with the question: What is the intersection of students’ culture with physics ideas? I ask this because for decades scholars have explored the impact that the intersection of school and culture has on instruction in schools (Bryan &amp; Atwater, 2002; Gay, 2002; Ladson-Billings, 1995; Milner, 2011; Scherff &amp; Spector, 2011). Indeed, a variety of researchers have found that students have a higher level of engagement, performance, and identification when the instructor uses students’ cultural resources for instruction (Au &amp; Jordan, 1981; Brown, Collins, &amp; Duguid, 1989; Scherff &amp; Spector, 2011). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	There have been developments in pedagogical theories and approaches to teaching science from a culturally informed perspective (Banks, 1993; Carreon, 2007; Ladson-Billings, 1992). Pedagogical approaches that are culture-based are designed to give students from different cultural backgrounds very distinct classroom experiences than those traditionally seen. These experiences are designed to use students’ cultural resources as a reference to enhance the content, curriculum, and teaching approaches that structure students’ formal education to create meaningful academic experiences.   </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	However, while the development of the culture-based pedagogical approaches have been described in many disciplines, researchers have struggled to implement such pedagogies in science (Boutte, Kelly-Jackson, &amp; Johnson, 2010; Johnson, 2011).  One of the primary tensions involved in this effort is the difficulty in merging the canonical knowledge to be learned with students’ cultures. There have been many approaches to bridge the two. For example, (1) identifying students’ cultural resources though funds of knowledge (Moll, Amanti, Neff, &amp; Gonzalez, 1992; Morrison, Robbins, &amp; Rose, 2008; Teo &amp; Khoh, 2015), and (2) problematizing a relevant issue within the context of students’ culture (Morales‐Doyle, 2017) have become well-recognized standards in this approach to instruction. However, these efforts have been largely fragmented, and the body of research has been poorly articulated as scholars have worked within different theoretical frameworks, focusing on varied disciplines and student target populations.  Thus, the primary goal for this study was to systematically examine an attempt to incorporate a culturally relevant approach to physics instruction. The research has been structured to address the following research questions: </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>1.	How does one physics teacher enact culturally relevant pedagogy? </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>2.	What are the dilemmas a select physics teacher navigates as she develops and attempts to enact a culturally relevant approach to physics instruction?</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	To answer these questions, I employed a qualitative case study approach to examine the efforts of a female African American Physics teacher (under the pseudonym Sarah), as she attempted to shift her instruction from a traditional approach to a culturally relevant one. Using data from classroom observations, co-planning sessions, and semi-structured interviews with the teacher, I examined the dilemmas Sarah experienced as she attempted to develop and enact culturally relevant curricula in her physics classroom. To frame my analysis of challenges posed by Sarah’s efforts, I used Windschitl’s (2002) framework of dilemmas teachers encounter which consists of: conceptual, pedagogical, cultural, and political. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Findings revealed that Sarah showed the strongest indicators of culturally relevant pedagogy through her allowing students to address socio-political topics, consistent encouragement of students towards academic excellence, and ability to adapt curricula to capitalize on students’ strengths. The weakest indicator of culturally relevant pedagogy in Sarah’s instruction was found in the connection between students’ cultural norms and physics content.  As Sarah worked to make her instruction more culturally relevant, she encountered many dilemmas in her teaching, ranging from difficulties with encouraging students to establish agency in their learning, constraints on using students’ cultural resources to connect to physics ideas, and restrictions from state curricula standards, along with local and school authorities that set boundaries on the sorts of lessons that she could enact.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The findings from this case study suggests that Sarah placed a larger emphasis on cultural competence and socio-political consciousness, and a smaller emphasis on academic excellence in her physics instruction. The weaker emphasis on academic excellence was largely due to dilemmas Sarah encountered when she attempted to introduce a more constructivist-based approach to her teaching, as Sarah’s struggled with trying to manage students’ moments of uncertainty in their science learning. While Sarah supported students’ consideration of sociopolitical topics in her classroom, such as discussions of racial discrimination that students encountered, she struggled to find physics-based sociopolitical topics to anchor her instruction, and she struggled to connect students’ cultural resources to physics ideas. The conservative nature of her school system precluded the use of some forms of sociopolitical topics and required a fast pace of instruction, making the social consciousness tenant of Ladson Billings (1995) cultural relevance difficult to achieve within a physics context. In contrast, Sarah’s positionality as an African American woman familiar and comfortable in the students’ community allowed her to excel in cultural competence, and her drive for students to succeed provided one route to academic excellence.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para> 	This study suggests that Culturally Relevant Pedagogy depends on a myriad of factors, relying in part on teachers’ relationships with students, their knowledge of students’ communities, wider institutional factors,  as well as curriculum. Thus, no single lesson or activity that can assure culturally relevance. While CRP cannot be captured in any singular curricular document, these findings suggests that preservice and in-service teachers must be provided with many examples of teachers who use CRP in physics and other science classrooms and opportunities to enact such instruction, followed by a reflection on their practice. This case study is one example that will be useful to those interested in engaging in such instruction in the context of physics and it calls attention to the need for further curricular and instructional supports for such efforts.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>A given location’s annual cycle of surface temperature is often used as a reference framework for climate anomalies through which the seasonal and interannual variability of the Earth’s climate system can be quantified. Since local climate trends can be explained by the same fundamental physics that power a basic energy balance climate model, one of these models could theoretically simulate Earth’s land surface temperature trend and then be used to predict its future evolution. Although general circulation models (GCMs) are considered the most accurate climate simulations, they are highly complex to diagnose direct responses from perturbations to individual parameters. This study focuses on building and parameterizing a simplified conceptual energy balance climate model that will be tested to 1) simulate observational annual cycles to demonstrate the model’s reasonable validity and 2) discover how Earth’s climate system in an energy balance framework is sensitive to the considered parameters. Detailed explanations of the selected parameters surface albedo, greenhouse gas concentration and meridional heat transport are presented. Sensitivity testing of these parameters reveals that both tropical and midlatitude annual cycles are particularly sensitive to the meridional heat transport rate, followed by moderate sensitivity to surface albedo and little sensitivity to the greenhouse gas parameter. Observed warming trends indicate the mid- and high latitudes are warming at a faster rate relative to the tropics, which has reduced the meridional temperature gradient through time. The simulations of reduced meridional heat transport in the midlatitudes are related to a given location’s later observance of its maximum temperature within its annual cycle. In the tropics, reduced meridional heat transport is related to an earlier observance of its maximum temperature within its annual cycle, as the tropics may evolve towards a dual-peaking annual cycle with less overall heat transport and a stronger emergence of its semiannual cycle. The results of this study demonstrate the usefulness of studying climate through a simplified energy balance framework, even in a modern computer-intensive field with powerful GCMs.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Adrienne Rich explains that the contemporary concept of the home and the domestic sphere is a cultural construct rather than an essential, inherent biological identity. She asserts that the “nineteenth- and twentieth-century ideal of the mother and children immured together in the home, the specialization of motherhood for women, the separation of the home from the ‘man’s world’ of wage-earning, struggle, ambition, aggression, power, of the ‘domestic’ from the ‘public’ or the ‘political’—all of this is a late-arrived development in human history” (46). The maternal identity has continued to trouble scholars and writers through the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Modernist and feminist scholars have grappled with the function of the maternal identity within modern narratives and progressive endeavors. Much of the critical and mainstream conversations have situated the maternal identity as regressive character, the product of a reductive binary including good/bad, domestic/professional, woman/man, and so on. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>My research concentrates on modernist literary depictions of the mother to expand contemporary understanding of the construction of the maternal identity as a distinctly modernist project: the modernist mother. Modernist writers such as Henry James, Nella Larsen, and William Faulkner challenged Victorian values to depict the modernist mother as a complicated and nuanced figure. Later modernists like Kay Boyle, Storm Jameson, and Elizabeth Bowen highlighted the modernist mother as a self-sufficient woman who forges her own path within a changing world.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Electroacoustic music is a broad term used to describe the process of composition as opposed to the sonic environment of the music. Over the last several decades, electronic music has evolved to incorporate acoustic instruments and live computer processing. This document is an exploration of the current, most prevalent styles of electroacoustic music: fixed media, amplification with the addition of effect pedals, and live processing using the compositional method of live looping. Additionally, there are sections included discussing the standard tools and unique features of electroacoustic music. This document highlights three electronic etudes, composed for this case study. Ideas and suggestions for approaching practice, performance, teaching, and composition are discussed for each style of electroacoustic music. The pieces are titled “Electric Etudes,” written for a performer beginning to explore electronics, or a student interested in writing electroacoustic clarinet music. As etudes, these are not complete performance pieces; their primary objective is to help incorporate the use of electronics into practice and performance settings.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Each electronic etude section is structured as follows: an etude in one of the three styles, performance considerations (set-up, tools needed, how to practice, etc.) and compositional advice and considerations. The goal of this document is to make modern technology in electroacoustic music accessible for clarinet pedagogy and performance. Some of the hurdles to accessibility that this sub-genre faces are attributed to: the low number of compositions published in comparison to other new music genres, limited standardized tools and resources for students, and the need for products that are often overly complicated and costly. This inhibits many students, teachers, and composers from exploring electroacoustic music in their studies. Through this project, I hope to guide individuals who wish to explore this avenue of music-making, ultimately helping to advance the electroacoustic clarinet through repertoire and pedagogy. Additionally, there is a copy of the Electric Etudes in the appendix and a .mp3 file has been uploaded for the backing track of Electric Etude #1.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Negative book equity firms have grown to comprise a substantial subset of the equity market, totaling $893 billion in market value at the end of 2017. Few studies focus on negative book equity firms, leaving our understanding of this sector of the market inadequate. One important question that exists is how investors place positive market value on these negative book value firms. There are concerns with interpretation of negative book equity firms using empirical value relevance model measures based on earnings and book value. In this study, I investigate and find that net deferred taxes and some cash-related variables provide incremental value-relevant information to investors in negative book equity firms. Net deferred taxes, in particular, may serve as a signaling mechanism from management through which investors can assess the market value of these firms.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory of superconductivity is one of the jewels of 20th century physics.  In this theory, the superconducting state of a metal is understood in terms of the formation of electron pairs which condense into a macroscopic quantum state that can carry electrical current without resistance.  The theory is built upon another jewel, Landau Fermi liquid theory, which implies that even strongly interacting fermions (such as electrons in a metal) can, at low energies, behave like weakly interacting ``quasiparticles".  According to BCS theory, if these quasiparticles experience an attractive force, characterized by dimensionless coupling constant $\lambda$, they will form pairs with a binding energy (or energy gap) given by $\Delta \sim \omega_0 e^{-1/\lambda}$ where $\omega_0$ is a characteristic energy scale.  The fact that this binding energy depends on the inverse coupling constant $1/\lambda$ in the exponent suggests that this pairing is very sensitive to the strength of the interaction, consistent with experimental observation.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The quantum Hall effect, a {\it third} 20th century jewel, occurs when a two-dimensional gas of electron is placed in a magnetic field and cooled to very low temperature.  For certain field strengths the electrons can form states with an energy gap.  These states then exhibit a precisely quantized Hall resistance and vanishing longitudinal resistance.  For other field strengths, the system is gapless, and behaves in many ways like a metal in zero magnetic field.  Much of this phenomena can be understood in terms of new particles, known as composite fermions, which consist of electrons bound to an even number of flux quanta. These new particles experience an effective magnetic field that is different than the applied field and, for the case of a composite fermion metal, this effective field is zero.  There is, however, a price to be paid for this effective field. The composite fermions also experience a strongly fluctuating $U(1)$ gauge field.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The bilayer composite fermion metal, i.e. two parallel composite fermion metals that interact with each other via the Coulomb repulsion, is a rich system in which all three of these jewels meet, and which has been studied both experimentally and theoretically for more than 30 years.  In this system the composite fermions are predicted to experience {\it two} gauge fields, one associated with each layer.  These gauge fields naturally organize themselves into in-phase and out-of-phase components.  A clear prediction of the theory is that the out-of-phase fluctuations are stronger and hence should dominate the low-energy physics.   One effect of these out-of-phase fluctuations is that they lead to a breakdown of Fermi liquid theory. Another is that they lead to a strong attractive interaction between composite fermions in different layers leading to the formation of interlayer pairs.  Because of the singular nature of this interaction and the non-Fermi liquid nature of the system, the BCS result for pairing is no longer applicable.  Instead, the binding energy of the interlayer pairs is predicted to be $\Delta \sim \omega_0 (l_0/d)^2$, where $d$ is the spacing between layers, $l_0$ is the so-called magnetic length, which is a measure of the size of the wave function of individual electrons, and $\omega_0$ is again a typical energy scale.  The fact that this gap depends as a power law on $l_0/d$, which plays the role of a dimensionless coupling constant here, and not an essential singularity, as in BCS theory, suggests this pairing should be significantly more robust than conventional superconductivity.  But, to date, there is no experimental evidence such a paired state of composite fermions exists in bilayer composite fermion metals at large layer spacing.  The mystery of why this is one of the main motivators of this Dissertation.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Here we address this question by including in our study of the bilayer not just the pairing out-of-phase fluctuations, but also the {\it pair-breaking} in-phase fluctuations.  While the in-phase fluctuations are significantly less singular than the the out-of-phase fluctuations, they nonetheless can have a significant effect.   We study this effect using a variety of approaches.  First we carry out a renormalization group analysis and find that, while the repulsive gauge field suppresses pairing, it never leads to the destruction of the paired state. We then present numerical solutions of the full $T=0$ Eliashberg equations (coupled integral equations which can describe pairing even in systems with strong enough interactions to lead to the breakdown of Fermi liquid theory) which are broadly consistent with the renormalization group results.  Finally, in the central result of the Dissertation, we link these two approaches and find an analytic solution to the Eliashberg equations (within the so-called ``local approximation", which can be used to justify the renormalization group approach) which includes both the out-of-phase pairing interaction and the in-phase pair-breaking interaction.  We find that the pair-breaking fluctuations neither close the energy gap, nor change the dependence of this gap on the inverse of the layer spacing squared.  Rather, the pair-breaking fluctuations lead to a strongly suppressive prefactor in the expression for the energy gap.  Our approach provides, for the first time, an analytic expression for this prefactor from which it can be seen that this effect is large enough to possibly account for the fact that this paired state hasn't yet been seen in experiment.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Green Infrastructure (GI), including greenspace, provides many important benefits to humans, including that of natural hazard mitigation. As such, it is important that issues of equity and recovery are included in planning for GI. This paper examines several elements of these issues through three distinct chapters. The first reviews issues of distribution and equity of parks in one city. The second considers planning for greenspace recovery, and the third investigates benefits and challenges of post-disaster green volunteering.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Reactive Aggression (RA) and Proactive Aggression (PA) represent two functions for engaging in aggressive behaviors. Proactive Aggression (PA) is considered to be a “cold” aggression that results in planned behaviors. In contrast, Reactive Aggression (RA) has been described as a “hot” aggression that occurs in response to an external threatening stimulus. Emotion dysregulation is a person’s inability to recognize emotions and employ strategies to control these emotions. Most past research related to the relationship between aggression and emotion dysregulation focused on younger populations and on one dimension of aggression, as opposed to the two-dimensional RA/ PA model. Given the developmental nature of emotion regulation, it is appropriate to investigate these same variables in adults. Participants were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) and compensated using funds from the Institute of Education Sciences’ (IES) Pathways to the Education Sciences Research Training Program. The current study used multiple linear regression analyses to test the hypothesis that lower scores on emotion dysregulation subscales will predict higher levels of proactive aggression; whereas, higher scores on emotion dysregulation subscales will predict higher levels of reactive aggression. The major finding of the study was that PA was related to being able to engage in goal-directed behaviors while emotionally aroused, while the opposite was true for RA. Additionally, PA was related to impulsivity and trouble clarifying emotions. Findings suggest that adults who present with PA may benefit from learning impulse control strategies and how to clarify and sort out their emotions. Adults who present with RA may benefit from learning calming techniques, such as mindfulness, and social skills to stop and think about the goals of the interaction. However, due to limitations of the study’s ability to confirm all linear regression assumptions, results should be interpreted with caution.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Originally Nothing is a poetry collection that traces the intersection of immigrant experience, place, obsession, distance, loss, and avoidance through a balance of lyric, narrative, minimalist, and serial modes. The book’s core second section—a long poem titled “Speak and the Sleepers”—employs white space and extends the elegiac tradition to examine differing forms of absence, including diaspora and a father’s passing. The poem also shifts among several languages and recontextualizes phrases borrowed from international poets. As the collection moves from Manhattan to Ukraine, Ohio to Italy, rural Massachusetts to Florida’s coast, methods and themes evolve. And elemental image, formal diversity, meditations on (non)disclosure, and an avant-garde aesthetic combine to explore perception, grief, language, and continuance.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Dynamic legged robots use complex designs or controllers to achieve high performance locomotion. Some of these gaits can result in high power requirements to achieve the best results. In nature, animals often use spring-like behaviors to exhibit robust and efficient performance. This thesis looks to study various methods of improving performance and efficiency of legged systems though leg design, improving leg control, and studying energy efficient path planning.  This is done utilizing analytical models, physical experimentation on a legged robot, and high fidelity multibody model of a quadruped robot.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Desirae, a chamber opera in one act, is named after its protagonist, a 26-year-old artist struggling to acknowledge her full identity. In an effort to make peace with this, she begins a quest for clarity by entering into three very different relationships. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Desirae straddles the boundary between opera and musical theatre, employing elements from both. Although the score requires the virtuosity and vocal style of operatic voices, it replaces recitative with spoken poem recitations and character dialogue. Each member of the cast is musically paired with a member of the instrumental ensemble (Desirae and flute, Matt and oboe, Mark and bassoon, and Mai-Linh and Bb clarinet). The music is largely generated from tonal scalar patterns (major, minor, dorian, and lydian collections). Ostinatos, specifically descending “lament” tetrachords, play an important role in the form and harmonic structure. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The libretto is an original story written by the composer, interwoven with excerpts of poetry by Edna St. Vincent Millay. Desirae is ultimately a coming-of-age story whose moral is to accept uncertainty, question conventionalities, and explore alternate, but equally valid kinds of platonic and romantic relationships.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The use of natural horn and its technique has greatly diminished since the invention of the valved horn in the 19th century. While there have been groups of composers and hornists who continue to advocate for the natural horn, it has become a specialty instrument whose study is often non-comprehensive or relegated to a short period of time. Since the beginning of the 20th century, there have been composers utilizing the natural horn and its technique, legitimizing its continued importance and providing new landscapes of creative expression that were, for a long while, exclusive to the valved horn. The pieces surveyed in this treatise, Villanelle by Paul Dukas, Serenade for tenor, horn, and strings by Benjamin Britten, Prelude for Horn by Randall Faust, Elegia by Hermann Baumann, September Elegy by Jeffrey Agrell, and “Ghost Circles” from Supernatural by Jay Batzner, were chosen because of their historical significance for the horn, their pedagogical value, and their exploration into different mediums of horn performance. This treatise will provide important historical and biographical information about these pieces and their composers, discuss important features about the pieces, and provide performance suggestions relating to the natural horn and its technique. Additionally, this treatise will cover the overtone series, how the valved horn eased the process of navigating the range and chromaticism of the horn, and how modern natural horn writing has become integrated into solo literature.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This novel follows T-Mark and a cast of contemporary train hoppers who congregate in Gainesville, Florida. From the beginning of the narrative, T-Mark is haunted by a fatal accident he witnesses, and one of the people killed by the train starts to speak to him in his dreams and then eventually confronts him in waking life. Other supernatural elements set a tone of otherworldliness against an otherwise realistic and rooted setting, guiding the reader to question T-Mark and his blurred conception of real versus perceived. Perspectives from other characters help interrogate and complicate this further. While we witness T-Mark navigate this chosen lifestyle, the novel also then partially acts as an extended study of mental health, privilege, and subculture.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Between 1750 and 1830, historians of sexuality have argued for a revolution in the methods and purposes of regulating sexuality in the European-dominated communities of the United States and its colonial antecedents. Regulation of sexuality became privatized in the individual and institutions other than the state, resulting in a growing self-consciousness and claims of autonomy over sexuality. However, such changes happened more slowly outside of urban areas and American states never fully abandoned their claim to define or regulate sexuality. This was true even in the newly forming settler communities and states in the region between the Appalachian Mountains and Mississippi River. Drawing from legislative and judicial records from across four resulting settler states, Alabama, Indiana, Mississippi, and Ohio, this dissertation argues these settler states and settlers consistently attempted to create law and put it into practice to define, assess, and sometimes punish sexual behaviors and desires during the Early Republic (1787-1825). This legality of sexuality did not venture far from Euro-Christian traditions, particularly its grounding in the heterosexual, monogamous marriage contract. The legality was often patriarchal in conception, but ideas of women’s material and sexual dependence on men, as well as desires to reproduce well-orded families in the Euro-Christian model in the region, aided at least settler women in using the settler states as possible allies in sexuality related issues and encouraged settler states themselves to target settler men, not women, as needing state interference and punishment when it came to sexual behaviors and desires. All residents of the region could find themselves judged by the norms of this settler sexual legality, but both settler state law and prevailing attitudes among settlers meant freedom status and/or race could limit one’s access to a settler state to confirm one’s belief in the legality and thus one’s full acceptance into a settler community and state. Settlers, particularly those of European descent, were the primary population settler states wanted and needed to abide by their version of sexual order; these were truly settler states. In turn, the involvement of settler states in issues of sexuality helped implant and increase the authority and permanence of the settler states themselves in the region.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Since their inception in the late sixteenth century, French ballets de cour traditions have drawn characters from sources that include commedia dell’arte, Greek mythology, and fairy tales. These source materials have affected the stage presentation of characters in productions, including how they are costumed and what kinds of dances they perform. Dances and dance music for ballet de cour are also intimately connected with French court dance movement and music, including notions of character and affect associated with each dance. This thesis seeks to examine the interaction of music and physical elements involved in the creation of seventeenth-century theatrical character dances, including dance music, dance movement, and appropriate costuming. By examining theories of affect and embodied cognition with respect to common character archetypes, costuming, and musical storytelling devices, it is possible to form a connection between musical elements and theatrical personas. Musicians can subsequently use these connections to inform their performances of Baroque music for ballet de cour and other seventeenth-century French theatrical performances.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The global energy demand has increased significantly alongside the worldwide population in the last decade. The global energy demand has been met for years by carbon fuel-based sources, which has increased the pace of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. These emissions affect the environment in a significant proportion, which has led to different efforts from governments to slow down the pace of emissions. Consequently, alternative ways of generating electricity have been investigated to have more sustainable and "greener" sources destined for energy supply. One of the technologies that utilize clean energy resources and has been widely used is solar Photovoltaic (PV). Behind the fast-growing integration of this technology into distribution networks are government incentives and regulation policies, which have resulted in reduced costs for manufacturing and installations of PV systems. The PV system integration is forecasted to keep growing, but their interconnection with traditional power systems may endanger its regular operational performance. Higher levels of PV penetration might cause an adverse impact on the different components of the grid. The protection and voltage regulation devices existent on a traditional network are designed and configured to operate under a unidirectional power flow. The PV system interconnection causes a bi-directional power flow, which will affect those components. The conventional power system is propelled to transition to a more dynamic system able to operate with different renewable sources interconnected, and even allow the participation of consumers in energy market transactions. Planning is a crucial stage for utility operators in order to achieve a successful integration without endangering the electric network's reliability and safety. Each distribution network has a limit of maximum PV penetration which within, the presence of PV systems will not adversely affect the regular operation of the system and equipment throughout the feeder; this limit is known as hosting capacity (HC) or hosting limit. Research conducted by industry companies and academia focused on solar PV technology have developed planning tools and methods capable of determining the PV hosting limit. In the following thesis work three most used techniques for PV Hosting Limit estimation are studied:</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>1. Iterative Approach: This method is one of the most used, and it is based on performing repetitive power flows. It represents an easy method to estimate the hosting limit but has certain limitations regarding computational time and accuracy. These limitations are demonstrated with test cases.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>2. Sensitivity-Based Approach: This is a mathematical approach based on the Newton-Raphson power flow approach. It is a faster estimation approach compared with others but also has limitations caused by assumptions that are not tailored to distribution systems specifically. A detailed analysis is given by testing two different distribution systems.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>3. Stochastic-analysis framework: This approach provides a comprehensive solution to the PV hosting capacity since it considers different PV sizes and locations to evaluate the impact on performance criteria. It is based on simulation software to perform numerous power flow scenarios, changing the PV penetration, and location randomly. The final results show the number of violations in the voltage levels per node, and considers reverse power flow scenarios.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The three approaches are tested, and a detailed analysis is provided. The hosting limit is estimated with respect to the performance of indices or criteria since multiple factors have an impact on the final hosting capacity of a distribution system. However, the voltage is the most assessed criterion because it is the first one to be reached in the presence of High PV penetration. In all described approaches, the over-voltage is the parameter that restricts the PV hosting limit estimation. After the thorough analysis of the different approaches and the identification of limitations, the work in this thesis provided an alternative method to estimate the PV hosting limit. The proposed approach is an optimization-based method, which is based on the linearization of the traditional AC power flow equations. This allows a formulation based on linear programming when only the over-voltage criterion is considered. The objective is to maximize the PV power output that can be injected into a distribution network without causing adverse effects. The hosting capacity is assessed concerning three main factors: the voltage level, thermal rating limit of distribution lines, and reverse power flow condition. The method is validated and tested with two different distribution systems and compared with other approaches. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach offers similar solutions, while providing a balanced performance concerning the accuracy and computational time efficiency.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This treatise examines twenty-eight compositions written for clarinet choir by American composers published in the 21st century.  Works included were published between the dates of January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2019; all were originally written for clarinet choir, excluding arrangements, transcriptions, and compositions for small clarinet ensembles. Compositions included in this bibliography are intended to be performed by ensembles of varying skill levels, ranging from secondary school clarinet ensembles to graduate and professional clarinet choirs. The majority of these works are best suited for ensembles at the undergraduate level.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Thorough annotations of each score are provided, including background information about the work and the composer, required instrumentation, ranges for each part, technical challenges, and other and considerations. With this information, readers will hopefully be able to make informed decisions when programming music appropriate for their ensemble.  A brief contextual history of the clarinet choir is also included.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The intent of this document is to provide clarinetists and music educators with a resource to consult when programming contemporary music for a clarinet choir, and to promote future research into the clarinet choir and its repertoire, a topic with little exploration in academic writing.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study is to examine the recent reports of impacts on public lands in the United States due to increased use of the social media platform, Instagram, and the app’s geotagging feature. Critical political economy acts as the theoretical and methodological basis for this analysis, accompanied by critical textual analysis in the later chapters. This study begins by situating the historical context of the claims that public lands are being ‘loved to death’ by a review of the wilderness preservation history in the United States. In following the historical perspective, the critical political economy lens allowed for the analysis to probe deeper into the past and present underlying policy and regulatory decisions that may contribute to the Instagram effect. Primarily, this thesis analyzed the Instagram effect as it was reported in 63 online news articles about the recent Instagram effect on public lands. After probing the underlying political economic support structures of public lands and the media, this study analyzed the ownership and advertising support mechanisms of the sampled articles to determine what role production plays in prevailing ideologies surrounding the Instagram effect in the news, finding that the ‘pristine wilderness’ ideology exerts a great deal of dominance, as did pro-business ideologies. This thesis also examined sourcing choices and how the sources quoted in the articles impacted truth claims about the Instagram effect, finding that a reliance on predominantly government sources who worked for land management agencies narrowed the scope of the issue to only what is immediately visible. This narrowing served to shift blame for problems facing public lands to individuals, rather than larger structures with a few notable exceptions. Articles published in locally-owned, independent newspapers, one online source, and two national sources provided a counter viewpoint to the prevailing notion that Instagram users are ruining public lands.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) are third-party administrators that assist employers and insurers in managing prescription drug benefits. The practices of PBMs remain largely unregulated at the national level and lack transparency, despite their growing influence over the pharmaceutical market. This project offers insight into the complexity of the pharmaceutical supply chain in the U.S. by first detailing the context of which pharmacy benefit managers have evolved and fallen under scrutiny for their practices. Second, I characterize PBMs and the companies that contract out to them through a principal-agent relationship and find evidence to suggest that PBMs wield their drug formularies as imperfect agents. This is done by assessing the relationship between the three largest PBMs’ formularies and pharmaceutical costs by analyzing the drugs included on their yearly formulary plans and the National Average Drug Acquisition Cost (NADAC) of these drugs. Third, I explain the spread of PBM targeted regulatory legislation across the states through interest group pressure from a market adversary, PhRMA. To gain a market advantage, I argue that pharmaceutical manufacturers used their state-level influence to reduce the power of PBMs. I develop a Cox proportional hazards model to estimate the influence of PhRMA’s monetary contributions to state-level campaigns on the adoption rate of PBM regulatory policies by state governments from 2000-2013. Fourth, I assess the effectiveness of state-level maximum allowable cost (MAC) transparency regulations in reducing the PBM practice of spread pricing from 2013-2018. I rely on a difference-in-differences design to evaluate changes in the markup of reimbursement rates in states before and after legislation was enacted and find evidence that these regulations are effective in reducing the markup in reimbursements from state Medicaid programs.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Blood biochemistry profiles aid health assessment of marine turtles but knowledge of the influence of regional biological factors (e.g. habitat, diet) on marine turtle blood analyte values is limited. To investigate the influence of diet on blood chemistry values in juvenile green turtles (Chelonia mydas) we used carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes to provide a quantitative estimate of forage item proportions in green turtles feeding at two distinct areas (Bonefish Hole and South Flats) in Bimini, Bahamas. Blood samples were obtained from 13 turtles in Bonefish Hole (a mangrove tidal estuary) and 15 turtles in South Flats (an open water seagrass bed) in 2018. Sessile filter feeders contributed the largest proportion of diet in Bonefish Hole and seagrass contributed the highest proportion of diet in South Flats. Turtles at Bonefish Hole presented significantly lower cholesterol, total protein, phosphorus, triglycerides, and aspartate transaminase compared to South Flats. Across all turtles, those feeding primarily on red algae presented the highest uric acid and alkaline phosphatase and turtles with a seagrass-dominated diet had the highest cholesterol. Understanding dietary influence on blood biochemistry is a priority for green turtle conservation because it will help inform health and nutritional evaluations, and the trends reported can aid the interpretation of blood analyte values in marine turtle populations worldwide.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Every year, millions of Americans get sick from foodborne illness and it is estimated half of all reported instances occur at restaurants. To protect the public, regulators are encouraged to conduct restaurant inspections and disclose reports to consumers. However, inspection reporting format is inconsistent and typically contains information unclear to most consumers who often misinterpret the inspection results. Additionally, consumers are increasingly searching for this information in a digital context. Limited research explores inspection reports as communication tools. Using affect-as-information and ELM as theoretical frameworks, this experiment investigated how discrete emotions (e.g., disgust) conveyed through pictorial cues (i.e., emojis) influenced consumers’ processing of inspection reports. Participants, recruited from Amazon’s MTurk, were randomly assigned to one of six experimental conditions in a 3 (emoji: smiling vs. disgusted vs. none) x 2 (violation level: low vs. high) between-subjects factorial design. Then, completed a questionnaire regarding perceptions, attitudes, behavioral intentions, and cognitive processing of the message. Results revealed that, compared to text, disgusted face emojis increased risk perceptions and avoidance behavior. Additionally, violation valence altered risk perceptions and behavioral intent. In terms of emotion, smiling face emoji motivated participants to feel more emotions related to sanitation. In turn, positive feelings decreased elaboration likelihood. As predicted by ELM, involvement also predicted elaboration, such that participants who were highly involved with inspection reports elaborated more than those less involved. Involvement also moderated the relationship between emoji presented and elaboration. Practical implications are also discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation investigates the literary, cultural, and intellectual contexts of Galen’s Protrepticus.  In this work Galen seeks to persuade young men to cultivate an art or skill in order to have a successful life rather than depending on wealth, nobility, or physical beauty for fulfillment.  At the end of the work Galen attempts to discredit the athletic lifestyle and challenges the claims of athletic trainers who promise a fulfilling life to the young.  When the Protrepticus is placed in the context of the rhetorical education and display during the high Roman Empire, it reveals an erudite author trained in the sophistic showpieces typical of the era.  Furthermore, Galen’s engagement with athletics explores the tensions involved in the competition among members of the elite class in establishing cultural standing.  In addition to Galen’s aims of engaging with the literary and cultural concerns of his time, he composed this work as a learned, rhetorically charged critique of the Empiricist medical school.  For Galen, a shortcoming of Empiricists was their rejection of the need for presenting a logos, or explanatory account of causes, in the practice of medicine.  In reply to their position he composed a work in which logos, symbolized by the god Hermes, is praised and linked with the practice of art.  The Protrepticus, then, stands as an expression of Galen’s positions on rhetoric, athletic culture, epistemology, and medicine.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Afro-Brazilian martial art and dance form known as capoeira has spread extensively around the world in recent decades. Today, capoeira academies may be found worldwide in cities large and small, especially throughout the United States, Canada, Europe, and Japan. This thesis investigates the transnational study of capoeira, focusing on a capoeira contemporânea academy located in Tallahassee, Florida. Through participant-observation fieldwork, interviews with instructors and students, and musical analyses, I highlight the experiences of non-Brazilian practitioners teaching and learning capoeira and explore how these same individuals find meaning more broadly in their engagement with this Afro-Brazilian tradition. I examine how Tallahassee Capoeira participants negotiate their ties to notions of Afro-Brazilianness through axé, a malleable force of power that is inherent to capoeira’s practice. In a successful capoeira roda, or circle, capoeira players maximize the axé of the space by being fully engaged in the movements within the game and by participating in music making. Axé encompasses the capacities of resilience, adaptability, strength, and communal solidarity that define the idealized capoeira experience in all of its myriad manifestations. It is that sense of axé, from the traditional realms of the Afro-Brazilian martial art to the globalized markets of the international fitness industry, that weaves together this diverse cultural complex. Exploring the vitality of axé within capoeira’s transnational settings, with a particular concentration on Tallahassee Capoeira, is the focus of this thesis.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Spelling a complex English word is more difficult than reading it, suggesting that spelling requires a higher quality orthographic representation and a greater degree of word knowledge compared to reading. In the absence of a high-quality orthographic representation, spellers often rely on other information, such as phonological to orthographic encoding, to aid spelling. However, the quasi-regular nature of English orthography to phonology relations often render encoding strategies ineffective. This study examined whether alternative orthographic representations might facilitate the spelling of complex English words. Specifically, would English-Spanish bilingual university students benefit from orthographic similarities of English-Spanish cognates compared with non-cognate words when spelling complex words? </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Cognates are words that share similar spellings and meanings across languages and given the transparent nature of the Spanish orthography, they might help inform English spelling. Monolingual (n = 43) and bilingual students (n = 77) were asked to spell complex English words, half of which were Spanish cognates, with item-level spelling accuracy modeled using word-level (e.g., cognate status) and person-level (e.g., English monolingual vs. Spanish-English bilingual and prompting to consider Spanish spelling) predictors. Results indicate that bilinguals had a higher probability of spelling complex cognate words correctly compared to monolingual peers, and these results were not mediated by any significant prompting effects. Findings from this study expand an interdisciplinary framework of understanding bilinguals’ lexical access and strength of orthographic representations across languages.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>A Wedding of Jackals is a creative dissertation in poetry. It follows a queer speaker who, after the end of his marriage, tries and fails to restore a relationship with his estranged father. In evaluating and moving through these relationships, the speaker of A Wedding of Jackals struggles to separate his evolving understanding of love from his continuing experiences of loss. This struggle may have universal value, but it is a particularly queer dilemma in terms of what and whom we lose by coming out: if our understanding of love is so inflected by loves we have lost, the question for queer individuals becomes how we can say “love” again without also signifying grief.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>As demand for more efficient and higher-performing aerospace platforms increases there is a need to address challenges that have been left unsolved through a more comprehensive understanding of the complex flowfields and the underlying phenomena.  In current tactical aircraft design, one of the more complex flowfields encountered is the release of a store from an internal weapons bay.  The bay doors are opened to allow the release of an internal store, which subsequently leads to the formation of a shear layer between high-speed flow outside and the low-speed flow inside of the bay.  This shear layer spans the entire length of the weapon bay, resulting in a strong turbulent flow with intense aeroacoustic loading in and around the bay.  These aeroacoustic loads can lead to structural and acoustic vibrations that can affect the bay, bay components, and internal stores.  Previous studies have shown that the cavity flowfield has an effect on a store present in the cavity and that it can significantly alter the release of the store.  But these studies have not been able to draw substantial relations between the cavity flowfield and the unsteady release characteristics of a store leaving a cavity.  To fully study store release characteristics, 4 store configurations (changing length and fin span) were studied in the presence of a cavity (L/D of 4.5) at Mach 2. The analysis begins with the cavity pressure field with and without a store, the store forces and moments in the presence of the cavity, and store release trajectories, both simulated and experimental were analyzed.  From this study, it was shown that the cavity flowfield is impacted by the presence of the store, forces and moments acting on the store are strongly dependent on the store configuration and that the store release is dependent on the ejection characteristics of the release mechanism as well as the store configuration.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Hurricane Maria made landfall on the island of Puerto Rico in the early hours of September 20th, 2017. The unprecedented level of devastation combined with a slow-moving response and recovery created an environment of inefficiency and vulnerability on the island. This study aims to identify the events before, during, and after the storm that contributed to such a disastrous response and recovery. Using path dependency and punctuated equilibrium to examine the archival data and grounded analysis to analyze the interview data, major themes were extracted and connected with actions and decisions that took place. A lack of preparedness and the divisive nature of the relationship between the islands’ government and the federal government proved to be extremely problematic for the response and recovery. In addition, Puerto Rico’s infrastructure was already compromised and the past decade of government corruption and financial crises made the island susceptible to destruction. I argue that an intersection of blame avoidance, financial and resource constraints, and unclear or misplaced roles and responsibilities caused a second punctuated event, leading to the disastrous post-disaster environment we have witnessed</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Alcohol and other drug use is understood to be one of the most stigmatized activities in the world (Room, et al., 2001). Substance use disorder (SUD) stigma has been shown to impact self-identity and self-esteem, present a psychological obstacle to seeking treatment (Pickard, 2017) and delay the onset of treatment (Broadus et al, 2010). Given that 19% of music therapists (MTs) work in mental health settings (American Music Therapy Association, 2018) and will likely encounter individuals with SUD, it is imperative that MTs understand the impact of SUD stigma. The purpose of this study is to explore the occurrence of SUD-related presentations that appear in music therapy national conference programs from the years 2009 to 2019. There were 37 SUD-related presentations and 142 other mental health-related presentations that met the inclusion criteria. Results indicate that 26% of all mental health topics that were presented at national conferences discuss substance use and that 2 out of the 37 SUD-related presentations included the terms “stigma” and “discrimination”, which makes up approximately 1% of all mental health-related presentations. Results from this study suggest that the number of SUD stigma presentations does not reflect the high demand of quality and evidence-based treatment needed by individuals with SUDs and the need for more presentations to address SUD stigma at national conferences.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Hydrogen is an element with increasing importance as we shift towards green and renewable energy sources. As such, the physical and chemical properties of hydrogen and materials which help store or produce hydrogen are necessary for the advancement of new technologies. Here, the surface and interface chemistry are explored in three systems using solid-state 1H, 11B, 29Si, and 6,7Li Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and complementary techniques. The results include the reaction mechanism determination of the Cobalt-nanocrystal-assembled hollow nanoparticles (Co-HNP) catalyst for hydrogen gas production, the quantification of surface silanol species on a mesoporous silica encapsulated platinum nanoparticle for hydrogenation, the study of the presence of hydrogen spillover phenomenon in heterogeneous catalysts, and the lithiation mechanism and failing causes of chloranilic acid electrode for lithium-ion batteries. These studies give insight into the behavior of hydrogen in different systems which are essential to the shift in green chemistry.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The follicular epithelium (FE) in the Drosophila melanogaster ovary is an excellent model system to study epithelial  processes and behaviors, such as cell-cell communication, cell cycle regulation, and epithelial morphogenesis. The growth and morphogenesis of the FE is closely coordinated with the oocyte via cell-cell communication, similar to how epithelial-mesenchymal interactions drive vertebrate tissue development. The FE in the genetically tractable Drosophila system is therefore an excellent model for the study of vertebrate epithelial behaviors such as growth regulation, morphogenesis, tissue homeostasis, as well as tumorigenesis and metastasis. The focus of the research here is the characterization of non-typical epithelial behaviors in the Drosophila FE using cell- and tissue-specific genetic manipulation and confocal microscopy. In the first part of this thesis, I present a detailed characterization of a novel non-typical epithelial process in the FE termed ‘patency’, characterized by the transient opening of intercellular spaces between follicle cells that could assist in the trans-epithelial transport of lipids across the FE. Images from Immunostaining and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that during mid-vitellogenesis, tricellular contacts between follicle cells open and create transient channels across the entire epithelial monolayer. I found consistent temporal and spatial patterns of patency in the Drosophila FE. I also show that the transcription factor Ttk69 restricts the temporal range of patency, and the underlying dorsal-anterior signals which use the Epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Decapentaplegic (Dpp) ligand influence the spatial pattern of patency. Together, the data from this study show that patency is a novel epithelial property in a classic model system, highlighting the use of the FE as a model to study conserved epithelial processes such as tricellular junction dynamics, and trans-epithelial transport. Development of the Drosophila FE is also controlled by growth regulatory pathways that couple nutrient availability to development and regulate cell growth. In the second part of my thesis, using the Drosophila follicle cell system, I investigated the effects of inducing differential growth in the endocycling cells. I show by mosaic analysis that induction of higher growth rate in a subset of endocycling follicle cells results in a non-autonomous response which is characterized by smaller wild-type cells of the epithelium in response to this induced differential growth. Here, we termed this non-typical epithelial response Non-autonomous Cellular Compaction (NCC), wherein the wildtype cells are reduced in size, instead of undergoing overcrowding-induced extrusion from the epithelial monolayer. The NCC cells present lower cell and nuclear volumes, as well as reduced protein synthesis rates, potentially in response to lower levels of activation of the insulin pathway. We found using FACS analysis and confocal microscopy that the DNA content in the NCC cells is not altered, indicating that the rate of endocycling is maintained. Overall, our data reveals a non-autonomous, non-typical epithelial response to differential growth involving cell size plasticity in the endocycling FE. Most mammalian tissues are highly heterogeneous in nature, and the study of non-autonomous effects such as NCC have both scientific and medical significance. Complementary to NCC, a non-autonomous increase in cell size has been previously reported in response to a local loss of tissue volume in the endocycling Drosophila FE, a process called compensatory cellular hypertrophy or CCH. A model was proposed, involving the recruitment of mechanotransducers for the increased growth of the CCH cells. In the last part of my research, I explored the roles of a mechanotransducer, No mechanoreceptor potential C (NompC), previously identified from a screen, for regulating growth of the endocycling follicle cells to generate CCH. Using mosaic analysis in the endocycling epithelium, I show that NompC does not appear to have a direct role in the growth of the epithelial cells, but affects other epithelial properties such as nuclear placement within the cells. This study reveals that the CCH response may indeed be more complex and involve multiple mechanotransducers. Overall, my research characterizes a set of non-typical epithelial behaviors in the classic Drosophila melanogaster FE model, including patency for oocyte lipid uptake, and non-autonomous cell size plasticity, NCC, in response to differential growth in the endocycling FE. This study creates a platform for further research into conserved epithelial behavior, trans-epithelial transport mechanisms, non-autonomous growth regulation, and cell size plasticity, as well as providing a broader characterization of the widely used FE model system. Together, the epithelial properties highlighted in my research now makes these non-typical epithelial behaviors accessible for genetic dissection, presenting the Drosophila FE as a model to study various vertebrate disease states that share these epithelial properties.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The inclusion of reinforcing particles in materials used for AM allows for the fabrication of tailored multifunctional parts with improved mechanical properties, thermal conductivity, reduced coefficient of thermal expansion, improved dielectric permittivity and controllable resonance frequency. These techniques allow for the production of customized products with tunable functionalities for specific applications, for example, materials with conductive metal particles such as copper or silver can be used to print conductive traces for use in circuits. With the advancement of multi-material printing and the addition of reinforcing structures to existing polymers (e.g. 0D-3D particles) the functionality, strength, and design possibilities are endless. Fiber orientation control in printed composites can be complex due to the numerous forces acting on the composite material, forcing the fibers to align with the direction of material flow, particularly for extrusion-based additive manufacturing processes. Since extrusion-based AM relies on shear forces in a convergent nozzle to achieve fiber orientation, they can only be oriented in the direction of material flow or deposition, thus making it anisotropic. However, in order to manipulate the fiber orientation in flow, and provide the printed part with controllable fiber directionality, the shear forces acting on the material need to be overcome by the utilization of external forces. 1D Fibers (i.e. Nickel nanorods, 10- 50 um length) have been successfully synthesized and utilized in reinforcing polymer-inks to process as a Direct Printing application (via high-precision nScrypt machine). Previous attempts to randomly introduce reinforcing fibers via additive manufacturing methods have raised many limitations and issues with regards to fiber size, non-uniformity, fiber directionality, and the ability of the matrix material to hold its shape after deposition. This dissertation investigates the effects of using an externally applied magnetic field (40 mT) and novel nozzle designs with a composite containing ferromagnetic nickel nanowires during extrusion for real-time fiber orientation control. A testbed apparatus was first implemented to simulate the flow in an extrusion nozzle and to visually study the fundamental mechanism of 1D nanoparticles in flow. The effect of geometrical channel constraints (e.g. convergent vs. divergent nozzles) was explored based on Stokes’ theorem, Hagen-Poiseuille equations and experimental observations on the testbed. Divergent nozzles with inflection angles of 45 degrees for use on extrusion-based printers were designed based on the study and used to fabricate composites with improved mechanical properties, thus proving the advantage of in-situ fiber orientation control. Fiber orientations of 90 degrees to the direction of flow was achieved using a magnetic field, while a range of orientations between 0 degrees and 90 degrees can be obtained with the use of a divergent channel with the appropriate design.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Those in the helping professions, such as therapy and education, actively strive to become aware of their bias, human behavior, and personal limitations. They also attempt to understand the worldview of their diverse clients and learning appropriate and culturally sensitive intervention strategies and skills when working with culturally diverse clients. A Conceptual content analysis approach was used to examine cultural competency-based sessions presented at American Music Therapy Association National Conferences between the years of 2010 and 2017. More specifically, the researcher explored the following question: Do AMTA conferences provide an adequate amount of sessions on cultural competency related to multicultural languages, ethnicity, and gender? Results showed a total of 1671 sessions were presented at AMTA National Conference between 2017-2017. Of those sessions, 59 (3.5%) were cultural competency-based sessions presented on multicultural languages, ethnicity, gender, or general cultural competency within the field of music therapy. Between 2010-2017, 11 sessions were presented on cultural competence related to ethnicity, nine sessions presented on cultural competence specifically related to gender, one session presented on cultural competence related to multicultural languages, and 36 sessions presented on cultural competence as it relates to the field of music therapy.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Recently in the United States, there has been an increasing pace of roundabouts installation. Following that, several studies are being conducted to ensure safe and efficient roundabout operation. To study roundabout’s operational efficiency, data on traffic activity at the roundabouts have to be collected and analyzed. Most of the data has been collected by recording videos at the intersection, extract events from the video and analyze the information from the videos. Capacity determination has followed similar procedures since it requires determination of accepted gaps, rejected gaps and follow-up times. The manual approach to capacity determination, has been both time consuming and prone to human errors. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>On the other hand, computer vision techniques has widely been used in many fields including transportation Engineering. In transportation, the techniques have been used to count vehicles, detect congestion and incidents, and in speed-related studies. With this growing application in Transportation Engineering, it is important to extend the applications to roundabouts’ capacity determination. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study aimed at developing an algorithm, which would use the deep learning models to determine the roundabouts’ capacity. Along with this main objective, the study focused on three goals. Firstly, the study aimed at determining which object detection model among the known existing models would be more efficient for the algorithm. Secondly, examined the applicability of such algorithm under different traffic, geometric as well as environmental characteristics. Different videos with varying attributes like poor background illumination, higher percentage of heavy vehicles and roundabout with narrow splitter island were used. Finally, the study used videos recorded at different camera height under the same conditions at the same time, to study which camera height is more suitable to adopt when conducting data collection and analysis at roundabouts. The camera height is worth studying since occlusion is more pronounced to videos recorded at lower altitudes and poor vehicle detections may be noticeable to videos recorded at upper height since most of the pre-trained models uses images of vehicles taken at lower height.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>From the results obtained, Faster-RCNN ResNet101 model produced better estimates of the gap-acceptance parameters than other object detection models and was considered more suitable for detecting vehicles at roundabouts. These observations led to the conclusion that, the Faster-RCNN ResNet101 model is more appropriate as an object detection model for the accepted gaps. The model was therefore adopted as the object detection model of the developed algorithm and used for the rest of the analysis.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In addition, the test for robustness showed that the algorithm generated significantly similar observations of accepted and rejected gaps to the ground-truth values. On the other hand, the algorithm generated significantly dissimilar follow-up time observations to the ground truth. Due to these results, it was reasonable to consider the algorithm as robust when determining the accepted and rejected gaps under different traffic as well as environmental conditions. However, since the results did not favor the algorithm when determining the follow-up time, the reasonable conclusion was that the algorithm needs more improvement to significantly determine this parameter.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The study of the videos recorded at different camera height revealed that when the algorithm was used for the lower height video, only the accepted gap observations showed significant similarity to the ground truth. On the contrary, when the algorithm was used to the video at lower altitude, only the rejected gaps showed significant similarity to the ground truth.  This observation suggest that somewhere along the middle there is an optimum camera location that could bring better results for both accepted and rejected gaps. Such height will have an advantage of avoiding vehicle occlusion without jeopardizing the detection quality. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Therefore, the study suggest further studies using the camera at different heights to determine the optimum camera height when the pre-trained object detection models are used. On the other hand, since higher altitude camera position is preferred to avoid occlusion, the study advise to train the detection models using images captured by a camera at a higher altitude to improve the quality of results. Finally yet importantly, different object detection models could be tested under different scenarios to determine which models performs better under which conditions. With this approach, a more robust algorithm could be obtained that uses different detection models under different conditions.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>While this dissertation was designed to respond to an exigence in scholarship attending to whether students composing texts that are digital and multimodal are influenced in their decisions by classical rhetorical concepts, it was also shaped by a timely if provocative message shared on the professional listserv for writing program administration to which many in the field of rhetoric and composition subscribe. The contention in the message was that the classical rhetoric commonly taught in schools, including on the college level, does not seem to be helping students develop as writers. Thus, to investigate the potential role that classical concepts have on students composing digital multimodal texts, I articulated the following research questions:</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>1) Which, if any, classical rhetorical concepts play a role in students’ decisions as they design, draft, and deliver a digital multimodal text?</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>2) When, where, and how do these concepts affect students’ decisions in their composition processes? In other words, how and to what ends are these concepts used?</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>3) Are these concepts, if employed by students, used explicitly in decision-making processes?</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>4) If, and when, these concepts are employed, are they embraced in their traditional configuration, repurposed, or shaped into a combination of both? How, and to what ends?</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To answer these questions, I employed a case study methodology: working with three participants, I followed each across the arc of a digital multimodal project, from before its formal introduction in class to after submission of the final draft. I conducted four interviews with each participant, and, after the course had concluded, I followed up with a brief questionnaire to clarify participants’ prior instruction in classical rhetoric. In analyzing my data, I employed two methods: first, grounded theory as an inductive means of discerning how and where classical rhetoric seemed at work as students made decisions; and second, after completing the grounded theory coding, a deductive coding scheme that applied fifteen classical concepts to the data.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>My findings, in light of my research questions, suggest four prevalent patterns in the relationship between classical rhetoric concepts and how students understand and utilize them in composing digital multimodal texts. First, participants largely engaged classical concepts implicitly, seeming to employ them intuitively, which suggests the significance of a rhetorical attitude, or unconscious, embodied beliefs that predispose a student to act rhetorically even if they’re not articulating rhetorical terminology to themselves. Second, classical concepts are porous and malleable, which lent themselves to being taken up so implicitly by participants, with students often pulling on more than one concept at a time. Third, implicit use of classical concepts by participants points to rhetorical agency, where participants made decisions in light of the project expectations, but also in answer to their own desires and goals, such that participants’ decisions resembled the strategies embraced in do-it-yourself (DIY) rhetorics. Last, imitatio emerged as a classical concept implicitly recurring across the cases, gesturing to the potential for other classical concepts to be present, if repurposed and not traditionally recognizable, as well. Thus, while evidence of explicit reliance on rhetorical concepts was meager, evidence of implicit reliance on rhetorical concepts, which had become mortised into participants’ composing processes, was rich and provocative.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Dicyclopenta[a,d]cyclooctene (5-8-5) ring system is a privileged scaffold found in over 30 di- and sesterterpene natural products (e.g fusicoccin and ophiobolins). These natural products have gained attention due to their interesting biological properties. The limitation of exploring the potential of these small molecules is that modular routes to synthesize these 5-8-5 carbotricycles is underdeveloped.  This is due to the fact that the majority of the synthetic strategies have been directed towards specific natural products, semi-synthesis, or long methodology routes.  In addition, the method used to study biological structure-function properties has been via semi-synthesis, which limits the scope. Our group has developed a rapid and modular route to this 5-8-5 core, that can be performed on gram scale. We have shown that we can make this 5-8-5 scaffold via a photochemical cycloisomerization cascade reaction.  This route provides a rapid entry to this particular 5-8-5 privileged scaffold, where functionality can easily be modified early on in the synthesis with simple starting materials.  We have further expanded the utility of this 5-8-5 ring system by developing scalable routes to targeted peripheral functional groups.  These functional groups can be useful for both as a functional handle and functional groups that are part of several different fusicoccin and ophiobolin natural products.  This peripheral functionality is also important to be able to begin to study structure-function relations of fusicoccin and 14-3-3 PPIs.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In literary history, the study of the relation between the colonial worlds and their metropoles tends to follows unilateral trajectory. For instance, while the influence of French literature on the cultural productions of its colonies has been widely studied, less has been said about how works produced by colonial subjects have bent the arc of metropolitan French literature. Entitled “From Hainteny to Negritude: Analysis of the Transnational Flow of Literary Currents between “Indocean” and Francophone Literatures,” this dissertation looks at the ways in which indigenous poetic genres from the Indian Ocean, such as hainteny or sirandanes, have repeatedly influenced French literature, from the moment of first contact between Malagasy and French peoples in the seventeenth century to the contemporary postcolonial era. I analyze how Malagasy and Indian Ocean literatures fit into the broader sphere of sub-continental literatures in French, paying particular attention to the triangular exchange of aesthetic practices between the Indian Ocean, continental Africa and the French metropole. My research spans over many centuries of literatures in French, and over two continents. The corpus includes Chansons Madécasses (1787), by Reunion-born writer Evariste-Désiré Deforges-Parny (1753-1814); Charles Baudelaire’s Les fleurs du mal (1857) and Le Spleen de Paris (1868); and the complete oeuvre of Malagasy writer Jean-Joseph Rabéarivelo (1903-1937). Read in concert, these texts highlight the influence of autochthonous literature from colonial spaces at the main turning points of modern Francophone literature (both metropolitan and [post-] colonial), namely Romanticism, Symbolism, and Negritude. Specifically, I argue that because of the movement of authors between France and its Indian Ocean colonies, Indian Ocean folkloric productions introduced thematic and aesthetic innovations that helped propel French literature into modernity.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The dissertation takes a genealogical approach to disentangle the bilateral exchanges between the “minor literature” (Deleuze and Guattari, 1986) of the Indian Ocean and other canonical genres of Francophone literature. I am interested in the connections between and among literary forms, their currents, movements, and transformations. I therefore apply a trans-historical and transnational approach to Malagasy writing in order to embrace the Édouard Glissant’s ideal of “relation,” which is the aggregation of all the cultural particularities that occurs at the point of contact between communities. My approach that will contribute needed scholarly attention to the Indian Ocean islands (the Mascarenes and Madagascar) as an important and often understudied place of literary innovation.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Pre-sleep protein has been shown to improve overnight muscle protein synthesis, muscle size and strength, and muscle recovery. However, all pre-sleep protein studies to date have utilized dairy-based protein sources. There is currently a large interest in alternative protein sources, such as plant-based protein. Yet, there is no evidence regarding the efficacy of plant-based proteins consumed pre-sleep. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>PURPOSE: Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare animal-based vs. plant-based pre-sleep protein on muscle recovery as measured by blood markers of muscle damage and inflammation, metabolism, and muscle function. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>METHODS: Twenty-seven males performed a bout of eccentric exercise (ECC) for the knee extensors (ext) and flexors (flex) in the morning, then consumed 40 g of either whey hydrolysate (WH, n = 9), whey isolate (WI, n = 6), rice and pea combination (RP, n = 6), or placebo (PL, n = 6) 30 min pre-sleep. The ECC protocol consisted of 5 sets of 15 repetitions of maximal eccentric voluntary contractions for ext and flex of each leg, respectively. Catered meals (15% PRO, 55% CHO, 30% Fat) were provided to participants two days pre-ECC, the day of ECC, and the following two days during follow-up testing to standardized nutrition. Plasma creatine kinase (CK), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and C-reactive protein (CRP) was measure at pre, post, +4, +6, +24, +48, and +72-hrs post-ECC. Isometric and isokinetic maximal voluntary contraction (ISOM and ISOK, respectively) was measured at pre, post, +24, +48, and +72-hrs post-ECC. Subjective muscle soreness, thigh circumference, and HOMA-IR was measured at pre, +24, +48, and +72-hrs post-ECC. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>RESULTS: CK increased at +4-hrs post-ECC and remained elevated at all time points compared to baseline (n = 25, p &lt; 0.001) and was significantly greater at +72-hrs compared to all other time points (p &lt; 0.001). IL-6 increased at +6-hrs (n = 25, p = 0.002) with no other time differing from baseline. CRP increased immediately post-ECC (n = 25, p = 0.035) with no other time differing from baseline. There were no group x time interactions for any blood marker. ISOMext was reduced after ECC (p = 0.001) and remained reduced until returning to baseline at +72 hrs. ISOMflex was reduced after ECC and remained reduced at +72-hrs (p &lt; 0.001). ISOK60ext and ISOK60flex were reduced after ECC and remained reduced at +72-hrs (p &lt; 0.001). ISOK180ext and ISOK180flex were reduced after ECC and remained reduced at +72-hrs (p &lt; 0.05). ISOK300ext was reduced after ECC (p &lt; 0.05) and remained reduced until returning to baseline at +72 hrs. ISOK300flex was reduced at +24-hrs and remained reduced at +72-hrs (p &lt; 0.05). There were no group x time interactions for any muscle function marker. Muscle soreness increased post-ECC (p &lt; 0.001) and did not return to baseline. There were no group x time interactions for muscle soreness. Thigh circumference (p = 0.456) and HOMA-IR (p = 0.396) did not change post-ECC. IL-10 concentrations were below the valid detectable limits of the assay used, thus were not included in the analyses. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that middle-aged men consuming 1.08 ± 0.02 g/kg/day PRO did not recover well from damaging exercise at +72-hrs and that pre-sleep protein, regardless of source, did not aid in muscle recovery when damaging exercise was performed in the morning. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Individuals should consume a sufficient bolus of high-quality protein in close proximity to their exercise session, whenever that session may be. Further, pre-sleep protein consumption can be utilized to consume enough protein throughout the day.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Kennedy Space Center and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (KSC/CCAFS) experience thunderstorms on an almost daily basis during the warm season (May through September). Most thunderstorms occur in the afternoon and are accurately forecast with respect to timing and location. However, on rare occasions, thunderstorms form at night with no apparent cause. These unexpected events can catch forecasters off-guard, leading to missed lightning watches and unexpected dangerous situations. The goal of the present research is to address the lack of knowledge of these unexplained nocturnally forming lightning events near KSC/CCAFS and provide forecasters with additional information about the events. The study area is a rectangle centered on the Space Shuttle Roll-Out at KSC and oriented parallel to Florida’s coast. Lightning flash data from the Earth Networks Total Lightning Network (ENTLN) and the National Lightning Detection Network, and radar data from the National Weather Service Melbourne (NWS MLB) were used to identify case nights and null nights (i.e., nights with an unexplained nocturnal thunderstorm and nights without, respectively), and generate a climatology of case nights. From sounding data, 24 different variables quantifying atmospheric moisture, hydrostatic stability, and wind shear were investigated to identify a possible discriminating parameter between case nights and null nights. Results showed that July had a greater occurrence of case nights, and the greatest frequency of first flash times was at 0500 UTC, about 5 h after local sunset. The results also revealed case nights had slightly greater potential for convection, but unfortunately there was no variable that had a statistically significant difference at the 95% confidence interval between case nights and null nights.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Abbotsford 7.5’ quadrangle resides entirely within the Dadeville complex, a volcanic arc complex located in the Alabama-Georgia Inner Piedmont region of the southern Appalachian mountain belt system. The Dadeville complex has been described as a fault bounded, allocthonous, volcanic arc remnant consisting of predominantly metavolcanic and metaplutonic rocks that sit in the core of an open, northeast-plunging, regional synform called the Tallassee synform. Detailed structural mapping of the Abbotsford quadrangle has revealed the location of the core of the Tallassee synform as it traces into areas of Georgia that have never been systematically mapped. Field relations and lithologic interpretations have established two major geologic units present in the quadrangle. The Franklin Gneiss, a massive tabular granitic batholith was observed to intrude areas of the structurally lowest and oldest unit within the Dadeville complex, the Ropes Creek Amphibolite. Through petrographic evidence such as the pervasive microcline within the gneissic samples, and geochemical analyses which confirmed high K values and a strongly calc-alkaline affinity; it was concluded that the Franklin Gneiss is chemically correlative to the Chattasofka Creek Gneiss and the Rock Mills Granite Gneiss described in Alabama. It is also chemically distinct from the second major granitic intrusion into the Dadeville complex, the Camp Hill Gneiss. This provides evidence for two distinct periods of magmatism during the Taconic orogeny. Trace element analyses performed on the Franklin Gneiss have revealed signatures consistent with previous studies and with interpretations for the intrusion’s formation in an arc type environment (enrichments in LILEs, depletions in HFSEs, Nb/Ta anomaly, Pb enrichment) with magma generation partially driven by the subduction of oceanic Iapetan crust beneath extended continental crust. These results coupled with previous geochronological studies of units in the Dadeville complex all point to a B-Type subduction model for the southern Appalachian Taconic orogeny. Further detailed structural mapping eastward into Georgia could help to support an emerging hypothesis for the expansion of the surficial area of the Dadeville volcanic arc complex.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>While rollover crashes are the least frequent types of crash, around one third of vehicle occupant fatalities occurs in rollover crashes. Rollover crashes are usually associated with multiple impacts which result in complex interactions between occupants and a passenger compartment. Compared to the numerous experimental and computational studies on the rollover in passenger cars, efforts on bus rollover safety are far lagging behind. Based on a literature review, available studies on a bus rollover safety have mainly focused on structural integrity rather than considering occupant responses in their assessment. However, detailed information about the characteristics of occupant responses is lacking. Additionally, to design the effective occupant protection systems and safety evaluation tools, understanding the vehicle-occupant interaction is essential. There have been A few field data studies that provide some insights into occupant injuries (e.g., severity and distribution of injuries) using post-crash data, however, their results show a qualitative assessment rather than a quantitative assessment of occupant kinematics and injury risk. The main goal of this research was to characterize the vehicle and occupant responses during the rollover crash using both experimental and numerical methods.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Two different experimental rollover tests include a modified dolly rollover (MDR) and tilt table (TT) tests were conducted using a similar bus and anthropomorphic test device (ATD) configurations to understand the effects of vehicle kinematics on occupant injuries. In each test, a 2-point and 3-point belted 50th percent male Hybrid III ATDs were used and the injury risks were measured for different parts of body. Next, two different computational models were developed to further understand the effects of test parameters and structural performance on injury outcomes. The full-scale finite element (FE) model of the bus were simulated in LS-DYNA and validated against experimental data. Because, the Hybrid III was originally designed for frontal crashes, the FE model of the EuroSID-2re, which his developed for the side impact crashes, was also implemented. Then, a series of FE simulations were conducted, and the structural deformation and occupant injury risk were quantified. Lastly, to obtain the more realistic characteristics of bus rollover crashes, the real-world rollover accidents were simulated using the multibody dynamic (MBD) model of the bus in PC-Crash software. An application of the combined MBD and FE simulations has been presented to and the results of the two crash tests were compared with the results of accident reconstruction. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The results of this study showed that the most common impact mechanism among these rollover scenarios is the impact between the bus’s cantrail (roof connection to the sidewall) and ground that caused similar lateral deformation patterns. Also, unlike the passenger cars where the vertical roof deformation can significantly increase the occupant injuries, the intrusion of the bus passenger compartment was not identified as a source of any major injury. Furthermore, The highest head, neck, and chest injury risk were predicted during the MDR simulation where the ATD was partially ejected through the shattered side window. The findings of this research can benefit automakers who seek to improve the effectiveness of structural safety systems of the bus and regulatory agencies seeking to develop the vehicle tests targeting the safety of the passengers in the bus rollover crashes.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Despite being a known benthic biological hotspot and environmental ecotone, the DeSoto Canyon has hardly been characterized for its benthic diversity and community structure. Moreover, it is a known deposition and impact zone due to hydrocarbon pollution from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill (DwH). As part of a project to evaluate the impact of the DwH and characterize the spatial and temporal ecological patterns, macrofauna (seafloor-inhabiting organisms 300 - 500 μm) were sampled within the canyon and on the adjacent slope. Five stations within the canyon, sampled 2012 – 2014, and two stations on the adjacent open slope sampled between 2013 – 2014, were used for analysis of interannual dynamics, and temporal variability in the face of the DwH. Elevated abundance was observed at the start of the time-series for overall macrofauna and deposit feeder abundance. However, diversity metrics showed no difference within stations among timepoints. Community and feeding guild structure varied by station, as expected, but showed no statistical difference among time points within a station. Cluster analyses of structure showed grouping more by station than by time point, but some temporal variability was noted in temporal trajectory overlays. Metrics designed for measuring oil contamination impact and overall community stress including the benthic polychaete/amphipod ratio, feeding guild abundance, macrofaunal indicators designed from the DwH, and community dispersion, generally exhibited a paucity of evidence of impact, both yearly and with site-to-site comparisons. This suggests low to moderate levels of impact in the canyon consistent with the low deposition of hydrocarbons in the canyon documented by previous studies, timing of sampling, and quick recovery of canyon foraminifera. Taken together these results suggest relatively low levels of temporal variability within the DeSoto Canyon, with little evidence of the influence of oil on these sites within the studied time range. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To examine spatial variability, macrofauna from 13 stations along the canyon wall and axis, and on the adjacent slope, were sampled along with sediment, terrain, and water mass parameters. Within the canyon, abundance and species richness decreased with depth, while evenness increased. Cluster analysis identified three depth-related groups: stations at 464 – 485 m, 669 – 1834 m, and &gt; 2000 m, within the canyon that conformed to previously established bathymetric boundaries for the broader Gulf of Mexico. Distance-based linear modeling (DISTLM) identified community structure within the canyon most related to water parameters, especially fluorometry and oxygen saturation, with some models also including sediment organic carbon or topographical slope.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Canyon wall abundances were higher than those of the canyon axis (center) or adjacent slope. Community structure differed between all three habitat types. Ordination of community structure suggests a longitudinal pattern that potentially tracks with increasing sea-surface chlorophyll that occurs in the eastward direction across the northern GOM. As indicated by univariate tests and Canyon and slope differences may result from seasonal water masses entrained by canyon topography characterized by high salinity, oxygen saturation, fluorometry, and turbidity. Higher fluorescence and turbidity in the canyon did not translate into higher sediment organic matter. Current flushing along canyon wall channels and the canyon axis may explain the low organic matter. Differences in abundance and structure between the canyon wall and axis may result from microhabitat heterogeneity due to potential hydrocarbon seepage, organically enriched sediment deposits along channels, or remnant influence from the DwH spill.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The larger Gulf of Mexico is a recognized biogeographic province, but few studies have characterized the inter-regional variation of the benthos. The Biodiversity of the Gulf of Mexico (BioGoMx) database, which contains occurrence information of extant species in the GOM, allows for the analysis of benthic mollusc diversity and distribution across the entire basin. For analyses, the GOM was split in 4 geographic sectors (NE, NW, SE, and SW) and 6 depth classes (inshore, upper shelf, lower shelf, upper slope, lower slope, and abyssal plain) for a total of 24 geographic-depth polygons. The northern GOM contained higher species richness than the south, the east more than the west. Species richness decreased with depth with maxima occurring on the upper shelf. Bivalves and gastropods dominated each geographic sector and depth class, together comprising &gt;90% of the molluscan species richness. Assemblages were structured by depth more than by geographic sector. GOM molluscs fell into 3 broad depth-based assemblages: the inshore and continental shelf, the continental slope, and the abyssal plain species combined with the western lower slope. Geographically, taxonomic distinctness analysis indicated most NE depths fell below average distinctness and by depth, polygons above and below the continental shelf break were frequently distinct. Cluster analysis based on taxonomic dissimilarity agreed with the analyses based on the species occurrence data. Mollusc feeding strategies largely followed estimated proportions for the larger Atlantic. Carnivory and suspension feeding were the most common with grazing, herbivory, and parasitism following behind. Chemosymbiotic species were also prevalent due to the widespread occurrence of cold seep habitats. Further taxonomic research and more sampling are needed to determine patterns at finer scales.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Overall, the GOM remains an ecologically distinct basin on temporal scales, and on spatial scales both large and small. Further research is required to substantiate the lack of overall temporal change in benthic fauna and the distinct spatial uniqueness and heterogeneity that takes place in local ecosystems such as marine canyons and across the entire basin. The patterns observed also offer a baseline of comparison for future studies, and vital information for policymakers and stakeholders, especially in the face of ongoing resource extraction (e.g., fossil fuels) that occurs in the deep Gulf of Mexico.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>My aim here is to offer and defend an account of forgiving, which I’ll call ‘the charity account’: to forgive is to declare an enemy a friend (with respect to some wrong). That phrase employs a few semi-technical terms that need clarification, so in §3, I’ll outline the account of love on which my account of forgiving depends, and in §4, I’ll explain what I mean by ‘declare’, ‘enemy’, ‘friend’, and ‘with respect to some wrong’. But before that, I’ll also need to explain what I mean by “an account of forgiving” (§1), since I’m not concerned here with some of what occasionally goes by the name ‘forgiving’ (or ‘forgiveness’). I’ll then give two arguments in §2 to explain why I think the major contemporary accounts of forgiving have not yet captured the phenomenon successfully, and to motivate the general shape of the charity account. I’ll conclude by noting a few salient applications of the account in §5.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Diodorus Siculus composed a universal history, the Bibliotheke, covering the origins of humanity down to the events of the year 60/59 B.C. sometime before the fateful battle of Actium (31 B.C.). Although fifteen of his forty original books survive in full, his treatment of Hellenistic history after the battle of Ipsus (301 B.C.) and the rise of the Roman empire can only be gleaned from quotations preserved in later anthologies and epitomes. This dissertation presents a new evaluation of these fragments that recontextualizes Diodorus’ assessment of the Ptolemaic and Roman empires in light of a more nuanced understanding of the historiographical aims and method of the Bibliotheke. The universal scope of the work is best understood not only as a consequence of the totalizing political discourse of the age but also the historian’s appropriation of its imperial ideologies for history itself. For Diodorus, human political life unfolds within patterns discernable through a synthesis of the past, and the Bibliotheke, thus, serves as a guide for contemporary and future readers who aspire to leadership. The text’s ubiquitous themes reveal that a successful regime is achieved only when its elite institutions are organized in such a way as to encourage the emulation of good deeds and the avoidance of evil, assimilating the historian’s own general task into particular social structures.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This artistic practice based inquiry, modeled after Chinese cases, is grounded in Taoist philosophy, personal story, and commentary. It is about the practice of contemplative art making as research as/in resilience told through the experiences of students in a doctoral/graduate art education program. It is a story of resistance and transformation that brings to light a holistic Way in doctoral and graduate art education that has the potential to privilege diverse ways of being, living, learning, and researching in the academy, especially for women and the natural world. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The inquiry centers on relationality, generativity, and lived experience as the impetus and location of research as/in resilience. The story is told through poetry, contemplative photography, ink, watercolor, and egg tempera painting, as well as quilting, rug hooking, and needlepoint. It touches on issues, relationships, and experiences in higher education including the graduate student experience, women in the academy, the destructiveness of the larger patriarchal system and practices that maintain the system’s status quo,  and how utilizing, and even making art central in educational experiences serves to disrupt/de-center in a Taoist sense to help create a movement toward balance and generation of healthy learning environments and practices. It is a call for art education to proceed in a compassionate, loving, and balanced way.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The actinide series remain a rather unknown area within the periodic table. There is plenty of studies that can be done with the actinide elements, however, the radioactivity has truly hindered the process of learning about these elements. Due to their paramount presence in spent nuclear fuel, the investigation of these elements is essential. One common strategy to studying the actinides, specifically transneptunium elements, is to compare and contrast the chemistry with the lanthanide series. In this dissertation, there are 12 chapters covering three distinctly different chemical series with these transneptunium elements.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter 1 is a brief introduction regarding some of the history and fundamental importance and chemistry of the actinide series. Chapters 2, 3, and 4 focus on a soft, sulfur donor ligand pyrollidinedithiocarbamate (PyDTC). There are several studies suggesting the softness of actinide elements with respect to their lanthanide counterparts. The PyDTC project provides further evidence supporting this idea for plutonium, americium, and californium for Chapters 2, 3, and 4 are presented.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The second section within this dissertation regards a harder, oxygen donor system. This system utilizes the mellitate ion (mell) as a ligand. The mellitate ion is benzenehexacarboxylic acid and has a variety of different coordination modes that take place. Chapters 5, 6, and 7 discuss plutonium, americium, and californium mellitates and compare them to nonradioactive lanthanide analogues. The results display that the actinide in general have similar bond lengths with their similar sized lanthanide counterparts suggesting that there is no increase or decrease of the hardness of the actinide ion with respect to the lanthanides. Chapter 8 brings together the PyDTC and mell projects with the synthesis of the respective curium compounds and their behavior under pressure. Advanced theory coincides with these studies and the results show that the 5f orbitals are perturbed far more in soft donor complexes compared to the hard donor mellitate complex.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The third and final section of the main body focuses on a mixed donor ligand 2,2’,2’’-tris(salicylideneimino)triethylamine (H3trensal). This ligand coordinates with both hard oxygen donor atoms and softer nitrogen donor atoms within the same ligand. Chapters 9, 10, and 11 investigate the plutonium, americium, and californium compounds. Within this system, the softness trend of the actinides can be seen by their bond lengths with respect to their lanthanide counterparts. Chapter 12 finally concludes the main body portion of the dissertation.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The electrical power industry is currently going through one of the most dramatic changes in its history. With an ever-increasing demand for power, environmental cleanliness, and reduction in electronic device sizes, the use of electrical power is continuously expanding to new types of electrical devices and systems. Electric transport systems are one of the newest large-scale power systems being developed. Electric ships and aircraft require innovative ideas and novel designs of power system components to meet their anticipated power demands. These immense power demands are coupled with ambitious goals of energy efficiency, power density, and resiliency. These demands add strict constraints of size and weight, while at the same time call for substantially high-power capabilities in the megawatt (MW)-range. High temperature superconducting (HTS) power cables have been proposed as a solution to meeting these goals of power-dense, resilient, and efficient electrical transmission. HTS power cables possess a current density of 50-100 A/mm2, compared to conventional conductors such as copper, which generally have a current density of 1-30 A/mm2. Hence, HTS power cables achieve high capacity power transmission without the need to operate at a high voltage, which can reduce the size and weight of electrical components within a power system. There have been only a few studies in the past on understanding electrical faults in power systems consisting of HTS cables; however, there were no comprehensive studies on the response of HTS cables during various types of electrical fault conditions. Understanding the response of the system during various electrical fault scenarios is crucial for satisfying the requirement of resiliency for electric transport systems. These studies provide the fundamental electrical characteristics HTS cables must be designed to be implemented within the system The researched performed for this thesis focused on three primary studies: a study was performed on understanding various types of electrical faults that can occur in a medium voltage direct current (MVDC) power system and the additional design constraints that come to play when using HTS power cables as a means of power transmission in these systems. Another study was conducted on characterizing the intrinsic dielectric strength of liquid nitrogen (LN2) and analyzing the discrepancies in measured data that occur from gas bubble formation in the LN2 medium. This study also analyzed if the substance and pressure used to pressurize and subcool LN2 had a significant impact on its measured dielectric strength. The final study performed in this thesis was on investigating the feasibility of a novel HTS cable design referred to as superconducting power cable with hybrid cryogens (SPCHC). The SPCHC design utilizes LN2 as the dielectric medium and GHe as the primary cooling medium by utilizing commercially available HTS conductors and cryostats, along with the previously published work on LN2-cooled HTS cables. Several key findings were obtained from completing this research. These key findings are essential for enhancing the resiliency of HTS power cables, and for characterizing the intrinsic dielectric strength of LN2. The following is a summary of the conclusions that were made in this research: • The average measured dielectric breakdown voltage of LN2 in a stagnant bath was approximately 6% lower for vertically positioned electrodes compared to horizontally positioned electrodes. Also, vertically positioned electrodes had approximately 5% lower maximum breakdown voltage compared to the horizontally positioned electrodes. The lower measured values of dielectric breakdown for the vertically positioned electrodes indicate that a larger volume of gas bubbles was likely trapped between the electrodes when vertically assembled. • The measured intrinsic dielectric strength of LN2 increased by a maximum of 87% when pressurizing and subcooling the LN2 compared to the dielectric strength of a stagnant unpressurized bath of LN2. This study showed that even slight gas bubble formation in the LN2 medium has a significant impact on the measured dielectric strength of LN2. • The substance and pressure utilized to pressurize LN2 did not have a significant impact on its intrinsic dielectric strength. In the experiments performed in this study, LN2 was pressurized at pressures of 35-65 PSIA and with cases utilizing nitrogen gas (GN2), gaseous helium (GHe), and a binary gas mixture consisting of 6 mol% hydrogen gas (H2) and 94 mol% GHe. The lower condensation temperature of pure GHe and the binary gas mixture allowed for varying pressure levels to be achieved easier compared to nitrogen gas, which condenses at 77 K. • The SPCHC power cable design can potentially reduce the LN2 volume required for the cable by up to 95% and reduce the maximum gas volume expansion in the event of a cryogen leak by up to 89% compared to conventional LN2-cooled HTS power cable technology. The increased dielectric strength of LN2 compared to GHe may allow for the SPCHC design to have more HTS cables installed within a single cryostat compared to utilizing just GHe. Installing more HTS cables into a single cryostat allows for a reduction in the required cryogenic components of a system.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Households provide a glimpse into the everyday life of a small group of individuals. When studied systematically we can learn how households fit into the social, economic, and political systems practiced by the larger community. I explore socio-economic household status in the Mississippian period (AD 1000-1500) in the Southeastern United States through the lens of zooarchaeology. I integrate data derived from faunal and architectural remains recovered from a Phase III data recovery at the Fewkes site (40WM1), located in Williamson County, Tennessee. My analysis of faunal and architectural data includes those from several households identified at the Fewkes site. These data and interpretations are then compared to previously identified households in the Middle Cumberland Region of Tennessee. Ultimately, my study shows similarities and differences in animal use in non-elite households</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Combining influences from western and oriental elements always fascinates composers who benefit from diverse musical cultures. TongQu is a large-ensemble piece for the Chinese instrument Zheng and eleven performers. The charm of Chinese music shimmers on the surface, while the foundation resonates with European and American influences.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The 21 strings of the zheng are tuned to alternating C major pentatonic and C minor pentatonic scale. The dissonances generated from the two juxtaposed parallel pentatonic scales are interlocked and layered to create non-pentatonic sonorities that are distributed to all other instruments vertically and horizontally.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The four movements in this piece imitate four different games played very often when I was a kid. The title, TongQu has more than one meaning in Chinese, but most of them are about childhood. Possible translations include, 'childhood-like', 'pleasure of leisure', and 'fun time when young'. My favorite one is 'The Little Pleasure of Life', which comes from Lin Yutang's translation of the famous Chinese book Six Chapters of a Floating Life. We grow older each day, but we could connect with the bright, shining, and loving inner child—an inner child who survived adulthood.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This thesis analyzes the networks of negotiations cultivated by Kurdish elites in the early twentieth century and argues that Kurdish elites played an important role in shaping major political transformations in the Middle East and internationally. It investigates the specific networks used by elites in both the urban and tribal context and compares the different negotiations these groups made within their respective networks. Through the propaganda and the press, private petitions and negotiations, and international meetings such as the Paris Peace Conference, it shows how Kurdish elites worked within the changing political context before and after World War One by embedding themselves into new political networks to support their political goals.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>I had been wanting to write a bizarre piece for solo piano using a lot of pianist. This inspiration comes to me when I was watching a concert at Mahidol University, Thailand during a piano duet concert which I cannot fully remember who is the composer, but there is an ending section of when the audience can all come up to play on the piano together. Those participants are, possibly, planned beforehand since they are all from the same field of piano majors.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>3 Pieces for 10 Hand Solo Piano had been my choice for writing this thesis with the objective to expand more creativity and also find opportunities to express skills that I had learned from studying for masters in Florida State University.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>All three movements show different ways for five pianists be able to play on a single piano. The first movement highlights using tools to create different sounds and effects that blends in with the piano sound. The second movement introduces to play the piano in the traditional normal way. Lastly, the third movement shows a different way to play piano with a little of the visual.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The spinel vanadate CoV2O4 is a magnetically frustrated system with an interesting non-collinear spin texture at low temperatures. The magnetic frustration in the system arises from the arrangement of atoms in the structure of the material, and the competition of various anisotropy energies leads to cooperative phase transitions. In this dissertation, we report on the growth of CoV2O4 in thin film form to induce structural perturbations, to attempt to control the magnetic properties in the material. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Tuning of the crystal structure is achieved through strain induced in the material by growth on a substrate with different lattice parameter. By growing thin films of CoV2O4 on SrTiO3 substrates, we successfully perturb the structure from its bulk cubic form to a stable orthorhombic unit cell, confirmed with synchrotron x-ray diffraction. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The perturbations to the structure lead to interesting magnetic properties in the CoV2O4 films, as the structural change distorts the nearest neighbor distances throughout the unit cell, and in turn, the exchange interactions between the ions. We present both macroscopic and microscopic magnetic behavior in the material as it is cooled through different magnetic transitions. In the different chapters of this dissertation, we use macroscopic magnetometry measurements to find the transition temperatures in the films, neutron diffraction measurements to investigate the arrangement of spins (magnetic structure), and torque magnetometry to probe the anisotropy energies associated with these magnetic structures. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Clear differences in magnetic properties are seen in our thin film materials compared to previous reports of bulk CoV2O4. We find three magnetic transitions, rather than the two transitions typically seen in bulk, including one transition that appears to be field-dependent. While the low temperature magnetic structure of our films is similar to the non-collinear spin texture seen in bulk, our structural perturbations have significantly increased the canting angle of this non-collinearity, and induced very strong anisotropy in the magnetic structure. Differences in the magnetic behavior between thin films and bulk, in both magnetic structure and anisotropy, provide evidence that structural tuning of spinel vanadates is a promising avenue to stabilize different exotic spin textures via strain-engineering.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The mobile game industry is one of the fastest-growing industries nowadays. More and more mobile game developers adopted the freemium strategy, which means the monetization of the game solely relies on in-game ads and in-game purchases. The latter one contributes nearly half of the revenue of the mobile game industry, yet a small portion of the gamers are buying in-game contents. This study proposes to examine the relationship between various factors affecting Purchase Intension by using the extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and explore how this relationship is differ across different game types and cultures. The sample was mainly drawn from college students from Florida State University and Amazon Mechanical Turk. Based on the data, it was found that Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, Social Influence, Facilitating Conditions, Hedonic Motivation, Price Value, and Habit all positively influence the Purchase Intension of in-game content. It was also found that game type influences the relation between Price Value and Purchase Intension, while the player’s culture influences the relation between Hedonic Motivation and Purchase Intension. Moreover, the Purchase Intension of players who play solo mobile game are influenced more by the Price Value. Also, the Purchase Intension of players who have higher masculinity level are influenced more by the Hedonic Motivation. The contributions of this study will help mobile game developers and marketers to be more effective in targeting and designing attractive content for their consumers.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>ABSTRACT</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This treatise seeks to examine the importance and relevance of the vibraphone and its functional adaptability in all genres (classical, jazz, etc.). In the canon of vibraphone research and literature, there exists only a modicum of information on the topics of orchestral vibraphone excerpts and adapting the music of Johann Sebastian Bach for vibraphone. This treatise serves as a resource that details recommendations on performance practice, dampening solutions, rhythmic interpretations, and stylistic information regarding the aforementioned topics. In addition, two lecture recitals were presented to support this document with tangible information and concise demonstrations that aided in the understanding of these topics and recommendations.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The first lecture discussed how the vibraphone plays a distinctive role in three orchestral works, in that its use is synonymous with jazz. Excerpts from John Adams’ City Noir, Leonard Bernstein’s Symphonic Dances from West Side Story, and John Williams’ Catch Me If You Can: Escapades are not only the three most common vibraphone excerpts called in orchestral auditions, but are also deeply rooted in jazz. The second lecture discussed and demonstrated the capabilities of vibraphone dampening as it pertains to J. S. Bach’s Violin Sonata No. 1 in G minor (BWV 1001). It provided a detailed outline of vibraphone dampening techniques, as well as excerpts of Bach’s Violin Sonata No.1 that include vibraphone dampening markings and notation. This lecture also presented a new dampening concept and a more effective approach to vibraphone dampening techniques.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>As noted in the first lecture, the vibraphone is utilized as a symbol of jazz in some of the most respected 20th-century orchestral masterworks. As stated in the second lecture, the vibraphone functions effectively as a solo instrument because of its dampening capabilities- more so than other keyboard percussion instruments.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Set in rural North Carolina, BEWILDERNESS explores the current opioid crisis and the link between addiction and trauma, specifically PTSD and sexual assault.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Narrating the story is Irene, a part-time food server who pairs a cynical outlook with a slippery sense of ethics. She also maintains a fierce loyalty to her best friend Luce. Although both women have a history of abusing prescription painkillers, they've managed to stay clean for eleven months, and are eager to get their one-year key tags. But when Luce's boyfriend Wilky fatally overdoses on fake oxy pressed with fentanyl, Luce suffers an asthma attack triggered by stress and is given ketamine by the paramedics––throwing her sobriety into peril. Struggling with grief and isolation, the women soon fall back into their old hustle, graduating from pills to sniffing heroin. A sexual assault from a doctor launches them into IVing their dope. But it isn't until Irene convinces Luce, who is still covered by her stepfather's health insurance, to go to rehab in Florida that the danger really escalates. Told in woven narratives with two different timelines, BEWILDERNESS tracks the events leading up to and following a user's death.</DISS_para>

      <DISS_content>
         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>India has the greatest maternal and child health burden in the world, having more stunted and wasted children, neonatal deaths, and deaths of children under age five than any other nation (Paul et al. 2011; UNICEF 2013; 2018; Hug, Sharrow, and You 2017). Progress has been made in reducing these disparities in the past few decades, but it has not been enough to meet national or international goals. Although India has a long history of gender, caste and class-based inequalities, research considering the connections between these inequalities and childhood health and survival is lacking. The purpose of this dissertation is to examine whether under-five mortality in India reflects the physical embodiment and intergenerational transmission of social and contextual inequality. This study is guided by four specific research questions about neonatal mortality risk and survival through the fifth birthday, in recognition of the different cause-structures of mortality at these two stages of the life course: Question 1) Do elements of the maternal life course—family background, educational attainment, degree of personal agency—influence neonatal mortality risk? Question 2) Do maternal health status and health behaviors prior to and during gestation mediate the association between mothers’ life experiences and their neonates’ mortality risk?  Question 3) Do state-level characteristics, including health system quality and degree of socioeconomic development, influence child survival and, if so, do they operate through proximate or intermediate factors? Question 4) Are household characteristics and environmental exposures associated with childhood survival, net of maternal characteristics, and are these relationships conditional on birth size? All analyses were conducted using the India National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4), which provided nationally representative data collected in 2015-2016. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Questions 1 and 2 address the significance of the mother’s life course for her child’s survival during the first month of life using discrete time hazard models and mediation analyses. I examined the extent to which key elements of the mother’s earlier life experience, such as her family background, educational attainment, and her degree of agency, impact her newborn’s survival chance, and if these earlier life experiences predict her health and health behaviors around pregnancy. Mother’s education is significantly predictive of her physical health and prenatal care use in adulthood, and lowers her newborn’s mortality risk through these two proximate determinants. Greater decision-making power is also associated with more prenatal care visits, which ultimately lower her child’s hazard of death, net of all other factors. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Questions 3 and 4 investigate the broader avenues through which inequality influences child health. I examined how contextual effects at the state-level are mediated or moderated by individual-level factors to impact the chance of under-five survival using discrete time hazard and interaction models. Greater educational attainment of women at the state level translates into lower odds of death for children, net of other structural measures. This contextual effect exerts its influence through household and individual-level measures, as it is no longer significant once markers of parental socioeconomic status are considered. For under-five mortality, the importance of the parent’s cultural capital is apparent. Unlike the neonatal period, father’s education retains a significant protective effect that does not appear to be mediated by other measures of socioeconomic status or birth conditions. While specific dimensions of household quality are not significantly related to child mortality on their own, net of other state and household factors, the protective effect of having access to a flush toilet is conditional on birth size. Only children not considered small at birth appear to reap a survival advantage from modern plumbing systems, which help to shield them from pathogens linked to diarrheal and other infectious diseases. For children with small birth sizes, higher-quality toilet facilities do not seem to raise or lower their already-higher odds of mortality.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In total, this dissertation paints a holistic portrait of how structural and cultural barriers culminate in maternal and child health outcomes on the individual level. The findings provide policy makers and public health scholars with new insights on the risk factors of various stages of child mortality using current, nationally representative data. Furthermore, employing the life course framework provides a fresh perspective for analyzing the determinants of child survival in India, one that gives proper attention to the social and environmental experiences of the children and adults to whom they are linked.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>A long-standing paradox in evolutionary biology is the maintenance of genetic variation in traits that are strongly tied to fitness. How is it that variation can be maintained in ecologically important traits when directional selection and genetic drift are expected to erode this variation? There are several evolutionary processes that are capable of maintaining population diversity above levels expected under mutation-selection-drift balance. One of these processes is negative frequency dependent selection (NFDS), wherein rare phenotypes have an inherent fitness advantage. A well-supported example of NFDS is found in the Trinidad guppy, Poecilia reticulata. Guppies exhibit extreme within population variation in male-limited color patterns and these color patterns are highly heritable. In this system, both natural and sexual selection appear to favor males bearing rare or unfamiliar color patterns. Evidence from laboratory studies suggest that female preference may be the underlying mechanism for the reproductive advantage of these rare male color patterns. However, this preference has only been assessed in laboratory-reared animals derived from a few natural and feral populations. It is uncertain whether the preference for rare and unfamiliar color patterns is exhibited by wild females, or how variable the preference is across a range of natural populations. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	In my dissertation work, I tested predictions based on the hypothesis that negative frequency dependent female preference promotes male color polymorphism in guppies, and I created a novel tool to evaluate variation in color patterns. I first determined whether female preference for rare and unfamiliar color patterns was prevalent in wild females from natural populations. Additionally, I tested whether there was among-population variation in this preference and whether any variation in preference was associated with variation in predator communities. Over a two-year period, I tested for negative frequency dependent female preference in 11 natural guppy populations, ten of which were paired high- and low-predation populations. I predicted that females would exhibit a preference for males bearing rare and unfamiliar male color patterns and that this level of preference would vary among populations. I found that females in natural populations do exhibit preference for rare and unfamiliar color patterns, and this behavior was consistent rather than variable among populations. This is the first study to examine female preference for both rare and unfamiliar color patterns across many natural populations. These data support the hypothesis that negative frequency dependent female preference promotes the maintenance of the male color pattern polymorphism in the guppy. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	In the next chapter of my dissertation, I describe a novel method for quantifying color patterns. This method was designed to enable investigation of a wide range of questions about color patterns, including those in study systems other than guppies. Current methods used to measure color patterns typically segment digital images into areas of color categories (e.g., “orange spots”, “black spots”) and quantify patterns using both frequency and area of these color pattern elements. However, color quantification in this manner ignores the spatial location of colors within the whole-body pattern. In addition, image segmentation categorizes rather than maintains the continuous nature of color. Currently, the ability to assess variation in whole color patterns is currently lacking because there are no methods available that enable spatially-explicit color sampling among images while maintaining the continuous measure of color. Therefore, I designed a method that sampled color at individual sampling points across a whole pattern; this method of sampling allows for the total variation in color of whole patterns to be quantified. I then demonstrated some applications of the pipeline using the guppy system. With this new approach to color sampling, I tested hypotheses that color patterns differ in predictable ways across predator-community types and that different river systems exhibit parallel evolution of color patterns between high- and low-predation populations. My novel method to quantify color patterns expanded the toolbox available to researchers allowing for the examination of questions left unanswered by current methods.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	In a third study, I tested for negative frequency dependent female preference in a close relative of the guppy, Poecilia picta. Populations of this species have varying levels of male polymorphism. Populations from the mainland of South America (Guyana) are polymorphic, having males that exhibit three different color morphs, while populations from the island of Trinidad are typically monomorphic. I tested the hypothesis that the level of female preference for unfamiliar (novel) male color patterns would predict the level of male polymorphism. To do this, I familiarized Guyanese and Trinidadian females to Guyanese males bearing one of two possible color morphs (red or standard). Although I did find population differences in some female preference behaviors, female population did not interact with the status of the male morph (familiar or novel). Results of this experiment do not support the hypothesis that negative frequency dependent female preference promotes color polymorphism in P. picta. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	In conclusion, my dissertation work robustly supports the hypothesis that female preference for males bearing rare and unfamiliar male color patterns produces a reproductive advantage for these males in natural guppy populations, thereby generating negative frequency-dependent selection. In order to test other hypotheses about the evolution of male color patterns in guppies, I developed a method for sampling and quantifying whole color patterns from digital images. This method is capable of addressing questions about color patterns that could not be addressed by previous methods and its use is not restricted to the guppy system. Finally, although negative frequency dependent female preference appears to be important in the maintaining variation in male guppy color patterns, this mechanism does not appear to explain color polymorphism in a related species. Overall, my dissertation research illuminates the causes of ecologically-important genetic variation in an evolutionary model system, and expands the tools available to researchers for addressing fundamental questions about color patterns.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Sports have become more than just games played for entertainment. What was once a distraction to watch and enjoy has become not only an inspiration and motivation for individuals but a representation of countries and different groups of people (Kunkel, Funk, Ceridwyn, 2014). Sports is so prevalent that it has had behavioral and societal impacts affecting the daily lives of people. And because of this, the loyalty and associations created by teams and leagues with consumers is evident more than ever (Jankovic, 2019). A professional sports league works to not only generate revenue, but to create positive associations between a product and the consumer. This is done through branding, and the resulting associations, revenue, loyalty, and emotions are called brand equity (Keller, 1993). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This research provides an assessment of the Major League Rugby (MLR) brand, more specifically how the brand has been depicted. MLR is a new, professional rugby league that has franchises located in the United States and Canada. It has developed from seven to twelve teams in just three seasons and is looking to continue its growth. It is important to foster positive brand associations because they contribute to developing brand equity, which would help MLR sustain itself as the most successful rugby league in North America. Many professional leagues utilize social media to help create these brand associations. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Facebook and Instagram posts (1/01/2018-12/31/2019) were analyzed and coded, to determine if the core values of the MLR association were being communicated. The two screenings revealed that teamwork was the most common theme/type of content posted on Facebook’s feed out of the MLR association’s core values. The majority or most frequent types of content posted on both Facebook and Instagram were highlights and information/news/updates. This would appear to be following Keller’s consumer-based brand equity (CBBE) pyramid because the main focus, according to MLR’s social media, seems to be brand salience. Which is likely why highlights and information/news/updates are the most frequent types of posts. Since teamwork is one of the most frequent types of content posted out of all of the core values, it appears MLR is starting to slowly use its core values to create associations for its consumers. Respect and enjoyment were included in some posts as well, but sportsmanship and discipline were two of the core values that never appeared in any of MLR’s social media posts. In time, there may be evidence of brand equity through the increase in merchandise sales, tickets sales, revenue sales, and popularity. Future studies would need to focus on the top two levels of the CBBE pyramid, which focus on the consumer side and reactions to the brand salience and brand meaning (the first two levels of the CBBE pyramid).</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Research has revealed that there are patterns to offending that can be aggregated into categories or typologies. Despite the large amount of research on typologies of offending, there is a lack of research exploring general violent offending typologies, and how these can help predict recidivism. In order to address this gap in the literature, we explore what typologies of violent behavior emerge from a large sample of violent offenders, and how these help predict recidivism. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for future criminological research and practice.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Paul Dirac, a British theoretical physicist, provided a method to enrich uranium in larger quantities than other physicists were doing prior to World War II and the early war years. His method is known as the centrifuge method, and had an impact on Britain’s Tube Alloys project, the precursor to the Manhattan project. Although invited to participate fully in both programs, Dirac refused to travel to America and become part of the Manhattan project. However, he continued to reach out to other physicists, no matter their nationality or background. This caused problems when some politicians and bureaucrats in both Britain and the United States assumed he was too friendly with his Soviet counterparts, since the Soviets were not invited to be part of atomic research in the Manhattan project during World War II by their Allied partners. The British tried to use Dirac to keep secrets from the Americans by patenting his centrifuge method. Dirac refused to participate in the patent process, believing the other contributors to the centrifuge, Rudolph Pierls, Otto Frisch, and Klaus Fuchs, should be given equal credit with this method to enrich uranium. This would lead to suspicion by the British government that Dirac was a Soviet sympathizer.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The essays comprising this dissertation intersect public policy and consequential personal decisions: attending college, adopting a child, or choosing the right neighborhood. These selections have an enduring effect on an individual’s life and are constantly influenced by government policy. In all three essays, I leverage natural experiments derived from policy-induced variation. Specifically, I study the role of information as it pertains to the higher education attainment gap between Appalachia and the rest of the nation, how the generosity of tax credits affects adoption, and how place-based neighborhood improvement programs influence crime.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The first chapter explores the relation between information availability and higher educational attainment in a historically underperforming region, Appalachian Ohio. Appalachia has consistently ranked as one of the poorest regions in the nation, and a possible explanation for this lack of intergenerational income mobility could be the region’s chronically low levels of postsecondary educational attainment. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In response to persistently low college attendance rates within Appalachian Ohio, the Ohio General Assembly created a program in 1993 with the express goal of reducing informational barriers to all forms of postsecondary education. An element of the program involved awarding competitive grants to high schools within the region. These grants were specifically designated to encourage college enrollment by funding campus visits, seminars, college fairs, etc. I empirically estimate the impact of these targeted, high school-level grants on college attendance using a difference-in-differences framework.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>I exploit policy-induced variation in treatment eligibility and timing to compare college attendance rates for high schools that received the grants with those of similar high schools that were ineligible for the program. I digitize historical student inventory data reports from the 1990s to examine treatment effects by institution type. Incorporating multiple datasets, treatment specifications, and control groups, I document three findings: i) no evidence suggests that the grants increased college enrollment overall; ii) there is no evidence that attendance patterns shifted to higher-quality institutions; and iii) estimates suggest the program increased enrollment at previously unattended colleges, expanding students' choice sets upon high school graduation. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>While information interventions often offer a low-cost option for combating disparities in college enrollment, this paper joins a growing body of literature demonstrating that more direct measures may be needed to successfully increase postsecondary attendance in certain challenging settings.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This chapter examines how the federal Adoption Tax Credit affects adoptions and is co-authored with Luke P. Rodgers. The value of the credit varies with many factors, but adoptions from foster care (public adoptions) are the most heavily subsidized. It is unclear if the credit incentivizes the marginal adopter or if it is a simple transfer to those who would have adopted from foster care without the subsidy.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To identify the effect of the tax credit, we leverage variation induced by a period of increased tax credit generosity in 2010 and 2011. Prior to 2010, the credit was nonrefundable, but the credit became refundable in 2010 and 2011 and reverted back to a nonrefundable credit in 2012. Most public adoptions during these two years qualified for the full value of the credit (over $13,000 per child) regardless of one’s tax liability, representing a tremendous increase in the value of the credit for parents adopting from foster care.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Using county-level data from Florida, we document an average increase of 3.2 additional public adoptions (68 percent) per county immediately before the refundable period ended. While this effect is large, estimates show relative decreases in average adoptions in the first months of 2012, suggesting a retiming of adoptions rather than new adoptions. Importantly, the response appears to be concentrated in higher-income, more populated areas. Poorer, rural counties exhibited no response to the credit's expiration. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The final chapter documents the effect of targeted federal spending at the neighborhood level on crime and is co-authored with Carl Kitchens. We analyze the Los Angeles Promise Zone, a five square-mile area in Central Los Angeles that received Promise Zone designation in January 2014. An initiative of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Promise Zone program provides areas with preferred access to grants from federal agencies. Both urban and rural locales are selected based on need; the place-based program targets communities with high unemployment, high poverty, high housing costs, high crime, and poor educational opportunities. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The Los Angeles Promise Zone focuses on four primary pillars: economic activity, education, public safety, and neighborhood revitalization. In its first two years, it received more than $100 million in federal grants and received more than $300 million by the end of 2019. To identify the impacts of the Promise Zone designation on criminal outcomes, we combine crime-level data with geographic identifiers and information on the location and timing of the LAPZ designation. We compare the change in reported crimes for areas just inside and just outside the Promise Zone perimeter in a spatial difference-in-differences approach.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We find evidence that the total number of reported crimes within the Promise Zone fell after its creation in 2014 relative to nearby areas outside the boundary. Estimates indicate this fall may have been driven by decreases in the number of reported property crimes. Both of these reductions manifested three to four years after treatment. We attribute this net decrease in crime to indirect forces, such as improved educational and economic opportunity, and direct forces, including specific crime-reduction initiatives implemented by the Promise Zone.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Two species of marine catfishes (Ariopsis felis and Bagre marinus) are abundant within the Apalachicola Bay system during most of the year. They function as 2nd and 3rd order consumers and as prey for top predators. Males perform oral incubation, a trait of most ariid catfish species, and thus unique considerations may be required for conservation efforts. Current information on the abundance, movements, population structure and life histories of ariid catfish is lacking for the northern Gulf of Mexico. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine trends in catfish abundance and spatial distributions, as well as determine how abiotic factors influence these patterns. Fifteen years of monthly fishery independent survey data collected by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission were used to examine relative catch per unit effort (CPUE) and create spatially explicit kernel density estimates to observe spatial distributions. Boosted regression tree models were used to examine the influence of abiotic factors upon catfish abundance and movement. Adults were most abundant prior to and during the spawning season in May through August and juvenile abundance was highest 9-12 weeks after spawning activity. An annual temperature-driven migration event was documented. Spatial distributions of adults showed partitioning for spawning purposes and juveniles exhibited overlapping distributions. Boosted regression tree models revealed that all analyzed predictor variables were important to the presence and distribution of A. felis and B. marinus. Salinity, water temperature, depth and clarity were found to be most important while pH and dissolved oxygen were less important. These results differ from observations of ariid catfish in tropical ecosystems in which spawning areas are more segregated, migration events occur biannually and are salinity driven.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Inorganic precipitate membranes play an important role in chemobrionics and origin of life research. They can involve a range of catalytic materials, affect crystal habits, and show complex permeabilities. Microfluidic flows are a powerful tool to drive reactions far from equilibrium and thus induce chemical self­organization. This dissertation documents results obtained from three different studies that utilize Y-shaped microfluidic devices to grow several types of complex inorganic membranes and explore their growth dynamics, catalysis, and reactivity as well as in situ and ex situ characterizations of their chemical compositions.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>  We produce such membranes in a microfluidic device at the reactive interface between laminar streams of hydroxide and Co(II) solutions. The resulting linear membranes show striking color bands that over time expand in the direction of the Co(II) solution. The cumulative layer thicknesses (here up to 600 µm) obey square root laws indicating diffusion control. The effective diffusion coefficients are proportional to the hydroxide concentration but the membrane growth slows down with increasing concentrations of Co(II). Based on spatially resolved Raman spectra and other techniques, we present chemical assignments of the involved materials. Electron microscopy reveals that the important constituent alpha-Co(OH)2 crystallizes as thin hexagonal microplatelets. Under drying, the membrane curls into spirals revealing mechanical differences between the layers. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>  The layered structures indicate steep chemical gradients at the interface. We also synthesize mineral membranes and test their ability to catalyze the formation of pyrophosphate from phosphate and acetyl phosphate across steep pH gradients in microfluidic devices. The mineral membranes involve iron(II), iron(III), and other divalent metal cations (calcium, manganese, cobalt, copper, zinc, and nickel). We then study the chemical compositions of the precipitate membranes (which included vivianite, goethite, and green rust) using in-situ and ex-situ micro-Raman spectroscopy. The yields of pyrophosphate are determined by aqueous 31P NMR spectroscopy. We found that Fe(II)+ and Ca(II) are the best catalysts for pyrophosphate synthesis among investigated ions; Fe(III) and mixed-valence iron membranes are also able to promote pyrophosphate formation. In addition, the pH gradients across the membranes affect the pyrophosphate yields and the smallest pH gradient results in the highest yield. Since pyrophosphate might have functioned as an energy storage/currency molecule on early Earth, essential for the emergence of life, These results suggest a possible route of substrate phosphorylation in prebiotic hydrothermal systems.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>  Studies of membrane formation in microfluidic devices have been limited to non-redox and purely inorganic reactions. Here, we also investigate the formation of hybrid membranes at the interface of silver nitrate and 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine solutions that are steadily co-injected into a microfluidic device. The membrane thickening occurs in both directions and reveals oscillatory dynamics. The hybrid membrane mainly consists of hair-like Ag microstructures, Ag nanowires, and unbranched TMB-TMB2+ microfibers. Branched dendrite-like fibers form on the TMB side when the flow is stopped. We characterize these components with techniques including micro-Raman and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy as well as scanning electron microscopy. We also study the effects of initial concentration ratios on the membrane thickening speed and its opaqueness.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>  This dissertation focuses on the self-organization of purely inorganic membranes and organic-inorganic hybrid membranes at the interface of fluid flow in microfluidic devices and demonstrates an application to the origins-of-life research by forming simulated hydrothermal vent precipitates with steep gradients.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The past three decades have witnessed a rapid growth in the number of international teaching assistants (ITAs) in U.S. colleges and universities. Since the early 1980s, the dominant line of ITA research has focused on ITAs’ instructional discourse with the goal of developing effective ITA training programs that enhance the English proficiency, public speaking, and communicative competence of ITAs. In U.S. colleges and universities, ITAs are often viewed negatively as a homogeneous group that demonstrates limited English proficiency and teaching competence. As the U.S. academic community becomes increasingly diverse, a growing number of researchers have proposed that American universities value the unique contributions and the multicultural, multilingual identity of ITAs. Little has been explored, however, on ITAs’ agency and their identity construction in teaching.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Using a case study approach, this study investigates how five ITAs achieved their agency and constructed their identity in teaching throughout their college teaching experiences in the U.S. Guided by Emirbayer and Mische’s (1998) conceptualization of agency, this study examines the contextual factors that influenced these ITAs’ achievement of agency in real-life teaching settings. Informed by the identity work in the field of teacher education, the study also explores how ITAs constructed their unique identity in teaching. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Data of the current study came from multiple sources, including semi-structured interviews, class observations, and stimulated recall (SR) interviews. First of all, I conducted a semi-structured interview with each participant in order to gain insights into his or her personal history, college teaching experience, and teaching reflection. Next, I collected classroom observational data during the Fall semester 2018 and Spring semester 2019. From the observational data, specific classroom episodes reflecting ITAs’ agency and identity in teaching were then selected as the entry points of SR interviews. All data were analyzed in NVivo 12 using a combination of in vivo, process, affective, and pattern codes.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The findings of the study highlight the challenges that these ITAs encountered throughout their teaching experiences and the efforts they made to overcome these challenges. Moreover, classroom episodes and SR interviews reveal factors, such as autonomy, peer and departmental support, ITAs’ cultural backgrounds, and their professional experiences, had played critical roles in fostering their agency in teaching.  ITAs were also found drawing from their personal and professional identities in teaching. These identity aspects included personal beliefs, personal stories, English as a second language (ESL) background, the role of a student, cross-disciplinary experience, as well as research expertise.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Following these findings, I outline the theoretical and practical implications as well as future research directions. First, the study offers both narrative and observational evidence of how contextual factors in teaching can influence ITAs’ achievement of the agency. Second, the study suggests that ITAs’ personal and professional aspects of identity can be used as pedagogical resources in teaching. Third, ITAs’ hosting departments need to introduce a strong support system that promotes ITAs’ agency in teaching. Fourth, the university wide ITA program needs to empower ITAs to capitalize on their own identity as pedagogy to teach. Last, future ITA researchers can explore ITAs’ agency in different disciplinary areas and direct more attention to the ITA’s vulnerability in teaching.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This research aims to synthesize the psychological distance on social media marketing of luxury brands. At the same time, this study sheds light on consumers’ online engagement behavior on social media brand pages, so that managerial implications can be drawn for corporations to compose more persuasive social media marketing messages based on different consumers’ psychological distances. By reviewing the background and current problems in recent social media marketing research, the present research applies construal level theory (CLT), exploring the effects of appeal type (attributes vs. benefits) on the persuasiveness of social media marketing messages and consumer online engagement. Two studies were conducted respectively to examine how message appeal types associated with luxury brands, and how different psychological distance dimensions (i.e., temporal distance and social distance) with message discount information can impact consumer online engagement, attitude toward the brand, word of mouth (WOM), and purchase intention.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Study 1 investigated whether message appeal types impact consumers' attitudes toward the ad, attitude toward the brand, and their online engagement on social media. The findings of Study 1 illustrated that consumers who own luxury products would have a more positive attitude toward the brand if they viewed the luxury brands utilized a benefit-based message.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Study 2 tested the role of temporal distance in luxury brand social media marketing. It suggested that there were no interaction effects between temporal distance with message appeals and discount information on consumer online engagement. However, when considering social distance with luxury products, there are significant differences between temporal distance and discount information on WOM. Specifically, consumers who are socially close to luxury products are more likely to have a positive WOM if the temporal distance and discount information matched.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation defense is concerned with random objects in the complex projective space . It is shown that the Veronese-Whitney (VW) antimean, which is the extrinsic antimean of a random point on  complex projective space relative to the VW-embedding, is given by the point on complex projective space represented by the eigenvector corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue of the expected mean of the VW-embedding of the random point, provided {this} eigenvalue is simple. We also derive a CLT for extrinsic sample antimeans, and an asymptotic $\chi^2$-distribution of an appropriately studentized statistic, based on the extrinsic antimean, which in the particular case of a VW-embedding is then used to construct nonparametric bootstrap confidence regions for the VW-antimean planar Kendall shape. Simulations studies and an application to medical imaging are illustrating the proposed methodology.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Statistics and Geometry share an important commonality: they are both based on the concept of distance. There is a distance called energy distance, which is a statistical distance between the distributions of random vectors, which characterizes equality of distributions. In this dissertation we also talked about this energy distance. We will apply the energy test in medical imaging data.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Talking about medical imaging, the one common problem is classification, which is often to identify the difference between two population. The common test is to identify the mean difference. In this defense, we derive the two sample test for VW antimeans in complex projective space,  and also applications on the same data set.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Uses and gratification theory has guided many media studies, but few have explored the relationship between uses and gratification theory and live game streaming behaviors. Nowadays, live streaming, especially live game streaming, has become a popular media type around the world. Different types of streamers work on these platforms and play video games as jobs. It is valuable to look into this field since it generates huge profits, with many companies competing with each other. In this study, I will examine the reasons why Chinese undergraduate students watch live game streams through a uses and gratification perspective.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Tarsus’s conversion in the New Testament. Though as the last essay will reveal, I have experienced more of a reverse conversion in regards to my faith journey, this metaphor of scales falling from eyes, seeing a revelation, seemed fitting for the rest of the collection of essays as well as I revisit past experiences with new perspectives, as in We Were Sisters and The Student Body; as I explore the depths of grief after losing my father in Orvillesdóttir and Insomnium; or as I come to more solid conclusions regarding things I’ve always suspected as in City of Roses and the essay, Something Like Scales. In this collection, I’m often looking backwards, but also at my immediate surroundings and realizing, not everything is as it initially seems.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Telling the Bees is a collection of poems that approaches grief, confession, tradition, and community from a queer perspective. It uses a tradition Quaker poet John Greenleaf Whittier describes in his 1858 poem of the same name in which families were sure to go out and tell their beehives of important domestic events—births, marriages, and especially deaths—believing that if they didn’t the bees would leave and therefore stop producing essential resources like wax and honey for the household.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Earth's atmosphere-ocean system is distinguished by its variability over a wide range of time scales. The non-linear interactions between these time scales are complex and are further complicated by the large number of subsystems and modes in the atmosphere-ocean system. Here, we explore a stochastic model developed by Sardeshmukh and Sura which uses correlated additive and multiplicative (CAM) noise and relies on a state-dependent (multiplicative) noise forcing to represent the multi-scale interactions between weather and climate.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>An important problem in climate variability is the statistical representation of extreme weather and climate events. While a description of the tails of a probability density function (pdf) is essential for modeling extreme events, an understanding of the full pdf is required to capture the full dynamics of the atmosphere-ocean system. On daily scales, the statistics of the large-scale atmospheric circulation are non-Gaussian. A one-dimensional pdf produced by the CAM noise model, or stochastically generated skewed (SGS) distribution, attempts to probabilistically represent the non-Gaussian statistics of atmospheric climate anomalies.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para/>
            <DISS_para>This study evaluates the ability of the SGS distribution to represent the non-Gaussian statistics of several atmospheric variables using NOAA-CIRES-DOE Twentieth Century Reanalysis Project version 2c (20CRv2c) dataset. A method of moments SGS parameter estimation technique described Sardeshmukh et al (2015) is implemented in a Julia software package and applied to global gridded time series of reanalysis data. Goodness-of-fit tests show the SGS distribution performs well in regions of near-zero and positive kurtosis, but produces statistically implausible with time series with negative sample kurtosis. However, the SGS distribution is found to outperform the standard normal (Gaussian) distribution at nearly all gridded locations, even where the SGS fit is poor. The SGS distributions of two 67 year 20CRv2c periods are also compared, where few significant changes in the shape of the SGS distribution are found.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Research has continually shown that minoritized students are lower performing on standardized assessment and represent only a small portion of the Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) profession. These trends are likely an artifact of the lack of opportunity for minoritized students to engage in learning that is not only rigorous but also allows them to integrate their funds of knowledge developed through their culture and past experiences. Instruction that contains such aspects (rigor and attention to funds of knowledge) have separately been shown to benefit minoritized students’ achievement, motivation, and persistence in STEM. As such, these components of instruction represent equitable means for teaching minoritized student populations. Unfortunately, much of the work related to equitable instruction has dealt either with attending to students funds of knowledge or rigorous instruction; with few scholars attending to both. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Implementing both rigorous instruction and instruction that attends to students funds of knowledge has been shown to be difficult for many teachers. Teacher preparation programs offer a critical component in helping to prepare science teachers for rigorous instruction that attends to students’ funds of knowledge since they provide prolonged support for pre-service teachers. Teacher preparation programs provide spaces for shaping teacher thinking, extensive feedback, rehearsals, reflection, scaffolded support, etc. These components have been shown to be important for changing practice and thinking. If the goal for teachers is to create equitable instruction for minoritized students then explicit attention to developing instruction that attends to these aspects will be of particular importance for teacher preparation programs.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	This dissertation addresses the gaps in the understanding of the type of instruction pre-service science teachers design to provide insights into areas of improvement for teacher education programs. As such, this work focuses on exploratory studies of pre-service teacher practice and thinking. Each manuscript focuses on an aspect needed to create equitable learning opportunities for students. The first manuscript address equity through the lens of rigor. By looking at the lessons designed to be implemented within the classroom, this manuscript addresses the level and type of thinking pre-service teachers intend to have their students engage in. Using the lesson plans of seven pre-service science teachers, this manuscript discusses areas to be addressed by pre-service teacher preparation programs to increase the rigor for all students, specifically in high-needs schools serving populations of primarily minoritized students. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The second manuscript addresses the second component of equitable instruction, that is attending to students funds of knowledge. Using the same lesson plans from the seven pre-service teachers, this manuscript seeks to uncover how pre-service science teachers sought to make their lessons relevant to students. We distinguish between constructed relevance that does not take into account the students in the classroom and relevance that is based on students’ funds of knowledge. The findings indicate productive beginnings and areas for improving the type of funds of knowledge pre-service science teachers draw upon and where these funds of knowledge are integrated within the lesson plans. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Shaping teacher practice is often tightly linked to teacher thinking about students and instruction. To address this, the third manuscript looks at how three pre-service science teachers think about culture. Using interview data, this manuscript posits that pre-service science teacher thinking can be thought about in terms of a collection of resources around culture. This notion builds on work from others around different resources individuals activate in their thinking. The findings of this manuscript discuss the five resources found within the data and how these resources were shown to be activated in productive and unproductive ways for fostering equitable instruction. The findings are discussed in terms of how they can shape pre-service teacher preparation programs and future research in the area of teacher thinking around culture. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Taken together, this work addresses the gaps in knowledge about how to best assist pre-service science teachers in creating equitable science instruction for minoritized students. By examining specific aspects of pre-service teacher practice and thinking, this dissertation seeks to move beyond general conversation of whether pre-service teachers are or are not providing equitable instruction to thinking about nuanced areas that can be addressed. Therefore, the findings in this dissertation point to specific and targetable areas that can be the focus of teacher preparation programs.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) often experience atypical patterns of sensory processing. Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD) occurs when sensory information is interpreted incorrectly or not filtered appropriately. This often results in atypical behavioral responses that may impact an individual’s ability to sustain attention, communicate, and participate in social activities. Music therapy has been shown to enhance social, communication, and cognitive skills through a variety of interventions designed and adapted to each individual’s needs. The purpose of this systematic review is to analyze and describe the evidence about how SPD impacts ASD and how music therapy can be used to address challenges that arise from SPD. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A systematic literature review was conducted using 22 articles from an electronic database that met specific inclusion criteria. Results were summarized to describe participants, setting, research design, goal/objective, intervention(s), and generalizations. Overall, the results showed a need for more extensive research on the prevalence of SPD in individuals diagnosed with ASD and the effectiveness of music therapy to address SPD. To support board-certified music therapists who work with individuals with ASD, it is imperative that future research be conducted in order to establish best-practice goals and interventions.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Buoys are a common source of validation data for remote sensing over the open ocean and are one of only a small number of in situ sources in this data sparse region. Previous studies have shown the presence of a low wind speed bias for buoys in extremely high wind conditions, but the data for the high wind speed ranges are limited. Therefore, it is important to test the validity of using buoys as an in situ source for satellite calibration in high winds and high seas using a relatively long record of buoy winds. Sub-setting scatterometer and buoy wind speed differences using wave parameters provides insight into the conditions under which wind speeds diverge between these wind sources. This study uses the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute ASCAT and NASA QuikSCAT Ocean Vector Wind datasets to compare with buoy winds processed through the Global Telecommunications System and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts 5th Generation Reanalysis wave data from 1999 to 2018. The scatterometer, buoy and reanalysis data are triple collocated in space by less than 25 km, and time less than 30 minutes. A probability distribution function analysis with wind speed differences sub-divided by wind speed ranges and wave characteristics is performed to test for the dependence of wind speed differences on sea state. Wind speed differences are further binned by anemometer height to investigate how physical buoy characteristics affect these differences. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>       To account for buoy wind speed differences due to different stability conditions in the boundary layer, buoy winds at different anemometer heights are converted to 10 m equivalent neutral winds (U10EN) which is the variable to which scatterometer winds are calibrated. Comparisons show a difference between the high wind speed calibrations of QuikSCAT and ASCAT where QuikSCAT winds exceed buoy U10EN by nearly 4 m s-1 and ASCAT winds exceed buoy U10EN by 0.65 m s-1 on average in the 20 to 25 m s-1 buoy U10EN range. However, the PDFs of wind speed differences (Buoy U10EN − Scatterometer) binned by wind speed ranges vary as a function of ERA5 significant wave height and buoy anemometer height. Buoy U10EN associated with low anemometers is typically lower than buoy U10EN from higher anemometers for the same significant wave height and scatterometer wind speed bins and these differences increase as significant wave height increases.  This pattern is particularly apparent when significant wave heights exceeding 4 m are combined with wind speeds exceeding 12 m s-1. Therefore, it is important to consider modification of buoy winds by the sea state in extreme conditions prior to their application to validate remotely sensed winds.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Deep learning has been widely used to predict price movements from the limit order book. In this paper, we design a consistently profitable trading system for predicting the bid-ask spread crossing. Our trading experiment is done on a limit order book sample dataset from Lobsterdata.com. We improve the daily return rate by 1000% comparing to a paper [1] working on deep learning trading with limit order book dataset from London stock exchange. We introduce a regular mid-price movement model and a benchmark mid-price movement model on the limit order book data from Lobsterdata.com and a benchmark dataset [15]. Our benchmark mid-price movement model improves the f1 score on the benchmark dataset and fixes the bias comparing to the model in the paper [16].</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Spatial datasets are becoming increasingly more common over the recent decades. Rapid devel- opments in technology has brought an abundance of information and data. Big spatial datasets produce many computational challenges. In this essay, we focus on modeling big Gaussian and non-Gaussian spatial datasets.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>It is increasingly understood that the assumption of stationarity is unrealistic for many spatial processes. In Chapter (2), we combine dimension expansion with a spectral method to model big non-stationary spatial fields in a computationally efficient manner. Specifically, we use Mej ́ıa and Rodr ́ıguez-Iturbe [1974]’s spectral simulation approach to simulate a spatial process with a covariogram at locations that have an expanded dimension. We introduce Bayesian hierarchical modelling to dimension expansion, which originally has only been modeled using a method of moments approach. In particular, our algorithm is a type of collapsed Gibbs sampler and it involves two steps. Our method is both full rank and non-stationary, and can be applied to big spatial data because it does not involve storing and inverting large covariance matrices. Additionally, we have fewer parameters than many other non-stationary spatial models. We demonstrate the wide applicability of our approach using a simulation study, and an application using ozone data obtained from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In Chapter (3), we propose a method for prediction using spatial count data that can be reasonably modeled assuming the Conway-Maxwell Poisson distribution. Modeling spatial count processes is often a challenging task. That is, in many real-world applications the complexity and high dimensionality of the data do not allow for routine model specifications. For example, spatial count data often display over-dispersion or under-dispersion. In order to allow for such structure, we propose a computationally efficient hierarchical Bayesian model. We develop the Conway Maxwell- Poisson model (COM-Poisson), which is a two parameter generalisation of the Poisson distribution. The COM-Poisson distribution allows for the flexibility needed to model count data that are either over or under-dispersed. The limiting factor of the COM-Poisson distribution is that the likelihood function contains multiple intractable normalizing constants and is not always feasible for MCMC techniques. We provide discussion on a project that addresses these issues for spatial count data.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Finally, we provide some discussions and future works in Chapter (4).</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>How does subatomic matter organize itself? Neutron stars are cosmic laboratories uniquely poised to answer this fundamental question that lies at the heart of nuclear science. Newly commissioned rare isotope facilities, telescopes operating across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, and ever more sensitive gravitational-wave detectors will probe the properties of neutron-rich matter with unprecedented precision over an enormous range of densities. Yet, a coordinated effort between observation, experiment, and theoretical research is of paramount importance for realizing the full potential of these investments. Theoretical nuclear physics provides valuable insights into the properties of neutron-rich matter in regimes that are not presently accessible to experiment or observation. In particular, nuclear density functional theory is likely the only tractable framework that can bridge the entire nuclear landscape by connecting finite nuclei to neutron stars. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Although density functional theory is very successful in predicting the isoscalar properties of nuclei, the isovector sector is poorly constrained. Thus, this dissertation is focused on how to best constrain the isovector sector of the density functional. The electric dipole polarizability is an isovector observable that probes the dynamic response of the system. In order to incorporate it into the fitting protocol of the functional, we need to compute the  $m_{-1}$ moment of the excitation strength through ground-state properties with an isovector dipole field added to the original mean-field Lagrangian. To solve this problem, we developed a fully relativistic approach based on the Dirac oscillator basis that can be applied to self-consistent calculations that include deformed potentials.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>While the electric dipole polarizability is an observable from the nuclear collective excitations, with remarkable advancements in experimental physics, it is now possible to gain valuable insights into the neutron distribution using exclusively electroweak probes. With calculations based on relativistic density functional theory, we found that both parity-violating elastic electron scattering and coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering will play a vital role in constraining the weak form factor of nuclei which is closely related to the neutron density of nuclei. This will ultimately lead to powerful constraints on the isovector sector of the density functional.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Finally, we also show that the difference in the charge radii of mirror nuclei has a strong correlation with the neutron skin of neutron-rich nuclei, which is another strong isovector indicator. This means elastic electron scattering on unstable nuclei can also be used to constrain the isovector component of the density functional.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The study examines faculty-librarian OER partnerships in adopting or developing OERs for faculty’s classes. The courses represent the Psychology, Mathematics, Education and Geography disciplines and range from undergraduate to graduate level. The multiple-case study was employed, with data collected through interviews, observations, and documentation. Each case in librarians partnered with one faculty member was analyzed separately, resulting in discipline-specific findings. Three faculty adopted existing OERs in their course, while two faculty developed their own open text based on their lecture notes. The diagram of each faculty member’s activity system was drawn and discussed. A cross-case analysis was conducted, with findings highlighting similarities and differences across cases. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In general, all faculty considered their OER partnerships with librarians were considered helpful and positive. At the beginning of their OER partnerships, librarians and faculty worked together to delineate their specific responsibilities. During their partnerships, librarians provided necessary expertise in instructional design and copyright. Across five cases, two strategies worked well for faculty-librarian OER partnerships: taking a team approach and maintaining faculty’s motivations in adopting or developing OERs. Time constraints and lack of effective communication were two important tensions that hindered collaborations between faculty and librarians across cases. The findings add to the OER literature focusing on how faculty and librarians could work together to adopt, develop, and promote OERs.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Visitation has received increasing attention from policy makers and scholars for its ability to help offenders maintain connections with loved ones during confinement. While there has been a great deal of work examining the potentially beneficial effects of visits among adult offending populations, very little attention has been paid to these effects among samples of incarcerated youth. This omission is problematic considering that youth face numerous challenges during confinement including exposure to violence (Sickmund &amp; Puzzanchera, 2014) and worsened mental health (Cauffman et al., 2007; Potter &amp; Jensen, 2003), and thus many go on to reoffend and continue their involvement in the juvenile justice system (Annie E. Casey Foundation, 2011). As a result, there is a need to identify whether cost-effective programming options, like visitation, might improve youths’ adjustment during confinement and after release. Accordingly, the goal of this dissertation is to examine visitation effects among incarcerated youth and to do so in ways that addresses some of the limitations inherent in prior visitation research. To this end, this dissertation answers three questions. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>First, this dissertation examines whether visitation is associated with prosocial changes during confinement. Drawing on the Risk-Needs-Responsivity literature, the effect of visitation on prosocial changes is assessed across seven domains: antisocial personality, antisocial attitudes, antisocial peers, family issues, school problems, unstructured activities, and substance abuse (Andrews et al., 2006). Because changes across each of these domains is associated with recidivism, this is an important question that has implications for youths’ short- and long-term offending patterns (Baglivio et al., 2017).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Second, this dissertation examines whether visitation can reduce recidivism. This chapter addresses limitations in existing research by examining this relationship using a wider range of controls than have been examined in prior work. In doing so, this chapter responds to concerns from scholars about whether the beneficial effects of visits reported in existing research are the result of selection bias (Cochran, 2019; Cochran et al., 2018). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Third, this dissertation examines whether the visitation-recidivism relationship differs by visitor type and visit quality. To date, all research on visitation effects among juveniles have examined the average effect of visits, without understanding when, and for whom, it is most beneficial. Yet, doing so can provide important information about when visitation may have the greatest crime reducing effect. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>These questions are assessed using two samples of incarcerated youth released from residential placement facilities in Florida. The first is a sample of youth who were released from placement between 2015 and 2017 and received a visitation survey designed to tap into the nuances of the visitation experience (N = 1,148). The second includes all youth who were released from placement between 2010 and 2015 (N = 7,296). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Analyses of these data point to several key findings. They highlight the importance of visitation for youth during confinement but raise questions about the importance of visitation after youth are released from confinement. Furthermore, these analyses suggest that there may be a great deal of variation in who benefits from visits, but that this variation is not captured by visitor type or visit quality. More broadly, these findings underscore the need for additional research on visitation effects among incarcerated youth and have implications for both policy and theory.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In 1985 Florida State University was asked to investigate an inadvertent archaeological discovery on private property in Leon County, Florida. A two-week survey of the area led to the documentation of a Deptford period site, the Marchant site (8LE822), with a small, but varied artifact collection. In 2019 these collections from the Marchant site were reanalyzed for this master’s thesis research project. Material culture classes of ceramic, lithic, and charred bone fragments were all observed and recovered from the site.  Initial observations of the charred osseous remains led to the prospect of the Marchant site’s being a space for mortuary or cremation practices. This thesis focused on ceramic and lithic analyses to better contextualize the fragmented osseous remains and the types of activities that may have occurred at the site. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Examining the materials through a series of technofunctional analyses was determined to be the most productive method. The goal of the technofunctional analysis was to better understand the functions for which specific items were created and in turn gain insight into how these objects were used in their environment. Ceramic vessels with specific forms that indicate utilitarian purposes and more specialized forms for secure containment were identified in the assemblage. The shape and wear patterns on the single hematite plummet recovered were assessed as part of the site’s use for special or ceremonial activities.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Observations from these technofunctional analyses, in relation to the osseous remains and the general environment that was exposed during the initial surveys, favors the conclusion that the Marchant site was a place for specialized ceremonies.  It was difficult to support an interpretation of the site as a crematorium, as was first suggested, because the osseous material is in such poor condition.  However, objects formed with specialized functions and the distribution of these objects does confirm ceremonial activities.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Tracking slow dynamics in polymers is very challenging using all-atomistic molecular dynamics simulations due to the vast range of time scales involved. Therefore, there are urgent needs to develop coarse-grained modeling schemes to meet the time scale requirement. Dissipative particle dynamics and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations are used to model phase separation of block copolyelectrolytes and photo-switching of azobenzene-polymers, respectively. Single-ion block copolyelectrolytes are solid-state conductors which can self-assemble into various nanostructures to enable both high ion transference number and structural integrity. Ion transport in these charged block copolymers strongly depends on the nanoscale microdomain morphology, however, the influence of electrostatic interactions on morphology of block copolyelectrolytes is still not clear. Using explicit electrostatic interactions, a systematic prediction of the phase diagram and morphology of diblock copolyelectrolytes was developed using a modified dissipative particle dynamics simulation framework. Various experimentally-controllable conditions are considered here, including block volume fraction, Flory-Huggins parameter, block charge fraction, and dielectric constant. Boundaries for microphase transitions are identified based on the computed structure factors, mimicking small-angle X-ray scattering patterns. Inclusion of ions leads to a significant leftward and upward shift of the phase diagram due to ion-induced excluded volume, increased entropy of mixing, and reduced interfacial tension between dissimilar blocks. Versatile design space for the nanostructures of block copolyelectrolytes is vastly broadened here for electrochemical energy storage applications.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>On the other hand, the photoisomerization of azobenzene-polymers is widely used in various engineering areas. However, their photo-mechanical energy conversion efficiency remains low for practical applications. Multiscale molecular dynamics simulations of single-chain monomer and bulk azobenzene-polymer systems are performed to quantify their photostrictive work and the resulting energy conversion efficiency in order to facilitate fundamental understanding and possible measures for optimization. An artificial driving force for isomerization is introduced as a bias dihedral (for all-atomistic models) or angular (for coarse-grained models) potential change to match the absorbed photon energy at the azobenzene bonds (-N=N-). Using single-chain molecular simulations with the all-atomistic force field as a benchmark, a coarse-grained force field is developed based on the Boltzmann inversion method. Finally, the energy conversion efficiency of bulk azobenzene polymers is calculated and compared with experimental results.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation intends to explore the effects of second language speakers’ L2 self- guides and regulatory focus on their pragmatic competence. Furthermore, how different motivational domains, standpoints, and orientations influence their L2 pragmatic awareness and production, pragmatic in different situations, and their grammatical awareness.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A total of 121 Chinese international students who speak English as their second language at universities in the United States participated in the study. They completed a regulatory focus questionnaire examining their chronic motivational orientations; an L2 self-guides questionnaire capturing the L2 speakers’ perceptions of their future selves; an appropriateness rating task to examine participants’ pragmatic awareness; a discourse completion task to measure their pragmatic production; an error judgment task to see how the participants recognize and judge the severity of grammar and pragmatic errors; and a demographic questionnaire recording their background information and other factors such as proficiency, length of residence, and age.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Multiple regression analyses which included proficiency and length of residence as control variables showed that second language speakers’ promotion level and ideal L2 self/own positively predicted their overall pragmatic competence when producing a second language. They also significantly predicted second language speakers’ pragmatic production in a situation that has a higher degree of imposition, with a larger social distance between the interlocutors, while the listener has a bigger power (IPD+). The prevention level, on the other hand, negatively predicted second language speakers’ pragmatic production and their pragmatic production when they share opinions. It also negatively predicted the production in IPD+ situations. Second language speakers’ ideal L2 self/own positively predicted the production in IPD+ situations and when they share opinions. Ought L2 self/own negatively predicted second language speakers’ pragmatic production as well as their production when making requests. When considering the speakers’ error judgments, the participants’ promotion levels positively predicted the pragmatic related measures, while the prevention levels positively predicted the grammar-related measures. L2 speakers’ self-guides failed to predict their pragmatic error judgments but predicted their grammatical error judgments where ideal L2 self/own and ought L2 self/ other positively predicted L2 speakers’ recognition of grammatical errors.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>These findings provided better insights in understanding individual differences in L2 pragmatics and showed that differences in chronic motivational orientations can lead to different patterns and characteristics in their second language development. Theoretical and instructional implications were discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Low-rank matrix approximation is extremely useful in the analysis of data that arises in scientific computing, engineering applications, and data science.  However, as data sizes grow, traditional low-rank matrix approximation methods, such as singular value decomposition (SVD) and column pivoting QR decomposition (CPQR), are either prohibitively expensive or cannot provide sufficiently accurate results.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A solution is to use randomized low-rank matrix approximation methods such as randomized SVD and randomized LU decomposition on extremely large data sets.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this dissertation, we focus on the randomized LU decomposition method. First, we employ a reorthogonalization procedure to perform the power iteration of the existing randomized LU algorithm  to compensate for the rounding errors caused by the power method.  Then to solve the fixed precision low rank approximation problem, we block the existing randomized LU algorithm. Our proposed randomized blocked LU algorithm is accurate and has comparable speed with randomized blocked QB algorithm by Martinsson and Voronin. Then we propose a novel randomized LU algorithm, called PowerLU, for the fixed low-rank approximation problem. PowerLU allows for an arbitrary number of passes of the input matrix, $v \geq 2$.  Recall that the existing randomized LU decomposition only allows an even number of passes.  We prove the theoretical relationship between PowerLU and the existing randomized LU. Numerical experiments show that our proposed PowerLU is generally faster than the existing randomized LU decomposition, while remaining accurate. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We also propose a version of PowerLU, called PowerLU_FP, for the fixed precision low-rank matrix approximation problem.  PowerLU_FP is based on an efficient blocked adaptive rank determination Algorithm 18 proposed in this dissertation. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We present numerical experiments that show that PowerLU_FP can achieve almost the same accuracy and is faster than the randomized blocked QB algorithm.   We finally propose a single-pass algorithm based on LU factorization.  Tests show that the accuracy of our single-pass algorithm is comparable with the existing single-pass algorithms.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Statistical depth, a commonly used analytic tool in non-parametric statistics, has been extensively studied for multivariate and functional observations over the past few decades. Although various forms of depth were introduced, they are mainly procedure-based whose definitions are independent of the generative model for observations. To address this problem, we introduce a generative model-based approach to define statistical depth for both multivariate and functional data. The proposed model-based depth framework permits simple computation via Monte Carlo sampling  and improves the depth estimation accuracy. When applied to functional data, the proposed depth can capture important features such as continuity, smoothness, or phase variability, depending on the defining criteria. Specifically, we view functional data as realizations from a second-order stochastic process, and define their depths through the eigensystem of the covariance operator. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>These new definitions are given through a proper metric related to the reproducing kernel Hilbert space of the covariance operator. We propose efficient algorithms to compute the proposed depths and establish estimation consistency. Through simulations and real data, we demonstrate that the proposed functional depths reveal important statistical information such as those captured by the median and quantiles, and detect outliers. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Functional data appear in applications commonly, particularly in modern neuroscience such as electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), where phase variability plays an important role in the data. In this study, we introduce the Fisher-Rao registration to analysis neuronal signals and compare with Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) method from the aspects of basic framework, mathematical properties, and computational efficiency. We also introduce FRR to the research area of measures of synchronization and constructing brain network.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The rapidly increasing demand for energy storage necessitates the development of the next-generation rechargeable Li-ion batteries (LIBs) with high energy density, enhanced safety, long-cycling life, and low cost. Over the past few decades, tremendous effort has been devoted to understanding how LIBs work and developing high-performance battery materials. One focus is to design and discover solid electrolytes, which will replace the flammable liquid electrolytes in the current generation of rechargeable LIBs. This doctoral dissertation focuses on tracking the charge carrier, Li+, transport in composite solid electrolytes and understanding lithiation mechanisms of organic electrodes with high-resolution solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Composite electrolytes, combing the advantages of inorganic and polymer electrolytes, have attracted fast-growing attention due to their compatibility with electrodes, enhanced stability, and desirable mechanical properties. However, Li-ion transport pathways in these complex systems are not well understood: Li ions can transport via organic matrix, inorganic fillers, organic-inorganic interface or the combination of the three. To examine these possibilities, systematic studies have been carried out in this thesis work. Firstly, Li ions in different local structures (inorganic filler, polymer matrix, and inorganic/polymer interface) are distinguished with high-resolution 6Li NMR. Furthermore, tracer-exchange NMR is developed and has been proven to be an effective strategy to probe Li-ion transport pathways in solid electrolytes, which combines 6Li7Li isotope exchange with high-resolution 6Li NMR (Chapter 2). Chapters 3-5 discuss the Li-ion transport in representative oxide-polymer, i.e., Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO)-poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), and sulfide-polymer, i.e., Li10GeP2S12 (LGPS)-PEO, composite electrolytes. Li-ion chemical environments and ion transport pathways are correlated with ion mobility, ionic conductivity, and chemical and electrochemical stability. Tracer-exchange NMR can be widely used to determine ion transport pathways in solid electrolytes for Li- or Na-ion batteries.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In addition to electrolytes, electrodes are also critical to battery performance, which determine the energy and power densities of batteries. Conventional cathodes are transition-metal based inorganic compounds, consuming non-renewable resources and generate heavy metal wastes. Considering long-term sustainability, organic materials composed of light and abundant elements are considered promising as alternatives. Besides, organic cathodes are chemically diverse and can deliver much higher theoretical capacity compared with inorganic cathodes. However, the practical capacities of organic cathodes are often much lower than the theoretical values and capacity deteriorates fast during cycling. Chapter 6 and Chapter 7 aim at investigating Li-ion transformation in quinone-based organic cathodes, chloranilic acid and 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane, upon cycling with ex situ and in situ NMR and EPR, correlating the structural evolution with electrochemical performance, which can contribute to reveal the origin of capacity decay of organic cathodes. The inferior cycling capacity of organic electrodes originates from the incomplete lithiation/de-lithiation of organic molecules because of the relatively low electric and ionic conductivities, high solubility of organic compounds and intermediate products in liquid electrolytes, and irreversible side reaction products.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In summary, these studies shed light on fundamental mechanisms of how battery materials work and provide insights for materials design, synthesis, and modification to develop the next-generation LIBs with high-performance and sustainability.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Nanoscale ion diffusion is an important phenomenon governing the energy conversion efficiency, stability, degradation pathway, and lifetime of both soft and condensed engineering materials. Block copolyelectrolytes are one of the leading candidate materials for use as solid-state single-ion electrolytes (for ion transport) and ion-conductive membranes (for ion exchanging) in electrochemical energy storage systems, such as Li-ion batteries and fuel cells. They self-assemble into nanostructures that enable both ionic transport and maintain structural integrity. Ion transport in these charged block copolymers strongly depends on the alignment of specific anisotropic nanostructures. In this work, a modified dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulation framework has been developed to systematically study ion diffusion dynamics considering various experimentally controllable factors, such as block volume fraction, Flory-Huggins parameter, block charge fraction (or ion concentration), and dielectric constant. Using a novel “diffusivity tensor” approach, we predict the phase-dependent ion diffusivity along the principal microdomain orientations, and find that the degree of anisotropy in ion diffusivity strongly correlates with that of the polymer microdomains. Ion conductivity in block copolyelectrolytes strongly depends on ion concentrations and temperatures, but weakly on other experimentally controllable parameters. Surprisingly, we discover that the inverse topology gyroid and cylindrical phases are the optimal candidates for single-ion conductors with high-flux ion conductivity, well-percolated isotropic diffusion pathways, and mechanical robustness. Finally, we find that higher ion diffusivity can be achieved by increasing the dielectric constant, which facilitates ion diffusion across block microdomain interfaces. This work significantly motivates future efforts in exploring inverse phases without removing grain boundaries in order to enhance ion transport. On the other hand, material stability issues, especially moisture degradation at ambient device operating environments, limit the practical application of hybrid perovskite in photovoltaic and light-emitting devices. Very recent experiments demonstrate that ligand passivation can effectively improve the surface moisture tolerance of hybrid perovskites. Here, the water stability of as-synthesized pristine and alkylammonium passivated methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) is systematically investigated using molecular dynamics simulations and two-step parallel reaction kinetics models. Interestingly, the more hydrophilic [PbI2]0 surface is more stable than the less hydrophilic [MAI]0 surface, due to the higher polarity of the former surface. This suggests that the water stability of MAPbI3 depends on both surface wettability (i.e., ion-water interactions) and surface energy (i.e., inter-ionic interactions at the surface). Among different types of passivation ligands, linear-chain ligands significantly stabilize the [MAI]0 surface with highly reduced dissociation rates of both MA+ and ligands, while branched ligands surprisingly leads to higher dissociation rates that increases with the surface coverage. Such anomalous behavior is attributed to the aggregation-assisted dissolution of surfactant-like ligands as micelles during the degradation process. As a result, shorter-chain linear alkylammonium at the full surface coverage is found to be the optimal ligand to stabilize the [MAI]0 surface. This work not only provides fundamental insights into the ionic dissolution pathways and underlying mechanisms of hybrid perovskites in water, but also inspires the search and design of highly stable hybrid perovskites with organic passivation layers. The computational framework developed here could be also transferrable to the investigation of surface passivation chemistry for other weak ionic materials in general.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Molecular photon upconversion via triplet-triplet annihilation, aka TTA-UC, is a process to upconvert two low energy photons into one high energy excited state, from which one can either harvest a high energy photon emission or a high energy electron generation. TTA-UC has become a particularly intriguing strategy to increase maximum theoretical solar energy conversion efficiencies from 33% to over 45% for single junction photovoltaic device under AM 1.5 solar irradiation. This dissertation introduces the usage of an inorganic-organic interface, self-assembled multilayers of TTA-UC pair (acceptor and sensitizer) on the nanocrystalline metal oxide film, to facilitate upconversion and subsequent photon/electron extraction. With a fully loaded monolayer of acceptor molecules organizing at the interface and sensitizer molecules coordinated in a bilayer structure, energy transfer is not limited by diffusion but instead by interlayer and cross surface energy transfer. Beyond that, this strategy also offers a unique scaffold with unprecedented geometric and spatial control of the TTA-UC pair at the metal oxide interface.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Under the right energy scheme, the structure and relative orientation of UC pairs on the surface can strongly affect TTA-UC rates and efficiencies. Therefore, five different anthracene derivatives were synthesized and incorporated into self-assembled bilayers as acceptors. Green- to-blue photon upconversion was found in all five films while surface loading, stability, energy transfer, and UC emission are examined. Insights on forward and backward energy transfer, cross surface exciton diffusion, the efficiencies of each step in the TTA-UC process, as well as the upconverted emission intensity dependence with respect to acceptor molecule structure in the bilayer film was provided.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Later on, in order to harvest broad band absorption, a singlet sensitizer was incorporated into a self-assembled trilayer to harness the absorption transmission window between sensitizer and acceptor molecules and enhance the performance of UC solar cells. A record TTA-UC photocurrent density enhancement was achieved under 1 sun irradiation AM 1.5. A combination of spectroscopic techniques was used to confirm the singlet sensitization mechanism and generate the generalized model to predict the efficiency gains in future singlet sensitization TTA-UC solar cells.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Finally, the various strategies for integrating TTA-UC into dye-sensitized and layered hetero-junction solar cells were reviewed. Architectures, note advantages, and disadvantages of each were described. With the summary of progress in the field to date, the efficiency limiting factors of current TTA-UC photovoltaic device and the prospects for integrated TTA-UC solar cells were discussed.</DISS_para>

I was at home listening to the sounds outside, and I felt truly terrified as I watched a giant tree falling right on my neighbor's house. However, I count myself fortunate thinking of the coastal cities that were hit even worse. Humans do not have much control when faced with the power of the nature. So this experience became an inspiration for my orchestra piece Storm and Stress - how destructive the nature can be and how helpless as humans we are when witness nature's anger.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>While I was composing this piece, I heard about the passing of the great American composer, Christopher Rouse. His music influenced me a lot, especially its dynamic power and emotional depth. His orchestra works made a particular impact for my orchestra writing.</DISS_para>
