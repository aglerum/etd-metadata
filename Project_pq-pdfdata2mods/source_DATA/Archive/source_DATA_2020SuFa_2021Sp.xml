         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Despite music education being endorsed by researchers as an effective tool to improve the social-emotional competence of students who live in poverty, African American students, who are overrepresented among the population of students who live in poverty, often fail to take advantage of music education programs (Elpus &amp; Abril, 2011; Hoffman &amp; Carter, 2013; Rabkin &amp; Hedberg, 2011; NCES, 2017). As such, there is a gradual attrition of African American students in school music programs nationally, and the largest attrition occurs between students 8th and 9th grade years (Bradley, 2007; Elpus &amp; Abril, 2011). These national trends are mirrored in the music ensemble enrollment of two predominately African American high schools in Wimbo County (pseudonym) Georgia. Through this study, I use focus groups and in-depth interviews to explore the factors considered by African American underclassmen in Wimbo County, Georgia when deciding to participate in school music programs. I also explored how they are making sense of their musical experiences and perceptions as well as the significance and relevance of school band program participation. A thematic analysis yielded seven themes: Meaningful High School Experiences and Postsecondary Success; Gravitating Toward Music (Exposure and Ability); Influential People (Family Influence and Mentorship); Making Sacrifices in order to Improve Oneself; Setting Oneself up for Success Beyond High School; Being Part of a Supportive Social Network that Contributes to a High-Quality High School Experience; Engaging with Music that is Uplifting, Challenging, and a Reflection of one’s Culture. Participants considered their postsecondary plans, their innate musical abilities, and the advice of family members and other mentors to be influential in their decision to participate in their high school band program. Participants perceive band program participation as an experience that yields many sacrifices, but will set them up for success in the post-secondary endeavors, provides them with a supportive social group, and serves as a reflection of their culture.  </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this dissertation, the work presented describes an integrated microfluidic system composed of pressure driven perfusion and online measurement techniques for analyses of hepatic metabolism. The liver is primarily made up of hepatocytes, which undergo anabolic and catabolic pathways in response to hormonal stimuli from the pancreas in order to maintain blood glucose homeostasis; therefore, faults in the mechanisms involving hepatocytes can have a detrimental effect on glucose metabolism. Type II diabetes, which is now a worldwide pandemic, is a result of defective insulin secretion from the pancreas and insulin resistance in surrounding tissues, ultimately leading to abnormal glucose levels in the blood. It is important to investigate the secretory patterns of pancreatic hormones such as insulin, to determine how their dynamic profiles contribute to effective glucose handling, which is gradually lost in patients with Type II diabetes, and as early as pre-diabetes.1,2 This will potentially shed light on the mechanisms behind proper glucose regulation in the body, and therefore facilitate therapeutic approaches to managing glucose levels. To investigate this, an in vitro system was developed to enable automated perfusion of pancreatic hormones to hepatocytes, coupled with real-time detection of metabolic output. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>With an in vitro system, it is necessary to mimic as best as possible cellular architecture in order to depict accurate structure and function of an organ. For this purpose, a microfluidic bioreactor was developed in order to generate an environment for liver cells to grow in 3D, similar to in vivo. This liver-on-a-chip allowed for successful growth, viability, and metabolic function of hepatocytes over time. Fluorescence detection was directly interfaced with the liver-on-a-chip and used for highly sensitive, continuous online measurement of extracellular secretions in order to quantify various components of metabolism, such as glucose, during long-term culture and in near realtime. Glucose was measured via an online Amplex Red based assay, which was optimized for direct on-chip analysis incorporated into the output of the liver-on-a-chip. The combined extracellular samples and assay reagents were encapsulated into microfluidic nanoliter droplets, resulting in a quick reaction time due to rapid mixing, while maintaining accurate readings.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In order to determine whether the newly developed online assay could be used for in vitro measurements, glucose consumption rates were measured in the absence and presence of insulin. The liver-on-a-chip device, which accurately mimicked the structure and metabolic function of the liver, was perfused with various solutions of pancreatic hormones in order to generate different aspects of glucose metabolism using the automated pressure-driven flow system. During perfusion, the extracellular output from the bioreactor was coupled with enzymatic assay reagents to determine extracellular glucose levels. The combined solutions were encapsulated into the droplet based microfluidic system, and the intensity of the resulting fluorescent product in the droplets was measured and directly correlated with glucose concentration. This allowed for measurement and quantification of rapid changes in glucose output from hepatocytes in response to pancreatic hormone perfusion online and in near real-time. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Since healthy pancreatic hormone secretions that are pulsatile and out of phase are gradually lost at the onset of diabetes, this suggests that inter-islet synchronization that occurs in the pancreas is also lost, and ultimately results in improper glucose production and storage by the liver. Dynamic stimulation of insulin is more effective in maintaining healthy blood glucose concentrations overall, but how the normal and altered dynamic profiles affect glucose metabolism in the liver specifically is not completely understood. Using the coupled microfluidic system for perfusing hepatocytes with pancreatic hormones and detecting their metabolic output, dynamic insulin stimulation was recreated in vitro, allowing for the effect of pulsed insulin characteristics on glucose consumption in hepatocytes to be observed and quantified online and in near real-time. In the future, the perfusion system can be expanded to deliver additional dynamic hormone perfusion profiles in further investigation. The detection system can also be expanded to incorporate multi-detection of additional components involved in hepatic glucose metabolism using similar Amplex Red based assays.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This thesis aims to develop a deeper understanding of perovskite thin film growth and stability for integration into photodetectors for mechanoluminescent sensing applications. Photodetectors play an important role in our society, acting as the sensing mechanism for most remotes, switches, triggers, and indicators. As new thin-film semiconducting materials are synthesized, the volumetric footprint of photodetectors decreases to opens doors for multi-functional materials such as wearable electronics and sensor integrated composites. The recent synthesis of methylammonium lead halide perovskite has triggered a renaissance due to being solution processable and high performing at relatively low fabrication cost. The optoelectronic properties of perovskite are strongly dependent on the crystalline quality and morphology of the film. Uniform temperature strongly affects nucleation and grain growth rate, which dictate the morphology, uniformity, coverage, and quality of the perovskite layer. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	A novel heating method was developed in an effort to gain uniform temperature control during the perovskite annealing and deposition process. This novel method was applied to carbon nanotube yarns (CNYs), which resulted in the successful fabrication of flexible wire-shaped photodetectors. The CNY perovskite photodetectors produced a competitive detectivity (1.76 x 1011 Jones), on/off ratio (45), and response time (0.132 s), but suffered instability due to the perovskite’s reaction to high temperatures and moisture.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Thin-film growth dynamics of the more stable ‘triple cation’ perovskite (TCP) (Cs0.05(FA100-xMAx)0.95Pb(I1-xBrx)3) were studied which revealed crystallinity could be improved through the tuning of both the organic cation and halide sites. The transition toward scalable fabrication methods was made by studying the material’s behavior towards anti-solvent bath crystallization. It was revealed that the use of diethyl ether would lower the annealing temperature, which resulted in thermally stable, phase pure, high quality, large grain thin films. Photodetectors were fabricated using the optimized TCP, which showed stability towards temperatures of 85° C for up to 10 hours with an extremely rapid response time of 12.4 μs. Finally, a model predicting TCP film quality as a function of annealing time and temperature was developed to calculate ideal annealing conditions for future commercial and scientific applications.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The dissertation presents a series of hydrogeological studies related to mixing of lake water and groundwater in the Upper Florida aquifer system. In the study area located in the Northern Highland of Florida, two sinkholes were developed on lakebed of Lake Miccosukee in late January or early February of 2018. Lake water directly drained into the sinkholes, and discharged at downgradient springs. A dye tracing experiment conducted in April 2018 indicates that lake water discharges at Natural Bridge Spring, a first-magnitude spring located 32 km downgradient from the lake. The objective of this dissertation research is to use isotope analysis and groundwater modeling to advance our understanding of the mixing of lake water and groundwater in the aquifer.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Oxygen and hydrogen isotopes were used to detect the hydraulic connection between the sinkhole lake and the karst spring. By collecting water samples from the lake, the spring, and groundwater wells during 10/2019 – 1/2020, it was found that, after removing rainfall effects on isotopic signature in spring water, mixing of heavy-isotope-enriched lake water into groundwater explains increased isotope ratios of spring water. This detects the hydraulic connection between the lake and the spring, and such a detection at the scale of tens of kilometers and for a first-magnitude spring has not been reported in the literature. Spring hydrograph mixing fraction calculation during storm indicate that relative contribution of different sources decreases in the order of groundwater (10–93 %), birdsink flow (45–76 %), rainwater (2–41 %) and lake water (4 -14%).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The isotope analysis was extended to include the other two sinkhole lakes, i.e., Lake Jackson and Lake Iamonia, in the Tallahassee area, to study lake water and groundwater mixing at a larger scale. Based on δ18O isotopes in lake water and groundwater and using mass-balance mixing calculations, it is estimated that the proportion of lake water that mixes with groundwater ranges from 2 to 96 % at the wells downgradient to Lake Miccosukee. In the wells downgradient to Lake Jackson and Lake Iamonia, the mixing ratios range from 7 to 39 %. The spatial pattern of lake water and groundwater mixing was consistent with that simulated by using a regional MODFLOW model developed by the Northwest Florida Water Management District. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>An indirect evidence of lake water draining into lakebed sinkhole can be found by analyzing the relation between lake stage and hydraulic head downgradient to the lake, because the lake water drainage can potentially impact the groundwater head through groundwater flows from karst conduits to matrix. The processes governing the interactions between sinkhole lake water and groundwater vary in time and space. To capture the dynamics of the interaction, it is necessary to derive indicator parameters that can serve as proxies to lake water recharge via lakebed sinkholes. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to identify the indicator parameters for groundwater wells downgradient of Lake Miccosukee. The PCA approach highlighted differences between hydraulic heads at observation wells and the response of lake stage fluctuations. Three observation wells were shown to be representative of dynamics of lake water and groundwater interaction in the study area. The PCA results also indicated that the magnitude of hydraulic connection was greater in the downgradient from Lake Miccosukee due to presence of karst conduits. Groundwater head and lake stage are recommended as a combined proxy for understanding the dynamics of lake water and groundwater interaction in the study area. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Chan-Vese is a level set method that simultaneously evolves a level set surface and fits locally constant intensity models for the interior and exterior regions to minimize a Mumford-Shah integral. However, the length-based contour regularization in the Chan-Vese formulation is quite simple and too weak for many applications. In this dissertation we introduce a generalization of the Chan-Vese method to evolve a curve where the regularization is based on a Fully Convolutional Neural Network. We also show how to learn the curve model as a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using training examples. Our RNN differs from the standard ones because it has the Chan-Vese locally constant intensity model, which gives it better interpretability and flexibility.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Developers often need additional knowledge to complete some programming tasks, and they oftenseek information online to solve the problem at hand. Fortunately, online resources contain a vast
amount of information at the developers’ disposal, captured in (Q&amp;A) websites, API documentation, programming blogs, and even videos. In programming videos, developers share programming
knowledge by recording their screens and going through step-by-step instructions. Videos have
become pervasive among developers as they are easier to prepare than text documents, and they
are more interactive and engaging. Despite these advantages, the process of finding a relevant video
to a programming task is overwhelming and requires considerable effort and time due to the visual
nature of the data.
In this dissertation, we devise techniques to make programming videos more accessible and
reachable. More specifically, we introduce an approach to locate code editing windows in video
frames to improve the accuracy of the code extraction process. In addition, we introduce UIScreens,
an approach and tool to extract mobile Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) from mobile programming
screencasts and complement videos with a sufficient and unique list of GUIs. Last, we introduce
vid2meta, an approach meant to complement the metadata of Android programming screencasts
with a list of Java, XML, and GUI elements automatically extracted from the contents of the video.
The aim of this work is in (i) helping developers decide if a video is relevant to their task and (ii)
enabling developers to search and navigate to the textual code-related contents of videos.
We illustrate that the approaches introduced in this dissertation represent non-trivial advancements in mining video programming tutorials through a series of empirical evaluations and user
studies that demonstrate the accuracy, usability, usefulness, and flexibility of our approaches.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Spatio-temporal surveillance has found increasing applications recently in various domains including disease outbreak detection, urban crime monitoring, medical image analysis and computer network intrusion detection. The objective of spatio-temporal surveillance is to quickly detect changes or shifts in the incidence rate of an event in a regional cluster from sequentially observed spatial data.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Most of the existing research on spatiotemporal surveillance focused on detecting step shifts in the rate parameter. However, in many applications the rate parameter can change according to a linear or nonlinear drift pattern and therefore it is of practical interest to implement space-time monitoring for trend type shifts. Further, a drawback of the current cumulative sum (CUSUM) monitoring schemes is that they are designed to detect a particular shift size or trend slope and may perform far from optimal for detecting shifts of sizes smaller or larger than that particular shift. In this research, we propose a new robust space-time CUSUM monitoring method for regional Poisson count data subject to linear trends. The method is robust in the sense that multiple CUSUMs are used in surveillance, each optimized for a different shift. The research proposes to evaluate the proposed method versus single chart approach using Monte Carlo simulation under various conditions including (i) monitored region size (ii) varied infection rates and (iii) linear and non-linear drift patterns. Real life application of the methods in public health will be presented using the most recent COVID-19 virus infections in the State of Florida.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The error-related negativity (ERN), a fronto-centrally maximal negative deflection within 100 ms of error commission, reflects individual differences in the sensitivity to making mistakes and has been linked with some anxiety-related disorders. Growing research has not supported a relationship between the ERN and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which may reflect that error-commission on traditional tasks does not tap into PTSD-relevant concerns. The current study sought to evaluate whether linking error-commission with a PTSD-relevant concern (i.e., fears of anxious arousal) yielded a component that was sensitive to PTSD severity. The current study utilized three versions of a flanker task: Neutral, delayed hyperventilation (DHv) punishment for error commission, and noise blast punishment. In partial support of expectations, those who rated the DHv manipulation as more believable exhibited a significantly larger ERN in the hyperventilation condition relative to neutral ERN (i.e., the DHv-neutral ΔERN). Contrary to hypotheses, self-reported post-hyperventilation anxiety, anxiety sensitivity (AS), and PTSD symptoms did not predict the DHv-neutral ΔERN when using repeated measures analysis of variance or ordinary least squares regression. Exploratory analyses utilizing quantile regression revealed that the DHv-neutral ΔERN was only related to AS and PTSD symptoms at the highest quantile of each variable. PTSD symptoms also demonstrated a blunted relationship with the neutral ERN, which was not accounted for by checking behaviors, AS, age, and biological sex. Taken together, these findings support that the ERN can be modulated by the perceived consequences of making a threat-relevant mistake and provide insight into endogenous threat reactivity in PTSD.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>We present three algorithms to reduce  homogeneous linear differential equations to their simplest form. Factoring a differential operator reduces a differential equation L(y)=0 to  equations of minimal order, but this is not the only simplification one can make. There are three order-preserving transformations that can change the degree of the coefficients. To fully simplify a differential equation, after the order is minimized, we want to find the smallest equation that can be reached under any order-preserving transformations. We design  algorithms to find transformations that reduce L to its simplest form under all three transformations.  The algorithms use relative invariants and integral bases for differential operators. We give an algorithm to find all relative invariants, and we generalize a prior integral basis algorithm to cover all cases.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Prestressed concrete is used in structures because of its versatility, adaptability, and durability. Durability of prestressed concrete bridges in extremely aggressive environments is of increasing concern because of corrosion of the carbon steel strands that are typically used for prestressing. Concrete is a permeable material where chloride ions can penetrate through and reach the internal reinforcement and carbon steel strands are highly susceptible to corrosion. Thus, prestressed concrete bridges located in areas with high exposure to environmental factors (e.g., marine environments) deteriorate due to corrosion of carbon steel strands. For example, Florida has a long coastline, with many concrete bridges over coastal water. Among the 12,518 bridges in Florida, 6,303 are prestressed concrete, and almost half of them are older than 40 years. One solution to overcome the early deterioration of coastal bridges is to use corrosion-resistant strands, such as Duplex High-Strength Stainless Steel (HSSS) strands.HSSS strands have high corrosion resistance and are an alternative to carbon steel strands in concrete bridges in extremely aggressive environments. The growing interest in using stainless steel strands has led to the development of the ASTM A1114. In 2020, ASTM A1114 was released as a standard specification for low-relaxation, seven-wire, Grade 240, stainless steel strands for prestressed concrete. Stainless steel is made from different alloys compared to carbon steel, and thus the mechanical properties of stainless steel strands are fundamentally different than those of carbon steel strands. The most significant difference is in the guaranteed ultimate strain:  the value for stainless steel strands is only 1.4%.
Several departments of transportation (DOTs) have already used or allowed the use of HSSS strands in prestressed piles. As of 2020, a total of 17 projects have used stainless steel strands, a majority of them in piles. Those projects are in areas with high exposure to environmental factors. The use of HSSS strands in flexural members has been hindered by the lack of full-scale test results, structural design approaches, and/or design guidelines. The main concern in using HSSS strands in flexural members is their low ductility. Concrete members prestressed with HSSS strands, if not properly designed, might fail suddenly without adequate warning. There have been no attempts to address this problem in full-scale research studies.
The goals of this research project were to investigate the use of HSSS strands in flexural members and to develop design guidelines that could be used by bridge engineers. A total of thirteen (13) 42-ft-long AASHTO Type II girders were designed, fabricated, and tested in flexure or shear. Ten (10) girders were prestressed with HSSS strands, while the other three (3) were prestressed with carbon steel strands and served as control girders. This research program included experimental activities to determine the mechanical and bond strength characteristics, prestress losses, and transfer length of 0.6-in-diameter HSSS strands.
Twenty HSSS strands from two spools were tested in direct tension. A stress-strain equation is proposed for the 0.6-in.-diameter HSSS strands, which satisfied all ASTM A1114 requirements. The minimum and average bond strengths, following ASTM A1081, of six 0.6-in.-diameter HSSS strands were 15.8 kips and 17.9 kips, respectively. The minimum and average experimental ASTM A1081 bond strengths were 23.4% and 19.8% greater than the recommended values by PCI Strand Bond Task Group. The maximum measured transfer length of 0.6-in.-diameter HSSS strands was 21.5 in., which was less than the value predicted by AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications’ equation for carbon steel strands.
Experimental flexural and shear results showed that the post-cracking behavior of girders prestressed with HSSS strands continued to increase up to failure with no discernible plateau. The behavior is attributed to the stress-strain behavior of the HSSS strands. Also, flexural results revealed that, although HSSS strands have low ductility and all composite girders failed due to rupture of strands, the girders exhibited large reserve deflection and strength beyond the cracking load and provided significant and substantial warning through large deflection, as well as well-distributed and extensive flexural cracking, before failure. A non-linear analytical model and an iterative numerical model were developed to predict the flexural behavior of concrete members prestressed with HSSS strands. Although the analytical model gave better predictions, the iterative numerical approach is slightly conservative and is easier to use for design – designers prefer to use an equation type of approach to perform preliminary designs. Numerical equations were developed to calculate the nominal flexural resistance for flexural members prestressed with HSSS strands. The proposed equations are only valid for rectangular sections. In the case of flanged sections, iterative numerical approaches were also introduced.
Because HSSS strand is a brittle material, the design must consider the strain capacity of the strand and must be balanced between flexural strength and ductility.  Based on the flexural design philosophy for using carbon steel strands in prestressed concrete girders, along with experimentally-observed behaviors and analytical results for concrete members prestressed with HSSS strands, flexural design guidelines were developed for the use of HSSS strands in flexural members. For I-girders, rupture of strands failure mode is recommended by assuring that concrete in the extreme compression fiber reaches considerable inelastic stresses, at least 0.7f_c^'.  For slab beams (e.g. Florida Slab Beam), crushing of concrete failure mode is recommended by assuring that the net tensile strain in the HSSS strand is greater than 0.005. The recommended maximum allowable jacking stress and stress immediately prior to transfer are 75% and 70%, respectively. A resistance factor of 0.75 is recommended for both rupture of strand and crushing of concrete failure modes. AASHTO equations conservatively estimated the measured transfer length and prestress losses of 0.6-in.-diameter HSSS strands. The ACI 318-19 and AASHTO LRFD conservatively predicted the shear capacity of concrete girders prestressed with HSSS strands.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Access to high quality curriculum through acceleration/college preparatory programs is essential to student success in their post-secondary education and opportunities. However, African-American and Hispanic minority students are disproportionately underrepresented in these programs. These lower rates of participation have the potential to impact that post-secondary outcomes. This exploratory study seeks to understand, from the perspective of students, how they make decisions to participate in one such program, the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program. In this study, two student focus groups of six participants each were chosen using a purposive convenience sampling. These focus groups consisted of students who applied for participation and were accepted to the program and students who declined to apply for the program. A total of six individual parent interviews, three parents representing each focus group, were employed to provide additional data and background to better understand data collected during student interviews. The findings from these interviews informed the findings. The findings reveal that there were four primary themes by which students and families based their decision making. These themes included workload and stress, social relationships, family influence, and access to information. These factors worked in concert to frame student and parent beliefs regarding the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program. While students and families in both groups saw the same factors as important, they came to differing conclusions regarding enrollment based on the social and cultural contexts of the students. The social and cultural contexts of students and parents strongly influences the way in which they process this information. Understanding the influences of this context is essential to increasing minority student enrollment in the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Whether the discussion occurs among scholars, video game critics, or everyday gamers, the video games held up as exemplars of the medium’s artistic potential (so-called “art games”) are those that inspire complex emotional responses. A game’s soundtrack functions to underscore and intensify the emotional impact of the game’s other elements. Because games that deliver particularly moving experiences are considered more artistic, and the soundtrack contributes significantly to the emotional impact of the gaming experience, music is a vital component of the elevation of a game to the status of art. This thesis examines connections between art games and music more closely. Taking three landmark games––Shadow of the Colossus, Journey, and Undertale––as case studies, I explore thematic connections between a game’s music and its broader storytelling elements. I argue that the soundtracks of these games intersect with and strengthen each game’s artistic ethos, as revealed by analysis of the music, its role in the storytelling process, and its reception in the gaming community. The concepts of hedonic enjoyment vs. eudaimonic appreciation, developed by Mary Beth Oliver, provides a framework for identifying and analyzing each game’s intended emotional impact as well as the emotional experiences of its players. This study demonstrates the central importance of music in the perception of video games as artistic experiences.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The information-seeking behavior has proven vital in understanding people's search behavior while seeking information about a particular topic or field. However, in some geographical regions, studies that focus on information-seeking behavior are few, specifically studying Arabic users' information-seeking behavior. A handful of studies investigate the information-seeking aspect of Arabic users, especially in the academic domain. Understanding the users' information need is essential to achieve satisfaction and provide reliable, easy-to-use, and intuitive services to users. This research focuses on the user's information-seeking behavior of the Saudi Digital Library (SDL). The SDL is the largest digital library in the Arab world, and it offers its services to Saudi students inland and abroad.This research aims to understand the information-seeking behavior and the needs of the SDL users and challenges they may face during their searches and report on how such difficulties may affect the users. It also aims to identify any challenges, either caused by the system or the users, and provide suggestions on how to improve the users' search experiences. Four questions have guided this research to report on the users' search experience while performing three search tasks with the user's choice of search term; an Arabic search task, an English search task, and a third task with searching in Arabic and English search terms.
Applying the Stimulated Recall method, which involves recording the searching process, I recorded the screen as the participants searched the SDL, followed by semi-structured interviews where I asked the participants to report on their search process during each task. With a convivence sample, eight participants chose to participate in this study.  Each participant's search experience has been investigated and reported on the challenges and the search behavior of each participant as individual cases. During the search process, I took memo notes of the participants' search process to record their behavior while completing the search tasks. Data were analyzed via NVivo 12.
I found that the SDL search system lacks accuracy in finding relevant results in the Arabic search and suffers from accessibility in English. Users faced difficulties with completing the search tasks; some challenges were due to the search system, and some were due to the users' information search skills. This study suggests implementing a more robust dual-language search system to help Arabic users find relevant resources quickly and easily and help the users identify and fix search errors. Around-the-clock online support would help Arabic users feel confident that they will find the needed support if they cannot find relevant resources. The study contributes to the literature regarding SDL users' behavior and Arabic users' information-seeking, which is understudied.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Testlets bring several perks in the development and administration of tests, such as 1) the construction of meaningful test items, 2) the avoidance of non-relevant context exposure, 3) the improvement of testing efficiency, and 4) the progression of testlet items requiring higher thinking skills. Thus, the inclusion of testlets in educational assessments are prevailing. However, the violation of local item independence (LII) assumption because of the inclusion of testlet items is of paramount concern for the accuracy and precision of psychometric procedures, especially when unidimensional IRT models are mostly used in educational assessments.A Monte Carlo study was conducted to systematically investigate the impact on the accuracy and precision of psychometric procedures due to the various approaches to local item dependence (LID), which are the following. First, the 2 parameter-logistic (PL) model or 3PL model are under the ignoring approach in which no action is taken to handle LID. Second, the graded response model (GRM), the generalized partial credit model (GPCM), and the nominal response model (NRM) are under the aggregation approach in which testlet items’ scores are aggregated to handle LID. Third, the GRM is under the Response Pattern Coding (RPC) approach in which Testlet items’ unique response patterns are coded to handle LID (rpcGRM). Fourth, the BiFactor model and the testlet response theory (TRT) model are under the multidimensional approach in which a complex model is employed to handle LID. The current study compared the four approaches (i.e., ignoring, aggregation, RPC, and multidimensional) to LID in estimating (a) the item parameters for regular test items; (b) the individuals’ latent traits under EAP, and MAP scoring methods; (c) the empirical reliability under EAP, and MAP scoring methods; and (d) the classification agreement and classification accuracy indices under EAP, and MAP scoring methods.
The results of the study showed that the inclusion of testlets greatly impacted the psychometric procedures, and the approaches to handle LID succeed merely in mitigating the problems. Additionally, the impact of the inclusion of testlets increased as the local item dependence levels, the proportion of testlet items, and the use of multiple-choice testlet items increased. Therefore, educational assessment developers should be cautious when including testlets in future test development procedures. The result of this study found that the RPC approach performed optimally in recovering both item and individual parameters and producing accurate empirical reliability and classification accuracy values when testlet items were multiple-choice items. However, when testlet items were non-multiple-choice items, the aggregation and the RPC approaches were the optimal choices followed by the multidimensional and the ignoring approaches consecutively.

            <DISS_para>Supercomputers play an essential role in performing computationally intensive tasks in various scientific fields. As supercomputers move toward the next milestone in computing power, exascale computing, interconnection networks become a critical factor that limits the performance. My dissertation research explores opportunities to improve interconnection network architecture. In particular, I have focused on two promising networks for future supercomputers, Dragonfly and Jellyfish. Dragonfly is used in the current generation of supercomputers and has been proposed for the next generation of systems, while Jellyfish has been shown to be more cost-efficient than the widely used fat-tree topology. I evaluate variations of the networks and develop routing schemes that are more effective on these two topologies than existing schemes. These techniques will likely have an impact on the design of future supercomputers</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The ancient historian Josephus records that Palestine witnessed a surge in Jewish sectarianism during the second and first c. BCE, resulting in the proliferation of groups associated with the Pharisees, Sadducees, Essenes, and Qumran sects. The discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, a collection of ancient sectarian manuscripts from the first c. BCE, offers an unprecedented glimpse into the debates and social issues that generated and sustained sectarian identities during this period. This project addresses the following stream of questions: what was it about the context of late Second Temple Judea that made this area/time so fertile for the emergence of sectarian organizations and how did that context give shape to various ideological and structural paradigms associated with Jewish sects? Scholarship has concluded that ancient Jewish sectarianism derives its origin from the widespread cultural debates over halakhah and/or politics that characterize the late Second Temple period. That is, sectarian research generally frames those groups as political and/or theological protest movements and studies sectarian groups principally in relation to their beliefs which stand in opposition to a normative church or political institution. This is largely due to the fact that scholarship of ancient Jewish sectarianism invariably draws its methodological frameworks from Bryan Wilson and/or Rodney Stark and William Sims Bainbridge, each of whom preserve the church-sect dichotomy and protest language originally proposed in Max Weber’s pioneering definition of sectarianism. However, this two-fold framework of sectarianism oversimplifies the complex formation of sectarian groups and ideologies. Instead, this project blends methodological insights from David Chalcraft’s reading of Weber and Karl Marx’s historical materialism in order to better understand the material economic conditions that undergird the emergence of sectarian groups and the production of sectarian ideologies. In so doing, this project argues that Jewish sectarianism flourished in the late Second Temple period because of the increasingly desperate and precarious economic conditions in which most of the population lived.The first half of this dissertation reconstructs the economic atmosphere of Ptolemaic, Seleucid, and Hasmonean Palestine, emphasizing the degree to which class violence and macroeconomic changes with regard to coinage, tenancy, and taxation resulted in an extremely anxious situation for the Judean peasantry. These chapters argue that extant literature from the late Second Temple period, including the Zenon Papyri, 4QInstruction, and Ben Sira, attest to an overwhelming economic malaise which emerged from an increasingly precarious economic landscape and generated interest in sectarian activity. The second half of the project then examines the way in which the economic context of the second and first c. BCE influenced the nature of the sectarian ideologies and structures depicted in the extant Dead Sea Scrolls. This project’s methodological approach to sectarianism based on a reinterpretation of Weber and Marx’s Materialismus highlights the material backgrounds that engender the development of unique ideologies and organizational practices. Chapters Four and Five thus argue that the precarious economic atmosphere of late Second Temple Palestine shaped the way the sectarian texts understood and articulated the concept of election and the way sectarian groups managed the wealth of its constituents in cooperative ways so as to obviate the need for excessive borrowing and prevent the accumulation of debt. This approach sheds light on the way that the sectarian texts represent the value of sectarian membership in relation to monetary wealth, consistently emphasizing the superiority of the former in juxtaposition to the latter. Therefore, the second half of this project interprets the sectarian Dead Sea Scrolls in relation to their economic context in order to illuminate the complex relationship that exists between ancient Jewish sects and the depleting financial conditions of Hellenistic and Hasmonean rule in ancient Palestine. Altogether, I submit that scholarship can better understand the representations of sectarian ideologies and organizational patterns in the Dead Sea Scrolls when they are read in direct conjunction with the economic context of the ancient world.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Collective protein structural transitions couple with fluctuations of their aqueous environment to enable biological function. Although decades of experiment have investigated protein-motion hy- dration couplings, atomistic details regarding global hydration structures and their transitions as- sociated with large-scale protein motions have remained elusive. This knowledge gap has hindered computer aided drug design strategies which fail to account for protein and aqueous structural transitions in a physically rigorous manor. Consequently, the detection of hidden drug binding sites hypothesized to form during rare conformational transitions has proven to be exceedingly difficult. These elusive pockets are named cryptic sites, and are of immense therapeutic value due to their ability to couple to enzymatic active sites and allosterically modulate catalytic activity. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations provide excellent spatial and temporal resolution to observe protein and hydration dynamics but struggle to adequately sample cryptic site formations. Over the past decade the Yang lab has worked to overcome this deficiency by developing the Orthog- onal Space Tempering (OST) enhanced sampling technique, uniquely designed to accelerate rare conformational transitions of biomolecules and their environment.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The focus of this dissertation is to enrich computational drug development by understanding how collective protein motions are coupled to the aqueous environment. Towards this goal, a novel toolkit of GPU-accelerated algorithms has been developed to 1) elucidate the hydration structure enveloping proteins, 2) reveal collective protein and water structural fluctuations, and 3) map causal dynamics throughout proteins and their environment. These algorithms are first utilized on the millisecond long MD simulation of Bovine Pancreatic Trypsin Inhibitor (BPTI) performed by D. E. Shaw Research, one of the longest MD simulations performed to date. BPTI has been thoroughly investigated by biophysicists for decades and is known to harbor several buried water molecules, making it a fertile system to investigate hydration couplings. By application of our toolkit, we successfully characterize known conformational transitions of BPTI and elucidate how these motions are coupled to, and to an extent caused by, the aqueous environment. Next, OST is utilized to simulate TEM-1 β-lactamase, an enzyme that harbors a pair of cryptic sites capable of modulating the degradation of β-lactam antibiotics, making it a valuable therapeutic target in the fight against antibiotic resistance. Application of our toolkit characterizes large scale motions of TEM-1 and its aqueous environment, including expansions of the cryptic site cavities and the active site, which are connected to each other by structural hydration linkages. We then reveal immense couplings between TEM-1 and aqueous conformational transitions and investigate causal dynamics among the cryptic sites, active site, and the environment. Through the culmination of these analysis, we identify a prospective cryptic site that is allosterically linked to the active site by collective hydration fluctuations. In summary, the work presented here provides a promising foundation to enrich computational drug development strategies by understanding the intimate relationship between proteins and the aqueous environment.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Hans Werner Henze’s music is shaped by his trauma from the atrocities of Nazi Germany and the issue of German identity in the years following World War II. He became an outspoken anti-fascist. His compositional style is a freely tonal 12-note idiom, and his output includes theater pieces, ballet music, operas, symphonies, string quartets, chamber music, and guitar music.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The guitarist Julian Bream encouraged Henze to write a significant work for solo guitar. Henze composed the monumental Royal Winter Music Sonata I, a collection of Shakespearean character portraits. He later composed Royal Winter Music Sonata II, completing the cycle.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This treatise provides a theory of Royal Winter Music Sonata I that addresses connections between movements and characters with the goal of delineating an overall narrative arc. The analysis takes the form of an overview of the Shakespearean play and important characters and character relations followed by a detailed examination of the respective movement. The methodology reconciles the work’s resistance to confinement of the musical language as either tonal or atonal, its premise of portraying Shakespearean characters, and the notion that it is an interconnected cycle. This method freely employs literary, narratological, psychoanalytic, psychologic, and musical historical lenses in what can be called a semiotic analysis. It yields an interpretation of Royal Winter Music Sonata I where a consistent structure encounters resistance. Atonality, rhythmic irregularity, and descending pitch and phrase contours are the structure’s initial signatures. It is ruptured to the point that a new universality is posited.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, the purpose of this study was to describe and analyze the characteristics of existing choral pedagogical repertoire for early adolescent males, and to place those findings within a broader historical framework. Specifically, the study endeavored to answer the following research questions: (1) what are the vocal classifications (number of parts, names of parts, terminal pitches, ranges, and tessituras) used in choral repertoire for early adolescent males? (2) What are the textual aspects (subject matter, emotion, text sources, language, and complexity) used in choral repertoire for early adolescent males? (3) What are the formal and theoretical aspects of a composition (basic characteristics, pitched aspects, unpitched aspects, and accompaniment) used in choral repertoire for early adolescent males?</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The methodology involved a descriptive study of a representative sample of pedagogical choral works for early adolescent males (N = 106) collected from honor choir past-programs at the state and national level of the American Choral Director’s Association (ACDA) and the National Association for Music Education (NAfME) from 2010–2020, repertoire &amp; resource lists from state and national chapters of ACDA from 2010–2020, large-group performance evaluation repertoire lists from state levels of ACDA &amp; NAfME, and evidence-based repertoire lists for early adolescent males. Each octavo was individually examined and information was recorded on a data collection sheet prepared by the researcher consisting of 90 elements per octavo.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Results indicated that the terminal pitches, ranges, and tessituras found within the representative repertoire adequately conformed to the stages of male adolescent voice change proposed by Cooksey, particularly within 3-part octavos. Furthermore, the historical and contemporary re-framing of singing as a masculine activity as a means of choral recruitment appears to have had widespread effects on the subject matters and emotions found within the representative body of repertoire. Finally, while there is now a greater body of vocally-appropriate literature for changing male voices at present than at any previous point in history, the representative body of repertoire was noticeably lacking in diversity, particularly with regard to textual aspects of subject matter, emotion, and language; as well as formal and theoretical aspects of musical composition such as tonality, meter, and musical traditions. By placing the results of this study within a broad framework established by the review of literature, a number of potential best-practices regarding the choral music education of early adolescent males were proposed, including implications for the creation and programming of works for changing male voices, new directions for adolescent music education research, and the potential reframing of singing as a gender-neutral activity. It is hoped that the findings from this study will aid in the selection and cultivation of a wider body of quality pedagogical choral repertoire designed to meet the unique physiological, neurological, and sociological needs of early adolescent males.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Although slavery was abolished over 150 years ago, research suggests that the effects of slavery are everlasting. Coined the “legacy effect”, scholars argue that the abolishment of slavery did not mark the end of slavery’s deleterious effects. Instead, slavery and its consequences—both intentional and unintentional—continue to be consequential for a number of contemporary outcomes. Notably, prior research has demonstrated a relationship between an area’s connection with slavery and Black-White disparities in occupational stratification, poverty, legal executions, and education. While this body of research has furthered our understanding about how historical processes can influence contemporary outcomes, gaps in the literature remain.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Indeed, slavery was largely a violent institution. Yet, there has been limited empirical attention given to the how the institution of slavery may be consequential for contemporary acts of violence, especially violent acts targeting Blacks. Moreover, there is a paucity of research examining the mechanisms that undergird this relationship. Hence, the purpose of this dissertation is to explore these issues by specifically investigating whether county-level slave populations are predictive of anti-Black hate crimes. This dissertation draws on two theoretical perspectives—the defended neighborhoods perspective and intergroup contact theory—to explain how structural conditions, such as racial segregation and the size of the White population, might aid in explaining the victimization of Blacks in these areas. The first study of this dissertation explores whether the relationship between slavery and anti-Black hate crimes is mediated and moderated by racial segregation. The second study examines whether the relationship between slavery and hate crimes targeting Blacks is mediated and moderated by the size of the White population.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To test these ideas, this dissertation draws data from several sources, including the 1860 and 2000 U.S. Census and 2000-2015 Uniform Crime Report (UCR). The findings reveal that slavery is associated with higher instances of anti-Black hate crimes in a county. Specifically, counties that had a larger concentration of slaves also report an increased number of hate crimes against Blacks. Although the analyses do not provide support for racial segregation mediating the slavery/anti-Black hate crimes relationship, the analyses reveals that the relationship between slavery and anti-Black hate crimes is moderated by racial segregation. Lastly, while the findings provide no support that slavery and hate crimes are mediated by the size of the White population, this dissertation finds support for the size of the White population moderating the relationship between slavery and hate crimes targeting Blacks.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The goal of this dissertation was to advance understanding of family financial socialization in Black families by documenting specific content socialized, how (implicit or purposive) that content was socialized, and the relation of such family financial socialization experiences with two financial outcomes: (a) financial attitudes and (b) financial well-being. The current study was guided by theories of socialization (Arnett, 1995; Bales &amp; Parsons, 2014; Baltes &amp; Schaie, 2013; Grusec &amp; Hastings, 2014) and the Family Financial Socialization Model (Gudmunson and Danes, 2011), interpreted through the lens of critical race theory (Delgado &amp; Stefancic, 2012). Analysis was conducted using Pearson’s correlations, Independent samples t-tests, and Stepwise Regressions. Results of the study make three main contributions to the literature. First, the current study advances understanding of family financial socialization by documenting socialization experiences among African Americans, a segment of the population that has been overlooked in research on family finance. The contributions of the focus on Black people are accentuated by the use of a culturally sensitive instrument intended to capture potential financial socialization strategies unique to Black people because of their history of oppression and institutional racism. Second, it provides evidence of gender differences in how Black families financially socialize their members. Third, it demonstrates that previously documented (Klontz and Britt, 2011) relationships between financial attitudes and financial well-being among White people does not mirror the same relationship among Black people.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Previous scholarship on abortion in the ancient Mediterranean world has often characterized Christians as absolutely opposed to abortion because of concern for the life of the fetus. By analyzing several of the ancient Greek and Latin texts that are considered in these histories, I reveal that ancient Christians used the language of abortion "to think with." That is, abortion was a rhetorical device by which ancient Christians attempted to define the boundaries of their identities and assert their dominance. Whether by talking about abortion to differentiate themselves from others, to slander their opponents, or to assert dominance by defining behavior as deviant, my analysis shows that there is no unified or absolute position on abortion in ancient Christian communities. I take my analysis a step further by considering how the grand narrative of "absolute" opposition to abortion reveals little about the ancient context and instead speaks more to the present-day concerns and interests of the modern scholars themselves. In this work I consider the concerns and interests of John T. Noonan, Jr., one of the most prominent proponents of this grand narrative. I situate John Noonan in the social world of debates over contraception during the Second Vatican Council and the burgeoning movement to legalize abortion in America in the 1960s and 1970s. I also trace the way that Noonan transforms his grand narrative in the wake of the 1973 Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton opinions. As I show in my analysis, Noonan engages in a series of discursive strategies to cast his grand narrative of Christian opposition to abortion in naturalized and universalized terms considered acceptable in the American political sphere. This study offers an important disruption of this grand narrative about abortion in the ancient world while also demystifying the ideological interests and presuppositions of perhaps the most influential advocate of the myth of ancient Christian moral supremacy.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Shockwave boundary layer interactions (SBLI) occur on both internal and external surfaces and adversely affect both the structural and propulsive performance of high-speed flight vehicles operating in the trans/super/hypersonic flow regimes. In the absence of a comprehensive understanding of the flow physics associated with SBLI, the most common approach to mitigating the negative ramifications is structural over-design, often resulting in reduced aero-propulsion efficiencies and excessive cost. SBLI have been the subject of numerous experimental and numerical investigations focusing on simplified two-dimensional (2-D) canonical configurations derived from relatively complicated aircraft/turbomachinery components. A few recent studies have focused on addressing the knowledge gaps by examining component geometries that produce three-dimensional (3-D) SBLI and therefore a closer representation of real-world configurations. 
The current experimental investigation explores the viscous/inviscid interaction of an incoming supersonic turbulent boundary layer and a single, sharp unswept fin generated shockwave. This kind of SBLI is of keen interest to the high-speed aerodynamics community as the separated flow induces a strong crossflow component, giving rise to a highly 3-D flowfield. Although previous studies on 3-D SBLI have provided a substantial knowledge base, there are still a number of consequential questions pertaining to the flowfield topology and dynamical behavior that remain unanswered. First, what is the effect of Reynolds number on SBLI flow features, in particular, the length scales associated with the shock-induced separation region and its interaction with the shock generator (sharp-fin)? Second, what is the extent of facility dependence on the 3-D SBLI?  Which, if any, component(s) of the unsteadiness is inherent to the interaction and which are facility dependent and therefore limit or bias the flowfield? Are the geometric and boundary layer constraints imposed by the size of the facility necessary for numerical simulations to ensure the proper development of scaling parameters as experiments shift from the laboratory scale to flight testing. Finally, how do the spatio-temporal scales associated with SBLI vary with the interaction strength? The main objective of the present experimental study is to answer the posed questions by conducting a detailed flowfield analysis of the sharp fin induced SBLI over a range of Reynolds numbers and interaction strengths. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The research methodology involves high-fidelity experiments at the state-of-the-art wind tunnel facilities housed at the Florida Center for Advanced Aero-Propulsion at Florida State University and the data available from previously published literature. Cutting-edge global flowfield diagnostics allow for the full-field reconstruction of both skin friction (mean) and pressure (time-averaged/unsteady) underneath the single fin SBLI as the incoming Mach number (M∞ = 2 - 4), fin angle of attack (αF = 10° - 20°), and unit Reynolds number (Re/m  17 x 106 - 108 x 106) are parametrically varied. Reynolds number sweeps, spanning nearly an order of magnitude, illustrate that the interaction footprint is distinctly affected by the Reynolds number, with the effects being most prominent near the fin/surface junction and the outer edges of the interaction near the freestream boundary. The results indicate that the interaction flowfield becomes less receptive to Reynolds number variations as the Reynolds number continues to increase. This shrinking dependence indicates that there may be a point beyond which any further increases to the Reynolds number produce negligible differences in the flowfield i.e. Reynolds number independence. Identical surface oil flow and pressure measurements carried out in facilities of different scale/size compare favorably throughout the interaction region with Reynolds number based scaling. However, different incoming boundary layer thicknesses impose limitations on the extent of the inception region and the onset of finite fin effects. When investigating the mean skin friction between different scale facilities, the Reynolds number scaling could not be assessed due to limitations of the available data sets. An angular scaling was applied to enable proper inter-facility comparison between the conical regions of both identically matching and nominally equivalent interaction strength test cases. The results showed trends similar to those seen in the pressure measurements, with skin friction matching well between the facilities across the interaction with minor divergences in the near fin region, where viscous effects become more prominent. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Simultaneously sampled high-speed pressure transducers and fast response PSP measurements allowed for a full-field investigation of the flow dynamics. The RMS pressure field highlights regions of increased unsteadiness along the interaction boundary, inviscid shock line and at/upstream of the fin tip vertex. Increased coherence levels indicate a communication mechanism is present between the inviscid shock and the interaction boundary. When compared with studies conducted in a smaller facility, findings of the current work are consistent in both the locations of increased unsteadiness and their respective magnitudes. In addition to illustrating the robustness of these dynamical features between differing size facilities, the current work identifies the presence of elevated levels of low-frequency content. The presence of this low-frequency content has been observed in investigations associated with 2-D SBLI, but has been absent in the 3-D SBLI studies conducted in smaller facilities.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The present study has contributed significantly to a better understanding of swept 3-D SBLI, in particular, the role of Reynolds number and the size of facility on the interaction characteristics. The flowfield analysis has discovered the underlying physics associated with the fin induced SBLI. The high-fidelity experimental database generated will be very useful for the validation of numerical tools and the development of flight vehicle design guidelines.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation investigates how gender and sexuality shape people’s perceptions of aging in midlife. The study draws on two narratives about aging discussed by aging studies scholars. Decline—the predominant aging narrative—constructs aging as an accumulation of irreversible losses. A second, less prevalent narrative constructs aging as progress—emphasizing the potential for continual personal growth across middle and later life. These narratives appear to become salient in midlife. Although research reveals that views of aging as decline and progress influence people’s perceptions of aging, little is known about how these narratives may manifest differently in the lives of lesbians, gay men, straight women, and straight men. The project examined this issue, using interviews conducted with 41 middle-aged people of different gender and sexual identity backgrounds. Employing an inductive analysis, I analyzed how interviewees experienced and managed aging narratives in everyday life.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Findings reveal evidence of the decline and progress narratives, though decline was predominant. All groups perceived aging primarily as a biomedical process of declining health, which generated anxiety they attempted to quell by employing health interventions. Anxiety about decline also registered as concerns about physical appearance, especially for straight women and gay men. Evidence of the progress narrative was also present, though it manifested differently across the gender and sexuality subgroups. Men’s progress narratives emphasized their increasing usefulness to older generations. Straight men described their progress as becoming more useful to their children, and gay men spoke about their mentor status among younger LGBT people. Lesbians viewed progress as learning to stick up for themselves, and straight women viewed it as developing self-reliance. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Results offer empirical and theoretical contributions to the study of gender, sexuality, and aging, and also have policy implications for helping people better navigate aging. By focusing on how aging narratives unfold in the lives of women and men of different sexuality backgrounds, this project shows how aging anxiety is produced by many intersecting social pressures. Results also suggest that policy makers could alleviate aging anxiety in midlife by implementing policies that help people better navigating aging, such as strengthening the social safety net, increasing wages of women-dominated occupations, and legislating more LGBT and family-friendly policies.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Known as the belief about the malleability of intelligence, the concept of intelligence mindset has been embraced by the United States education system and abroad. Specifically, some research suggests that growth mindset (i.e., belief that intelligence can be changed) and fixed mindset (i.e., belief that intelligence is stable) differentially relate to achievement outcomes and are influenced by socializers’ beliefs. Other work, however, suggests that these relations are less robust than previously thought. Importantly, a reconceptualization of the construct of intelligence mindset may be warranted. In this study, I developed a novel math intelligence mindset scale for children that included growth, fixed, and items for a new type of mindset called “mixed” mindset. In a sample of 698 grade 3 students and their 59 teachers, I examined the structural validity of the new scale for children and found that math intelligence mindset was represented best when there was a combined growth and mixed mindset factor and a separate fixed mindset factor. In support of the external validity of the scale, I found that each factor of intelligence mindset was strongly related with effort beliefs and perceptions of mistakes in math and moderately related with challenge-seeking behaviors and math achievement. Student fixed intelligence mindset was consistently found to be uniquely related to student math achievement above and beyond other motivational factors. Teacher growth/mixed and fixed/mixed intelligence mindsets were important predictors of student mindsets and teacher growth mindset was important for student math achievement, but only when teacher mindsets were modeled as individual predictors. This study advances our current knowledge of intelligence mindsets by testing a new component of intelligence mindset and adding to the knowledge base about how math intelligence mindset might be conceptualized. Additionally, it can more broadly influence how the educational community might address intelligence mindsets in the classroom.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Geometrically frustrated systems have garnered much interest in recent times due to the emergence of novel magnetic states in these systems that contrast traditional cooperative magnetic phenomena. The spin ice pyrochlores Ho2Ti2O7 and Dy2Ti2O7 have been extensively studied and have been shown to posses highly degenerate ground states that lack long-range order and furnish an environment in which fractionalized excitations, that behave like magnetic monopoles, have been experimentally realized. These ground states are dictated by the competition between nearest neighbor superexchange  (Jnn) and dipolar interactions (Dnn), as well as a strong single-ion anisotropy due to the local crystal field environment of the rare-earth site. In order to determine the effects of epitaxial strain on the emergent properties of spin ice materials, we have grown strained thin films of Ho2Ti2O7 on yttria-stabilized zirconia substrates using pulsed laser deposition. We have performed an extensive study on the effects of substrate orientation, strain, stoichiometry, and defects on spin ice physics in Ho2Ti2O7. Magnetization measurements at 1.8 K show the expected magnetic anisotropy and saturation magnetization values associated with a spin ice for all orientations; shape anisotropy is apparent when comparing in and out-of-plane directions. Significantly, only the (110) oriented films display the hallmark spin ice plateau state in magnetization, albeit less well-defined compared to the plateau observed in a bulk single crystal. Further anisotropy studies performed on bulk single crystals and thin films of Ho2Ti2O7 with capacitive torque magnetometry reveal, for the first time, the rich angular phase diagram associated with the spin ice state. They also furnish a means by which to probe the energy scale associated with the spin-spin interactions (J'eff), when considering the effects of long-range dipolar interactions. We extract J'eff and find that long ranged interactions indeed play an important role. A comparison is made between the angular spin ice phase diagram of the bulk single crystal and the angular response of the thin films. This allows us to probe directly the changes in anisotropy of the films, revealing that the (110) films are the most bulk-like. These studies show that capacitive torque magnetometry is an excellent tool for distinguishing between the different spin textures of highly frustrated materials and possesses the sensitivity to accurately characterize these textures in thin films samples.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>By removing as much as 90% or more of a deep neural network's (DNN's) parameters, a wide variety of pruning approaches not only allow for DNN compression but also increase generalization (model performance on test/unseen data). This observation is in conflict with emerging DNN generalization theory and empirical observations, however, which suggest that DNNs generalize better as their parameter counts rise, despite overparameterization (use of more parameters than data points). Seeking to reconcile such modern findings and pruning-based generalization improvements, this thesis empirically studies the cause of improved generalization in pruned DNNs. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We begin by providing support for our hypothesis that pruning regularizes similarly to noise injection with a perhaps surprising result: pruning parameters more immediately important to the network leads to better generalization later, after the network has adapted to the pruning.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We show that this behavior is a manifestation of a more general phenomenon. Across a wide variety of experimental configurations and pruning algorithms, pruning's benefit to generalization increases with pruning's instability (defined as the drop in test accuracy immediately after pruning).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We study the limits of this generalization-stability tradeoff and use it to inform the derivation of a novel pruning algorithm that produces particularly unstable pruning and higher generalization. Such results suggest that  accounting for this tradeoff would improve pruning algorithm design.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Finally, we empirically examine the consistency of several generalization theories with the generalization-stability tradeoff and pruning-based generalization improvements. Notably, we find that pruning less stably heightens measures of DNN flatness (robustness to data-sample and parameter changes) that are positively correlated with generalization, and pruning-based generalization improvements are maintained when pruning is modified to only remove parameters temporarily. Thus, by demonstrating a regularization mechanism in pruning that depends on changes to sharpness-related complexity rather than parameter-count complexity, this thesis elucidates the compatibility of pruning-based generalization improvements and high generalization in overparameterized DNNs, while also corroborating the relevance of flatness to DNN generalization.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Vitrimers are a new category of polymer that incorporates an associative bond exchange molecular network rearrangement mechanism (MNR), which happens in a single step rather than in discrete dissociation and association steps. Based on a patchy particle model for vitrimers proposed by  Rovigatti et al., which predicts that vitrimers will have an angle-dependent fast relaxation mode and angle-independent slow relaxation mode, a dynamic light scattering (DLS) model was constructed. The purpose of this model is to give insight into how the various polymer network design parameters affect the relaxation time of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) vitrimer networks, which will aid with the design and analysis of future PMMA vitrimers. The parameters investigated in the vitrimer dynamics model were: number of crosslinks per polymer chain (N_x), polymer concentration (c), the activation energy of the bond exchange mechanism (E_(a,sm)), and molecular weight of the polymer chains (M_n).  Along with this, other thermodynamic and dynamic properties of PMMA chains were incorporated into the vitrimer dynamic models to improve the overall accuracy. The effects of temperature on the segmental motion (τ) of the polymer chains were captured using a shift factor (α_T) from the Williams-Landel-Ferry equation (WLF). Non-crosslinked precursor  PMMA polymers were analyzed via dynamic and static light scattering to get the diffusion coefficient (D_t) and the second virial coefficient (A_2) of various M_n PMMA. It was found that the N_x and  E_(a,sm) have the most significant influence on the relaxation time of PMMA vitrimers in all limits except for the diffusion-controlled regime. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Leadership definitions, educational approaches, and frameworks are often founded through a western lens that denigrates cultural values. With the growing Latin* student population on college campuses, there is a demand for filling the gap in empirical research and literature on Latin* leadership education. This research explored generativity and the cultural wealth model's intersections within a theoretical framework to build a culturally relevant approach to developing leadership in the Latin* student population.This research, founded on generativity and leadership, explored how Latin* students make meaning of leadership through their cultural practices of generativity through their campus organization engagements. A qualitative critical incremental case study was used to understand Latin* students' experiences in the bounded system of organizational involvement within a Hispanic Serving Institution. Purposive sampling was used to identify and invite Latin* students actively involved in their campus to participate in two interviews and journal reflections. Eleven participants contributed to the systematically analyzed data to develop a rigorous description of the common student experiences to present a more accessible framework for Latin* students to develop their leadership identity.
Each of the study participants had never heard of the generativity concept before, yet they made clear connections to it within their student organizations, their Latin* culture, and their understandings of leadership. The research provided rich responses to the research questions that demonstrate how generativity serves as a cultural gateway to supporting students' meaning-making of leadership. With the cultural connections to generativity, the participants were also able to develop their leadership identity, capacity, and efficacy after reflection on this new term. The data also largely supported the study's conceptual framework and provided implications for leadership educators, programs, and research.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Peatlands cover a small percentage of the earth surface, but the exact mechanisms of how a third of the Earths global soil carbon is sequestered is not yet resolved. Therefore, this thesis aims to explore the relationship between the chemical composition of peat soils and organic matter and their response to various physical and environmental stimuli in three standalone projects, so that we may be able to better understand the fate of the carbon currently stored in peatland systems. (1) We analyzed peat samples from the Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Changing Environments (SPRUCE) project to explore ecosystem-scale warming effects on peatland carbon storage in vegetative organic matter using Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).  We found that the depth of the sample had a larger effect than the amount of in situ heat the sample was exposed to. (2) Wooden blocks were positioned at pre-determined depths within the peat soil horizon in a bog in tropical Borneo and incrementally removed at different time points, with the last blocks being removed after eight years in situ.  By taking dimensional data from the blocks, and using FTIR to observe any shift in chemical composition, we found that the blocks mechanically decayed before large trends in chemistry emerged. Depth of the blocks and exposure to aerobic conditions were important drivers in the rate of decay in this bog system. (3) To observe how carbohydrate content drives the rate of CO2, CH4 production in anoxic peatland systems, we created incubations from peat samples representing a range of latitudes and parent vegetation. We found that the carbohydrate content positively drove the rate of CO2, CH4 production; but this was only true for samples that were not from habitats that primarily consist of Sphagnum moss. Results from our projects suggest that the current store of carbon in peatlands are compositionally stable under stress from a changing climate, at least on the timescale of this experiment. Further work is needed to fully understand the processes that govern controls on carbon storage in peatland systems as our findings raise questions that the scope of our studies do not answer.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In 1914, the United States federal government formalized efforts to reform rural living. It passed the Smith-Lever Act, which established the Cooperative Extension Service of which Home Demonstration was one component. It was designed to help disseminate information about scientific farming and new agricultural methods; home demonstration, in particular, was intended to help modernize rural life. Home demonstration agents created programming, including in-person demonstrations, aimed at alleviating struggles in rural homes. This study examines how and why rural women in Alabama and Florida used the home demonstration programming in a different, fiscally beneficial way from its inception to just before the financial collapse of the nation: 1914 and 1929. From Curb Markets to Guava Jelly demonstrates and analyzes how rural women tailored this programming to gain disposable income. Rural white and African American women in Alabama and Florida took the techniques they learned from home demonstration programming in cooking, handicrafts, sewing, and more and implemented new marketing methods for their economic benefit. By analyzing archival records, newspapers, bulletins, and other archival sources, Curb Markets to Guava Jelly reveals how rural white and African women established sources of extra income, allowing them to become the producers and consumers of their own choosing.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to conceptualize the role of prayer and relationship with God for parents who experienced the death of a child. In-depth interviews were conducted with eighteen parents (N = 18) who fall under the Protestant Christian religion. A thematic analysis was conducted, and results indicate that the role of prayer for parents before the death of a child were considered active prayers as defined by Baesler (1999) in the relational prayer theory and relationship maintenance. The role of prayer for after the death of a child for parents indicate the themes dependence on God, sensemaking, vehicle to peace and thankfulness. The results indicate that parents’ relationship with God before the death of their child was deemed as unspecific and lacking depth enough to be discussed and the relationship with God after the death of their child was noted as the relationship changed, they were closer with God and they were being carried by God. Results of this study expand on the relational prayer theory and the direct divine communication model suggested by Sigler (2014) including a discussion of receptive prayer as defined by Baelser (1999) in the relational prayer theory and of direct divine communication as defined by Sigler (2014).</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This dissertation is focused on the study of spaces called 2-stratifolds. These spaces are locally modeled on a 2-dimensional space where n-sheets meet. Unlike 2-manifolds, 2-stratifolds are not determined by their fundamental group and a complete list of 2-stratifold groups is unknown. To further understand these groups, we determine which finite groups and which abelian groups are the fundamental group of a 2-stratifold. A powerful tool for studying 2-stratifolds is the associated labelled bicolored graph. This graph essentially determines the homeomophism type. A classification of all labelled graphs that represent 1-connected trivalent 2-stratifold had been previously obtained.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We extend this classification to labelled graphs that represent trivalent 2-stratifold with finite fundamental group or abelian fundamental group.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This study aims to add to a deficit research literature at aspects of the adolescents' residential substance use treatment environment associate with engagement. Further, this study sought to explore racialized treatment experiences through the use of novel measures. This study used secondary, de-identified survey data from two sites of one residential treatment program in the same region of the United States. The final sample comprised 65 adolescents ages 13 to 18 who were enrolled in treatment from July to December of 2020. This study evinced several significant associations among social context factors (treatment relationships, program connectedness) and treatment engagement. While the categorical indicator of race and ethnicity did not emerge as a significant variable in this study, significant racialized differences were discovered on most social context variables through novel measures. This study's findings substantiate the importance of continuing the extant deficit investigation of how residential treatment centers' social environment commission or prohibit engagement and therapeutic change. Further, this study's findings affirm the imperative of continuing an intentional investigation of racial and ethnic disparities in engagement and treatment outcomes. This line of inquiry is necessary to ensure that the research literature does not inadvertently commission systemic racism through the promulgation of unsubstantiated assumptions about minoritized subpopulations. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Low resting heart rate (HR) has been established as a pervasive risk factor for the development of antisocial behavior (ASB). Work thus far has explored fearlessness and stimulation seeking as possible mechanisms responsible for the low HR–ASB relationship. The fearlessness perspective suggests individuals with a low resting HR have deficient fear systems, and that a low heart rate is an indicator of low fear. The stimulation seeking perspective posits that low resting HR is indicative of a general deficit in autonomic arousal, causing low-HR individuals to constantly seek stimulation to bring their systems back up to a normative level. Research thus far has yielded more evidence for stimulation seeking, as compared to fearlessness, in accounting for the low HR-ASB relationship. However, both stimulation seeking and fearlessness have been conflated at times in their operationalizations, making it difficult to discern which of these trait factors is most responsible. The current study explored the trait-based mechanisms underlying the low HR-ASB association in terms of the triarchic model of psychopathy. Specifically, the roles of boldness and disinhibition were evaluated using existing data from participants (N ~ 700) tested in the USC RFAB project, a large longitudinal twin study aimed at identifying risk factors for ASB by utilizing measures from different response modalities. Evidence was found for indirect effects of HR on violent and nonviolent ASB through both boldness and disinhibition, suggesting a role for both fearlessness and stimulation seeking in the relationship between low resting HR and these forms of ASB. Evidence was also found for a unique role of disinhibition in associations of low HR with antisocial personality disorder symptoms, and with externalizing problems more broadly. Lastly, HR showed a positive association with internalizing symptomatology when controlling for overlap with externalizing problems, and boldness uniquely accounted for this association. The current study advances our understanding of the possible trait-based mechanisms underlying the low HR-ASB relationship. Implications for theory and clinical intervention are discussed.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>ABSTRACTThe quality of care children receive from birth to kindergarten sets them on a trajectory for successful entry to school. Children who receive high-quality care, which is provided by qualified early educators with demonstrated mastery of the essential early learning core competencies, enter school ready to learn. Shortages of credentialed early educators are an obstacle to achieving this goal. This study investigated the employment and educational outcomes for high school students who graduated from early childhood career and technical education programs (EC-CTE) in 16 school districts in Florida and explored whether they chose to work in early learning settings directly following graduation, pursue higher education in the field of early education, or pursue career or educational options outside the field of early education.
All participants received a T.E.A.C.H. Early Childhood® scholarship to pay for the National Child Development Associate® (CDA) credential™, which is the entry-level industry standard for early educators. Information gathered from scholarship applications as well as data collected from a post-graduation survey informed the findings of this study. In general, participants felt very prepared to work in preschool settings following the completion of their EC-CTE programs and almost half were employed in early childhood settings immediately following high school. For those who worked in jobs outside the Early Childhood Education (ECE) field, more than half said they were looking for positions in early education. Most participants enrolled in college directly following high school and those who selected a major focused on “helping fields” such as elementary education, nursing, and early care and education.
These findings suggest that high school EC-CTE programs provide a strong pipeline to the early learning career pathway and that high school CTE programs should be considered a viable resource to increase the number of credentialed early educators entering the workforce. This study can be used to inform policy that adequately supports the early learning workforce and attracts and retains the qualified staff necessary to provide high quality early care and education for young children in Florida.

            <DISS_para>Understanding how massive stars explode as core-collapse supernovae (CCSN) remains an important  challenge  in  stellar  evolution  theory.   When  massive  stars  reach  the  end  of  their  lives,  the central iron core can no longer support the weight of the surrounding material.  The iron core collapses, and at nuclear densities, the core bounces, forming a proto-neutron star (PNS). This bounce launches a shock wave; however, this shock quickly stalls due to the ram pressure of the collapsing star, energy losses due to dissociation of the nuclei, and neutrino emission.  A primary challenge is understanding how the stalled shock is revived initiating the explosion that unbinds the star.  The key to successful explosions is transporting energy from the hot PNS star outward to the region just  behind  the  shock.   Theory  suggests  that  neutrinos  may  transport  some  of  the  required  energy.  Multi-dimensional simulations show that turbulent dissipation by neutrino-driven convection is significant in aiding successful explosions.  Another mechanism for energy transport has recently been suggested:  convection in the core may generate sound waves that would transport energy outward possibly depositing even more energy behind the shock.  In this dissertation, we explore whether this acoustic power is efficient in aiding CCSN explosions.  In order to model these effects, we develop the hydrodynamics code Cufe, which employs a general metric to solve the Euler equations.  Through  verification  and  validation,  we  show  that Cufe can  efficiently  and  accurately  simulate astrophysical problems.  With a systematic study of acoustic power, we execute one-dimensional and two-dimensional simulations.  These simulations show that the acoustic power reduces the critical condition for explosion by at most 5%.  This result is somewhat unexpected.  Previous studies  had  assumed  that  acoustic  power  would  be  perfectly  absorbed  in  the  region  behind  the shock.  On the contrary, we show that the acoustic waves are likely damped by neutrinos and are less effective than assumed in depositing energy behind the shock.  In summary, neutrino heating and turbulent dissipation remain the dominant mechanisms for successful core-collapse supernova explosions.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Black Lives Matter (BLM) is one of the largest movements in America, with the mission of ending police brutality and other racial injustices affecting the Black community. The deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery in 2020 sparked significant unrest, causing millions of people around the world to take action in-person and online. However, the social media event Blackout Tuesday caused many to question the sincerity and solidarity of those who posted the black square and hashtag on social media. Individuals and companies alike were called out for “woke washing,” or partaking in performative allyship. As more corporations and organizations are expected to make public statements regarding prominent societal issues like BLM, it is crucial that they be clear, specific, and genuine in their statements, including those posted on social media. The current study evaluated different elements of Fortune 500 companies’ BLM-related Instagram posts and how they related to the valence of users’ comments. A quantitative content analysis revealed that companies should follow recommended format guidelines for social media posts and avoid making vague, neutral statements; otherwise, they are at risk of receiving negative comments. Based on the results of this study, if corporations and organizations truly support causes like BLM and want to succeed in their online corporate social advocacy efforts, they must recognize that actions speak louder than words.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Background: As suicide rates have continued to rise, suicide prevention efforts turned toward identifying factors through which initial onset of suicidal ideation (SI) transitions to attempted suicide. Evidence suggests that when individuals experience emotional distress (e.g., fear) in response to SI, they may attempt to avoid (e.g., suppress) SI. Paradoxically, this process may actually increase SI frequency, intensity, and uncontrollability. Although mitigating distress and avoidance of SI may help thwart the transition from ideation to attempts, traditional therapeutic approaches have largely neglected this specific risk process. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Aims: This study examined whether a novel computerized intervention, Re-Evaluating Suicidal Thoughts (REST), would reduce distress, avoidance, and severity of SI compared to a time-matched control video. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Methods: Young adults (N =106) who reported first lifetime occurrence of SI within the previous three years and no prior suicide attempts were enrolled and randomized to REST or control conditions. Following intervention, participants provided a written narrative of their recent suicidal thoughts, followed by a thought monitoring period to measure the incidence of and efforts to avoid SI. Self-report measures of SI emotional distress, SI avoidance, and SI severity were administered at baseline, post-intervention, post-thought monitoring, and one-week and one-month follow-up. Intent-to-treat with last observation carried forward analyses were conducted for all hypotheses. Residualized change scores from baseline to relevant follow-up time point were computed for use with linear regression models. Mediation analyses were conducted using the PROCESS macro for SPSS. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Results: REST was associated with greater reductions of: SI emotional distress at post-intervention and one-week follow-up; avoidance of SI at post-thought monitoring and one-week follow-up; and SI severity at one-month follow-up. Reductions in SI emotional distress at one-week follow-up mediated condition effects on SI severity at one-month follow-up.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Conclusions: Findings suggest that emotional distress and avoidance of SI are malleable constructs that influence SI severity. Interventions that target these constructs, such as REST, present a novel way to build upon existing suicide prevention efforts.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Water Hammer is a collection of poems that explore what it means to be online in the 21st century. Taking inspiration from the rapid pace of social media feeds—and the mysterious workings of the predictive algorithms that dictate our diet of television, movies, and music—the poems in this collection jump between the serious and the ridiculous, the personal and the distant, and the past and the present. Everything happens at the same time, and everyone is talking over each other. Contemporary pop culture collides with nostalgia for the past, tragedy becomes indistinguishable from farce, and everyone is trying to sell you something. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Second language (L2) researchers have investigated the role of language learners’ motivation in relation to the learners’ L2 self-guides (e.g., Dörnyei, 2009; Papi, Bondarenko, Mansouri, Feng, Jiang, 2019a) and their feedback-seeking behavior (FSB) (e.g., Papi, Bondarenko, Wawire, Jiang, &amp; Feng, 2020; Papi, Rios, Pelt, &amp; Ozdemir, 2019b).Although these studies have contributed to our understanding of L2 learners’ motivation, the role of perceived self-efficacy (i.e., individuals’ beliefs in their ability to perform well), a prominent psychological construct in the field of social and educational psychology, has not been explored sufficiently in the context of language learning motivation. Dörnyei (2009) has argued that for individuals to energize behavior toward achieving their ideal future images, their expectations must be realistic and substantiated, which suggests the importance of the learners’ self-efficacy beliefs. Perceived self-efficacy can contribute to the development of learners’ future self-guides and determine their choice of feedback-seeking strategies toward successful foreign/second language acquisition.
This mixed-methods study employed a 2 × 2 Model of L2 Self-Guides (Papi et al., 2019a) to investigate the role of perceived self-efficacy (Bandura, 1997) in generating learners’ L2 self-guides and determining their FSB (Papi et al., 2019b) in language learning. The present study used a sequential explanatory design that first involved collecting and analyzing quantitative data in the form of Spanish learners’ questionnaire responses, with a subsequent collection and analysis of qualitative data which comprised the participants’ interview responses. The primary focus of this study is the quantitative analysis of the results, followed by the qualitative data analysis which aims to provide a more detailed account of the participants’ survey responses. First, a questionnaire examining the individuals’ speaking and listening self-efficacy (SLSE) beliefs, L2 self-guides, and FSB was developed, piloted, and then administered to foreign language learners (N = 341) enrolled in Spanish language classes at a major public university in the United States. Second, semi-structured formal interviews with the selected Spanish language learners (N = 12) were conducted. 
The results of the quantitative (questionnaire) and qualitative (interview) analyses showed that a high sense of perceived self-efficacy generated learners’ Ideal/Own and Ideal/Other self-guides and positively predicted learners’ monitoring (i.e., observing environment for feedback) and inquiry (i.e., directly asking for feedback from teachers and others) strategies. Whereas both the learners’ Ideal/Own and Ideal/Other self-guides positively predicted Feedback Monitoring and Feedback Inquiry/Other, only the ideal own self-guide emerged as positive and significant predictor of Feedback Inquiry/Teacher. The individuals’ ought self-guides (i.e., Ought Self/Own &amp; Ought Self/Other) did not result in learners’ FSB. Furthermore, the relationship between learners’ SLSE and FSB was partially mediated by their ideal self-guides, but not by the individuals’ ought self-guides. Both the Ideal/Own and Ideal/Other self-guides emerged as partial mediators in the relationship between learners’ SLSE and their Feedback Monitoring, and Feedback Inquiry/Other strategies. Only Ideal Self/Own, however, emerged as a partial mediator of the relationship between the learners’ SLSE and their Feedback Inquiry/Teacher strategy. Finally, in this study, the individuals’ SLSE weakly predicted learners’ Ought/Own and Ought/Other self-guides. 
The results of this study showed that not only did the learners with strong beliefs of personal efficacy pursue their future ideal and ought self-guides in learning Spanish, but they also utilized all three feedback-seeking strategies to improve their speaking and listening abilities in the target language. The findings further our understanding of the individuals’ perceived self-efficacy as the motivational antecedent underlying learners’ L2 self-guides and FSB in the language learning context and offer valuable insights into L2 pedagogy.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The North American gray treefrog complex (Hyla versicolor sensu lato), defined here as encompassing the diploid species Hyla chrysoscelis and Hyla avivoca, and the tetraploid Hyla versicolor, has long been used as a model system in a variety of biological fields. Although the origins of polyploidy in this group have been extensively studied since the discovery of polyploidy exactly 50 years ago, the most recent studies on this topic come to considerably different conclusions. Furthermore, though the biogeography of this system has been extensively discussed, no study to date has investigated the biogeography of gray treefrogs explicitly. These doubts and lack of knowledge affect the interpretation of studies utilizing gray treefrogs, and as the only known anuran polyploid complex in North America, it is of general interest that the origins and biogeography of this system are explored further. Finally, because work on this system has been foundational for defining our understanding of acoustic communication and mate choice, it is imperative that we investigate the evolutionary history of acoustic communication in gray treefrogs.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this dissertation, I present my work in defining the evolutionary history, origins of polyploidy, biogeography, and the evolution of acoustic communication in gray treefrogs. In addition to this research, I also present a historical review of the systematic and evolutionary work that has defined this system over the last two centuries. In the next chapter, I define the evolutionary history of the polyploid gray treefrog complex---utilizing hundreds of loci to estimate the taxonomic relationships, the origins of whole genome duplication (WGD), the mode of polyploidization, the history of hybridization, and the timing of important evolutionary events. In the following chapter, utilizing the data and results from the previous chapter along with a large acoustic data set collected over 45 years that includes &gt;1500 individual frogs, I estimate the biogeography and evolutionary history of acoustic communication of this system.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation adds to the rich history of evolution research in this system, and in general, aims to clarify the evolutionary history of gray treefrogs throughout the Quaternary. I find strong evidence for a recent autopolyploid origin of H. versicolor from a single WGD event. I also uncover significant hybridization in this complex, and show that historical hybridization has led to the formation of additional polyploid lineages following mitochondrial capture. My biogeographical analysis demonstrates that the origin of WGD occurred near the limit of the Laurentide ice sheet from the Illinoian glacial period that preceded my estimated WGD timing, and that glacial cycles have played a significant role in the evolution of this system. Finally, my acoustic analysis demonstrates the diversity of calls in H. chrysoscelis are associated with expansions out of glacial refugia, and that unique calls in H. versicolor are associated with a mitochondrial introgression event.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Malware has crippled computer systems, caused financial losses on the order of billions of dollars and denied access to services for millions of users worldwide. Detecting malware before it can cause any damage, therefore, is a significant problem. There are a number of methods which try to detect pre-existing as well as new threats. These methods mostly use signatures, which are byte sequences within the executable, for detection. Malware authors have tried a number of methods like advanced obfuscation techniques and run-time packing to evade detection with varying levels of success. In recent days, machine learning techniques have been widely used for a number of applications including malware detection. Most machine learning systems are based on neural networks which are not very interpretable, although that is slowly changing. To combat this problem, we have developed systems which are able to detect malicious programs while also providing an explanation for the classification. The first system to this end is a method using topic models, a suite of statistical models which assign a set of  "topics'' to documents. Using a few topic models like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Correlated Topic Models (CTM), the system is able to effectively detect malware it has not encountered before. The advantages and shortcomings of this approach are also presented. In the pursuit of more explainable AI models, a framework is presented which analyzes existing neural networks and explains their decisions. This will be beneficial in building more robust and efficient neural networks. This framework is applied to analyze  MalConv and reconcile two disparate findings about its results. It should also be noted that this framework can be used to analyze any convolutional network. Finally, to aid in explainable malware analysis, a reinforcement-learning based program analysis engine is proposed which leverages game-playing techniques to find valid paths to vulnerable code segments. All the methods presented should be beneficial in building an ecosystem of more interpretable and robust models for malware detection and analysts to find new ways to protect users from new malware.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Guitar works were written by significant Canadian composers for the Toronto International Guitar Festival during its existence in the 1970s to the late 1980s. These works have not yet been included in academic study and are generally unknown in the Classical Guitar community. This treatise presents historical information on and compositional analysis of guitar compositions written during these twenty years, and gives detailed information about the festival, which was the first of its kind and the precursor to the Guitar Foundation of America Festival.The composers whose scores are examined are John Weinzweig and four of his students: R. Murray Schafer, Harry Freedman, Harry Somers, and Srul Irving Glick. Each of these composers has a chapter devoted to him and includes biographical information, analysis, and historical information regarding the composition in question. The works studied are Contrasts, and Eighteen Pieces for Guitar by John Weinzweig; Impromptus for Mezzo-Soprano and Guitar by Harry Freedman; Sonata for Guitar, and Concerto for Guitar and Orchestra by Harry Somers; Le Cri de Merlin, and Guitar Concerto by R. Murray Schafer; Dance Suite for Two Guitars by Srul Irving Glick. Each chapter assists the performer in understanding the complexity of each piece and allows the guitarist to see the work’s place in the oeuvre of that composer. The study is intended to promote the performance of these works, and to draw attention to their composers, and the history of the festival.

(University of Pittsburgh Press, 2020), winner of the Agnes Lynch Starrett Poetry Prize, and work from what I hope will be my second book. I refer to this second project crudely as Ass Poetica, a play on ars poetica and the title of one of the poems in the collection, although I understand that in its final form a different name will need to occupy the cover.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Repossessing Spectatorship in Immersive Theatre and Virtual Reality proposes that material constructions borne by the ambitions of “immersion” do not fulfill their intended purpose: total passage to the reality of the performance. These materially constructed doorframes are not fully functional portals, as they ultimately have no bearing on the impassable barrier between our actuality and the virtual reality of a performance. Due to that barrier, encounters with the reality of a performance are still necessarily virtual; the spectator’s perception must traverse the performance through a sort of astral projection, as a dis/embodied ghost still tethered to corporeality and ultimately returning to it. Although these doorframes reveal and conceal no more than the actuality that already haunts spectators, these constructions produce exciting new theatre practices. Through a combination of the author’s embodied research, interviews with immersive theatre practitioners, and performance theory related to immersion, embodiment, and liveness, Repossessing Spectatorship in Immersive Theatre and Virtual Reality explores two contemporary case studies of immersive theatre that model the virtual reality headset as a visible, tangible example of one such “doorframe.” These case studies both integrate the virtual reality headset for the sake of immersion: 1. Tequila Works’s The Invisible Hours, one title in an expressly immersive and theatrical genre of virtual reality (VR) gaming, and 2. The University of Iowa’s Elevator #7, a mixed-reality production that adds an additional layer of tangible stimuli through live theatre, in order to supplement the immersive experience of wearing the headset. This thesis articulates its larger, abstract argument about spectatorship by tracing these case studies’ applications of the VR headset. Overall, Repossessing Spectatorship in Immersive Theatre and Virtual Reality encourages a reframing of the idea of immersion, away from total passage and toward a conscious repossession of the corporeal body in virtual visitation with a performance.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Silurian was a dynamic time of climatic transition punctuated by multiple biotic crises and global carbon cycle perturbations. The most severe of these biotic crises was the late Silurian (Ludfordian) Lau/Kozlowskii extinction event (LKE; 425 Ma), with a loss of ~23% of marine genera and a resurgence of abiotic and microbially-mediated carbonate facies. The LKE has been recognized as asynchronous for more than a decade, with benthic and nektonic fauna experiencing earlier extinctions than planktic fauna. The LKE preceded and partially coincided with an associated positive carbon isotope excursion, the Lau CIE, which is the highest-magnitude CIE in the Phanerozoic with average peak excursion values between +5 and +8‰. It has been suggested, but not directly tested, that both the Lau CIE and the LKE were the result of an expansion of reducing conditions in the Ludfordian global oceans. The mechanisms behind the temporal offset between the extinction and the CIE and the asynchronous nature of the extinction have also not been previously constrained. New records of the extinction and local and global marine paleo-redox change are presented herein from Ludfordian carbonate- and siliciclastic-dominated successions of multiple paleocontinents. For the first time biotic records of well-studied taxonomic groups affected by the LKE are compiled, highlighting the stepwise nature of the extinction. Global paleo-redox dynamics are first examined using a novel approach combining analyses of the stable isotopes of carbon, sulfur, and thallium. A positive excursion in thallium isotopes in the deep-water shales of the Baltic Basin (modern Scandinavia) records the earliest onset of global marine deoxygenation in the Ludfordian, which was coincident with the earliest extinction stages of the LKE and prior to the enhancement of organic carbon burial that fueled the Lau CIE. A large positive excursion in sulfur isotopes in the shallow water carbonates of the Baltic Basin was recorded parallel to the CIE as pyrite burial increased globally. This suggests an expansion of euxinia (anoxic and sulfidic water column) in the global oceans following the initial deoxygenation and concurrent with the later extinction stages of the LKE. Support for the expansion of reducing conditions in the late Silurian global oceans comes from the study of carbonate successions along the southern and western margins of the paleocontinent Laurentia (modern North America) where paired positive excursions in carbon and sulfur isotopes lend further evidence for the global enhancement of organic carbon and pyrite burial.
Variability in local and regional paleo-redox dynamics in the Ludfordian have been explored along the southern Laurentian margin and in the Baltic and Prague basins. Low I/Ca ratios from the carbonates of southern Laurentia and the shallow shelf of the Baltic Basin indicate proximity to local/regional oxygen minimum zones (OMZ) concurrent with the global expansion of reducing conditions. High pyrite content in the carbonate strata of southern Laurentia and the Prague Basin (peri-Gondwanan terrane; modern Czech Republic) suggest that sulfidic sediment porewaters were common. Comparison of iron geochemistry and trace metal enrichments in the deep shelf of the Baltic Basin to that of modern OMZs imply that the basin may have been dominated by a nitrogenous OMZ throughout most of the Ludfordian. There is also a possible overprint of a global trace metal drawdown in the stratigraphic trends of trace metal enrichments from this locality that would have been coeval with the enhancement of pyrite burial and the expansion of euxinic conditions in the global oceans. 
Dynamics of the LKE event have been further explored through microfacies analyses and accounts of previously unreported microbially-mediated facies in Ludfordian carbonate successions. The LKE event is recorded in southern Laurentia as notable biotic reorganizations during the interval of the mid-Ludfordian when reducing conditions would have been the most prevalent in the global ocean. Flat-pebble conglomerate facies and possible microbial mats are reported from the carbonate strata of western Laurentia and the Prague Basin, ooids and micro-oncoids from southern Laurentia. The variety and pervasiveness of microbially-mediated carbonate facies associated with the LKE hint at the severity of the extinction and the restructuring of faunal communities that took place within carbonate platforms during the Ludfordian. Altogether, the geochemical, biotic, and lithologic data presented here represent the first proxy evidence linking the LKE event to the Lau CIE through the progressive expansion of anoxia, and later euxinia, across portions of the late Silurian oceans. This multi-proxy, multi-lithology approach provides a previously unmatched, holistic view of the dramatic changes in the late Silurian marine biosphere and global marine redox conditions.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Contemporary U.S. artist Mike Kelley’s body of work can be read as an assessment of the institutions of the university and late twentieth-century contemporary art through the valences of time, geography, pedagogy, and systems of exchange that oscillate between identifications of institutional complicities and anxieties of institutional affiliations.  With his artworks, texts, and exhibitions, Kelley entwines the viewer in an endless web of institutional affiliations for which there is no terminus or other position.  This dissertation argues that Kelley’s broader project can be read in terms of pedagogical aesthetics that represents a form of pedagogical Institutional Critique that is not museum-based, but is rooted firmly in the artist’s educational engagements as both a student and as a teacher at the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts), Minneapolis College of Art and Design, and ArtCenter College of Design in Pasadena.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Much of Kelley’s practice is generated from his attempts to reconcile, what he describes as, the “anti-material and idealistic reductivism” of his Conceptual Arts education with his own “materialist maximalism.”  Kelley centers the legibility of his artworks within institutions of pedagogy such as the home, the school, and the museum, all of which are positioned as interchangeable sites webbed with institutional affiliations and anxieties imaged through fictive pedagogic traumas.  As such, this dissertation presents a sustained study of Kelley’s interrogations of artistic pedagogy, cultural formations, and his material maximalisms as he wrestled with art’s failure to be a productive social force by bringing into tension charged imagery that transgresses the high art-low art dialectic as defined in the late twentieth century.  This study presents a sustained historical analysis that weaves a number of narrative threads examining the school as a critical site in Kelley’s work, and how his deployment of humor, filmic and narrative genres, concepts of play, site specificity, nostalgia, and amateurism collate with architectures of memory, camera-based methodologies of critique and explorations of the museum as a pedagogical space.  The origins and points of artistic influence are critical subjects in Kelley’s work. Overlooked by critics, curators and art historians, the school as a site of institutional critique is overshadowed in art historical discourses because it is not public facing, yet universities and Master of Fine Arts degree programs became critical shapers of the geographies of contemporary art.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Howard Singerman was the first to assert that Kelley’s project was centered on the university, however, the intention of this dissertation is to greatly expand upon Singerman’s claims and narrow scope by proposing that the multiplicities, and varied threads, avenues, and evocations in Kelley’s work are generated from his constant mining of sites and architectures of pedagogy--the home, the school, and the museum--all of which function as the refuges and institutions of the late twentieth and twenty-first century artist.  Both Singerman’s and Mark McGurl’s accounts of the emergence of MFA degrees in the fields of art and creative writing infer that the primary mode of influence for academic programs are the ways in which they recreate themselves through the students.  This cloning dynamic was an operation that Kelley repeatedly engaged with and critiqued in his work and is frequently left out of accounts of his practice, a gap that this dissertation vitally fills.  The resulting “educational turn” fomented a range of pedagogical engagements and educational-aesthetic gestures by contemporary artists, yet there is a dearth of analysis on the topic of pedagogically informed Institutional Critique, and a significant gap in the scholarship in attending to such critical practices that reside outside of museum-centered discourses.  This is particularly salient for art located within the context of educational institutions, which includes Kelley’s practice, and is a vital lens through which to understand the contours of contemporary art. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Since his death in 2012, Kelley has had a remarkable influence on a generation of artists, including his own students.  The trace of his “materialist maximalism” and use of local, pop, and low cultural images and objects, and his insistence that those materials contain meaning worth investigating as a methodology of institutional and social critique is in the DNA of twenty-first century contemporary art to the point of ubiquity.  Kelley’s influence can be seen in a range of contemporary global practitioners and artists like Mika Rottenberg, Xavier Cha, and Carlos Rolon.  Located within Kelley’s practice are the attendant dynamics of memory and affect that shape those spaces and sites along with frequent representations and references to the geographical nodes of Los Angeles, California and Detroit, Michigan both of which take on a mythical status in the artist’s practice.  This dissertation mines the work of Kelley and his interest in the “unhistoric acts” and entanglements of education, influence, and institutionality that shape the experiences of the late twentieth and twenty-first century artist and the geographies of contemporary art through the mesmerisms of Kelley’s aesthetic, material, and narrative phantasms.  This project seeks to recalibrate the field of inquiry towards the discourses, practices, and histories of a pedagogic Institutional Critique, an overlooked mode generally, by identifying Kelley’s work as being distinct within it.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>A pianist's post-college life is richly diverse and multi-faceted due to the wide array of possible career options. During one’s professional life, a pianist could be called upon to perform as soloist, chamber musician, duo partner, choral accompanist, or orchestral pianist, along with several other types of collaborative positions. In order for young professionals to meet the demands of a highly competitive job market, they must develop a flexible set of skills that will open an assortment of career paths. Because the job description for pianists has evolved over the past several hundred years, it is essential that undergraduate programs provide an education that leads to the development of a comprehensive pianist trained for both solo and collaborative performance settings. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to contribute to the body of research in the area of collaborative piano pedagogy, specifically concerning the development of piano accompanists at the undergraduate level. The primary component of the project consisted of the researcher designing a grading system for developmental collaborative piano repertoire and organizing vocal works with piano accompaniment into a developmental collaborative piano curriculum for use at the undergraduate level. Based on the characteristics of each selection, the pieces were placed at the appropriate difficulty level using the criteria of the grading rubric. The secondary element of this study was to provide a compendium of developmental collaborative repertoire with detailed annotations that described the musical, technical, and ensemble challenges, as well as pedagogical reasoning for inclusion in the curriculum. It was the investigator’s intent that this resource serve as an instructional guide and practical resource manual for young accompanists or teachers of collaborative and ensemble skills. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To evaluate the effectiveness of the developmental collaborative piano curriculum, the researcher employed the use of outside graders (N = 5) from major universities across the United States. Reviewers assessed the technical, musical, and ensemble requirements for each difficulty level of the grading rubric, as well as the selected repertoire, difficulty grade given to each piece, and the order of the music in the curriculum. The experts had the opportunity to express their opinions and give advice for the grading rubric and selected collaborative repertoire, as well as suggestions for pieces to be added or removed from the curriculum. Once all responses were collected from the reviewers, the researcher compared the information to choose the pieces, and help establish the appropriate grade level and placement in the overall curriculum for each collaborative work. The completed curriculum is made up of 4 levels that coincide with an undergraduate student’s 4 years of study. Each level contains 60 pieces that are graded and leveled using its technical, musical, and ensemble difficulties.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study provided valuable information on the effectiveness of the grading criteria designed to level the vocal pieces with piano accompaniment, as well as insight into the grading of developmental collaborative repertoire, selected pieces used to teach collaborative skills at varying levels of difficulty, appropriate order in which to introduce the collaborative skills, and proper sequencing for the pieces in the curriculum. The information gained added to the teaching practices and resources utilized for the preparation of undergraduate accompanists and presented a clear description of the skills introduced to piano majors during their undergraduate education. This project also contributed to the successful preparation of students as they enter the professional field and increased the understanding of the specialized skills that will benefit students in any musical endeavors they choose to pursue in the future.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Allied war in the Southwest Pacific Area, and in Papua New Guinea, more specifically, is most often characterized in relation to General Douglas MacArthur, with little regard for the dynamic collection of servicemembers and civilians who implemented his strategic vision. This work accesses new parts of the Allied coalition by centralizing tropical nature as a primary historical actor, and unpacking the multitudinous ways in which it framed the structure, culture, and effectiveness of the Allied scientific community. In response to Papua New Guinea’s climate, entomology, and geography, Australian, American, and indigenous personnel worked in theater and on the home front to connect battlefield problems with research-based solutions. This collaborative, multi-national experiment improved the relationships of Allied governments and militaries with their public and private research institutions, altered the military chronology of the war, and contributed to the Pacific’s relevance in the postwar scientific world. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Hurricanes and other major storm events are a challenge for any coastal community, both modern and past. During the past half-century hurricanes caused nearly half a trillion dollars in property damage throughout the Southeastern United States. Archaeological evidence supports the fact that humans have lived along the Florida Gulf Coast for at least the past 14,500 years. Based on the periodicity of tropical cyclone events over the past 5,000 years, it is highly likely ancient coastal peoples would have been impacted. The impact catastrophic storms had on past societies is poorly understood, primarily because evidence of hurricane activity is not always clearly identifiable. Thus, for this thesis, I am looking for these signatures in archaeological sites. In this thesis, I present the results of my analysis of auger cores taken from two locations along the Big Bend Region of the Florida Gulf Coast. Both locations, Bald Point State Park and the Woodland period Mound Field site (8WA8) in the St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge, were directly impacted by Hurricane Michael in 2018 and Hurricane Irma in 2017, as well as several other tropical cyclone events in the past decade. The deposits at Bald Point State Park were used to create a “hurricane deposit” signature in this area. This was then applied to the deposits taken from Mound Field. The decision to use cores was made to maximize the collection of the foraminifera or other bioindicators of washover events. A noticeable change in siliciclastic grain size was observed illuminating evidence of a flooding event associated with a hurricane.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Some second language acquisition (SLA) scholars have characterized the astronomic rise in usership of language learning applications as a “revolution” of language learning (p. 25).  Alongside this rise in usership is also a small but steady stream of research that has investigated the effects of these applications on user motivation (Isbell et al., 2017; Loewen et al., 2019), learning gains on collegiate foreign language tests (Krashen, 2014; Vesselinov &amp; Grego, 2012) , and oral communicative ability (Loewen et al., 2020). This thesis investigated the role of meaningful input in the form of two new features of the language learning application Duolingo. The two under-researched features (Savvani, 2019) are the Stories feature, which is performed by voice actors and provides the learner with short stories intermittent with comprehension check and translation activities, and the Podcast feature, which are 20- to 30-minute podcast episodes told primarily in the L2 with no user interaction involved (Jiang et al., 2020). These two features offer users more meaningful input, which Duolingo has been frequently criticized for excluding in its curriculum (e.g., Crowther et al., 2017; Teske, 2017). To investigate the effect these new features have on users, this study utilized a quasi-experimental case study design, looking at two Spanish-L2 participants’ performance on a battery of implicit and explicit knowledge tests over the course of a four-week treatment period. The results indicated a steady increase in both implicit and explicit knowledge for the Stories participant over time, but that the Podcast participant was too advanced to make meaningful gains on the test battery as a result of Duolingo Podcast use. Despite this, the Podcast participant still made meager gains in implicit but not explicit knowledge. The battery of tests also accessed different language domains such as receptive (e.g., reading and listening) and productive (e.g., speaking and writing) skills.  
These findings add nuance to previous critiques of Duolingo and Mobile-Assisted Language Learning (MALL) in general that posited that the primary outcome of MALL app usage is receptive explicit knowledge (e.g., Krashen, 2014; Loewen et al., 2020). First, it was found that the Podcast participant showed meager gains in the measure of productive implicit knowledge (the Oral Narrative Task) but decreased in performance on the measure of receptive explicit knowledge (the Untimed Grammaticality Judgement Task). Interestingly, the Stories participant showed a large jump of 22% in receptive implicit knowledge of Spanish (as measured by the Timed Grammaticality Judgement Task). Neither participant showed meaningful gains in the measure of productive explicit knowledge (the Metalinguistic Knowledge Task). Although there was a slight effect found for receptive explicit knowledge for the Stories participant, the data from both participants in tandem discount the idea that app-based MALL prioritizes receptive explicit knowledge, at least when considering these novel input-based features of Duolingo.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Previous case studies have noted a significant extratropical flow response to recurving Atlantic tropical cyclones (TCs), which is often linked to extreme weather events downstream. This study examines the modification of Rossby waves on the extratropical jet in response to recurving Atlantic TCs from both climatological and predictability perspectives. Changes in amplitude and location of Rossby waves are identified using a wavelet decomposition technique on isentropic potential vorticity. The climatology demonstrates that recurving Atlantic TC events are capable of modifying the amplitude of the extratropical flow. The nature of the extratropical flow response is most strongly tied to the average translation speed of the TC relative to the Rossby wave over the 72 hours following recurvature. The ability of Atlantic recurving TCs to significantly modify the amplitude of downstream Rossby waves motivates the investigation into whether the predictability of the extratropical flow is also affected by the TC and its Rossby wave relative speed.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Predictability is evaluated as the standard deviation of isentropic potential vorticity among a 50-member ensemble and is compared to climatology. This study found subsets of recurvature cases that contain areas of significantly modified ensemble spread which were anchored in time and space to the recurvature of the TC. It is shown that forecast uncertainty is dependent upon the location of the nearest trough at the time of recurvature and the relative speed between the TC and the Rossby wave train after recurvature. Predictability is significantly degraded when recurvature occurs downstream of a trough; the elevated uncertainty subsequently propagates downstream along with the trough axis. An analysis in spectral space demonstrates that the increase in uncertainty is not solely attributed to the trough location, as there is also significantly elevated uncertainty in the Rossby wave amplitude across downstream troughs and ridges. Uncertainty is enhanced in locations where baroclinic growth processes are most pronounced, specifically where the TC and upper-level trough are optimally phased.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In nature, different rhizobial genotypes, that are either ineffective or inefficient in nitrogen (N2)-fixation are able to invade plant roots and colonize developing nodules along with highly effective nitrogen fixers. In plants such as Medicago sativa (alfalfa) and Medicago truncatula that form indeterminate nodules, the part of the rhizobial population that differentiates into the N2-fixing form loses the ability to regain the free-living state, whereas the part of the rhizobial population that does not differentiate remains capable of growth and reproduction. Whether plant hosts that form indeterminate nodules are able to detect and prevent these non-nitrogen-fixing ‘cheaters’ inside the nodule from proliferating and escaping from senescing nodules as free-living rhizobia was previously unknown. To gain insight into whether or not the host can penalize a non-fixing strain (nifH mutant) in mixed infections, we forced the development of mixed-strain infections using strains that can rescue one another in the root invasion process but cannot invade on their own. An exoY strain that is succinoglycan-deficient and a nodC strain that is Nod factor-deficient can only invade the host roots and form functional nitrogen-fixing nodules when they form an invasion structure (infection thread) together. Our nodule-crush/efficiency-of-plating assay shows that in alfalfa, the proportion of undifferentiated non-fixing nodCnifH strain in nodCnifH + exoY nodules is not significantly different from the proportion of N2-fixing nodC strain in nodC + exoY nodules. The epifluorescence images of alfalfa nodule sections suggest that the cortical cell occupancy of nodCnifH vs nodC is not significantly different. This indicates that in mixed-strain infections, the alfalfa host is unable to distinguish between effective- and ineffective-nitrogen-fixing strains and selectively impose sanctions or prohibit proliferation of a non-fixing rhizobia. The alfalfa nodules populated with a mixture of N2-fixing (exoY) and non-fixing (nodCnifH) rhizobia release a smaller number of total bacteria than nodules colonized by two N2-fixing mutants (exoY and nodC). Whether a more restrictive host, M. truncatula is able to penalize the reproductive cells of a non-fixing nodCnifH strain is not yet clear. In contrast to the perennial alfalfa, the annual M. truncatula produces a smaller fraction of the non-fixing nodCnifH strain than the N2-fixing nodC strain from mixed-infected nodules. However, in M. truncatula a similar number of total viable bacteria is released from nodCnifH + exoY nodules than in nodC + exoY nodules. An unexpected and even more interesting result came from determining the number of recoverable bacteria from plants inoculated with control strains. The non-fixing nifH nodules on alfalfa and M.truncatula release a significantly much larger number of bacteria than the nodules inoculated with wild type N2-fixing S. meliloti. This suggests that a non-fixing strain that invades normally is able to use plant resources without providing nitrogen in return, thus exhibiting parasitic growth.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>At the beginning of this century, some societies have shifted, or at least recognized the need to shift, towards a more renewable way of living, this shift has initiated a movement to reduce the carbon footprint, and new standards are being set by society and governmental entities. This has created a demand for new materials, processes, buildings, and among other solutions, to, when possible, eliminate the environmental impact or drastically reduce it. All-electric solutions play a major role in reducing the environmental impact as they are more efficient than the classical mechanical solutions. We set out to investigate the outcome of system-level thermodynamic optimization and different heat generation medias presented on an all-electric ship. The primary study presents a modeling, cross-validation, and thermodynamic optimization of a shipboard integrated energy system cooling network to assess the practicality of a dimensionless model for scalability, the reliability of different statistical metrics in cross-validation, and the effects of design and operational parameters on the system thermal performance. Furthermore we conducted studies devoted to component-level optimization, the first is focused on a pulsating large thermal load, and as a case study, an electromagnetic launcher (EML) of a notional all-electric ship model is formulated using quasi-3D and multi-physics together with a dynamic parallel-flow heat exchanger model to devise effective thermal management strategies. The model combines a 2D electromagnetic-thermal model and a 3D thermal-fluid model developed based on the fundamental laws of electromagnetism, heat transfer, and fluid dynamics. Subsequently we focuses on cooling strategies for steady heat-generating components. Here we develop a derivative-free 3D heat sink topology optimization tool using graph theory and ant-colony based optimizer. With the application of the proposed methodology we were able to provide insight into optimal design and operating conditions for shipboard integrated systems by applying integrative thermodynamic optimization with the incorporation of graph theory as a method to simplify system representation and way to explore the inter-correlation among its components. A novel methodology to model the integration between the multi-physics involving the electromagnetic launcher and its thermal management and a volume element optimization tool capable to provide optimal 3D heat sink architecture based on a global convergence objective function and capable to handle large number of constrains.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In the United States of America, more people have reported boycotting a brand in the last decade than in any previous one and the current increase appears to be exponential. However, boycott frequency and boycott success are disproportionate. In many cases, consumers’ boycott of a brand fails to prompt any change in company behavior or policy because the action does not create a substantially negative effect on the company’s profits and/or reputation. One explanation for the high rate of failure of consumers boycotts of a brand is the target’s expectation that consumers’ action will not yield significant news media attention. The way a company’s unethical policy or practice is framed can potentially boost media attention to it. However, the relative power of boycott activists and the media means that consumers are more likely to be exposed to media’s framing of the issue. This dissertation is a preliminary exploration of the effects of news media framing of a brand’s unethical behavior on consumers’ decision to boycott a brand. In so doing, the dissertation also tests a model of consumer boycott decision-making and explores the influence of high moral intensity on each of the four stages of that decision-making process. Data for the study are collected from consumers of a national retail brand who participated in a randomized experiment in which they read a news article that framed the brand’s unethical behavior with high moral intensity or with low moral intensity. The data are analyzed using multigroup analysis of structural invariance. The results provide initial support for a four-stage consumer boycott decision-making process. The results also illustrate that high moral intensity framing of a brand’s unethical behavior can trigger consumers’ moral awareness and affect their moral judgment, perceived moral obligation and intention to boycott, all mediated by perceived moral intensity. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>When police stop and question an individual for suspected delinquency or crime, they may either arrest that individual or release them without any formal arrest. Most of the criminological literature relating to police contact experiences focuses on the arrest experience, but the findings are conflicting, and several conceptual considerations limit our knowledge of the impact of an arrest. Notably, when examining the effects of any arrests, many studies actually measure an “average dose of arrest” effect. The effects of a single, first arrest are unclear. In addition, much less attention has been given to police contacts that end with the youth being released, even though this outcome is more common following a police-initiated stop of a suspect. To address these limitations, this study examines first police contact experiences—including both those that end in a release and those that end in an arrest.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation seeks to improve our understanding of punishment decisions and their effects within the modern criminal justice system. It is motivated by two overarching questions. First, what factors predict a first police contact? Second, what are the effects of a first police contact on offending? The following chapters introduce this topic and review extant literature, including a review of the plausible theoretical explanations for first contact effects. Data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health is used to examine the predictors and effects of first police contacts. Several findings can be summarized briefly. First, respondents with a first stop (and release) were substantively similar to youth with no contact, while youth with a first arrest varied substantially in comparison to non-arrested youth. Second, the effects of first police contacts were largely criminogenic and associated with increases in later offending. In the last chapter of the dissertation, the major implications for theory, research, and policy are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>We live in a highly connected world and individuals rarely, if ever, make decisions in complete isolation. Rather, our decisions and subsequent outcomes are often influenced by the decisions of others around us. Social, economic, and organizational networks are complex, and, therefore, it is important to understand how the structure of these networks influences behavior. This dissertation is comprised of three independent studies which explore, both theoretically and experimentally, how the structure of networks affects behavior in a variety of important economic environments. The first study considers the role of a network in determining how information flows through a society or organization. This allows us to examine how the structure of the network affects the aggregation of decentralized information and the accuracy of individual choice under uncertainty. The second study considers an environment in which an exogenous network structure dictates the flow of externalities in a strategic setting. Specifically, this analysis examines a contest environment where the allocation of a prize affects the payoffs of individuals connected to the winner of the contest in order to study how individual behavior and the overall level of competition are affected. The third study considers an environment in which a network, endogenously formed as a result of individual choices, determines the size, composition, and productivity of teams which then engage in jointly beneficial collective action. This study examines how characteristics of the network are related to subsequent behavior and how individual incentives influence the shape of the endogenous network. Independently, the findings of each study suggest that network characteristics are an important determinant of behavior in the respective setting considered. Collectively, then, the findings of this dissertation indicate that networks are pervasive in their influence of individual behavior across a wide domain of environments.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>College-readiness rates across the nation and in Florida are bleak. About a third of 2019 Florida high school graduates taking the ACT or SAT met college-readiness benchmarks (ACT, Inc., 2019; College Board, 2019). Almost 70% of those students, many unprepared, may have chosen to attend college (Florida Department of Education, 2020). These unprepared students are less likely to graduate college in six years and may not even earn a college degree (Chen, 2016). Florida attempted to address college-readiness with a series of policy changes. The policies began with high schools voluntarily offering college-readiness preparation in 2008 and shifted to a rigid policy in 2011 requiring high schools to administer a college-readiness test and enroll students not meeting established test benchmarks in state-developed college-readiness courses. Florida legislators reversed course in 2015, eliminating the mandated college-readiness testing and courses. With all the policy changes, it is important to understand how high schools are preparing students for college.The purpose of this study was to examine the college-readiness approaches in one Florida school district. In this comparative case study, twelve school administrators and counselors across six high schools explained postsecondary preparation at their school. The College-readiness Framework developed by Conley (2014) informed this study. This framework breaks down college-readiness into four components – cognitive strategies, content knowledge, learning skills and techniques, and transitional knowledge and skills. The framework provided a mechanism to compare the college-readiness approaches described by participants in this study to the research-based college-readiness approaches outlined by Conley (2014) as essential to postsecondary success. The framework also allowed for the comparison of approaches described by participants across schools. This study also explored the college-readiness policy beliefs of participants given the frequent policy changes.
The findings revealed college-readiness approaches varied across schools with each school using a unique approach. All schools used testing to determine if students were college-ready and offered numerous advanced and college-level course options to high-achieving students. Meeting graduation requirements was critical across the schools as participants focused on the fact that a high school diploma would allow students to attend an open-access state college in Florida. The student in the academic middle received less attention as schools focused preparation efforts on students at-risk of not meeting graduation requirements and advanced students. When comparing the college-readiness approaches described by Conley’s College-readiness Framework, findings revealed gaps in preparation efforts specifically in the areas of cognitive strategies and learning skills and techniques. Participants presumed teachers delivered content knowledge, but they could not explain how students used or connected information. Schools also struggled with the cultural and personal aspects of college-readiness such as how to socially transition to college and build self-advocacy skills. Every school offered students college admission and financial aid information with two schools providing every twelfth-grade student with the opportunity to complete the state financial aid application. When examining the policy attitudes of high school administrators and counselors, findings revealed principals desired increased control at the school level. Some participants were concerned schools may not identify and prepare potential college-going students in the absence of a college-readiness policy.

            <DISS_para>This research investigates the combination of lidar and passive polarimetric infrared imaging for object detection and classification. Lidar imaging can characterize reflective properties of a scene and provide high resolution three-dimensional spatial information, and passive imaging offers significantly faster imaging capabilities of large scenes at the cost of signal variability due to the fluctuation of external illumination sources. Dual-modality hybrid sensing is explored and an architecture is developed which simultaneously leverages the strengths of each sensor, while minimizing the individual shortcomings. The cooperative imaging approach significantly improves the imaging process by exploiting polarimetric features of hidden objects in passive imagery and cueing only the anomalous regions for further interrogation by the lidar sensor. Then, features obtained from both lidar and passive polarimetric infrared measurements are combined and utilized for object classification. The proposed solution consists of passive polarimetric anomaly detection (AD), adaptive lidar scanning, and hybrid material classification. An optical signal model is presented for each sensor modality and laboratory and field experiments are executed to demonstrate individual dependencies, performance, and limitations. A comprehensive performance evaluation of AD, adaptive scanning, and classification is presented. Results demonstrate the proposed AD method outperforms existing polarimetric AD techniques with 44.6% average detection improvement. Manmade objects at ambient temperature obscured by approximately 90% or less natural foliage cover are detected using the proposed technique while viewed at observation angles that optimize the polarimetric signature. A conceptual hybrid sensing design demonstrates the adaptive scanning technique which reduces lidar scan time by 99%. Material classification results demonstrate the dual-modality approach consistently outperforms single modality by over 20% improvement in classification accuracy and obtains an impressive 91.1% accuracy even with significant measurement noise resulting in a signal-to-noise ratio of only 6 dB. Finally, an application of the proposed technique is presented which demonstrates that hybrid lidar and passive polarimetric imaging is applicable for the classification of objects hidden in a large scene.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Moon’s Mystery Handbook (Zla gsang be’u bum), known also as Yama’s Handbook, is a compilation of Nyingma (Rnying ma) rituals attributed to Nupchen Sangyé Yeshé (Gnubs chen Sangs rgyas ye shes) and Mañjuśrīmitra (Tib. ʼJam dpal bshes gnyen). This ritual collection draws from the Nyingma Gyübum (Rnying ma rgyud ʼbum), among other sources, and includes a variety of ritual techniques, from general daily torma (gtor ma; Skt. bali) offerings to specific rites aimed at repelling or attacking enemies. It is a handbook of “magic” outlining specific ritual acts that are meant to accomplish the manipulation of the external world through sympathetic means. Rather than having a direct soteriological aim, these rites are practical in nature and are meant to deal with a variety of worldly concerns. The Moon’s Mystery Handbook is unique in its emphasis on fierce destructive rites. Contrary to the common western perception of Buddhism as the non- violent religion, this manual describes rites that invoke the power of Yamāntaka (a wrathful form of Mañjuśrī) to exact violence on the practitioners’ enemies. Within the Tibetan social landscape such ritual specialists are known as ngakpa (sngags pa; Skt. māntrika). As indispensable members of society, one of their pragmatic responsibilities within the community is to control the weather, usually in efforts to protect barley crops from hail. This ability to manipulate weather can be deployed for both peaceful and hostile purposes. In this thesis, I discuss the ambivalent hail-casting rites found in the Moon’s Mystery Handbook and argue that these rites are a reflection of distinct weather-related Tibetan cosmologies. I also provide an introduction to the Moon’s Mystery Handbook and an itemized catalogue of its content. It is my hope that this study will provide an avenue to begin to explore the unique Yamāntaka cycles of the Nyingma tradition, which is an important subject that has not received much scholarly attention.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The Zika virus (ZIKV) presents a threat to the health of pregnant women and developing fetuses as it is associated with microcephaly. There is a current gap in the understanding of how ZIKV affects the host’s chromatin architecture. Nucleosomes that reposition are thought to provide access to underlying DNA that was previously protected. Nucleosomal sensitivity to micrococcal nuclease (MNase) is also thought to allow for DNA to be more accessible for transcription. Nucleosomal sensitivity to MNase during ZIKV infection was studied independently of nucleosomal repositioning. The accessibility of nucleosomes was observed surrounding the transcription start sites (TSS) throughout the entire human genome during ZIKV infection. This study utilized the SNB-19 glioblastoma cell line, and the PRVABC59 Puerto Rican strain of ZIKV to observe genome wide chromatin modifications. A Genomic Transient Intermediate State (GTIS) has formerly been observed as a genome wide nucleosomal repositioning event. A GTIS was not discovered throughout ZIKV infection. However, during the ZIKV infection there was a temporal increase in the host cell’s nucleosomal sensitivity to MNase genome wide at 12 hours and then a return to basal levels of sensitivity to MNase at 24 hours. The genes associated with this chromatin architectural change are enriched for brain development. This temporal study presents greater insight into the nucleosomal accessibility of the host genome during ZIKV infection.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The ZIKV GTIS time point of nucleosomal repositioning was not observed during the study. Therefore, a novel approach was developed in being able to detect changes in nucleosomal repositioning at different time points. The novel approach utilizes droplet digital Polymerase Chain Reaction (ddPCR) (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, California, USA). The ddPCR can also be utilized for the identification of changes in nucleosomal sensitivity at different MNase digestion levels. This technique was developed to identify the GTIS without the need of a full sequencing experiment. The droplet digital PCR machine allowed for the generation of 20,000 unique droplets to precisely analyze amplification of a specific genomic region. The former Kaposi’s-sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) infected iSLK.219 cells studied in detecting the first recorded GTIS were utilized for this experiment and showed a decrease in sample copy concentration at the 24-hour time point. Tracking the same gene for all time points provided a control in detecting if there was a GTIS or if nucleosomes changed sensitivity. This approach allows for future genome wide nucleosomal repositioning and sensitivity studies to be conducted at a lower cost, and with increased accuracy by detecting changes at specific time points before sequencing occurs.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The annual cycle is a large scale climate process which influences smaller scale climate and meteorological processes. In this research, the annual cycle is defined by the climates response to Earth's orbit about the sun. In this definition, the annual cycle can be modulated and therefore change over time (Wu, Z. et al. 2008). The goal of this research is to diagnose changes to the Northern Hemisphere annual cycle from 1949 to 2017 using multi-dimensional ensemble empirical mode decomposition (MEEMD). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>MEEMD is a newer decomposition method that is built on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD; Wu et al. 2009). Unlike EMD and EEMD, MEEMD can be used to decompose spatiotemporal data sets making climate research easier, which often relies heavily on gridded data sets (Wu et al. 2016). In this study, MEEMD is applied to 2-meter pentad temperature data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)/National Centers for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Reanalysis 1 (Kalnay et al. 1996) to obtain the amplitude trend of the annual cycle.  The amplitude trend of the annual cycle for all points are normalized to compare the trends between polar and tropical latitudes, as the polar latitudes are changing at a more rapid rate than the tropical latitudes, likely due to anthropogenic forcing (IPCC 2019). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Results show that the annual cycle is decreasing in polar latitudes and increasing in tropical latitudes. In mid-latitudes, the annual cycle appears to change depending on topography where, in general, the annual cycle is decreasing in highland regions and increasing in lowland regions. Changes in climate modes may also play a role in mid-latitude results but this remains to be studied in depth. Identifying changes to the annual cycle will prove useful for understanding the spatially differing effects of climate change on weather and climate in the Northern Hemisphere. The the results of the evolution of the annual cycle amplitude trend are plotted as a movie and can be found as a supplemental file. Similarly, the evolution of the normalized results are plotted as a movie and can be found as a supplemental file to this thesis. Both movies show how the annual cycle of surface air temperature as changed yearly from 1949 through 2017, with the first movie showing the change in temperature and the latter showing the change in percent. The results of this research serve solely as a diagnosis and open the opportunity for future research to help explain the results of this paper.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This thesis examines the faunal remains from Site 40DV7, a shell-bearing Archaic through Mississippian period site in Middle Tennessee. The goal of the investigation is to answer three research questions about human behaviors during the warming climatic changes of the Mid-Holocene. The faunal analysis examines the environmental conditions present during the Archaic period in the Middle Cumberland River Valley, site seasonality, and subsistence techniques used by inhabitants of the archaeological site. Animal behavioral ecology coupled with biogeographic distributions of fauna and flora identify the climatic conditions of the Archaic period in the Southeast as similar to conditions today. A similarity in climate results in the culture choice of greater exploitation of bivalves during the Mississippian period, rather than an environmental factor. Examination of behavioral characteristics of seasonally and non-seasonally specific flora and fauna indicate a year-round habitation of the site. Finally, analysis of ethnographic analogies of three hunter-gatherer groups identify multiple subsistence techniques used by the inhabitants of Site 40DV7.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this dissertation, I produce novel scientific knowledge about the weather of the past using subjective human observations in the absence of instrumental records in the United States. Using a handwritten plantation journal from Shirley Plantation near Richmond, Virginia, I transcribe 34 years of sub--daily observations records (multiple observations throughout the day) spanning the period of 1816-1861. The resulting database contains 36,040 entries, averaging over 1000 entries for each year. I categorize and generate metadata for each of the entries. I use the resulting database to investigate the effects of volcanic forcing, develop a method for identifying tropical cyclones, evaluate the accuracy of written precipitation records, and test for spring advancement over the past two hundred years at my study site.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The goal of this dissertation is to add to our knowledge of the local weather and climate for the study area in the southeastern United States during the antebellum period (1815-1860). My project draws on methods from across the field of geography. I begin with archival research utilized in historical geographic research. I bridge the gap between qualitative and quantitative methods by extracting the observations recorded in the historical documents and coding them into a dataset. These data are then used to answer hypothesis--driven questions about the weather and climate of the region during the study period. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Plantation records from the southeastern United States have long been an important source for historical social and cultural narratives. However, they also represent an underutilized source for meteorological, environmental, and agricultural data from the antebellum period. While individual plantation records may have idiosyncratic limitations, plantation records, along with other types of detailed historical records, can still provide rich detail for specific locations or events. Plantation records are not limited to the southeastern US and include diverse geographic locations in less developed areas which were often the same areas where enslaved labor was exploited under the plantation system. Contextualizing historical data with present-day knowledge can be used to examine how society interacted with inter--annual climate variability and extremes.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study has three goals. Firstly, I advocate for a more systematic application of these records for quantitative analysis. Secondly, I show how these records can be mined for data on weather. These data lend themselves to quantitative analysis that can improve our understanding of the local weather and climate of that period, and how it has changed in the past two centuries. I introduce a method for extracting weather and climate data from a historical plantation document. I demonstrate the method on a document from Shirley Plantation in Virginia (USA) covering the period 1816--1861. I show how the resulting data are coded into a database that includes direct weather observations. Finally, I present four case studies using the Shirley Plantation database. Case study one investigates volcanic forcing following a large volcanic eruption in 1815, where I hypothesize that, on average, final spring freezes events occurred later in the spring for the earliest years in the record when compared to the later years in the record. Case study two examines indications of tropical cyclone activity in non-instrumental records, where I hypothesize that the impact of tropical cyclones along the mid Atlantic coast can be detected by specific weather changes at Shirley Plantation. Case study three evaluates the accuracy of written precipitation records compared to dendrochronological proxies, and I hypothesize that a precipitation index constructed from the database will correlate with precipitation estimates from tree rings. Case study four tests for spring advancement at Shirley Plantation over the past two centuries. I hypothesize that spring advancement caused by global warming can be identified by later last freeze dates in the Plantation data compared to last freeze dates from modern records at the nearby Richmond airport. I end with a discussion of the database and studies, the broader implications of the research I present, and a plan for future research.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation analyzes written language samples from fifth grade students with limited English proficiency from Spanish home language backgrounds. Written language sample holistic quality scores and Florida Assessments for Instruction in Reading–Florida Standards measures describe English learner (EL) students’ literacy achievement and relationships with writing microstructure measures. EL students were participants from a larger randomized control trial on the efficacy of an experimental word knowledge intervention that focused on instructing morphological knowledge. Following analysis for completeness and acceptability of written language samples, 173 EL students were eligible for study inclusion. Writingten language sample analysis resulted in the following microstructure measures; total number of words, number of different words, morphologically complex words, intervention-specific morphologically complex words, and amount of unique derivations score. Analysis of beginning and end-of-the-year written language samples resulted in a significant increase in morphologically complex word production, a significant decrease in the number of different words, and no change in the other microstructure measures. Analysis for intervention effects resulted in no difference in writing microstructure or writing quality outcomes between intervention EL students and EL students in the business-as-usual control group. Finally, multiple regression models resulted in significant ability of morphological writing microstructure measures to predict holistic writing quality scores above and beyond variance explained by reading comprehension achievement. Key findings are presented with a discussion of their relation to previous research. Discussion interprets results within the Simple View of Writing and provides implications for educators and researchers interested in continuing to develop interventions for EL students’ written language achievement. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Codeswitching is commonly practiced by Spanish heritage bilinguals in the United States (Fairchild &amp; Van Hell, 2017). Further, intrasentential codeswitching is the use of more than one language within a clause, as shown in (1) (Sankoff &amp; Poplack, 1981: 11-12). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>(1) 	There was this guy, you know que he se montó, he started playing with congas… </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	‘There was this guy, you know that he got up, he started playing with congas…’</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation studied the perception and production of switches between a pronominal subject and inflected verb in Spanish-English codeswitching. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Two of the leading theories on codeswitching, the Minimalist Program (MP) approach (e.g., MacSwan, 2000, 2009) and the Matrix Language Frame (MLF)/4-M models (e.g., Myers-Scotton, 1993; Myers-Scotton &amp; Jake, 2001), make conflicting predictions of the grammaticality of these codeswitches. The MP approach proposes that codeswitches after a pronominal subject are ungrammatical. For the MLF/4-M models, however, their grammaticality depends on the type of pronouns involved. These models posit that null pronouns (e.g., those used in broad focus in Spanish) are outsider late system morphemes, which are prohibited from codeswitching. Overt pronouns (e.g., English pronouns and those used in contrastive focus in Spanish) are categorized as content morphemes and can be codeswitched.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To test these theoretical predictions, this dissertation examined codeswitches after pronominal subjects in broad and contrastive focus. Focus was manipulated by presentation of a drawing of one person performing two actions (broad focus) or two people each performing one action (contrastive focus). An example of an English-Spanish target stimulus is presented in (2a) and in (2b) for Spanish-English. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>(2)	a. 	Alicia reads a book while she descansa en el sofá.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>        b.	Alicia lee un libro mientras ella relaxes on the couch.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>               ‘Alicia reads a book while she relaxes on the couch.’</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para/>
            <DISS_para>Participants were 55 Spanish heritage bilinguals (aged 18-24 years old; 43 female) who were frequent codeswitchers. All reported learning Spanish as a first language and demonstrated high proficiency on Spanish and English written exams. The Bilingual Language Profile (Birdsong et al., 2012) examined participants’ language dominance and portions of the Assessment of Code-Switching Experience Survey (Blackburn, 2013) assessed their codeswitching experience. A concurrent memory-loaded repetition task (adapted from Lipski, 2017) elicited production: it required participants to listen to four numbers, look at a drawing, hear a sentence, and repeat back the numbers and sentence. Written and aural acceptability judgement tasks (AJTs) measured participants’ ratings of stimuli on a seven-point Likert scale. All participants also completed these tasks in unilingual Spanish to assess each participant’s null and overt pronoun distribution, as variation in overt pronoun use in Spanish in contract with English has been documented (e.g., Shin &amp; Montes-Alcalá, 2014). These results were used to select subgroups of participants for each task that showed the expected Spanish pronoun distribution for broad and contrastive focus contexts. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Results from the production task showed that codeswitches in contrastive focus were produced significantly more accurately than those in broad focus contexts. These findings demonstrated support for the MLF/4-M models and went against the predictions of the MP approach. Results from the written and aural judgement tasks showed that the targeted codeswitches in broad focus contexts were rated significantly higher than contrastive focus contexts. These findings were not predicted by either model. Further analyses revealed that target stimuli were rated significantly higher in broad focus than contrastive focus contexts in unilingual Spanish as well, suggesting a task effect. However, target sentences were not rated at the low end of the scale (or below the fillers’ ratings), which would have shown support for the MP approach.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Finally, the (linear) direction of the switch and effects of sociolinguistic variables (language dominance and codeswitching frequency) were also examined. English-Spanish codeswitches were reproduced more accurately than Spanish-English in the production task. This may have been influenced by the frequency and obligatory nature of English pronouns. Linear regressions revealed that higher English dominance scores resulted in greater accuracy at producing codeswitches at the correct site and higher ratings of target stimuli in both AJTs. Further, greater codeswitching frequency resulted in more accurate production of codeswitches at the correct site in English-Spanish sentences and higher ratings for Spanish-English codeswitches in the written AJT. In conclusion, this dissertation provided empirical evidence in support of the MLF/4-M models and contributed to research on the role that switch direction and sociolinguistic variables play in Spanish heritage bilinguals’ production and perception of codeswitches after pronominal subjects.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>“Mississippi, Missing, Miss” is a book-length manuscript of poetry. The poems are a confessional, coming-of-age response to a highly-particularized Southern landscape. They examine that landscape by confrontation of religious hegemony, social hierarchies, and family trauma. The families in this book are meant to serve as specific illustrations of collective tensions, particularly those between social conservatism and the struggle for queer equality. Underneath these various subjects is a larger grappling with the grief of severed belonging. Some poems examine this grief by guiding a child and adolescent through the language and meaning of dance, the voices not unlike an omniscient ballet master. Other poems challenge their own grief through elegies for a first love, a trans man who dies young. Others trace their grief through generational trauma that begins when the speakers’ ancestors arrive in Mississippi. The book does not arrive at solutions but, instead, intends to provide attentive space for discomfort. Its speakers’ aims are to make sense of tension, of a landscape that somehow allows both unspeakable violence and tenderness.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>1.  Explicating The Concept of Reflection. To understand how ‘reflection’ is used, I consider ordinary, philosophical, and scientific discourse. I find that ‘reflection’ seems to refer to reasoning that is deliberate and conscious, but not necessarily self-conscious. Then I offer an empirical explication of reflection’s conscious and deliberate features. These explications not only help explain how reflection can be detected; they also distinguish reflection from nearby concepts such as ruminative and reformative reasoning. After this, I find that reflection is not obviously limited to only practical or only theoretical reasoning. The chapter ends with reasons to prefer ‘unreflective’ and ‘reflective’ to dual process theorists’ labels about systems or types.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>2.  Bounded Reflectivism &amp; Epistemic Identity. Reflection features centrally in philosophy (e.g., Korsgaard, 1996; Rawls, 1971; Sosa, 1991) and psychology (e.g., Pennycook, 2018). Bounded reflectivism is an empirically adequate model of reflection that explains reflection’s capacity to either help or hinder reasoning—e.g., reflective equilibrium vs. reflective polarization (e.g., Kahan et al., 2017). One innovation of the model is epistemic identity: an identity that involves particular beliefs—e.g., religious and political identities. When we feel that our epistemic identity is threatened, we can reflectively defend its beliefs rather than update our beliefs according to the best arguments and evidence. The solution, I argue, is not to suppress epistemic identity but embrace it by appealing to shared, superordinate epistemic identities.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>3.  All Measures Are Not Created Equal. A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost? “10 cents” comes to most people’s minds immediately. However, upon reflection, we can realize that “5 cents” is the correct answer. There are many reflection tests. Each has its limitations. Some reflection tests are mathematical—like the bat-and-ball problem (e.g., Frederick, 2005) and others are logical (e.g., Janis &amp; Frick, 1943). So there are concerns that reflection tests track logical and mathematical competence rather than reflection per se. Also, some psychologists assume a priori that correct answers are reflective and lured answers are unreflective. New evidence raises additional concerns about the plausibility of these assumptions. I argue that think aloud protocols (Ericsson &amp; Simon, 1998) and process dissociation (Jacoby, 1991) can assuage some of these concerns.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>4.  Great Minds Do Not Think Alike. Two large studies (N = 1299), one pre-registered, found that many correlations between reflection and philosophical beliefs among non-philosophers replicated among philosophers. For example, less reflective philosophers preferred theism to atheism and utilitarian rather than deontological responses to the trolley problem (Hannikainen &amp; Cova, in prep.; Pennycook et al., 2016; Reynolds, Byrd, &amp; Conway, forthcoming). However, philosophical judgments were sometimes better predicted by factors like education, gender, and personality than by reflection test performance. So although some relationships between reflection and philosophy were robust, there is more to the link between reflection and philosophy. Normative implications are also discussed—e.g., how we can infer the quality of philosophical views from their correlations with reflective or unreflective reasoning.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>5.  What We Can (And Can’t) Infer About Implicit Bias (In Synthese). Contrary to some philosophers and psychologists, I argue that implicit bias is probably associative. However, I also argue that debiasing is not thereby entirely unconscious and involuntary. Indeed, strong evidence suggests that reflection can change implicitly biased behavior—e.g., conscious and deliberate counterconditioning. This has implications for the science and morality of implicit bias—e.g., evidence suggests that we can reform biases; so. intuitively, we can be responsible for biases.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation will explore the topic of disposition ascriptions. A disposition ascription is any statement that ascribes a disposition to an object. The statement ‘Glass is fragile’ is one example. A popular account – called the conditional account – attempts to understand these statements in terms of counterfactuals. Recently, however, philosophers have offered objections to the conditional account on the grounds that it succumbs to counterexamples or that it rests on an incorrect assumption. I attempt to defend the account against some of these objections by offering an alternative analysis that builds on a distinction between single-track and multi-track ascriptions. In chapter one, I defend the conditional account from the problem of antidotes. I argue that antidotes admit of two different interpretations, and only one of them threatens the conditional account. In chapter two, I describe some problems for the traditional approach to analyzing disposition ascriptions, and I use these problems to motivate looking for an alternative account. This account is the subject of chapter three, in which I present and defend my proposal. Finally, in chapter four, I explain why my alternative is preferrable to another account that was developed recently by Barbara Vetter. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Social distancing precautions related to COVID-19 have had a significant impact on the delivery of music therapy services across the United States, and music therapists have had to adjust to changes in billing and regulation as well as the sudden need to deliver services via telehealth. The purpose of this research project was to collect data regarding the increased demand of information related to telehealth education, use of technology, and specific billing and regulation concerns from music therapists. Searches related to the categories of (a) billing, (b) technology, and (c) regulation were collected from the music therapy Facebook group, Music Therapists Unite (n.d). These searches were then compared according to (a) dates (January-February 2020 vs. March-April 2020), (b) poster status (student vs. professional), and (c) category (technology, billing, and regulation). Based on the results of this study, posts related to billing, technology, and regulation increased from January-February 2020 to March-April 2020. Posts related to technology increased the most extensively across both music therapy professionals and students before and after the COVID-19 pandemic was declared. The results of this study suggest that music therapy professionals and students’ interest in knowledge related to technology during the COVID-19 pandemic increased. This increase is consistent with research that has shown that technology is increasingly integrated in the field of music therapy but understanding of and education about technology is still limited. While there is much uncertainty regarding when this pandemic will end, the changes brought about in the field of music therapy will surely have strong implications on the future development of the field.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>ABSTRACTPerforming Bela Bartók’s Concerto for Viola and Orchestra poses myriad technical hurdles. The initial approach to studying this work must include practice strategies that isolate its numerous technical challenges and work through them. This is why forging a targeted practice plan is vital in order to avoid inefficient and counterproductive methods of study. To that end this treatise provides a practical guide for violists interested in learning and performing this concerto.
Chapter 1 describes the purpose and need for this study. The chapter also provides a brief background on the difficult genesis of the work and the ongoing debate on the accuracy of the existing editions. Chapters 2 and 3 introduce the methodology chosen for this study and its delimitations. Chapter 4 offers some insight on existing research to be used as complementary material. Chapters 5 and 6 present aspects of Ivan Galamian and Otakar Ševčík’s pedagogical output that relate to this treatise. Chapters 7 to 12 introduce newly created exercises, directed to the violists performing the piece and conceived to overcome technical challenges encountered in the concerto.
This treatise acknowledges the contribution to the advancement of violin pedagogy of Otakar Ševčík, Ivan Galamian and Simon Fischer. While my research is comprised of original exercises for viola, it is based on principles that are complimentary to the technical approach of Otakar Ševčík and Simon Fischer. Footnotes and Appendix C will provide further guidance on this. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>During the Post-World War II construction boom homes in the United States began considering durability, energy conservation, comfort, security, and aesthetics in housing design. These factors, within the residential sector, did not include improving the health and wellness of occupants affected by the physical housing changes. Housing materials and conditions were not deemed as issues that would affect the health and wellness of residents in the past, and this remains the same in today’s modern built housing sector. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The overall goal for this thesis project was to create a housing design that supports positive behavior change, fosters a sense of community, and minimizes environmental impacts on human health. The design proposed by this thesis explores improving user health and wellness through behavioral, community, and environmental aspects of the WELL Building Standard in an affordable residential housing development. The WELL concepts are applicable to achieve affordable solutions for either low, medium, or high-income residences for a time where housing is growing rapidly, increasing in costs, and considerations for health and wellness are needed.  The content in this thesis explains in detail a proposed design solution that is located within a community in Old Fourth Ward, Atlanta, Georgia. The proposed design solution in Old Fourth Ward was developed within the hypothetical housing development, called The Well Community. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The results of this thesis project were translated into programmatic and spatial recommendations for designing residential environments, specifically affordable urban housing that apply the WELL Building Standard to accommodate health and wellness of residents. Designers can shape the built environment, allowing it to become preventative care and a healing aspect for people experiencing a wide range of impairments (Smith, 2015). To create a better design, we must design with psychology in mind and understand how we are affected by the built environment to reach a surrounding that supports our human behavior and how we experience it. Focusing on health and wellness in residential environments provides users with an overall improving life outside of the workplace or any other setting they might be occupying (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018).</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry (IMS-MS) is playing an emerging role in structure elucidation of biomolecules. IMS-MS has certain advantages over traditional biophysical tools due to its high sensitivity and fast measurement time scale. For example, IMS-MS is capable of collecting snapshots of short-lived folding intermediates and conformational transitions, instead of providing only the ensemble-averaged or time-averaged structure. However, certain challenges need to be overcome before IMS-MS becomes a reliable structure elucidation tool. Two of the most significant challenges are (1) accurate determination of cross section, which reflects the microscopic structure information of the analyte ion. (2) understand how and what aspects of the nativelike structures of proteins, proteoforms and protein-ligand complexes can be preserved and interrogated using IMS-MS.Trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS) is a recently commercialized high-resolution ion mobility technique. Tandem trapped ion mobility spectrometry (tandem-TIMS) is a novel instrumentation recently developed in our group. Our group has made significant efforts towards developing TIMS and tandem-TIMS into a reliable structure elucidation tool for biomolecules.
Here, in my dissertation, I demonstrate my continuation work addressing challenges mentioned above to develop TIMS/MS and tandem-TIMS/MS methods for structural elucidation. The dissertation is organized into 6 chapters, as follows:
Chapter 1 provides the motivations for developing TIMS-MS and tandem-TIMS/MS-based structure elucidation methods. Chapter 2 presents a robust, transferable, and sample-independent calibration scheme for TIMS and compares its performance to the currently adopted approach. Chapters 3 to 5 demonstrate how tandem-TIMS/MS is utilized to study structure, motion and ligand-binding behaviors of the protein ribonuclease A and it’s glycoforms ribonuclease B. Chapter 3 focuses on demonstrating the capability of tandem-TIMS/MS in detailed investigation of heterogenous protein structures. Chapter 4 provides the methods that can probe the effect of ligand-binding on structure, compare binding affinity, and assess the gas phase stability of protein and protein-ligand complexes. Chapter 5 is the first step towards correlating gas phase structural heterogeneity with native ensemble structure in solution. Finally, chapter 6 provides a conclusion and future direction. Supplementary details for the aforementioned chapters are found in the appendices.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>We investigated electroless deposition technique for the synthesis of non-noble metal electrocatalyst containing Co-Ni-Mo-P.  As-deposited (ASD) Co-Ni-Mo-P catalyst on carbon substrate that was catalyzed by palladium-polymer ink (CCS) was characterized by SEM, EDX and XRD and then investigated for ethanol oxidation. ASD CoNiMoP/CCS catalyst was amorphous and active in alkaline solution for the oxidation of ethanol (0.5M NaOH+1 M EtOH). Multi-metallic alloy electrocatalyst provided better performance than the tri-metallic or bi-metallic composite electrocatalysts and the thermally treated multi-metallic electrocatalyst was found more effective but with lower stability for ethanol oxidation than its ASD counterpart. The composite multi-metal electrocatalyst mimicked the CV signature – presence of forward and backward oxidation peaks – as found in Pt-group noble metal electrocatalysts. The mimicking of Pt-group behavior was ascribed to the modification of the electronic structure of the surface active deposits that ameliorated the strength of interaction (adsorption-desorption) between OH group and electrocatalyst. Using the forward (if) and backward (ib) oxidation currents and their ratios (if/ib), the effects of bath compositions on the reaction performance was studied and the results showed that the composition and factor interaction of the deposited catalyst is more significant for its performance than the metal ion composition in the electroless bath. The synthesized electrocatalyst was used in a flow cell to generate hydrogen gas.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A comparison between electrolytically deposited CoNiMoP and CoNiMo, showed that the presence of phosphorous in the CoNiMoP deposit enhanced its electrooxidation of ethanol and electrochemical stability. A simple kinetics model was developed that supports the premise that at high ethanol concentration, ethanol reaction mechanism follows the acetaldehyde route while low concentration leads to acetic acid and carbon dioxide route.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In previous scholarly research, the relationship between family connectedness and mobile phone usage has mixed results, with some research touting phones as a relationship enhancer and other admonishing its role in the interpersonal divide between children and their parents. The research then branched off into examining whether or not phone use can be deemed “problematic” as opposed to phone use in other unique communication contexts. This thesis aims to examine if there was a relationship between Conversation Orientation, Mobile Phone Usage, and Attachment in early adolescent children. It was hypothesized that conversation orientation would negatively predict mobile phone use and that mobile phone use would negatively predict attachment. A survey design was employed utilizing a convenience sample of university undergraduate students (N=196). They were asked to keep their early adolescent experiences in mind while they completed the survey. Afterwards, data analysis was conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics 26. Results indicated that there was no significant relationship between conversation orientation and mobile phone usage, as well as no significant relationship between mobile phone use and attachment despite individuals with higher attachment scores registering higher phone use. Further research should work to define a phone use scale that is divorced from the realm of problematic phone use. Alternatively, there may be other factors at play in this relationship that could be introduced into future analysis. Utilizing early adolescents as a sample would provide a more detailed platform for analysis and generating conclusive results. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Considerable evidence has been accumulated on the risk factors associated with ADHD, but little is known about the minority of children with ADHD who may be flourishing despite this neurodevelopmental risk. The present multi-informant study is an initial step towards this line of research with the basic, but essential and unanswered, question: Are there resilient children with ADHD? The sample included a well-characterized, clinically evaluated sample of 206 children with (n=108) and without ADHD (n=98) ages 8-13 years (M=10.31, SD=1.41; 85 girls; 66.5% Caucasian/Non-Hispanic). Reliable change analysis based on the BASC-3 Resiliency subscale indicated that a majority of children with ADHD are perceived by their parents and teachers as resilient (52.8%-59.2%), with rates that did not differ from a Non-ADHD sample matched for the number of clinical disorders other than ADHD (p&gt;.09). Profile analyses indicated that resilient children with ADHD tend to have better developed cognitive abilities (IQ), better math achievement, more anxiety, and less oppositional-defiance than their low-resilient peers with ADHD based on parent and/or teacher report, and – presumably as a consequence – be less likely to require psychostimulant medication treatment. Interestingly, anxiety emerged as a protective factor for children with ADHD despite being a risk factor for children without ADHD. In contrast, children with ADHD do not appear to benefit from the protective effects of higher SES despite children with and without ADHD benefiting similarly from better-developed cognitive abilities. Further research is needed to identify additional factors that promote adaptive functioning and improve treatment outcomes for children with ADHD.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Diversity in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce is in continual demand among underrepresented minorities and women. Of particular concern is the disproportionality low rates of Black women in STEM in relationship to their science and engineering (S&amp;E) degree attainment and overall representation in the workforce. Studies traditionally have explored the underrepresentation of Black women in STEM within general analyses of women or underrepresented minorities, without considering the multidimensionality of the Black women and their barriers they may face due to the intersectionality of their race and gender. Considering personal-family characteristics, professional structures, race, and gender this study takes an in-depth analysis of the factors that lead to S&amp;E graduates to unemployment or career mismatch, working in an occupation unrelated to one’s degree field. Applying an intersectionality approach and Oaxaca-Blinder variance decompositions analyses, this study gives attention to the career mismatch and unemployment outcomes of Black women and the reasons for these outcomes in comparisons to non-Hispanic White counterparts and non-Hispanic Black men. The results reveal that S&amp;E degrees reduce career mismatch and unemployment, but not so much for Black women with S&amp;E degrees. Race and gender are associated with unexplained career mismatch, and minimal unemployment variance occurred between race-gender comparison groups. Therefore, this study strengthens the implication for continued research, policy, and practice enhancements to address the underrepresentation of Black women in STEM careers.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study aimed to describe and quantify the types of spelling errors produced in the writing samples of children with limited English proficiency (LEP) and children who are English monolingual speakers. The spelling errors on monomorphemic words in 100 writing samples, 50 by children with LEP and 50 by monolingual English speakers, were coded for phonology and orthography. The study also aimed to identify if the type and quantity of spelling errors significantly differ between English monolingual children and children with LEP and if there is a consistent error patterns between the writing samples of LEP children that differ from the error patterns of their English monolingual peers. The analysis of spelling errors produced by both groups showed that the type of spelling errors produced between the English monolingual children and the children with LEP did differ significantly with children with LEP producing significantly more plausible phonology errors, minor orthography errors, vowel orthography errors, and more spelling errors over all. Implications for how the results of this study can be used to best support children with LEP in schools are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The metabolic state of an organism and their sense of olfaction are closely interrelated. There is significant evidence that olfactory signals can modulate multiple metabolic parameters and, in turn, that metabolically relevant signals can modulate the function of the olfactory system and olfactory behavior. Diet and exercise are two powerful metabolic forces. Poor diet and low levels of physical activity are associated with increased disease and cancer rates, higher overall mortality, pro-inflammatory immune state, disrupted neurogenesis and reduced cognitive ability. Conversely, regular participation in voluntary exercise is associated with decreased disease and cancer incidence, lower overall morality, lower inflammation, increased neurogenesis and improved cognition. The dangers of poor diet and the benefits of exercise are somewhat characterized in the periphery and in several select brain areas. Much less is known about how diet and exercise impact the olfactory system.  	Previous work in a rodent model demonstrated that long-term consumption of a high-fat diet resulted in, as expected, a significant increase of bodyweight and bodyfat as well as, and perhaps more surprisingly, a significant reduction in the number of olfactory sensory neurons. In these findings it is difficult to determine what caused the neuronal loss: the unhealthy diet or the overconsumption and concomitant weight gain and body composition changes. Additionally, whether the neuroprotective effects of voluntary exercise extend to the olfactory system is virtually unexplored. To address these questions, I fed mice the same obesogenic diet that has been shown to result in neuronal loss, but I used a system of daily pair-feeding to prevent overconsumption and weight gain in order to disentangle the effects of the diet per se from its metabolic consequences. In a separate experiment, I provided mice that were maintained on either a normal rodent chow or the obesogenic diet with access to a running wheel to assess the effects of long-term voluntary exercise on the olfactory system independently and in combination with the demonstrated effects of the unhealthy diet. Finally, I compared the voluntary exercise behavior of a transgenic mouse line with unique metabolic and olfactory phenotypes (genetic knockouts for a voltage gated potassium channel) to wildtype mice when maintained on two different diets.
	In the pair-feeding experiments, mice that were pair-fed with the obesogenic did not gain weight or adiposity, but they still displayed a significant reduction of olfactory sensory neurons equal to that of the obese mice that were provided unlimited access to the diet. Interestingly, both pair-fed and ad libitum-fed mice maintained on the high-fat diet displayed equal levels of the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor and comparable levels of impaired glucose metabolism despite vastly different bodyweights and adiposity. In the exercise experiments, providing mice with a running wheel partially combated the metabolic detriments associated with the fatty diet. Mice maintained on the high-fat diet and given a running wheel weighed less, had lower body fat, and slightly improved glucose metabolism compared to mice on the same diet without access to a wheel. However, these partial protections did not extend to the olfactory system as mice fed the fatty diet in combination with running wheel access still displayed a significant loss of olfactory sensory neurons. In fact, if anything long-term exercise may have a negative effect on the olfactory system as mice maintained on the normal chow with access to running wheels also displayed a slight, but not statistically significant reduction in olfactory sensory neurons, though no behavioral deficits were noted in any of the groups. Additionally, the potassium channel knockout mice and wildtype mice displayed similar levels of wheel running but exhibited altered running patterns.  
	These data further display the intricate connection between olfaction and metabolic state. Strong metabolic drivers like diet modification and exercise can impact the neurons in the olfactory system. My data suggest an inflammatory link between consumption of a fatty diet and neuronal loss in the olfactory system that occurs independently of obesity and is not prevented by wheel running, though no causative link is demonstrated by these experiments. Future studies using diets of varying but closely matched compositions or a broader evaluation of inflammatory pathways are warranted to better understand the mechanisms underlying the bidirectional influences between olfaction and metabolism.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation consists of three projects in two research areas: 1) modeling of temporal point process (with one project) and 2) protein design in computational structural biology (with two projects).  My research work in these three projects can be summarized as follows:</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Project 1 is on methodology development.  It is well known that the classical theory on temporal point process only focuses on time-based framework, where a conditional intensity function at each given time can fully describe the process. However, such a framework cannot directly capture important overall features/patterns in the process, such as characterizing a center-outward rank or identifying outliers in a given sample. Therefore I propose a new, data-driven model for regular point process in this study, provide a probabilistic model using two factors: (1) the number of events in the process, and (2) the conditional distribution of these events given the number. The second factor is the key challenge. Based on the equivalent inter-event representation, I propose two frameworks on the inter-event times (IETs) to capture large variability in a given process -- One is to model the IETs directly by a Dirichlet mixture, and the other is to model the isometric logratio transformed IETs by a classical Gaussian mixture.  Both mixture models can be properly estimated using a Dirichlet process (for the number of components) and Expectation-Maximization algorithm (for parameters in the models). In particular, I thoroughly examine the new models on the commonly used Poisson processes. I finally demonstrate the new framework on two simulated datasets and point out its effectiveness on characterizing center-outward ranks.	</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Project 2 is a computational investigation, where I use deep learning methods to tackle inverse protein folding, a challenging problem in computational structural biology.  I begin with formulating the IPF problem as predicting the residue type given the 3D structural environment around the target residue. Afterwards, I design a nine-layer deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that takes as input a gridded box with the atomic coordinates and types around the residue, captures structure information at various scales, and provides a predicted residue type. Trained on thousands of protein structures, the method, called ProDCoNN (Protein Design with Convolutional Neural Network), achieved state-of-the-art performance when tested on large numbers of test proteins and benchmark datasets.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Project 3 is another computational investigation, where I use deep learning and reinforcement learning methods to study the challenging protein-ligand docking in computational structural biology. In order to find the optimal binding modes of protein-ligand complexes, I propose a supervised searching algorithm based on Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic algorithm in reinforcement learning. I take the gridded box with protein atomic information around the target binding site as environment, design a CNN as actor to guide the ligand move in the box and another CNN as critic to predict the binding affinity. The new framework is trained and tested using hundreds of protein-ligand complexes with single-atom ligand Copper and Zinc. The result shows that the new framework can find out the target binding site efficiently and predicted a reasonable binding affinity.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Approximately 48,300 people die by suicide yearly in the United States (U.S.) alone. Just over half of these deaths result from self-inflicted gunshot wounds, which is to be expected given that 9 out of 10 attempts involving a firearm result in death. Suicide research has demonstrated that prohibiting or reducing access to lethal means, or reducing the lethality of lethal means is am effective intervention for reducing suicide risk. The focus of studying lethal means in suicide research has recently emphasized firearms more strongly, and the literature has yielded strategies to increase the acceptability of lethal means counseling among at-risk individuals; however, strategies have yet to be empirically proven that effectively influence behavioral outcomes (i.e., increased engagement in firearm safety behaviors/thoughts). The present study sought to accomplish this. Nationally recruited at-risk, gun-owning community participants (n = 23) were randomly assigned to one of two intervention groups: 1) standard intervention (i.e., suicide risk assessment, safety planning, and lethal means counseling) with a gun lock and instructional video for its proper use, and 2) standard intervention without a gun lock or instructional video. Public health research findings have provided compelling evidence that administering gun locks increases gun safety behaviors in average gun-owners. Accordingly, we hypothesized that among an at-risk sample of gun-owners, administering gun locks would interact with time to increase Engagement in Firearm Safety Behaviors, Intentions to Adhere to Clinician Recommendations, Recommending to Others to Adhere to Clinician Recommendations, and Acceptability of lethal means safety intervention. Hypotheses were tested using Linear Mixed Modeling and demonstrated no interaction effects for group x time. However, main effects for time on Intentions to Adhere to Clinician Recommendations and on Acceptability of Intervention were found and elaborated on in greater detail in our discussion.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Utilizing the foundational concepts posited in the work of Tania Modleski, Janice Radway, and Andreas Huyssen, my dissertation project proposes a new method of receptive reading which prioritizes balanced textual examinations that integrate both critical and popular engagement, while concurrently exploring how white, patriarchal masculinist traditions still impact the production, circulation, and adaptations of women’s media, as well as a self-reflexive investigation into we, as academics, position ourselves into the machine of cultural legitimation and its ensuing bias. Regardless, women readers devour women-authored cultural content, extrapolating subversive and transformative narratives from traditionally denigrated feminine genres. My research seeks to continue the work of Elana Levine and open up crucial critical spaces to explore media that runs afoul of High/Low Split’s sexist, racist, classist, and heteronormative implications.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>“Race in the Prairie State: Black Laws and African American Activism in Nineteenth Century Illinois” looks at Illinois’s anti-black legislation throughout the nineteenth century, tracing its evolution from pseudo-slavery and indentured servitude to the exclusion of black immigration entirely. Concurrently, it investigates African American activism as a response to Illinois’s black laws, which outlawed African American immigration and settlement. This dissertation argues that Illinois’s laws regarding African Americans were similar to those of the upper South, because their shared borders and cultural similarities helped dictate their views on race. “Race in the Prairie State” looks at Illinois’s black activism and finds that, as a movement, it appeared much later than in other Northern states. People of color in Illinois finally coalesced against the state’s black laws in the early 1850s. This dissertation argues that this was, in part, due to the lack of a white backed abolition party apparatus in Illinois, which in other Northern states, served as an arena for black leaders to build a local movement from within a larger, national entity.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Founded in 1938, Florida’s Marine Studios was the world’s first “Oceanairum,” a place where marine life of different species lived in the same tanks in captivity.  After becoming a financial success, the facility franchised and changed its name to Marineland, and later Marineland of Florida.  Marineland became the prototype that allowed public access to marine research facilities that continues today. The legacy of Marineland involves combining research, entertainment, learning, and wonder can be seen in the continued popularity of places like Seaquarium, Georgia Aquarium, and Sea World.  By providing a unique blend of science, film, and tourism, Marine Studios brought about a change in the way both scientists and the American public understood marine environments and the animals that inhabit them.  Through these three different mediums, Marine Studios made people passionate about the oceans and environment.Marine Studios was created as a place for tourists to visit a scientific research laboratory and a film studio, and while it might sound unusual to combine these disparate entities into one facility today, it did not seem that way to its original founders. The founders original mission was to educate the public about life under the water at Marine Studios and they felt that entertainment helped with education. Cornelius Vanderbilt Whiney later stated that he and his cousin/business partner William Douglas Burden “wanted to bring the museum to life and find a way to provide entertainment which would stimulate and educate.”   Their years on the board of the American Museum of Natural History were pivotal for their interest in creating Marine Studios.  
Marine Studios’ story is unique among other marine research or recreation facilities in the United States and around the world.  It was created by an unusual cast of founders and investors who could afford to create a business in the years following the Great Depression.  As the first oceanarium, it became the first place to house animals of different species in the same tanks as one would see in the oceans and present these scenes to the viewer to provide an unobstructed view of the action.  The animals were captured and cared for in new ways created just for the facility.  Their survival lead to the training of some species and the scientific study of others.  The facility survived being mostly abandoned during World War II; when its founders and caretakers were away during the war, it served the country as part of the Coast Guard civil defense program, and its staff participated in the creation of shark repellent along with many other important missions relevant to the war effort.  It was reopened on the cusp of many of the largest financially profitable decades in Florida’s tourist industry.  Marine Studios was financially successful enough to franchise and had a name change so that it could put itself on the map, literally and figuratively.  Later known as Marineland of Florida, it played host to some of the most important marine scientists of the twentieth century as they worked and visited the facility to gain knowledge from its resident animals.  These studies became the foundations for future scientific inquiry into dolphin communication, lactation, breeding, and behavior.  Balancing entertainment and education, the facility was neither fully research center nor fully spectacle, a dichotomy picked up by other marine life facilities when they were created on the Marine Studios’ model.  One of the central issues for the facility was that balance between science and spectacle that worked both as an advantage while it was also equally a hindrance.  
With its many purposes and eclectic group of founders, staff, and visitors, Marine Studios serves as a lens to view many issues of science and culture during the twentieth century.  With its unique aspects, it lends itself for inquiry into how these issues shaped an institution.  Spanning from its creation to a series of new challenges and changes in the 1970s, “A Porthole Into A New World: The Contributions of Marine Studios To American Popular and Scientific Understanding of Marine Life” also seeks to better understand how one unique facility changed American understanding of marine environments and the animals who call them home.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>When discussing organ music composed in France during the Romantic period, it is imperative to mention César Franck. Though his compositional output for the organ is smaller compared to his contemporaries, such as Widor and Guilmant, these works remain cornerstones of the repertoire that have stood the test of time. Franck was born in Liège in 1822. His father aspired for a virtuoso career for him and in 1836 they emigrated to Paris. He was enrolled in the Paris Conservatory in 1837. Franck enrolled in the organ class at the conservatory in 1842, which would be the beginning of a prolific career as an organist. In 1857, Franck was appointed as organist at Sainte-Clotilde and in 1871 was appointed as organ professor at the Paris Conservatory, positions he held until his death in 1890. Franck’s large hands create problems of interpretation for performers, with wide intervallic spreads constantly found throughout the manual writing in his organ works. These problems make it difficult to play certain passages with a legato technique. It is this legato technique that Marcel Dupré and Charles-Marie Widor criticized Franck for not being able to demonstrate, though his work on the 1881 Braille edition of Johann Sebastian Bach’s works demonstrates Franck’s knowledge and application of the complete legato style. 
The Trois Chorals are the pinnacle of Franck’s writing for the organ, written in the final months of Franck’s life. Four primary editions of the Chorals are discussed and the variances that occur between them. Following this discussion is an analysis of the performances in recordings by Charles Tournemire, Jean Langlais, Marcel Dupré, and Gillian Weir of Franck’s Choral No. 3 in A Minor. The analysis focuses on key moments of interpretive discrepancy.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Joseph Jongen wrote more than thirty organ works, with the Sonata eroïca and Symphonie concertante as major landmarks in the instrument’s repertoire. Jongen was active in the years immediately following Franck’s death through World War II.  Born in Liège, Jongen had an early start as a composer and organist. Jongen enrolled in the organ class at the Liège Conservatory in 1892, winning top prize with honors at the Concours Supérieur in 1896. Jongen won the Belgium Prix de Rome in 1897, which enabled him to travel to Europe. During this time, he consulted with Richard Strauss and Vincent d’Indy regarding his compositions. Jongen’s magnum opus among his solo works for organ is the Sonata eroïca (Op. 94). In this symphonic-inspired work, Jongen presents unique registrations and ambiguous moments of registration changes, creating problems that the performer must solve, which are different from one instrument to another.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Street level bureaucrats, especially those in the criminal justice system, are expected to be neutrally competent. Yet local and state police have an unusual level of discretion on the job making them especially vulnerable to more practical considerations. This dissertation examines how human incentives and discretion affect decision-making which is especially important since this has implications for the perceived legitimacy of our broader democratic system. My first two papers use a nationally representative random sample of 500 local and state law enforcement agencies, and conducts a field experiment to test the factors that predict the accountability of local and state law enforcement agencies. The third paper examines the effect of elections on arrest behavior of sheriff deputies. Taken together this research sheds light on bias that law enforcement exhibits in their day to day dealings with the public.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation examines the relationship between queer geography and gentrification in Atlanta, Georgia. This relationship is intrinsically tied to issues of urban land valuation, sexuality, race, and the material reality of a sprawling urban area. Using data from thirty-five participant interviews, I examine the transformation of the former gayborhood of Midtown, and its relationships to the broader queer geographies of Atlanta. I begin by tracing the historical context of Midtown, from the post-war period and beyond. First, I examine how suburbanization, white flight, and narratives of good and bad families influenced valuation of the inner-city. In Midtown, the denigration of urban Black families and subsequent devaluation of urban land allowed for a return to the city of those queer persons who did not fit the suburban, family-oriented ideal. Next, I discuss how a reinvestment in the city in the late-twentieth and early-twenty-first century triggered processes of gentrification, revaluing Midtown. This revaluation simultaneously gentrified out many poorer queers while also helping to further a rich, white gay homonorm. I document how developers marketing Midtown commodified a privileged gay identity, leading to the dispersal of those LGBTQ community members that did not fit within a particular cis white male gay norm and lacked the financial means to pay the rapidly escalating rents in the neighborhood. Instead, they became a dispersed population that would need to contend with a new material reality, one that lacked long-term physical locations for community gathering. Finally, using the lens of mobilities, I trace how these dispersed Atlanta queers make place for themselves, often in temporary and ephemeral ways. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>At the nexus of Black feminist theory, geography, and literature this multidisciplinary project investigates the politics of space and the problem of dwelling in Toni Morrison’s socio-spatial quartette. Collectively, A Mercy, Beloved, Paradise, and Jazz make legible a complex geographic story by capturing the simultaneity of past, present and future on the material landscape. This simultaneity problematizes what Lisa Lowe calls “existing conventions for knowing and representing ‘modernity’ through narratives of progress and development.” In conversation with Hortense Spillers, Saidiya Hartman, Angela Davis, Christina Sharpe, and Katherine McKittrick, I argue that Morrison uses a spatial imagination to dismantle modernity’s monolithic myths of progress and development by illustrating how space has been produced in and through what McKittrick calls “the relational violences of modernity,” which violently throw language and dwelling into crisis.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Saint Bernardino exerted profound influences on lay piety and both the image and trajectory of the Observant movement. While there have been numerous studies on Bernardino the preacher and the Observant movement as a whole, no study has shown how preaching to the laity could have spread the ideas and values of the Observance. This study seeks to illuminate the ways in which Bernardino’s Latin sermons, which were model sermons for preachers, contain deep Observant parallels. While the Observant movement has been appreciated for the widespread reform it brought to the religious orders, few have shown how this reform effort might have been transported to the laity. By looking at three of Bernardino’s sermons designed for use by preachers, I argue we can read many Observant beliefs and anxieties underlying Bernardino’s thought. This allows us to sketch a picture of how the laity might have absorbed Observant ideologies unintentionally and how preachers might have directly transported the Observance to the laity. Additionally, this study challenges our definitions of the Observance, where we can find it, and who had stakes in its success or failure.  </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Creating a positive college environment regarding body image concerns is warranted given their strong association with eating disorders (EDs) and the alarming rates of EDs on college campuses. There is also a growing need to universally diversify ED prevention programs, explore the multidimensional construct of body image, and enhance selective prevention recruitment initiatives. This dissertation examined 132 undergraduate students in a universal and mixed gendered setting, their classrooms. Participants in the intervention condition received a single session of the Be Your Body’s Friend presentation, an adapted cognitive dissonance-based intervention aimed at reducing ED risk factors. The control condition included participants who received a general classroom lecture. Females and males in the two conditions were compared at pre, post, and 1-month follow-up timepoints on appearance-ideal internalization (thin-ideal and muscular-ideal), body image satisfaction, body image experiences related to quality of life, and behavioral intention to enroll in a selective ED prevention program, known as the Body Project (Becker, Rhode, &amp; Shaw, 2012). Repeated measure analyses showed that those in the intervention condition significantly lowered muscular-ideal internalization scores at follow-up when compared to the control condition. Collectively, the findings suggest that it is important to explore the role of muscularity in ED development for females and other underlying dimensions of body image, namely body appreciation. Mixed gendered settings might also benefit from cultivating conversations regarding the social injustices of beauty standards and adding intervention components, such as focus groups. These adjustments may help enhance the levels of cognitive dissonance experienced by participants to increase body image satisfaction and behavioral intention to enroll in the Body Project.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Expository writing, a modality of language to convey information, is worthy of analysis in school-age children because it is the predominant genre utilized in the classroom beginning in fourth grade and continuing through high school (Nippold &amp; Scott, 2010). Grammatical accuracy is a consistently noted weakness in the written language of children with language impairment (LI). Although measures to assess grammatical accuracy vary across studies, students with language impairment have been found to produce more syntactic errors in their expository writing than their typically developing peers (Fey et al., 2004; Mackie &amp; Dockrell, 2004; Scott &amp; Windsor, 2000; Windsor et al., 2000). While previous research had evaluated morphological errors (Owen, 2010; Windsor, Scott, &amp; Street, 2000) that distinguish the writing of students with and without language impairment, it is unclear which clause specific types of errors distinguish complex syntax between these two groups. In other words, there is no known evidence of errors specific to clause type to distinguish expository writing between school-aged children with and without LI. The purpose of this study was to analyze the frequency and type of grammatical errors within the types of complex clauses produced in fifth grade students’ expository writing samples. The expository writing samples of 59 students enrolled in the fifth grade were drawn for analysis from an archived data set. Participants were English speakers, without ESOL status. Following adherence to inclusion criteria, 31 students with typical language development (TLD) and 27 students with a diagnosis of language impairment (LI) were included in analyses. Using SALT conventions, the writing samples were orthographically transcribed and segmented at the T-unit. The samples were then coded for the subordination index, clause types, and grammatical errors by clause type. Descriptive statistics were used to report the distribution of scores on grammatical measures across groups. Nonparametric Mann-Whitney U tests examined differences in group means of clause type productions, errors and two measures of general language performance (mean length utterance and subordination composite score), while a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) analyzed group differences in three general language performance measures (total utterances produced, total number of words and total number of different words).  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Results revealed that although frequency in error production did not significantly differ between groups, students with a diagnosed language impairment produced significantly more subordinating clause errors and full propositional-complement clause errors than their age-matched typically developing peers. There were no significant differences between groups in the production of coordinating or relative clause errors. Additional descriptive measures of general language performance indicated no significant differences between groups. Furthermore, results indicate that school-based professionals may need to provide more direct attention toward subordinate and full propositional-complement clauses in their students’ with language impairment in particular, writing. However, given non-significant differences in coordinating and relative clause errors and other grammatical errors, students with typically developing language may need more direct instruction, as well, as they are still learning to execute and manipulate elements of complex syntax. Future research should incorporate a larger, more geographically diverse study to analyze the complex syntax of expository studies across a range of writing contexts to aid in determining more generalizable outcomes representative of fifth grade students with language impairment.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Common stereotypes contend that boys have more natural ability and interest in math than do girls, which may contribute to the underrepresentation of women in some Science, Technology, Engineering and Math fields. Research suggests that many teachers endorse these stereotypes to some extent. These stereotypes have the potential to be transferred to their students via their behavior, which may impact math self-concept and achievement, particularly in girls. Thus, we hypothesized that math-gender stereotyping in teachers would be associated with lower math achievement and self-concept in their female, but not male students, and that student math-gender stereotyping would mediate these relationships. In a sample of 2,387 kindergarten through 3rd grade students and their 223 teachers from 30 schools in the United States, we measured student math achievement and self-concept in Fall and Spring of the 2018/19 school year. We also measured math-gender stereotyped beliefs in both the teachers and the 3rd grade students from the sample. We found evidence of male-biased math-gender stereotypes in both teachers and male students, and female-biased stereotypes in female students. Using multi-level models, we found that there were no significant relations between teacher stereotyping and student math achievement or self-concept. We also found no relation between teacher stereotyping and student stereotyping in the 3rd grade students, and thus did not test the overall mediation model. However, when stereotypes about men and women were examined separately from those about girls and boys, we found that male-biased stereotyping about adults in teachers was associated with higher math achievement overall, and higher stereotyping and lower math self-concept in 3rd grade boys. We suggest that teacher math-gender stereotyping overall may not be a particularly effective avenue for intervention to improve math outcomes for female students, but that the influence of stereotypes about adults specifically merits exploration. Future research with a developmental approach is required understand how these relations may change over time and what potential gender stereotyping may have as a candidate for intervention as children grow. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>One of the central goals of evolutionary biology is to understand the evolutionary relationships among organisms by constructing phylogenetic estimates, commonly known as evolutionary trees. The accuracy of phylogenetic estimates can be strongly affected by the particular evolutionary processes that are taken into account during an analysis. One important process, genetic recombination, has been shown to lead to inaccurate phylogenetic estimates when ignored. Simulation studies measuring the accuracy of phylogenetic estimates in the presence of recombination have shown that when recombination is ignored, phylogenetic accuracy is reduced when divergence times are shallow and recombination is frequent. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Here, we describe a novel simulation study designed to determine the impact that genetic recombination has on phylogenetic analyses when sequence alignments are concatenated. In this simulation, gene trees that undergo recombination and speciation through time are created from a species tree template. These gene trees, which represent the evolutionary history of individual exons, are then used to simulate DNA sequence alignments which, in turn, are concatenated in patterns resembling common DNA partitioning approaches. If there is recombination present among the sequences, this exon concatenation approach can create a mixed evolutionary history in the newly concatenated alignment. Gene trees and species trees inferred from the alignments are compared to their corresponding true trees to assess the uncertainty of the phylogenetic estimates that is created by the presence of recombination. In addition to this simulation study, we have constructed a forward-time population genetics simulator that allows for customization of important model parameters like recombination rate. From this study, we will be able to provide recommendations to empirical researchers as to when it is most beneficial to treat exons as independent evolutionary units in phylogenetic analyses.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Latin American genre of documentary narrative known as Testimonio becomes an essential and primary narrative tool of both Cubans on the island and of Cuban-American exiles. This genre has not met its “institutional death” (as originally suggested by leading expert, John Beverley); but rather, it has resurfaced in new ways that utilize a visual component in order to further Cuban-diasporic thinking. Such innovative advances require new means of interpretation and analysis. As a result, this project is the beginning of my long-term research goal of expanding the Latin American Testimonio canon to better understand which texts have slipped from inclusion and follow the evolution of testimonio practices as new immersive technologies are introduced into the global market and stimulate the capacity to experience memories across a number of senses and dimensions. This project takes a diasporic, interdisciplinary and transnational approach to expand Latin American literary studies by engaging with film studies, queer studies and testimonial studies. I relate these discussions to the various ethnographic practices and forms used throughout the latter part of the twentieth century and the beginning of the twenty-first century: the testimonial novel, autobiography, biography, documentary, film, the graphic testimonio and biopic.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The objective of this thesis is to investigate the effects of social factors on the production and acceptance of contact-induced linguistic variables from the Galician-influenced verbal system. Situations of language contact and other social variables have been observed to impact and induce linguistic variation (Labov, 2001; Silva-Corvalán, 1979; Thomason &amp; Kaufman, 1988; Thomason, 2001). The contact between Spanish and Galician in Galicia, Spain has influenced both languages involved; the ways in which Spanish impacts Galician has received more attention in previous literature. However, a selection of articles has also investigated how Galician influences the variety of Spanish spoken in Galicia (Álvarez Cáccamo, 1983; Chamorro, 2012; Porto Dapena, 2001; Rojo, 1974; Ramallo, 2007;). Previous research investigating the distinct linguistic features of the contact variety of Galician Spanish simply describe the features provoked by the language contact, neglecting to empirically examine the possible covariation between linguistic and social variables. The Spanish Galician verbal system offers numerous structures with features atypical to non-contact varieties of Spanish, such as the non-standard usage of the Imperfect Subjunctive in place of the preterite and pluperfect in addition to complex verbal periphrases, such as tener + PP or dar + PP, thus providing an ideal array of linguistic variables to study in covariation with the social variables of age, gender, language dominance, and linguistic attitudes.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Participants of this study were Galician-Spanish bilinguals from the Northwestern part of Galicia, the Northwestern-most Autonomous Community of Spain. Participants completed the Bilingual Language Profile questionnaire to assess their linguistic and social background (Birdsong et al., 2012). 21 participants (11 male, 10 female, Mean age = 29 years, range: 18 - 63 years) completed two production tasks: a sociolinguistic interview and a Discourse Completion Task (DCT), and 12 participants (3 male, 9 female, Mean age = 42.33 years, range: 21 - 63 years) completed an Acceptability Judgement Task (AJT). Consistent with previous studies (Argyri &amp; Sorace, 2007; Iglesias &amp; Castillejo, 2020; Stocker &amp; Berthele, 2020), it was hypothesized that Galician language dominance would influence the production and acceptance of verbal constructions of the contact variety (Hypothesis 1). In addition, it was hypothesized that the three social variables of age, gender, and linguistic attitudes would influence the Galician Spanish verbal system. That is, younger and older speakers more than middle age groups (age), male speakers more than female speakers (gender), and speakers with linguistic attitudes favoring the Galician language and culture over the Spanish language and culture (linguistic attitudes) will demonstrate an increased production and acceptance of Galician-influenced verbal structures (Hypothesis 2) (Barbieri, 2008; Labov, 1990; Labov, 2001; Silva-Corvalán, 1979; Silva-Corvalán, 1986; Wolf and Jiménez, 1979).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Data collected from the sociolinguistic interviews and the DCT rendered 9 tokens—a number too small to conduct a quantitative analysis of social factors and production of the target verbal constructions. Nonetheless, the tasks revealed that all tokens were produced by Galician-dominant young male speakers with linguistic attitudes favoring Galician over Spanish. A series of linear regression analyses were conducted on the bilinguals’ acceptability ratings from an AJT. These revealed that male speakers, Galician language dominance, and linguistic attitudes that favor Galician significantly predicted increased acceptance of all the Galician-influence verbal constructions. Age as a social variable was a significant predictor of the acceptance of the tener + PP and dar + PP verbal constructions where younger age correlated with increased acceptance. The results contribute to the larger body of literature that describe situations of contact-induced language change and is the first study to explore the relationship between social factors and linguistic variation in the Galician Spanish verbal system.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>High-entropy alloys are a class of materials that are defined as containing five or more constituent elements, each with atomic percentages of 5-35%. They are of interest not only because of their novel structural/chemical composition, but also because they exhibit extraordinary properties, including high stress and strain strength, high corrosive strength, and the retention of these characteristics across broad temperature and pressure ranges. Superconductivity has also been observed in some high-entropy alloys, with d – electron systems being extensively researched. In contrast, f – electron systems have remained largely unstudied. Following earlier work by W. Lucas Nelson that addressed [TaNb]1-x(UHfTi)x [13], the substitution series [TaNb]1-x(CeHfTi)x was synthesized for concentrations x = 0.2 – 0.4. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>X-ray diffraction measurements show the cerium HEA forms a body centered cubic phase with minimal impurities. Differences were discovered in the XRD of cold worked v. as cast samples, and the inducement of impurities through cold working was documented. In order to investigate the electronic and magnetic properties of these materials, magnetic susceptibility χ (T), magnetization M (H), electrical resistivity ρ (T), and heat capacity C (T) measurements were performed for the as-cast specimens. Resistivity measurements showed disordered metallic behavior, with the occurrence of superconductivity at a critical temperature Tc ≈ 7 K for all concentrations, while the upper critical field Hc2 increases with increasing x. Magnetic susceptibility χ (T) measurements confirm the existence of a superconducting state, and magnetization as a function of field, M (H), suggest type II superconductivity. An additional magnetically hysteretic state spanning 10 – 225 K is also seen in χ (T) for some concentrations. This aspect of the behavior is not fully explored in this work, and will require further investigation. The superconductivity is shown to occur in the bulk for x = 0.3 through heat capacity C (T) measurements, with a bulk-like jump being observed at Tc. Taken together, these data show the cerium HEA to be a bulk type II superconductor for x = 0.2 and 0.3 while larger concentrations show weakened superconductivity with evidence for cerium magnetism. This opens a path towards investigating f – electron superconductivity in these and other high entropy alloys, where it remains to be seen: (i) whether higher transition temperatures can be accessed and (ii) whether strong electronic correlations that are related to the f – electron state relevant to the superconductivity and other physical properties.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Actualizations of Utopia: Ideological Space &amp; The Ultima Oslo Contemporary Music Festival expands upon Henri Lefebvre’s concept of social space by developing the concept of ideological space in order to examine how sound engages with embedded systems of societal valuing. Using the Ultima Contemporary Music Festival in Oslo, Norway as a case study, this thesis posits the festival as an example of how localized microideologies can engage in macroideological discourse as a means of confronting glocalized issues such as migration, racism, and xenophobia. By analyzing The Ultima Festival’s founding, the approaches of its artistic directors, its institutional organization, and its positions on progressive social issues in relation to Nordic conceptions of whiteness and Europeanness, this study emphasizes that deconstructing myths of utopianism is critical if contemporary arts organization are to actualize egalitarian spaces.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>An accumulation of experimental evidence over the past two decades has tightened the relationship between thermodynamics and the emergence of structure in driven natural systems. A plausible explanation for how structure emerges has arisen from the theory of stochastic thermodynamics called dissipative adaptation. As thermodynamic systems transition between states due to thermal fluctuations and external agency, the system is biased towards states that efficiently absorb energy from the applied force. The theory shows promise in explaining many challenging concepts such as phase transitions and evolutionary adaptation. However, nature is replete with systems that augment their configuration and act on their environment with apparent intent. In its current formulation, dissipative adaptation offers no insight into the mechanisms underlying this emergent feedback behavior. In this work, we propose that by integrating recent advances in stochastic process research and information theory we can extend this first principles approach to study the emergence of information processing. We propose a novel probabilistic graphical model that captures the underlying principles of stochastic thermodynamic systems capable of measurement. The model is based on an emerging discipline that integrates information into stochastic thermodynamics known as thermodynamics of information. Modern work in stochastic optimization theory provides a provably convergent stochastic approximation algorithm based on the Robbins-Munro algorithm that follows from the extended second law of thermodynamics. Finally, we will examine loosely coupled networks of individual systems that obey our stochastic optimization scheme while being stimulated by a transient data generating distribution and observe the hypothesized emergent behavior. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The geological history of Himalayans and Tibetan Plateau is important for understanding how our planet evolves, and how geological structures can have local and global effects on climate and floral and faunal evolution of a system. This thesis presents how biostratigraphy of calcareous nannofossils can be a vital tool when attempting to identify timing of sedimentological events captured within cores recovered from deep below the ocean floor. Here I utilize nannofossil biostratigraphy from International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 354 Sites 1451 and 1450 drilled in the Eastern Bengal Fan to investigate the paleogeographic setting and evolution of the Himalayans. This is done by linking autogenetic characteristics of calcareous nannofossils to allogenic and autogenic processes directed by tectonic and climatic forcing. More specifically, this study uses biostratigraphy to identify nannofossils observed in sediments collected to produce a data set for assigning a biostratigraphic zonal scheme. The biostratigraphy is used as a baseline for calculating sedimentation rates and errors, relate sedimentation rates and turbidite frequencies to tectonic and climatic forcing and understanding the paleo environment. Biostratigraphy is a vital tool for identifying events directed by tectonic and climatic forcing and in turn, to test and support or reject other groups of researchers’ hypotheses.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Expedition 354 Site 1451 was successful at recording nannofossil markers from the Holocene (0 Ma) to the Miocene-Oligocene boundary (23 Ma). The Gradstein et al. (2012) Time Scale was utilized to assign ages to the Martini (1971) and Okada &amp; Bukry (1980) nannofossil zonal schemes. Sixty-one biostratigraphic events assigned by sixty-five marker species were observed delineating sixty-one zones/subzones discussed herein. The ages range from recently deposited (Holocene) to older than 57.4 million years (Paleogene). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para> I utilize the biostratigraphic ages to analyze seven events representing pulses in turbiditic activity throughout the Miocene. Once the events were outlined, I compared each one to proposed tectonic and climatic events outlined in current published research in order to see whether they can be supported or rejected. Three of these events indicate the influence of significant tectonic forcing displaying nearly double the average sedimentation rate. The first event occurred around 6.1-8.2 Ma in the central Himalayans and has a strong source signal from the Ganges river system. The second and third events occurred around 8.3-10.9 Ma in the Eastern Tibetan Plateau and projects a strong source signal from the Brahmaputra river system. The fourth and fifth events can be linked to a monsoon activity and occurred around 10.8-13.5 Ma. The sixth event occurred around 14.1-14.91 Ma during the Middle Miocene cooling event and may have been influenced by a long-term sea level low. The seventh event occurred around 15.80-17.95 Ma during the Early to Middle Miocene climate optimum during a long-term sea level high.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Site 1451 Holes A and B were drilled from sea floor to 1181.3 m below the sea floor with 86% recovery from Hole A and 29% recovery from hole B resulting in 628.9 m of total sediment collected. There were 245.1 meters of turbiditic sediment identified within the cores. This accounts for 38.9% of the total collected sediment. The lowermost turbidite sequence is assigned an age range of 15.80 to 17.95 Ma. Radiolarian blooms are identified in 18.2 m of sediment before any recorded turbidites. There are 5.47 m of volcanic ash layers denoting 8 identifiable volcanic events. There were also 40.85 m of plant fragment inclusions observed within the cores. These plant fragment inclusions were deposited between 0.29-1.26 Ma and 8.68+ Ma, leaving a gap in plant-fragment inclusions from 1.26-8.68 Ma. The commencement of significant plant fragment deposition correlates with the onset of the monsoons and activity of crustal thickening around 15-18 million years ago. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In order to get a better understanding of the variation in depositional characteristics, 125 post cruise samples were analyzed from Site 1450 to correlate Pleistocene and Pliocene depositional patterns to Site 1451. Site 1450 biostratigraphy highlights a more expanded Pleistocene and Pliocene sections than Site 1451 with different sedimentation rates during the Pliocene/Pleistocene interval. This analysis highlights the variation in depositional characteristics from the two locations across the Bengal Fan head and hints to a possible reorganization of depositional patterns from source river systems around 5 Ma.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This research has increased the resolution of proposed tectonic and climatic forcing events during the evolution of the Himalayan and Tibetan Plateau. Tectonic uplift in the central Himalayas initiated around 7.42+ Ma, and around 9.69-10.97 Ma in the Tibetan Plateau. Climatic forcing occurred around 14.91 to 15.8 Ma, altering sedimentation patterns in the Indian Ocean.  Onset of turbidite deposition at site 1451 around 15.8 to 17.95 Ma confirms Early Miocene evolution of the Himalayas.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Two main challenges in computational biology are identify differential expressed genes from gene expression data and find out biological variable interactions from genomics data. This dissertation presents two studies in each of them. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>   In the first study, we developed super-delta2, a differential gene expression analysis pipeline for multi-group comparisons of RNA-seq data. It includes a trimming procedure with bias-correction, a customized one-way ANOVA F-test and a post-hoc test for pairwise group comparisons. We compared super-delta2 with three commonly used RNA-seq data analysis methods: limma/voom, edgeR, and DESeq2 in both simulation studies and a large set of breast cancer gene expression data obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Results show that super-delta2 not only achieved a competitive statistical power, but also was the only method that controlled type I error at the nominal level.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>   In the second study, we searched interactions between biological variables using Bayesian network (BN) inferred from a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) based three-stage approach, Growth-based Approach with Stage Pruning (GRASP). A double filtering strategy was first used for discovering the overall skeleton of the target BN. To search the optimal network structures, an adaptive SMC (adSMC) algorithm was applied to increase the diversity of sampled networks which were further improved by a new stage to reclaim edges missed in the skeleton discovery step. BN structure learning using multiple types of genomics data illustrates GRASP’s potential in discovering novel biological relationships in integrative genomic studies.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Adiponectin is a protein hormone most commonly produced by adipose tissue that has been found to play an important role in regulating vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) phenotype. In this dissertation we hypothesize that adiponectin regulates VSMC phenotypic switch through AMPK- and ECM-dependent pathways to reduce atherosclerosis. We investigated this claim by studying the role of adiponectin in the phenotypic switch of VSMCs (Aim 1), determining the role of TGF-β and the ECM in the phenotypic switch regulated by adiponectin (Aim 2), and by elucidating the role of adiponectin in atherosclerosis in vivo (Aim 3). We have determined that lack of adiponectin, commonly seen in obese and patients with cardiovascular disease or metabolic syndrome, induces the synthetic phenotype of vascular smooth muscle cells in Akt, MAPK, and TGF-β-dependent pathways. Importantly we have also shown that this information coming from in vitro studies is comparable to in vivo studies utilizing a double knockout of ApoE and adiponectin. We also show for that there are gender specific differences in response to a lack of adiponectin where females experience far more detrimental effects with the loss of adiponectin when introduced to a high fat diet.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Virtual reality (VR) has been considered as a promising platform for teacher education or teacher training. While the current literature has reported the benefits of VR, researchers suggest that scaffolding should be provided to make learning in VR more effective. However, the effect of scaffolding in VR-based learning environments remains an area to be investigated.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The current study reviewed scaffolding literature and identified two types of scaffolding approaches, prompts and sentence openers, and examined their effect in supporting Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTAs) in STEM disciplines in learning questioning strategies during simulation-based teacher training tasks in a VR-based learning environment. This study also investigated how the scaffolded training experience varied in enhancing the teacher self-efficacy for GTAs who received different types of scaffolds. Additionally, this study examined the GTAs perceptions of the type of scaffolds they received, intending to take initial exploration of scaffolding design for VR-based learning.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A two-group, pre- and posttest experimental research design was used in this study. A total of 39 participants were recruited from STEM departments of a land-grant public university in the United States. The participants were randomly assigned to either the prompt scaffolding condition or the sentence opener scaffolding condition. Of the 39 recruited participants, three participants did not complete the whole research procedures. Therefore, the data analyzed and reported in the current study were collected from 36 participants. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The results of the statistical analyses revealed that the GTAs who received prompt scaffolds earned significantly higher scores in the posttest of the scenario-based knowledge test of using questioning strategies, comparing to those who received sentence opener scaffolds. The results also suggested that prompts were more effective in enhancing the GTAs’ self-efficacy in teaching among the GTAs who had comparatively low efficacy than others before the training. However, for the GTAs who had high efficacy scores before the training, there was no significant difference in their self-efficacy after the training between the two scaffolding conditions. Lastly, the study explored the GTAs’ perception of the scaffold they received during the simulation-based training tasks. The results showed the GTAs in both scaffolding conditions had fairly positive perceptions of the scaffolds, and there was no difference between the two scaffolding conditions.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In DanceSport, dancers interpret transnational physical and cultural aesthetics through their choreographic performances based on the diversified origins of the ten dance styles. Given the increasing prevalence of DanceSport in China, it has generated the moral controversy between the couple dance and Chinese traditional culture and has presented contextually-specific configuration. The interaction between DanceSport and Chinese culture allows Chinese female DanceSport dancers to express their own performative identities which meanwhile reshapes the meaning and values of Chinese society. In this study, I attempt to explore the way in which female dancers, through performances, conform to and/or confront mainstreamed feminine identity in Chinese society. With the application of Foucauldian Discourse Analysis, I analyzed the videos of 19 DanceSport performances in two Chinese national competitions to investigate how female dancers choreograph their performances and how their gendered identities are represented through these choreographies evoking broader interplay with social culture.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Through five aspects—themes, costumes, stage props, art forms, and role-settings, I demonstrate how Chinese female DanceSport dancers represented their features in choreographies. The choice of themes in the 19 performances broke the intrinsic frame of DanceSport and was closely connected to the social culture. In regard to the costumes, the Chinese dancers followed DanceSport conventions, but they simultaneously combined them with the symbols of Chinese culture. In terms of the application of stage props, dancers took cultural context into consideration and selected typical objects to effectively identify a character, symbolize a certain custom or establish a specific backdrop. At the same time, 15 out of 19 performances combined multiple dance styles together breaking out of stereotyped images of each dance. However, most of the dance techniques performed by the 19 dance pieces were still confined in the frame of DanceSport conventions. The most distinct feature of these dance pieces are the characterized roles which convey dancers’ ideas and understanding of social values and norms. Throughout the analysis of these dance elements, on the one hand, female dancers are normalized by Chinese aesthetic culture including uniform rules, movement vocabularies, dance styles and dance techniques. On the other hand, these dancers interpret new gender roles through their choreographies, diversifying gender representations and moving DanceSport routines beyond the constricting gender norms of traditional DanceSport. Rather than foregrounding feminine images in DanceSport, Chinese dancers stretched the bounds of gendered restrictions via the interaction between DanceSport and Chinese society.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation centers on the stories and perspectives of young refugees from Syria and Afghanistan enrolled in Sweden’s municipal music-and-arts school, or kulturskola, programs. Kulturskolor are voluntary music and arts programs regulated by Sweden’s local municipalities. These music-and-arts schools were established in the 1930s and 1940s, corresponding with the rise of Sweden’s welfare state system. There are schools in nearly every one of Sweden’s 290  municipalities, each serving to provide opportunities for its enrolled children to meet and exchange ideas and cultural experiences through music and related arts activities.Working under the premise that children are agents of their own musicultural identities, this study aims to reveal not only how musical institutions such as the kulturskola create and challenge discourses and practices surrounding integration, diversity, and social inclusion, but also how children—the very people whom these programs are meant to serve—understand and confront these issues through music and the arts. One of Sweden’s more progressive kulturskolor, the Simrishamn Kulturskola, serves as both my central case study for exploring these phenomena and as the basis for developing a broader theoretical conception of how music-and-arts institutions contribute to larger processes of cultural friction, transfer, and exchange in diversifying societies. 
Drawing upon twelve months of ethnographic research at the kulturskola in Simrishamn, Sweden, I investigate how these historically democratic institutions feed into young people’s postmigration experiences and interactions through the following themes: 1) language learning, 2) relationship building, 2) care and hospitality, 3) learning about other people and customs, 4) self-definition and borderwork, and 5) social mobility. These themes emerge through analysis of several ethnographic narratives contained within this study and speak to some of the many ways that the young people define and negotiate “how [they] want to live together in societies characterized by increasing heterogeneity” through their participation in the kulturskola (Foroutan 2016, 248). 
At the end of the day, this dissertation seeks to find a practical solution for creating more inclusive music learning environments based on the lived experiences of young refugees and former refugees participating in Simrishamn’s kulturskola programs. Discussion therefore includes, but is not limited to, the following issues: how children see their own participation in the school, how they encounter diverse musical repertoires, and how they musically navigate new social and cultural networks. The results of this research show that while the young people in this study have found their experiences at the kulturskola meaningful, there are also moments of tension surrounding musical content and approach. These moments, however, have led to further transformations in the program’s inclusion efforts and thus offer a compassionate model for other individuals and institutions whose goals include reaching refugee children and young people through music and the arts.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>During the past two decades, the United States has witnessed a constant growth in academic research about group piano at the collegiate level of education. This topic has been the focus of attention in piano pedagogy journals and conferences. However, there are few studies related to piano classes in the secondary public school educational system. This trend raises questions regarding the status of these courses at this specific level of education.	The purpose of the present study was to investigate the status of group piano instruction in public secondary schools in the state of Florida. To accomplish this goal, the researcher collected data from instructors across the state of Florida who taught group piano courses at public middle and high schools. The questionnaire developed by the researcher served as the survey instrument for this investigation. The researcher used the data collected to analyze the instructional settings of piano classes, investigate the resources and materials that group piano teachers used, examine teachers’ preparation and training on piano and group teaching, and describe the equipment utilized by teachers. The participants’ perspectives shed light on the status of class piano courses in Florida’s secondary public schools.
	The researcher sent a total of 980 emails to music teachers of secondary public schools across the state. Although 120 music teachers responded to the questionnaire, only 87 met the criteria of teaching class piano courses in secondary public schools. Therefore, the number of participants for the present study was 87.
	Results from the questionnaire indicated that most of the teachers (97.7%) possessed a Florida teaching certification in music. However, only 28.7% of the teachers stated that keyboard/class piano courses were their primary teaching assignment. A minority of the teachers (36.8%) mentioned they had special training for teaching class piano, which included being a former class piano student while in college, taking private piano lessons while in college or from K-12, participating in piano workshops, and/or during the in-service experiences.
	Data from the questionnaire revealed that the number of middle and high school students who were enrolled in class piano varied. The enrollment of middle school students was between 10 and 160 per semester, while the enrollment of high school students was between 6 and 350. It is important to recall that these numbers may reflect the issues brought by the global pandemic teachers faced, especially during the academic year of 2020-2021. Additionally, teachers were asked about the importance of certain music skills during class piano instruction. All teachers stated that music reading was very important. Moreover, middle school teachers mentioned that memorization and ear training were important skills to be taught during class piano while high school teachers recognized chordal accompanying and ear training as important skills.
	Most of the teachers who participated in this study (88.5%) mentioned they used a basic method book for their class piano instruction. A variety of series was pointed, including books for children, for teenagers, and even music books for adults. Most of the books cited were designed for individual instruction; however, some teachers also expressed utilizing books that were developed purposefully for group instruction.
	The questionnaire also exposed diverse issues about class piano instruction that were perceived by the participating teachers. They mentioned that because of their inability to place students in different classes due to students’ schedule constraints, classes ended up including students with a wide variety of playing abilities (e.g., students who have never played the piano alongside with students who took private piano instruction for years). This issue might have made teachers prioritize an individual instructional setting over a collective one, shadowing their views on the advantages of group instruction during class piano.
	According to the results from the research questionnaire, the researcher recommends that teachers who instruct class piano courses in the state of Florida, in addition to music students who are to fulfill these positions in the future, enhance their professional development on the subject of piano teaching. This can be achieved by attending piano pedagogy courses that universities and colleges of music offer in their curriculum. Moreover, these educators could benefit from attending music conferences and being involved in professional music organizations that focus on piano pedagogy.

            <DISS_para>Type II supernovae (SNe II) are excellent tools for studying stellar evolution, mass loss, cosmology, and to probe possible explosion mechanisms. By examining the spectroscopic diversity of SNe II, this thesis aims to improve the understanding of SNe II classifications and their physical and progenitor properties. In this thesis, methods for characterizing the spectroscopic features of SNe II are updated and formalized. SNe II are well studied in the optical and have been found to be a diverse group. However, near-infrared (NIR) spectra of SNe II are rare. This thesis includes the largest NIR spectra data set of SNe II published to date. These NIR spectra are quantitatively measured and it is shown that there is a dichotomy in the NIR spectral properties of SNe II. This dichotomy is in contradiction with findings in the optical that suggest SNe II form a continuous group. Using principal component analysis (PCA), the NIR spectra are reduced from a multidimensional data set to a few components which describe the majority of the variations. With this tool, it is shown that the dichotomy seen in the spectral measurements is also a major source of variation, 6% of the total variation. In addition, two spectroscopic templates are created for SNe II in the NIR, which can aid in future cosmological studies.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The presence, or absence, of carbon monoxide (CO) in the NIR spectra of SNe II is studied and found to have a possible correspondence with NIR subclass. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A unique SN II, SN 2013ai, with a longer than normal rise to maximum luminosity and high expansion velocities is studied. SN 2013ai is examined in the optical and NIR and found to exhibit properties between a SN II and stripped envelope supernova (SESN). This supernova could be a possible link between SNe II and SESNe.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Taconic orogenesis along the eastern Laurentian margin was a dynamic tectonic event during the Ordovician that has been difficult to reconcile until as of late. The record of the Taconic orogeny is complex, and each section of the Appalachians has different geologic attributes that are unique to that specific section. In the northern and central Appalachians, the record of Taconic orogenesis is well preserved and understood, but in the southern Appalachians there are discrepancies in subduction style that suggest a different manor of tectonic evolution occurred. The probable model for the southern Appalachians suggests a B-type subduction system, where the Dadeville complex represents a marginal volcanic arc, due to a subduction polarity reversal north of the Virginia promontory, relative to the northern Appalachians during the Taconic orogeny, causing Laurentian continental lithosphere to override subducting Iapetan oceanic lithosphere. This model depicts the fringing Dadeville complex arc and associated Wedowee-Emuckfaw-Dahlonega back-arc basin originating on distended Laurentian crust, fueled by extensional rather than convergent tectonics.The Dadeville complex is a large klippe located in the Alabama and Georgia Inner Piedmont of the southern Appalachian orogen lying immediately above rocks of the eastern Blue Ridge, Brevard Zone, and Opelika Group in the core of the Tallassee/Newnan-Tucker synform. The Dadeville complex consists of an array of metaigneous, metaplutonic, and metasedimentary rocks including the Ropes Creek Amphibolite, a bimodal metabasalt/metatuff, metadacite at the base, overlain by the Agricola Schist, a metaturbidite consisting of metapelite, metagreywacke, and minor metabasalt. The Chattasofka Creek Gneiss (granite) is intrusive into the Agricola Schist, Ropes Creek Amphibolite, and a mafic-ultramafic suite.  The Camp Hill Gneiss (tonalite) is intrusive into the Ropes Creek Amphibolite. Also intrusive into the Agricola Schist is a mafic-ultramafic suite consisting of the Doss Mountain and Slaughters Gabbro units. There are a multitude of mafic-ultramafic suites and felsic plutonic rocks in the Dadeville complex that span from Camp Hill, Alabama to southeast Atlanta, Georgia that have been identified over the course of this research. Distinctive major and trace element geochemical signatures of the felsic intrusives, Ropes Creek Amphibolite, and various mafic-ultramafic suites all suggest formation within a volcanic arc environment.  U/Pb dating of detrital zircons in the Agricola Schist, and equivalent metasedimentary rocks, as well as igneous zircons in the Chattasofka Creek Gneiss, Camp Hill Gneiss, and Ropes Creek Amphibolite yield Middle Ordovician ages, with the Agricola Schist also containing a subordinate fraction of Grenville and Granite-Rhyolite Province ages. Additionally, the Camp Hill Gneiss, Chattasofka Creek Gneiss, and Doss Mountain and Slaughters Gabbro suites all exhibit negative initial epsilon Nd (Ndi) values indicative of a continental origin. These relationships suggest that the Dadeville Complex volcanic arc, and the associated Wedowee-Emuckfaw-Dahlonega back-arc basin, resulted from a B-type suprasubduction system where Iapetan oceanic lithosphere subducted beneath a distended Laurentian continental plate, and that there could be other Taconic arc fragments in the southern Appalachians, akin to or apart of the Dadeville complex, that have yet to be identified.

            <DISS_para>Objective: Difficulties with emotion regulation underlie emotional and behavioral problems as well as psychiatric comorbidity in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), yet very little is known about the early development of emotion dysregulation. The present study aims to measure emotional reactivity and regulation strategies during tasks eliciting joy, fear, and frustration in order to examine how toddlers with and without ASD express their emotions. Method: Nine tasks from the Laboratory Temperament Assessment Battery (Lab-TAB) were completed on 37 toddlers with and without ASD who ranged in age from 22 to 28 months. Video-recordings of these tasks were coded by undergraduate research assistants using a behavioral coding scheme tapping facial, bodily, and vocal affect and the frequency of employed emotion regulation (ER) strategies. Profile analyses were performed to examine the mean affect and total regulation strategies across each task and t-tests were conducted to assess the types of ER strategies utilized. Results: Toddlers with ASD showed significantly less positive affect and greater frustration compared to non-ASD toddlers; reactivity was comparable between the groups for fear-based tasks. Children with and without ASD used regulatory strategies in a similar pattern across tasks, with the exception that toddlers with ASD more often engaged in distraction in order to regulate their emotions compared to toddlers without ASD. Conclusion: Toddlers with ASD are characterized by high negative affect and low positive affect despite frequent and age appropriate attempts to regulate their emotions. This study provides preliminary evidence that observable indicators of emotion dysregulation are present around two years of age. Clinical implications and future research directions are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Chamber ensembles have incorporated clarinets since the instrument’s creation in the 1700s. Though there are a few examples of violin-clarinet-piano trios from those early periods, the medium was developed primarily in the 20th century. Composers of such works often refer to historical examples for material and inspiration, but The Verdehr Trio’s success in establishing the violin-clarinet-piano medium has been well documented and discussed. The Verdehr Trio - pioneers who built a 43-year career on the foundation of that history - deserve acknowledgement for their work in establishing the violin-clarinet-piano trio as a true medium, in large part by adding over 250 works to the repertoire, including some transcriptions in a large body of original works. This treatise considers what can be learned by evaluating the origins of The Verdehr Trio, with particular attention given to the creation and establishment of a new medium and its influence upon modern musicians. That consideration is drawn from an evaluation of the artistic and business-oriented aspects that led to the ensemble’s prominence.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The treatise presents a history of the Verdehr Trio, including their first collaborations with composers; an examination of how the Verdehr Trio effectively advocated for new works; and an explanation of how The Verdehr Trio’s processes might be applicable to modern musicians. Additionally, the Verdehr Trio’s impact on trends in modern music curricula, compositional practices, and performance experiences are discussed through research and original interviews with professional musicians, educators, and composers selected for their experience within the field.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Trends were revealed among interviewees, including the importance of personal relationships in performing and commissioning pursuits. Exposure to mediums, educational experiences, aesthetic preferences, and specific career goals also play important roles in the success of performing ensembles and the creation of new music. Practitioners and proponents of newer mediums also tend to be more open to experimentation due to a comparative lack of historical pressures. Trends also suggest a growing interest in chamber music performance and commissioning initiatives as career components, necessitating a growing need for study and other forms of stimulus in that area. Lastly, the research identifies The Verdehr Trio as the only acknowledged predecessor in the history of the violin-clarinet-piano medium.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>With the evolving normalcy of communication technology in society, more research is required concerning the processes and effects of social media within the context of health and interpersonal outcomes. By examining Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram simultaneously, this research aims to assess which Social Networking Site (SNS) has a stronger association on romantic relationship satisfaction through the mediating role of romantic relationship stress and conflict. Under the framework of the systemic-transactional model of dyadic coping, the study will attempt to identify how active SNS use is associated with romantic relationship stress, conflict, and satisfaction. A total of 227 participants with Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram accounts ages 18 to 39 (M = 20.77, SD = 2.08), predominantly heterosexual (92.1%) Caucasian (78.9%) women (87.2%), completed an online survey questionnaire. Analysis of two mediation models using bootstrapping methods revealed that active SNS use is not associated with romantic relationship conflict and stress and that the relationship between social media sites (i.e., Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram) and romantic relationship satisfaction is not mediated by romantic relationship stress or conflict. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed in detail.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The purpose of this collective case study was to explore the socio-cultural reproduction experiences of selected women college band conductors. A survey was administered in order to identify key influencers in the college band field. The women who were listed most often were invited to participate in an in-depth interview. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to investigate the experiences of women band conductors. Interview questions centered around experiences of mentorship, teaching, and personal life. Specifically, this study asked: (1) What are the socio-cultural reproduction experiences of selected, prominent women college band conductors? (2) How have the selected women conductors perceived cultural and social reproduction and the lack of women in the college band field? (3) Did the five selected women college band conductors become successful by conforming or resisting the masculine culture of college bands? Women are vastly underrepresented in the college band world despite their growing representation at the secondary level. Bourdieu’s Theory of Social and Cultural Reproduction was utilized as a theoretical framework to consider how the masculine cultures of bands have inexplicitly reproduced themselves. Analyzing the data consisted of several waves of inductive coding. Results indicated women college band conductors experience societal, institutional, and individual socio-cultural reproduction experiences.  Further results and implications regarding gender issues in music education are discussed within the paper.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The study of point processes and the analysis of data which involves spatial point patterns are important topics in spatial statistics with a long history and a large literature.  A relatively new sub-area within this is the statistical analysis of point processes on linear networks, that is, processes of events occurring randomly in space (or space-time) but with locations constrained to lie on a linear network.  For example, traffic accidents occur at random locations constrained to lie on a network of streets.  Other examples involve events occurring on networks of rivers or networks of neurons. In all these cases the networks are idealized as (or approximated by) a network of line segments or curves in the plane or in three-dimensional space.  The development of statistical techniques for the analysis of point processes on linear networks is still in its infancy. Many standard statistical techniques for analyzing point processes cannot be directly applied to data arising from linear networks and require suitable modification.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation contributes to the development of statistical techniques for analyzing point processes on linear networks.  We shall investigate two topics.  The first is testing the hypothesis of complete spatial randomness for point processes on linear networks. The second topic is the estimation of the intensity for such processes.  In particular, we will estimate the intensity by applying techniques for classification from machine learning.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The guqin 古琴 (or qin 琴) is an ancient seven-stringed Chinese zither and it is a quintessential exemplar of traditional Chinese cultural aesthetics and sensibilities. In the guqin tradition, wellbeing emerges from the cultivation and embodiment of core cultural values and a deliberate process of playing that unifies the body, mind, breath, and spirit. There is no Chinese equivalent of the English word “wellbeing” per se, yet key concepts such as xiu 修 (self-cultivation), qi 氣 (primordial energy), and he 和 (harmony, equilibrium) that are inherent in the guqin tradition may collectively be understood to convey a holistic sense of the intangible qualities of integrity, wholeness, longevity, and closeness to nature that “wellbeing” connotes. Thus, as I shall argue in this dissertation, the cultivation of wellbeing is at once the purpose and the outcome of guqin music and musical practice. 	</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The nationwide guqin revival in recent years has transformed the guqin from an elite, exclusive, and private art into a popular, tangible, and accessible culture that serves modern Chinese society broadly. It is undeniable that political propaganda, the Intangible Cultural Heritage program, and the market are all incentives to this revival. The key, intangible motivation, however, has much to do with the recognition that the guqin is conducive to wellbeing, which has become increasingly valued and elusive in the contemporary world of China. This dissertation explores how contemporary Chinese guqin practitioners harness capacities for wellbeing inherent in the ancient tradition of the guqin through a case study of the Longren Guqin Cultural Village located in Zhangzhou, Fujian Province. The research carried out at Longren shows that the intangible values immanent in traditional Chinese culture are still essential to modern guqin practitioners and their wellbeing. Key topics explored in this research include place, craftsmanship, musicianship, and listening in modern guqin poems.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>An ionized Very-High Velocity Cloud (VHVC, vLSR ∼ −350 km s−1 was recently discovered in multiple ion absorption lines (e.g., O i, C ii, Si ii, Si iii) in the sightline of M33 (Zheng et al. 2017). However, the VHVC’s origin is still unknown due to the lack of distance information and the poorly constrained HI content. Three possible origins are suggested by Zheng et al: (1) part of the Milky Way’s halo gas, (2) associated with a nearby HI high-velocity cloud (HVC) – so called the Wright’s Cloud (Wright 1974), or (3) M33’s extended HI northern warp. Currently available HI observations (e.g., AGES and GALFA-HI) are not sensitive enough to discount any HI leading to association with the suggested origin possibilities. We used the GBT to better constrain the VHVC’s origin by obtaining a high-sensitivity HI datacube reaching to a 5σ column density of 5.5 × 1015 cm−2 (or 1σ noise level at 3.5 mK/km s−1 ). With the GBT observation, we analyzed the diffuse HI context of the VHVC, and compared it with the nearby HI structures in both position and velocity, better constraining the origin. Using the resources provided by the Green Bank Observatory, a region of 1◦ by 2.5◦ was mapped, spanning 22◦ &lt; RA &lt; 23◦ and 28.5◦ &lt; DEC &lt; 31◦. Two previously undetected HI HVC were detected, with very similar velocities to both the VHVC and Wright’s cloud, leading the origin of the VHVC closely towards a connection between those structures.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>イオン化された超高速雲（VHVC、vLSR〜−350 km s-1）がM33の見通し線の複数のイオン吸収線（たとえば、O i、C ii、Si ii、Si iii）で最近発見されました（Zheng et al 。2017）。ただし、VHVCの起源は、距離情報の不足とHIコンテンツの制約が不十分なため、まだ不明です。3つの可能性のある起源がZhengらによって示唆されています：（1）天の川のハロガスの一部、（2）近くのHI高速雲（HVC）に関連付けられている-いわゆるライトの雲（ライト1974）、または（3）M33の拡張HI北ワープ。現在利用可能なHI観測（例：AGESおよびGALFA-HI）は十分な感度がありません。提案された起点の可能性に関連するHIを割り引くために、GBTを使用して、5.5×1015 cm-2（または1σのノイズレベルで5σカラム密度に到達する高感度HIデータキューブを取得することにより、VHVCの起点をより適切に制約3.5 mK / km s−1）。GBTの観測値を使用して、VHVCの拡散HIコンテキストを分析し、位置と速度の両方で近くのHI構造を使用して、原点をより適切に制約します。 Green Bank Observatoryが提供するリソースを使用して、22◦&lt;RA &lt;23◦および28.5◦&lt;DEC &lt;31◦の範囲で1◦×2.5◦の領域がマッピングされました。以前は検出されていなかった2つのHI HVCが検出されました。速度はVHVCとライトのクラウドの両方に非常に類似しており、VHVCの原点をこれらの構造間の接続に近づ​​けています。</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Excessive alcohol consumption in middle-aged and older individuals is a growing concern as 72% of alcohol-poisoning deaths occur in adults 35 years and older. Treating alcohol-related pathologies requires an understanding of the factors affecting alcohol toxicity and the mechanisms through which these factors modulate behavioral and cellular responses to alcohol. One of the factors potentially underlying age-related pathologies is the weakening of the circadian system with age. Circadian rhythms are internally driven cycles that rise and fall during the 24-hour day. Circadian clocks are present in almost all animals and plants on earth and coordinates rhythms in gene expression, metabolism, hormone secretion and cellular signaling. As individuals age, circadian rhythms weaken and become more susceptible to internal desynchronization. This dissertation presents research that investigates how the circadian regulation of alcohol sensitivity and toxicity changes with increased age and identifies changes in the clock that affects this sensitivity and toxicity in middle and old age. The model system used to investigate these effects is Drosophila melanogaster, a powerful genetic system with highly conserved signaling mechanisms, well-established for studies intersecting aging, circadian biology and alcohol neurobiology. My research data demonstrate that the circadian clock modulates the behavioral responses to alcohol with the greatest sensitivity observed during the night. Aging increases the sensitivity and toxicity to alcohol’s effects and dampens the circadian regulation of alcohol sensitivity and toxicity. An intact clock is necessary to buffer the toxic effects of alcohol. Entrainment of the circadian clock using the alternative temperature entrainment pathway is sufficient to reduce alcohol toxicity and facilitate induction of short-term and long-term rapid tolerance in older flies. The strength of the light-entrainment pathway is diminished in older flies. Selectively over-expressing cryptochrome (cry) in oscillatory cells is sufficient to lower alcohol mortality and facilitate the expression of short-term but not long-term tolerance in older flies suggesting the requirement of other transcriptional changes, circadian or perhaps non-circadian for the induction of long-term tolerance in older flies. Temperature entrainment of the clock substantially consolidates the rhythms in sleep-wake activity in older flies and pharmacologically inducing sleep in middle-aged and older flies lowers alcohol-related mortality. These results suggest that targeting the circadian clock may be a viable therapeutic option for mitigating alcohol pathologies in older individuals. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Because of the advent of massively parallel computing resources, which is due to the fact that today’s processors are reaching the clock speed limit, parallel computing is becoming more prevalent when computing solutions to partial differential equations. In the past, parallelization has often focused on the spatial discretization in contrast to the temporal discretization. When parallelization in space saturates, temporal discretization gives us a new direction for parallelization.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The Parareal algorithm is one promising parallel-in-time integration method which can overcome the saturation issue with spatial parallelization. The Parareal algorithm was introduced by Lions, Maday and Turinici [66] in 2001. It was initially designed to accelerate the solution of large system of ordinary differential equations via the temporal parallelization, since then Parareal algorithm has been applied to partial differential equations too. In recent studies, Parareal algorithm has gained popularity and been successfully applied to fluid dynamics, stochastic and fractional differential equations, power systems, optimal control, spectral deferred correction and waveform relaxation. Although Parareal algorithm has been applied to accelerate many problems, it hasn’t been applied to deforming boundary problems, for example, the Stefan problems.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The Stefan problem is a particular kind of boundary value problems concerning the heat distribution in a phase changing medium. A good and classic example would be the diffusion of heat in the melting of the ice, where the boundary between the phases is not fixed, but moves with time. In this dissertation, the one dimensional classical Stefan problem and the performance of the Parareal algorithm on it are studied. Different numerical methods to solve the Stefan problems, order of accuracy, and different boundary conditions are discussed. Choices of the propagators in the Parareal algorithm are studied and results are compared.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Before the study of the Stefan problems, Parareal algorithm is applied to some ordinary differential equations to demonstrate the performance of the numerical scheme. Advection equation, Burgers’ equation and heat equation, these non-deforming boundary problems, are investigated to check the performance of the Parareal algorithm when applied to partial differential equations. For the Burgers’ equation, shock generation is also considered in the Parareal algorithm.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Presented in this thesis are the results of a novel search for exotic particles produced at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The search is performed using the data collected by the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector during the Run II period (2016 - 2018) of data taking. The data corresponds to a total integrated luminosity of 117fb−1, recorded at √s = 13 TeV. The search is performed in the topology where the Higgs boson is produced in association with a Z boson. The Higgs boson may decay to two exotic long-lived scalar particles (S). Final states where the long-lived particle decays to pairs of either b-quarks, d-quarks or τ-leptons are considered. No significant excess in the data with respect to the expected number of events containing decays to long-lived particles was observed. Limits are set on the branching ratio BR(H→SS) for the final states where the long-lived particle decays to pairs of b-quarks or d-quarks. No limit is set for the final state containing decays of the long-lived particles to pairs of τ-leptons. The limits reflect the most stringent results for the decays of the scalar particles to low mass (&lt; 20 GeV) particles with lifetimes in the range 10 &lt; cτ &lt; 100 mm. The branching ratio for the Higgs boson decaying to pairs of long-lived scalar particles which decay to pairs of b-quarks is excluded to be above 15%(4%) at the 95% confidence level for scalar particle masses of 15 GeV(&gt; 40 GeV). The branching ratio for the Higgs boson decaying to pairs of long-lived scalar particles which decay to pairs of d-quarks is excluded to be above 13%(5%) at the 95% confidence level for scalar particle masses of 15 GeV(&gt; 40 GeV). Additionally, these limits reflect the most stringent limits on the branching ratio for the Higgs boson decaying to any exotic particles.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Observations indicate that massive stars ends their lives violently, but exactly how massive they need to be remains an astrophysical challenge. Stellar evolution predicts make two fundamental predictions about the fate of massive stars. One is that (single) stars with masses above 8 solar masses are likely explode as core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), and the second is that some of these stars fails to explode and form black-holes. Even though these fundamental predictions are important in stellar evolution, constraining them with observations has remained elusive. There are only a handful of progenitors with archival image before explosion. In an effort to increase the number of progenitors, an alternate technique has been used during the last decade (or so). This technique consist of characterizing the stellar populations in the vicinity of SNe and supernova remnants (SNRs). Age-dating the stellar populations around SNe has the potential to find the progenitor masses for thousands of SNe. In this dissertation, we develop a statistical framework to infer the progenitor mass distribution for CCSNe given these observations. Assuming single-stellar evolution, we find a minimum mass of 7.33^{+0.02}_{-0.16} solar masses, maximum mass &gt; 59 solar masses, and a slope of alpha=-2.96^{+0.45}_{-0.25} for ~100 SNRs with a 68% confidence interval. While these results are consistent with previous estimates, they also provide tighter constrains. For the SNR progenitor mass distribution, the slope is steeper than the standard Salpeter initial mass function (alpha=-2.35). This suggests that the SNR catalogs are biased towards the youngest SF regions or that the most massive stars are not exploding frequently. More recently, using 22 historic SNe, we found a minimum mass of 8.60^{+0.37}_{-0.41} solar masses and slope of alpha=-2.61^{+1.05}_{-1.18} while fixing the maximum mass to 34.6 solar masses. These results are closer to the canonical values and both inferred parameters are consistent within uncertainties with previous progenitor estimates using direct detections and the age-dating technique. These results further confirm that using stellar populations around SN and SNRs is a reliable way to infer progenitor masses.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The purpose of this Dissertation in Practice was to look at the patterns and trends of student enrollment, course hour load, and academic outcomes and explore student success interactions after the environmental shock of a natural disaster.  Forming the setting for this study was a regional, commuter, university campus and its largely nontraditional student body.  While the study was primarily qualitative, a sequential, mixed methods design was used to answer the two research questions.  Using descriptive statistics, the initial quantitative piece explored the different indicators and outcomes of students enrolled and established a backdrop for the more in-depth, qualitative component.  Interviews were conducted with both student and staff participants regarding post disaster interactions and a component analysis resulted in the identification of three central domains.  These domains led to the development of six major summary themes.  Findings underscore the value of communicating post disaster and being able to tell our stories, the reliance on communication technology and the importance of planning for long term disruptions, the difficulty that academic institutions face in planning for disasters, and the valuable lessons that can be learned by studying the actions of previous institutions and organizations who experienced a disaster.  Implications for universities’ disaster planning and preparation including challenges, resiliency, and adaptability will also be discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Theories of decision making often posit the existence of two separate modes of information processing known as type 1 and type 2 thinking. Type 1 thinking is characterized by autonomous information processing that does not impinge on working memory and other executive functions, while type 2 thinking is characterized by deliberate information processing that is working memory dependent. Theories of dual-processing posit that both type 1 and type 2 thinking are involved in decision making. These theories generally fall into two categories based on contrasting temporal constraints: serial models that posit the sequential engagement of type 1 and type 2 thinking and parallel models that posit the simultaneous engagement of type 1 and type 2 thinking. Distinguishing between serial and parallel theories has been particularly difficult because the majority of prior research has focused on outcome measures—what decision did participants ultimately choose? However, serial and parallel models make different predictions about how the decision process unfolds prior to the choice being made. For instance, the theories disagree about the timing of various mechanisms, such as conflict detection and conflict resolution. Thus, the paper explores the extent to which the temporal unfolding of the decision making process that occurs before a decision is made, while a decision is made, and after a decision is made can be examined via computer mouse-tracking and eye-tracking. Two experiments are reported. Experiment 1 uses a classical reasoning task where participants pick the larger ratio among choices that include false lures. Experiment 2 has participants make difficult nutritional decisions. In both experiments, mouse-tracking was used to examine the mechanisms involved in conflict detection prior to making the decision, while eye-tracking was used to examine the nature of conflict resolution post-decision. The two experiments explored the extent to which mechanisms involved in decision making could be mapped onto different dimensions of behavior. While the current studies serve only as an initial proof of concept, they may be the first step in advancing the field by illustrating how online measures can be fruitfully applied to examine the underlying processes involved in decision making.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study examines the possibility that winter storms developing off the east coast of Asia may trigger storms developing off the east coast of North American and vice versa. We focus on one point off the northeastern coast of North America and another off the northeastern coast of Asia where relative vorticity and height fluctuations are large. The starting point was identifying the 100 most prominent vorticity maxima at 500 hPa at each of these points during sixty 150-day cold seasons beginning on 1 November of each year from 1958 to 2017.  Global composites were computed across multiple pressure levels from these events, spanning 25 days before to 25 days after the time of a relative vorticity maximum. This allowed for observation of the disturbance from 1000 hPa to 1 hPa. At the time of the vorticity maxima, near both North America and Asia, the composite shows an untilted feature about 5° of latitude (560 km) in diameter extending from 1000 hPa to 100 hPa, decaying rapidly above that. Composites confirmed the existence of the wave pattern, which travels eastward across the Atlantic with maintained strength after reaching a peak off the coast of Nova Scotia (at t = 00.00). It then rapidly loses strength and gains a notable southward component to its trajectory after reaching the European coastline but still visibly treks eastward across Asia in its weakened state. Upon reaching the Pacific (at 9–10 days), it surges in relative vorticity strength again to a level of statistical significance. This strength is likewise maintained across the North Pacific, until it similarly and significantly weakens in strength and attains a southeastern trajectory upon contact with North America, only to reemerge in a week’s time to repeat the pattern once again at 19–20 days, increasing and maintaining strength along the North Atlantic. Similar results are repeated using height composites, with wave signal location, speed, and strength mirroring that of the relative vorticity composites. Case studies of individual events allow the indexing and chronicling of the events life cycle. Case studies also allowed for an analysis of height fields and relative vorticity anomalies as they evolved through the wave’s progression. This showcased features such as the development of a wave train across the Northern Pacific following the development of the east Asian vorticity maximum, and the unity of relative vorticity cores with low pressure centers during the times of maximized east coastal anomalous activity. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Energy absorption structures and devices, such as car bumpers, are designed to transform the kinetic energy into another form of energy in a controlled and predictable way. Focus of this dissertation was to enhance energy absorption of common crashworthiness structures, such as crash tubes and honeycombs by using novel geometrical patterns. Ideas were explored using combination of experiments and finite element simulations. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Firstly, the tensile properties and fatigue behavior of polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG) components manufactured by fused filament fabrication (FFF).  The objective of this study was to quantify anisotropy of PETG coupons by testing against four raster orientations—longitudinal, transversal, diagonal and crosshatched. Quasi-static tensile tests were performed on two specimen types that yielded the highest ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and modulus of elasticity for longitudinal specimens, with measured UTS of 48.04 MPa and E=1623.28 MPa. Tensile–tensile fatigue tests with a stress ratio of R = 0.1 were performed at 90, 80, 70 and 60% of nominal UTS of each specimen type. S–N curves displayed the highest fatigue life of the longitudinal specimen followed by the crosshatched specimen at 80–90% UTS stress level. Finally, a fractography analysis conducted on fatigued specimens displayed signs of plastic failure in all specimens.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Secondly, we designed three biomimetic honeycombs (BH) inspired by microstructure inspired of oak, palm, and cedar. The main objective of this study was to compare the crushing behavior and mechanical properties under in-plane compression tests. A few samples of each BH were fabricated using fused filament fabrication, a 3-D printing technique, and used for experimental and numerical investigation. Crushing behavior of BH-oak and cedar was very similar to commonly observed in hexagonal honeycombs, with predominant ‘V’ or diagonal shear band.  Numerical simulations were found to be in a good correlation with experimental results what implied high repeatability and good quality of the prints. Results showed that BH-Cedar demonstrate higher strength by about 30% than BH-Oak and BH-Palm that is associated with more vertical unit cell alignment. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Finally, the structural response and crashworthiness performance of circular thin-walled grooved tubes were investigated under axial loading. Star-like grooving patterns were introduced using CNC machining to a relatively short and thin tubes to enhance crashworthiness performance. Experimental and numerical analysis have been conducted to investigate influence of various geometrical patterns on crushing behavior and crashworthiness. It was found that several different multi-lobe diamond deformation modes can be triggered for a tube with constant D/t=59.25 ratio. Generally, an increased number of lobes and folds led to higher specific energy absorption (SEA) and crush force efficiency (CFE), up to 31% and 34.5%, respectively. Parametric studies showed that groove depth can be used to achieve desirable deformation mode that increase both SEA and CFE simultaneously. Also, it was demonstrated that 4-lobe diamond mode deformation can be triggered for a wide range of D/t tubes. For example, tube 4h3v developed a stable 4-lobe pattern exhibiting two incomplete folds for t=1.75 mm (D/t=33.38) and a stable 4-lobe pattern with three complete folds for t=0.65 mm (D/t=91.15).</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Research on the regulatory role of gut microbiota in clinically relevant behaviors has grown dramatically in recent years. The communication between the gut and the brain, often referred to as the gut-brain axis, can influence underlying neurobiology and resulting health outcomes. Through these research efforts, many have shown that the gut-brain axis is heavily intertwined with the social world across various species. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. A socially monogamous rodent species, the prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster), displays high levels of sociality, providing a unique opportunity to study gut-brain influences on behaviors and the potential underlying mechanisms. Thus, I utilized the prairie vole as an animal model to assess: 1) how manipulation of the gut microbiome via probiotic administration can alter well-studied social circuits in the brain; 2) how manipulation of the social environment alters the gut microbiome, central immune function, and neurochemical circuits, and 3) how impacts of social isolation on the brain and behavior differ between adulthood and adolescence. I found that manipulation of both gut microbes and the social environment alters the gut microbiome, neurochemical circuits in the brain, and relevant behaviors, and these changes are sex-specific in prairie voles. I also found that the prairie vole microbiome is unique from traditional rodent species, with maintained individuality. Through these experiments, I have found that the gut-immune-brain axis plays an integrative role in social and stress-related circuits and resulting behaviors in a socially monogamous rodent model. These data provide both new evidence and a starting foundation for the continued use of the prairie vole model for translational research on the gut-brain axis and the social world.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>DM Me, Mother Darling pulses with the confusion, elation, and shattering fear of 21st century parenthood. Through the eyes of Peter Pan’s Mother Darling and Doran’s own experience navigating modern motherhood, the struggles so often fought in silence come careening forward, electric as the light that defines them. Through a tangle of casinos, Lizzo, and gravel parking lots, Doran takes readers to a narcotized Neverland where the mire of grief and the desperation of joy burn with the same endless flame.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Although leisure spaces provide a degree of liberation through their relaxation of norms, women are more likely to experience behavioral and emotional burdens that limit their freedoms in these spaces. Little is known, however, about how women and men experience leisure within more socially tolerant environments. Described by Anderson (2011) as “cosmopolitan canopies,” these pluralistic spaces reinforce tolerance, civility, and camaraderie among diverse peoples, which may diminish gender inequalities, including those in leisure. Moreover, while cosmopolitan canopies are pluralistic in nature (i.e., socially, racially, and ethnically diverse), some also can be characterized by their tendency toward political progressiveness. In their quest to purposefully enact social change, highly progressive cosmopolitan canopies may, in fact, be even more effective in reducing gender and other inequalities in leisure. Building on Anderson’s work, this dissertation analyzes how leisure-based cosmopolitan canopies interact with gender inequalities to affect leisure experiences. Through ethnographic fieldwork and interviews (n=126), I investigate how Key West, Florida – both a progressive cosmopolitan canopy and leisure environment – shapes gender inequalities in leisure. While the focus is on Key West, I also collect and analyze interview data (n=60) from another leisure space in Florida – St. Augustine. The two environments share a focus on leisure (and economic reliance on tourism) but differ in their prevailing ideologies, with St. Augustine more conservatively oriented than Key West. Their comparison allows an assessment of the influence of cultural ideologies on leisure-based cosmopolitan canopies and deepens our understanding of leisure as a gendered realm.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>My findings demonstrate how Key West and St. Augustine both challenged and reinforced social inequalities in leisure through distinctive pathways. In Key West, gender inequalities were challenged through two processes – creating progressive narratives and “doing deviance.” The data indicate that the sense of collective energy, acceptance, and inclusivity found in Key West promoted progressive discourses among residents and tourists, which made individuals feel more comfortable in leisure spaces and encouraged them to become open to different groups of people. Adding to this “live-and-let-live” atmosphere, the diminished social control mechanisms on the island increased social freedoms for women and other minorities by allowing them to step outside normative boundaries and “do deviance.” Women, in particular, felt liberated in Key West by engaging in deviant acts often associated with masculine leisure traditions. To a lesser extent than Key West, St. Augustine’s cultural landscape also enhanced opportunities in leisure for women. Although its conservative climate was more restrictive, gender disparities were reduced in two ways – deflating conservative ideologies and connecting with others. St. Augustine’s leisure spaces fostered social tolerance and interaction, enhanced its culture and diversity, and increased women’s participation. However, while the canopies of St. Augustine and Key West aided in de-gendering leisure spaces, inequalities still materialized through two processes: masculinizing social space and communicating contradictory ideals. I outline the acts of incivility, along with the segregation of space occurring in both communities. Nevertheless, the liberating components of these cosmopolitan canopies overshadowed their restrictions. The canopy of Key West, in particular, offers a model for other communities aiming to reduce inequalities through progressive cultural and social practices and policies centering on leisure.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The unique physical and optical properties of inorganic nanocrystals have generated tremendous interest over the past two decades. They have been extensively studied to prepare photovoltaic devices and diagnostic tools. Luminescent quantum dots, gold nanomaterials and iron oxide nanoparticles have found promising success in a broad range of areas including light-emitting diodes, therapeutic tomography, photodynamic therapy drug delivery and magnetic resonance imaging. However, most of the as-prepared nanoparticles are stabilized by hydrophobic coordinating ligands which impede their biological applications. In this dissertation, we summarize the application of  poly(isobutylene-alt-maleic anhydride) (PIMA) polymer platform to prepare biocompatible nanomaterials as well as MRI contrast agents. In chapter 2, we designed a new set of multi-coordinating polymer ligands based on the phosphonate anchoring motif and applied them for the surface coating of luminescent quantum dots, gold nanoparticles and iron oxide nanoparticles alike. The ligand is synthesized via nucleophilic addition reaction between poly(isobutylene-alt-maleic anhydride) and amine-modified phosphonate derivatives and short polyethylene glycol hydrophilic blocks, which allows the flexibility to tune the architecture and stoichiometry of the final compound. We find that these phosphonate-based polymers exhibit strong coordinating affinity to ZnS-overcoated quantum dots (QDs), Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) as well as iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs), yielding nanocrystal dispersions that exhibit good colloidal stability for all three systems. The affinity of these ligands is also preserved when additional coordinating groups are introduced, such as imidazoles. Furthermore, the resulting polymer-coated nanocrystals are easily functionalized with reactive groups, introduced along the polymer chain during synthesis.   They are compact enough to allow implementation of resonance energy transfer coupling of luminescent QDs to proximal dyes.  Affinity between the ligands and gold nanoparticle surfaces was compared to that of thiol groups using NaCN digestion tests.
In Chapter 3, we designed a novel set of polymeric multicoordinating ligands based on the N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) anchoring molecules and applied them for stabilizing luminescent quantum dots in aqueous media. The ligand is synthesized via nucleophilic addition reaction between amine-appended imidazole/poly(ethylene glycol) compounds and poly(isobutylene-alt-maleic anhydride) (PIMA), which yields coordinating ligands with tunable number of lateral motifs. We find that these NHC-based polymers exhibit fast and robust coordinating affinity to CdSe QDs overcoated with ZnS shells. The removal of pristine coating and the generation of carbene are demonstrated by NMR techniques. 13C and HMBC NMR spectroscopy also confirm the existence of the carbene-carbon which is crucial for binding the transition-metals on QD surfaces. These QDs exhibit essentially identical absorption and emission features before and after the cap exchange, and their compact architecture is demonstrated by diffusion ordered NMR spectroscopy. Agarose gel electrophoresis measurements indicate that the polymer coating imparts the QDs good compatibility in different pH, and it prevents protein adsorption. Excellent colloidal stability of these QD samples is observed in a wide range of competitive conditions over extended period of time.
In Chapter 4, we detail the design of a set of polymeric contrast agents used for 19F magnetic resonance imaging (19F MRI). The agent is synthesized via a nucleophilic addition reaction between poly(isobutylene-alt-maleic anhydride) and amine-appended fluorinated precursors and short polyethylene glycol (PEG) coils, which permits the tunability of the stoichiometric architecture. We find that introducing PEG moieties to ~70% of the repeating units on the polymers is essential for balancing the hydrophobic feature of fluorine groups. We show that the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the contrast agents is highly dependent on the arm-length between the polymer scaffold and the magnetic responding CF3 groups. A series of lateral fluorinated chains with different lengths are installed onto the polymers, and extended transverse relaxation time (T2) is observed from the agents with long arm-lengths. Data from Diffusion-ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY) indicate that using a pegylated arm between the macromolecule and CF3 groups does not greatly increase the hydrodynamic size of the resulting contrast agents. The effectiveness of inserting the arm is also confirmed by phantom images collected from agent dispersions with different concentrations.    
In Chapter 5, we provide a summary of the versatility of PIMA platform and discuss the outlook of these multifunctional polymeric molecules.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This treatise will discuss the benefits of nutritional supplementation in building the muscles of the trumpet embouchure. It will include a research study encompassing a five-week supplementation regimen of beta-alanine combined with a control group. Beta-alanine, is a non-essential amino acid that aids in the ionization of hydrogen in the body and facilitates the creation of carnosine, a molecule that performs a crucial function in muscular pH regulation.  This experiment aims to show, through a series of musical exercises and physical tests that the nutritional supplement, beta-alanine, aids in increasing the endurance and range of trumpet players when taken daily for five weeks at the dose of 4.5 grams daily (split into three doses of 1.5 grams throughout the day). The overall intent is to express the notion that nutritional supplementation in musicians can aid in the development of muscles used in playing musical instruments and assist in decreasing the vast number of injuries that occur in the music industry, specifically in brass musicians.Along with the research of beta-alanine, this treatise will also discuss current studies with protein, branch chain amino acids (BCAAs), creatine, and other nutritional supplements to improve muscles within the body, as it relates to athletic training and how it can be applicable for musicians. Research already exists relative to beta alanine’s effect on athletic performance, namely endurance; nonetheless, to our knowledge, there is no current data related to musicians and the use of beta-alanine for the growth and development of muscle tissue within the trumpet embouchure, specifically. This paper will present research and information that may benefit all brass musicians in developing the embouchure muscles naturally, effectively, and more efficiently. This treatise will also provide valuable information and data to aid in the hopeful reduction of brass players' injuries.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Background. In recent years, the veracity of scientific findings has come under intense scrutiny in what has been called the “replication crisis” (sometimes called the “reproducibility crisis” or “crisis of confidence”). This crisis is marked by the propagation of scientific claims which were subsequently contested, found to be exaggerated, or deemed false. The causes of this crisis are many, but include poor research design, inappropriate statistical analysis, and the manipulation of study results. Though it is uncertain if social work is in the midst of a similar crisis, it is not unlikely, given parallels between the field and adjacent disciplines in crisis. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Objective. This dissertation aims to articulate these problems, as well as foundational issues in statistical theory, in order to scrutinize statistical practice in social work research. In doing so, it parallels recent work in psychology, neuroscience, medicine, ecology, and other scientific disciplines, while introducing a new program of meta-research to the social work profession. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Method. Five leading social work journals were analyzed across a five-year period (2014-2018). In all 1,906 articles were reviewed, with 310 meeting inclusion criteria. The study was divided into three complementary parts. Statistical reporting practices were coded and analyzed in Part 1 of the study (n = 310). Using reported sample sizes from these articles, a power survey was performed, in Part 2, for small, medium, and large effect sizes (n = 207). A novel statistical tool, the p-curve, was used in Part 3 to evaluate the evidential value of results from one journal (Research on Social Work Practice) and to assess for bias. Results from 39 of the 78 eligible articles were included in the analysis. Data and materials are available at: https://osf.io/45z3h/</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Results. Part 1: Notably, 86.1% of articles reviewed did not report an explicit alpha level. A power analysis was performed in only 7.1% of articles. Use of p-values was common, being reported in 96.8% of articles, but only 29% of articles reported them in exact form. 63.9% of articles reported confidence intervals; with the 95% coverage rate being the most common (reported in 31.3% of all studies). Effect sizes were explicitly reported in the results section or tables in a little more than half of articles (55.2%). Part 2: The mean statistical power for articles was 57% for small effects, 88% for medium effects, and 95% for large effects. 61% of studies did not have adequate power (.80) to detect a small effect, 19% did not have adequate power to detect a medium effect, and 7% a large effect. A robustness test yielded similar but more conservative estimates for these findings. Part 3: Both the primary p-curve and robustness test yielded right-skewed curves, indicating evidential value for the included set of results, and no evidence of bias.    </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Conclusion. Overall, these findings provide a snapshot of the status of contemporary social work research. The results are preliminary but indicate areas where statistical design and reporting can be improved in published research. The results of the power survey suggest that the field has increased mean statistical power compared to prior decades; though these findings are tentative and have numerous limitations. The results of the p-curve demonstrate its potential as a tool for investigating bias within published research; while suggesting that the results included from Research on Social Work Practice have evidential value. In all this study provides a first step towards a broader and more comprehensive assessment of the field.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Academic advising has been a recognized field of work for well over 50 years.  Yet, debates continue about its status as a profession.  To date, administrator perceptions of the role (purposes, outcomes, and functions) of academic advising have not been extensively studied.  This dissertation reflected a study of administrators within the Florida College System with the purpose of understanding how administrator views of the role of academic advising relate to what is espoused in publications from NACADA: The Global Community for Academic Advising.  Additionally, this dissertation explored how institutional characteristics relate to the administrators’ views.  Findings indicated that administrators’ top purposes, outcomes, and functions of academic advising were related to generating positive academic outcomes, namely retention and completion. Some institutional characteristics were related to subtle differences regarding administrators’ views of the role of academic advising.  More sophisticated and professionalized aspects of the role of the academic advisor were not as highly prioritized.  This indicates a disparity between what NACADA communicates to be the role of the advisor and the beliefs of administrators.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Chemical processes within flows are ubiquitous. There exists an important class of reactions that result in a phase change from liquid to solid: precipitation reactions. Inspired by recent microfluidic experiments, this dissertation develops a unified mathematical framework for handling such reactions occurring within a slow-moving fluid flow. A key challenge for precipitate reactions is that, in general, the location of the developed solid is unknown \emph{a priori}. To model this situation, we use a multiphase framework with fluid and solid phases; the aqueous chemicals exist as scalar fields that react within the fluid to induce phase change. We conduct several analytic and numerical validation studies to verify that the model exhibits desired fluid–structure behaviors without requiring interface boundary conditions. To demonstrate the functionality of this framework, we conduct full-scale simulations of two scientific applications: a microfluidic reaction experiment as well as a geophysical study of sinkhole formation. The results of this dissertation are (1) a rigorous derivation of a model framework that conserves mass and incorporates fluid-structure interaction, and (2) numerical methods for solving the full PDE system, which have been implemented in open-source software. The framework can be applied to precipitate reactions where the precipitate greatly affects the surrounding flow, a situation appearing in many laboratory and geophysical contexts including the hydrothermal vent theory for the origin of life. More generally, this model can be used to address low Reynolds number fluid–structure interaction problems that feature the dynamic generation of structures.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>High rates of sexual victimization occur on colleges campus and continue to be a significant issue, despite efforts to prevent assault. Although risk factors of victimization have been identified and extensively studied, many college students are still victimized and do not seek help (Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 2000, 2006).  College campuses have an abundance of resources; however, they are underutilized. Since preventative measures have not fully stopped these incidences from occurring, intervention and identification of these students is necessary.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The primary goal of this study was to investigate the relation between personality traits, coping styles, and disclosure among sexually victimized college students.  College students are of specific interest due to the high prevalence rates of sexual victimization that occur on college campuses (Koss, Gidycz &amp; Wisniewski, 1985).  There are an abundance of resources on college campuses that are free of cost to students; however, they are often underutilized in times of need (Sabina &amp; Ho, 2014). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The results of the present study revealed  the link between personality, coping and disclosure.  A total of 117 participants were used in data analysis. Participants ranged from 18-28 and all currently enrolled in college. All participants also endorsed one or more items on the Sexual Experiences Survey (Koss et al., 2006)… Participants also completed additional measures of  personality (Big Five Inventory, John &amp; Srivastava, 1990), coping (Coping Strategies Inventory (CSI), Tobin, 1984, 2001), and disclosure (CSA Study Reporting form, Krebs et al., 2007). A series of regressions were used to analyze the dataset.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Tiller and Cross observed that legal researchers “have extensively dealt with doctrine as a normative matter but have given little attention to the manner in which it actually functions,” while social scientists “who have done important descriptive work about how courts actually function, have largely ignored the significance of legal doctrine.”  This dissertation aims to fill that void.  A focus on a “small, well-defined” network—rather than indiscriminate networks with large samples—can allow for the exploration of “features of network structure unobtainable in representative samples.”  Applying this observation within the legal context, a focus on a “small, well-defined” network of case law can allow the researcher to give the legal doctrine created by each case its proper contextual due alongside quantitative measures of network influence.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation applies a pointed methodological approach to legal citation network analysis within the specific context of sports law, where empirical approaches to studying legal citations are largely lacking.  The unique treatment of the sports industry by the courts often creates discrete citation networks with “a common substantive focus and an unmistakably clear boundary” as the sport-specific exemptions that are created are very often not applicable outside of the specific and limited context of sports.  Sports antitrust law is a field of law that is particularly suitable for a study of discrete networks, as the differing nature of ‘competition’ in sports relative to more traditional industries often leads to judicially-crafted exemptions that are rarely—if ever—extended outside of the specific context of sports.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>By applying a two-level mixed methods approach to citation network analysis, this dissertation analyzes the precedential effect of two Supreme Court sports antitrust law cases—Federal Baseball v. National League and NCAA v. Board of Regents—through the creation and analysis of two separate egocentric citation networks through a methodological scheme that includes both quantitative and qualitative analysis.  This methodological approach includes two levels of inquiry: first, a quantitative citation network analysis study that looks to measure the relative ‘importance’ or ‘centrality’ of certain cases within a discrete citation network; and second, the infusion of qualitative legal doctrinal data into the network graphs to probe the context surrounding individual network connections through a doctrinal analysis of the judicial language and context surrounding each citation.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This methods conducted for completion of this dissertation were undertaken to answer two research questions.  By the use of centrality metrics, the first research question contains an examination of what cases have been the most influential within the discrete case networks of the baseball antitrust exemption and judicial overview of NCAA amateurism regulations.  For the second question, this dissertation examined the contextual similarities and differences in how judges have cited important case precedent within the baseball antitrust and NCAA amateurism regulatory case networks and discover whether those similarities and differences have led to an evolution in the application of case precedent.  Through this two-tiered analysis, this dissertation “offers a case study in precedential expansion” on the unique and highly instrumental antitrust exemptions that have shaped professional baseball and intercollegiate sports.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Appalachian orogen is separated from west to east and into the Cumberland Plateau, Valley and Ridge, Blue Ridge, Inner Piedmont, and Carolina Superterrane physiographic provinces. Within the southern Appalachians of Alabama and Georgia, the Inner Piedmont is composed of two Ordovician-aged volcanic arc and back-arc sequences that were later deformed, emplaced, and altered during the late Paleozoic Acadian and Alleghanian orogenies. These sequences appear within the Inner Piedmont as the Dadeville Complex (volcanic arc) and Opelika Group (back-arc). The Dadeville Complex is an allochthonous klippe which has been thrust atop its companion back-arc basin and is now fault-bounded to the southeast and northwest by the Stonewall Line and Katy Creek faults respectively. The local geologic structures within and between these two units, as well as characteristics of a large felsic intrusive complex within the Opelika Group, were studied in detail via field mapping, geochemistry, and petrography within and around the Mountville 7.5’ quadrangle in Troup County, Georgia. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The Stonewall Line, as observed in the Mountville quadrangle, does not support the theory proposed by other authors that involves the termination of the Stonewall Line into the Towaliga Fault south of the field area; it also does not follow the trend shown in the frequently cited map of Bentley and Neathery (1970). The observations made do support the idea that both the Dadeville Complex and Opelika Group continue northeast towards Atlanta, although the Stonewall Line appears to follow a path more easterly than previously thought The preliminary major and trace element geochemistry of a suite of granitic intrusions, referred to as the Odessadale Granite Gneiss, within the uppermost Opelika Group east of the mapping area support a correlation with similar granitic intrusions in the Inner Piedmont and eastern Blue Ridge; specifically the Farmville Metagranite and Lithonia Gneiss of the Inner Piedmont, and the Zana and Kowaliga Gneisses of the eastern Blue Ridge. Two granitoid bodies were also found that have intrusive relationships with the Odessadale, the redefined Gay Granite Gneiss, a low K2O/Na2O, peraluminous, seemingly I-type tonalite-trondhjemite, and one exposure of the herein named Big Springs Granodiorite, a low silica (63% SiO2), metaluminous, I-type tonalite-granodiorite with abundant biotite, hornblende, and minor pyroxene. Further geochemical investigation of the Odessadale Granite Gneiss, as well as the Gay Granite Gneiss and Big Springs Granodiorite, could reveal critical information related to the magmatic history and tectonic processes involved within the Wedowee-Emuckfaw-Dahlonega back-arc basin.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The Mahler measure of a polynomial with integer coefficients is the product of the moduli of all of the all roots outside the unit circle and the absolute value of its leading coefficient. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This smallest value is known to depend on the discriminant of the field by work of Silverman, Ruppert, and Vaaler-Widmer. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This thesis studies the minimal integral Mahler measure of primitive elements of cubic number fields.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We show that for Galois, non-Galois totally real, and non-Galois not totally real cubic fields there is an integral primitive element in each category that realizes the lower bound proven by Silverman, in terms of the exponent of the discriminant. Further, we produce an algorithm that determines this minimum value for any cubic field.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation is composed into two primary portions defined by the material types investigated. The first part is concerned with the magneto- and thermo-optical properties of trivalent lanthanide-doped metal-oxides using europium as a probe of the photophysical mechanisms in play. These works offer important insight to observed properties  that  have  not  previously  been understood and will allow for more directed studies for the use of such materials in commercial applications. The second part is concerned  with  the  synthesis  and  magnetic  properties  of  novel  hetermetallic perovskite-like metal-organic frameworks, providing a route to tune the multiferroic behavior through variations in the composition of the two metals involved.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the first part of this dissertation the magneto- and thermo-optical properties of known nanospinels (AB2X4), zinc aluminate and zinc gallate, and analogous β-gallium oxide nanoparticles doped with trivalent europium are studied using optical spectroscopy methodologies under applied high magnetic field and extreme temperature conditions. Lanthanide photophysics have been studied in depth for many decades due to their narrow line-like absorption and emission lines, despite being parity forbidden transitions. Lanthanides differ considerably from transition metal emitters in that the characteristics which lift the degeneracy in energy states are very different, resulting in many differences in the photophysical properties of materials containing those atoms. Lanthanides, however, differ from other common emitters in other ways, particularly in their relative quantum efficiencies and quantum yields. Due to the aforementioned parity forbidden nature of trivalent lanthanide excitation the quantum yields are very low due to poor absorption, despite very high quantum efficiencies. Research into materials containing lanthanides has continued to increase recently as methods of circumventing the poor absorption have increased quantum yields significantly and paved the way for commercial applications in solid-state lighting.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the last twelve years there has been additional interest in understanding the effects of temperature and applied magnetic field on lanthanide containing materials. Theoretical predictions have been made to explain observations made at moderately low temperatures (∼77 K) but experimental confirmation through a wide range of host materials and methods is limited. Studies of various metal-oxide hosts ranging from the nano- to bulk size regimes have been undertaken under applied high magnetic field using pulsed magnet systems. These studies have made a range of observations, including significant emission quenching, hysteresis-like behavior in emission recovery, and small shifts and changes in Stark splitting patterns as a function of applied magnetic field. There has been very little proposed to explain the mechanism that leads to emission quenching and hysteresis-like behavior (bistability), but the minute changes in Stark patterns and peak positions has been proposed to be the result of Zeeman splitting effects and changes in the local symmetry of the lanthanide ion. Lanthanides have also made an increased appearance in magnetic applica- tions as single-molecule magnets, most notably europium oxide, due to the unique behaviors of lanthanides under an applied magnetic field. This has widened the field of potential applications to include quantum computing and other spinelectronic applications.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this work a series of analogous metal-oxide nanoparticles are doped with trivalent europium and probed using optical spectroscopy at extreme temperatures as low as 4.2 K and, for the first time, in a persistent field magnet at high applied field. Using established theory the Zeeman splitting effects will be calculated to predict any relative shifts in Stark peak positions. Additionally, accepted theory will be used to verify that changes in Stark splitting patterns are likely due to Zee- man splitting alone, and not changes in local symmetry, as this splitting can lead to the separation of energy levels such that J-level mixing is reduced in at least one level and a secondary emission line exists. A simple mechanism is also proposed that functionally explains the emission quenching and bistabilities observed in recovery that is supported by thermo-optical data and a previously proposed model for temperature behavior in lanthanides based on Mott-Seitz theory. By using analogous hosts as controls it has been determined that the observed properties are due, not just to the field effects on lanthanide ions, but a combination of lanthanide properties and those of the host material. In fact, while the extremely limited tuning potential of lanthanide energy states are extremely important in facilitating the observed behaviors, their nature prohibits them from being useful in tuning them. Thus it has been concluded that the ability to manipulate these properties is primarily dependent on changes to the composition and structure of the host.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the second part of this dissertation a range of metal-metal ratios in a hetermetallic perovskite-like metal-organic framework is synthesized and probed to study the relationships between metal composition and magnetic properties. Since multiferroic behavior was first reported in metal-organic framework materials the field has grown considerably,  with the past ten years seeing  an explosion of studies to better understand the nature of these materials and the various ways these properties can be manipulated. This field has predominantly focused on homometallic ABX3 perovskite-like metal-organic frameworks and the tuning of these materials through structural manipulation via substitutions of the three ions (A, B and X). More recent studies have focused on tuning through changes in particle size and limited studies on heterometallic structures, typically with 50/50 metal ratios, on a handful of transition metal combinations. The investigation of the effects of particle size have also led to new synthetic routes, including microwave-assisted synthesis, which provide size control, substantially reduce the time of synthesis, and increase energy efficiency while lowering the environmental impact.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This work relies on traditional solvothermal synthesis methods to investigate a range of metal-metal ratios in dimethylammonium nickelx manganese1-x formate metal-organic framework materials and their relative magnetic and electrical properties. Several relationships between these properties and the metal composition have been identified in addition to crystal growth size. It is  also reported that the combination of metals, in which one is known to be multiferroic and the other is not, can and, in this case, will result in a hybrid material that maintains the desired multiferroic behavior.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation seeks to broadly increase the understanding of various magnetic and electronic properties and relationships to structure in materials with significant promise in important fields   and allow for more efficiently directed research in technical applications.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter 1 provides a thorough background and introduction to the theories and ideas used throughout this dissertation. In the first half an introduction to conventional lanthanide pho- tophysics provides an understanding of the unique nature of lanthanides relative to organic and transition metal emitters that in part leads to the difficulties of understanding the magnetic and thermal properties. A brief introduction is also provided to provide context for the analogous hosts used in this work which have allowed preliminary examination of the effects of manipulating various sites in the lattice. The second half of chapter 1 describes metal-organic frameworks and introduces the concept of multiferroics and provides an understanding of the significance of such materials.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter 2 provides introductions to the various methodologies used throughout this dissertation to probe the properties of various methods.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapters 3 and 4 describe the synthetic methods and primary experimental results and discus- sion obtained through the study of trivalent europium doped at 5% in zinc aluminate, zinc gallate, and β-gallium oxide nanoparticles under applied high magnetic field and extreme temperature conditions respectively.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapters 5 and 6 are concerned with the synthetic methods and structural, magnetic, and dielectric properties of dimethylammonium nickelx manganese1-x formate metal-organic framework single crystals and the relationships that relate many of these properties.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter 7 provides a summary of the most significant results of the prior chapters and a direction for future work to better understand and further validate the ideas proposed by this dissertation.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Coral reef ecosystems provide essential goods and services to civilizations around theworld but are threatened by local and global anthropogenic disturbances. As we enter the United
Nation’s Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development and the United Nation’s Decade
on Ecosystem Restoration, we must critically evaluate current conservation efforts and expand
our toolsets to effectively meet conservation aims. Present knowledge suggests coral reef
functionality remains largely contingent upon sustaining corals, the ecosystem engineers. This
dissertation examines coral settlement, coral recruitment, and broad reef dynamics through
reverse engineering coral (i.e., deconstructing and examining components to duplicate them and
further understand processes involved in their development). Reverse engineering techniques
presented mechanisms to replicate coral structures (Chapter 2) and isolate influences of habitat
structure from those of living coral tissue to evaluate reef processes in three separate
experiments: a structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry assessment of coral structures
(Chapter 3), a field-based study testing effects of structure on coral recruitment and benthic
communities (Chapter 4), and a laboratory-based experiment to examine chemical and structural
drivers of coral settlement (Chapter 5).
Methods were developed for generating digitized reconstructions of coral skeletons using
laser scanning and computer-aided-design software. The resultant digitized coral models were
used to replicate and control for structures in the laboratory and field-based experiments. The
digitized 3-D models were also valuable assets, used to promote marine conservation through
educational and outreach.
Acropora palmata colonies were reconstructed using SfM photogrammetric modeling, to
assess whether living and dead coral structures maintain the same structural characteristics.
Structural quantifications revealed living and dead A. palmata have significantly different fractal
dimensions and profile curvatures. These results indicated dead A. palmata structures were more
structurally complex and heterogeneous than living A. palmata structures.
During a field-based experiment, custom-designed artificial substrates with three
structural treatments (i.e., substrate tiles without any added 3-D structures, substrate tiles with a small 3-D coral replicate attached, and substrate tiles with a large 3-D coral replicate attached),
were deployed off Carrie Bow Cay, Belize, to test the effect of substrate structure on coral
recruitment and benthic community composition. This experiment tested the hypotheses that
coral recruitment would increase on substrates with larger 3-D structures, and benthic
community diversity would be greatest on substrates with large 3-D coral replicates. Eleven
months post-deployment, substrates were retrieved and analyzed. More scleractinian corals
recruited onto substrates with larger 3-D structures, but recruitment varied drastically between
coral taxa. Benthic species richness differed between substrate treatments, but communities were
not significantly different based on Bray-Curtis Dissimilarity.
The laboratory-based experiment assessed Porites astreoides and Acropora palmata
settlement abundances in the presence of combined 3-D structures and a chemical treatment.
Settlement substrates were designed with a 3-D coral replicate present or absent, and each
included a chemical treatment. The chemical treatments tested in this experiment included
fractionated compounds isolated from Hydrolithon boergesenii, natural biofilms, and controls.
This experiment tested the hypothesis that coral settlement would increase on substrates
containing both a chemical and structural settlement cue. However, the presence of a 3-D coral
structure did not influence settlement abundances, therefore structural treatments were pooled
and only the effect of chemical treatments was assessed. P. astreoides settlement was greatest in
the presence a natural biofilm, than the fractionated compound or chemical controls. A. palmata
settlement was greater in the presence of fractionated compounds and biofilm than chemical
control treatments.
Research conducted throughout this dissertation addressed key questions regarding coral
structures and their effect on key reef processes. Reverse engineering coral structures expanded
our breadth of knowledge surrounding coral reefs. Although additional research is necessary to
identify effective approaches to ecosystem conservation, this dissertation and the reverse
engineering perspectives applied throughout, present valuable findings and fruitful avenues for
further research.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Multi-strange baryons have played an important role in understanding the strong interaction. Despite their importance to advancing quantum chromodynamics (QCD), little is known about such hyperons due to the lack of a strange probe. Almost all knowledge of Cascade baryons today stems from kaon-nucleon interactions in bubble chamber experiments performed in the 1960s and 1970s. The 1980s saw advancement in electronics and computational resources allowing for higher statistic experiments such as the MultiParticle Spectrometer (MPS) at Brookhaven National Laboratory. From these previous experiments,  the octet and decuplet ground states, $\Xi(1320)$ and $\Xi(1530)$ respectively, were well established with known properties and four excited states were well established. This research uses the GlueX experiment at Jefferson Laboratory to extend photoproduction cross section measurements for $\Xi(1320)^-$ to higher beam energies to further understand the production mechanism, as well as to search for the first excited Cascade resonance observation in photoproduction through the decay $\Xi^{-*}\to K^-\Lambda$. The GlueX Spectrometer is a nearly hermetic detector used to study exclusive photoproduction reactions with photon beam energies up to $12$~GeV. The first phase of GlueX running has recently been completed. Preliminary results for the total cross section and differential cross sections in terms of momentum transfer $-t$ are shown within. Additionally, the first observation of an excited Cascade baryon, in particular $\Xi(1820)^-$, is shown.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The dissertation sought to provide insight to the unique experiences of foster care alumni in graduate education pursuits. For many, higher education serves to increase opportunities in the workforce and higher lifetime earnings; as the level of degree attainment is higher, the availability of benefits often increases. Frequently, these opportunities are more readily afforded to members predisposed to access and achievement in postsecondary experiences and remain elusive for many members identifying as vulnerable. A vulnerable population of interest is foster care alumni or those individuals with dependency system experiences as a result of abuse, neglect, or trauma. Previous research indicated foster care alumni often espouse desires to attain higher education at the same proportion as their nonfoster care peers; however, the reality is few gain access and fewer attain a degree. In Florida, current policies could assist in continued support, including application toward advanced degrees, for eligible foster care alumni; however, lack of awareness and guidance can result in unused assistance. Therefore, this study seeks first to understand the experiences of foster care alumni who attempted, pursued, or attained an advanced degree. Individual interviews with a small sample were conducted and analyzed for common themes in capturing the phenomenon of graduate education pursuits by individuals with background experiences in the foster care system. Findings help to generate a base understanding of these experiences through the voice of participants, as little is known at the undergraduate level, and less at the graduate level.  </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Sharks have provided nutrition, raw materials, and symbolism to people globally both near the coast and inland. Shark remains, primarily teeth and vertebral centra, are recovered from archaeological sites around the world and often exhibit use-associated surface wear. This project seeks to establish the contextual uses of shark teeth within Florida’s precontact Indigenous communities and determine how their technological uses correlate to social and symbolic belief systems. Through standard zooarchaeological methods, optical and scanning electron microscopy, and x-ray diffraction, this study examines shark teeth for use-associated wear and residues through the lens of social zooarchaeology. The data gathered will contribute to the archaeological knowledge on coastal systems, human and animal interactions, and specifically use-wear and residues on shark teeth. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>It is well established in the second language acquisition (SLA) field that Spanish accusative clitics (i.e., direct object pronouns) are forms that pose some difficulties for L2 learners. Research in the field has found that L2 Spanish learners use a non-optimal strategy when attempting to interpret these forms, in which they assign an agent role to them instead of a patient role (First Noun Principle, VanPatten, 2007). VanPatten (2016) claims that learners must first correctly interpret clitics for their meaning and function in the sentence before syntactic operations and parameter resetting could take place. Motivated by this claim, this dissertation investigates the development sequence of L2 Spanish accusative clitic acquisition, as divided in different components relevant for this structure, namely interpretation, clitic placement, and number and gender agreement.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation examines the developmental course of accusative clitic acquisition in a cross-sectional design of three groups of L2 leaners (low, intermediate and advanced learners) on four experimental tasks, in both comprehension and production measures: a picture matching, a self-paced reading task, an elicited imitation task and a story telling task. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The results lend support to the First Noun Principle, in that learners from the low group misinterpret clitics. The results also indicate that clitic acquisition is initiated by the correct placement and number agreement of accusative clitics, followed by their appropriate interpretation, and, lastly, by gender agreement. Contrary to VanPatten’s (2016) claim, the results suggest that acquisition of form precedes form-meaning acquisition. The results are also discussed in term of the nature of each clitic acquisition component, as well as task demands. Implications for the SLA field and for input processing oriented instruction interventions are also presented in this dissertation.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Widely publicized acts of racism put African Americans at risk for vicariously experiencing the consequences of these racially motivated acts of aggression and violence. Technological advances and increased access to media outlets create an atmosphere saturated with exposure to violence against Black people at the hands of non-Blacks. From murders of unarmed Black people at the hands of police streamed on Facebook timelines, hashtags on Twitter calling for justice after months of inaction, to turning on the evening news and seeing a picture of the latest victim, these indirect encounters with racism can seem inescapable. While the negative effects of perceived racial discrimination, an interpersonal experience of racism, are well documented, the consequences of this vicarious race-based stress are understudied. Racial discrimination has almost unanimously been described as a stressor resulting in negative mental health and interpersonal outcomes for those impacted. Given the much more pervasive nature of vicarious race-based stress when compared to racial discrimination, further investigation into its function in the lives of African Americans is imperative. Therefore, the current study aimed to develop and provide preliminary psychometric information for the first known measure of vicarious race-based stress (VSRB-ER). This novel measure was then used to explore the influence of vicarious race-based stress and racial discrimination on the mental health (i.e. depression) and interpersonal functioning (i.e. relationship quality) of African American adults. A growing body of literature suggests that racial trauma may also be a consequence of encounters with racial stressors. Thus, racial trauma was explored as a mediator for these associations. Despite the significant racial stressors and trauma African Americans encounter, they consistently demonstrate the ability to be resilient. To this point, racial identity and intimate partner support were explored for protective functions. A vicarious race-based stress specific measure of intimate partner support was also created to measure the influence of support when faced with racial stressors. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were employed to determine the reliability and validity of the novel measures. Structural equation models were estimated to explore the associations between vicarious race-based stress, racial discrimination, and mental health, and interpersonal outcomes along with the mediating influence of racial trauma. Latent moderated structural equations (LMS) were employed to determine the moderating influences of racial identity and intimate partner support. Findings demonstrated adequate reliability and validity of the measure of vicarious race-based stress (VSRB-ER). Evidence of the negative consequences of both vicarious race-based stress and perceived racial discrimination on depression was found. Racial trauma was also found to mediate these relationships. No associations between vicarious race-based stress or racial discrimination and relationship quality were found. However, racial identity and intimate partner support demonstrated positive influences on mental health and relationship outcomes. Neither racial identity nor intimate partner support moderated the associations between the racial stressors and outcomes. Finally, contrary to expectations, intimate partner support was associated with increased racial trauma symptoms as more racial discrimination was experienced. Implications of the findings for clinicians were discussed. Future directions for researchers in light of the limitations and strengths of the current study were also provided.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>French American artist Niki de Saint Phalle staged an explosive entry into the art scene of the early 1960s by publicly shooting her art with a .22 caliber rifle. Her guns’ bullets broke her carefully composed assemblages, puncturing their embedded paint sachets, releasing bright pigment which streamed across the reliefs’ plaster-white surfaces. These public séances de tirs (shooting sessions) and their related gallery exhibitions structure my study, the first solely devoted to what Saint Phalle called her tirs (shots or “shooting paintings”).The tirs’ display sheds light on the conditions of their production, departing from previous studies’ isolation of the works from the complex history that unfolded around them. The tirs represent far more than paintings “made” by gunfire. They became part of a larger multimedia practice that continues to resist categorization. The significance of Saint Phalle’s tirs changes profoundly when viewed in light of firearms as tools of (de)colonization during the Algerian war and rising atomic anxieties in the Cold War-era United States.
The tirs reveal the significance of shooting as an evolving strategy that evinces important changes in Franco-American visual art and identity during an era when the paradox of decolonization alongside globalization became increasingly present in the visual arts. Seen through Saint Phalle’s shooting sessions and the gallery displays of their paint-splattered results, this dissertation demonstrates the complexities of what Michael Smith and others have termed the long-1960s, and thus reveals the power of the performative as an integral and international theme in contemporary art.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to explore how use of a web application that makes use of Spotify APIs may be utilized by music therapists to inform clinical decisions. Spotify Charts was used to identify weekly top-streamed songs on Spotify, and the web application Sort Your Music was used to examine musical attributes including tempo, energy, danceability, loudness, valence, length, acousticness, and popularity for top-streamed songs on Spotify in the United States in 2020. Multiple Pearson correlation analyses were used to examine how specific Spotify musical attributes identified by Sort Your Music compared to previous research on the relationship between specific musical attributes and perceptions of valence and arousal in music. In line with previous research, results of the present study indicated positive relationships between energy and loudness (r = .711) and tempo and energy (r = .590). However, contrary to previous research, results of this study indicated a negative relationship between tempo and valence (r = -.590). Further results and implications for the use of Sort Your Music as a resource to guide music therapy clinical decisions related to music selection are discussed within this paper.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Neolithic was a critical period in human history, when the establishment of agriculture, sedentary society, and craft specialization all took place. Despite an abundance of material from sites throughout Southeastern Europe during this period, overall little attention has been paid to elucidating connections between populations that were made across large geographic distances. This dissertation presents the results of new research concerning the Neolithic period in Southeast Europe focusing on a particular type of vessel known as the Neolithic rhyton as a mechanism through which to explore social continuity over a large geographic area. The Neolithic rhyton is an unusual – and therefore readily identifiable – shape that is broadly designated a “ritual object,” though its use is debated and as yet unknown. This vessel shape appears along the Adriatic coast, the Balkans, and into Italy during the Middle Neolithic (ca. 5500–4800 BCE), and in the Mainland of Greece during the Late Neolithic period (ca. 5300–4200 BCE). Conducted over a five-year period, this project focuses on reevaluating the fragments of Neolithic rhyta excavated at the Greek site of Ancient Corinth between 1896 and 2016, using both macroscopic techniques and pXRF analysis to help understand and establish Corinth’s social and economic connections regionally and supra-regionally during the Neolithic. The results of this project will help to clarify Neolithic trade and exchange networks on various scales: tracking similarities in style, technology, and decoration help to prove the existence of communication between populations. Investigations carried out at Corinth have so far yielded 199 fragments of rhyta. Of the 29 known sites that have produced rhyta in Mainland Greece, the largest number from another single site is at Elateia, where excavators have found 17, indicating the centrality of Corinth within this Neolithic network that includes areas of the Balkans, the Adriatic coast, and the Mediterranean. The outcomes of this research will further the discussion concerning ritual and its role within a continuity of practice in during the Neolithic period of Europe, with Corinth as its focal point. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Introduction: Inflammation has been shown to play a role in a variety of disease states including osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of daily prune consumption on inflammatory markers, bone biomarkers, cardiovascular health, and the gut microbiome in an osteopenic male population. Methods: Forty healthy men between the ages of 55 and 80, whose lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) t-score was between -1.0 and -2.5 were randomized to 0, 50, or 100g of prunes and 450 mg calcium and 800 IU vitamin D daily for three months.  Changes in fecal microbiome were assessed at baseline, one, and three months (uBiome Explorer). Additionally, measurements of body composition (via anthropometrics), lower limb (calf) blood flow (via strain-gauge plethysmography), as well as blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR) mean arterial pressure (MAP), and resting blood flow (BF), were collected at each time point. Serum and plasma samples were subjected to ELISA for the assessment of inflammatory markers including C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interluekin-6 (IL-6) and lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP). Changes in bone turnover were estimated by serum osteoprotegerin levels (OPG). Fecal microbiome was analyzed via 16S rRNA sequencing (uBiome Explorer). Results: All participants were compliant with the daily supplements. Three-month measures of CRP, TNF-α, OPG, and IL-6 were not different from baseline (p&gt;0.05). Two-way ANOVA analysis of LBP revealed a significant effect of prune consumption (p=0.045). LBP was significantly increased in the 50g group compared to both baseline (p=0.010) and to the 0g control at 3-months (p=0.014). Prune consumption produced no significant changes in BF, MAP, HR, or BP. Measures of alpha diversity at baseline and 3-months revealed that prune consumption significantly decreased diversity as measured by Chao1 (p=0.02), Shannon Diversity (p=0.008), and the number of observed operational taxonomic units (OTU) (p=0.03). There was no significant change in Pielou’s evenness (p= 0.08). Beta diversity measures revealed a significant difference between 50g and 100g groups as measured by Bray-Curtis (p=0.001), Weighted UniFrac (p=0.02), and Unweighted UniFrac (p=0.01). Conclusions: Although most measures of cardiovascular and bone health in osteopenic males were not altered by a three-month treatment with prune, there were changes in gut microbiome diversity. These findings suggest that prune consumption does shape the colonization of the gut microbiome in osteopenic men. More research must be done to determine longer term impact of these microbial changes on gut, cardiovascular, and bone health.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>It has been well researched that college student alcohol use is a public health concern and that college students as a general population are at risk for excessive alcohol use and binge drinking. Within the wide population of college students, student-athletes are at a particularly high risk for excessive alcohol consumption. Collegiate student-athletes have been found to be more likely than their peers to report alcohol-related negative consequences. In studying why athletes drink more than their peers, collegiate student-athlete alcohol research purports that motives for alcohol use stem from both general and sport-related motives. Social norms research, particularly descriptive and injunctive norms, has also been used to explain alcohol use habits in college students and student-athletes. Alcohol use is also strongly influenced by cultural norms and beliefs that one may develop in their country of origin. No research currently exists that studies how domestic and international student-athletes differ in alcohol use trends. The current study intends to bridge gaps in the literature by investigating alcohol use among international and domestic student-athletes and the resulting relationship between factors such as alcohol consumption, drinking motives, negative consequences of alcohol use, and a student-athlete’s country of origin. It was hypothesized that student-athletes from the United States would report significantly different alcohol use behaviors than their International counterparts. NCAA student-athletes (n = 1330) completed an online questionnaire that included a demographics survey, country of origin questions, social norms perceptions questions, alcohol use questions, Athlete Drinking Scale, Drinking Motives Questionnaire-Revised, and Rutger’s Alcohol Problem Index. Multiple MANCOVA analyses were run to examine differences in alcohol use behaviors between the three pairs of independent variables while controlling for gender and age. Analyses revealed significant effects for country of origin on student-athletes perceived injunctive norms and sport-related drinking motives. Specifically, international student-athletes perceived that friends from their country of origin approve of binge drinking more than United States student-athletes perceived their friends approve of binge drinking. Also, United States student-athletes endorsed all sport-related drinking motives more than international student-athletes endorsed the same motives, meaning that American student-athletes are more motivated to drink alcohol due to sport-related drinking motives than in international student-athletes are motivated to drink due to sport-related drinking motives.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The geologic history of the southern Appalachians, specifically the rock suites comprising the Wedowee-Emuckfaw units in the Eastern Blue Ridge, have been the subject of debate for decades. A growing body of evidence implies the Taconic orogeny developed in an accretionary orogenic setting in the Southern Appalachians, rather than the collisional orogenesis assigned to the Northern Appalachians. These units, as well as the Jackson’s Gap Group, are genetically related as all having formed in a back arc setting on the Laurentian Plate rather than in an exotic arc collisional environment, as interpreted by previous research and the findings of this study. The data collected for this evaluation provides additional information and high-resolution field mapping to strengthen the verification of the tectonic history of the region. Crossbedding structures were discovered for the first time in the Emuckfaw group, as well as undifferentiated diamictites in proximity to the fluvial structures. The nature of the Wedowee-Emuckfaw Groups contact was discovered to be stratigraphic in nature, with no faulted displacement found in the study area. Geothermobarometry constrained the timing of metamorphism in the field area to an average maximum temperature and pressure regime of 542 ± 44°C and 6.3 ± 2.2 kb for the Wedowee Group and 594 ± 49°C and 8.9 ± 1.9 kb for the Emuckfaw Group. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>In this dissertation, we present several applications of polynomial chaos in Monte Carlo simulation.First, we investigate the use of polynomial chaos as a control variate method for Monte Carlo simulation. Specically, we analyze the mean square error of the control variate estimator when the coefficients of the polynomial chaos approximation are obtained from Monte Carlo simulation. For a fixed computational cost, our objective amounts to determining the optimal allocation of cost between approximating the polynomial chaos coefficients, and estimating the expectation of the function with the control variate estimator. Then, we examine the effects of setting the control to a polynomial chaos approximation of a reduced model, formed by freezing the insignificant inputs of the original model using global sensitivity analysis. Next, we propose two different polynomial-based control variate methods for the calculation of Sobol' sensitivity indices, and compare our methods numerically against crude Monte Carlo and an approach that only uses polynomial chaos. Finally, we introduce an orthogonal transformation based on a second order polynomial chaos approximation that can be used to reduce error in quasi-Monte Carlo simulation. To motivate this approach, we review the literature of Brownian path generation methods, including those based on Taylor approximations of the payoff function.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Black male student-athletes are not graduating near or at the same rates as their counterparts. Moreover, many are leaving college underprepared professionally and personally. These young men often dream and work toward competing professionally to earn significant amounts of money; however, few make it to the next level. While in college, many Black male student-athletes experience identity foreclosure in which they underinvest in the development of other areas or identities (such as academics) at the expense of overinvestment into their athletic careers or identities (Charleston et al., 2015; Marcia, 1966). This disproportionate investment can lead many of them to not graduate and subsequently be underprepared for life after college, both professionally and personally. The National Collegiate Athletic Association and other member institutions have sought to enable all student-athletes to grow in their development through different programming and departments. The study site, Florida State University, created the Leaders Yearning for Excellence (LYFE) program to combat this issue, specifically affecting Black male student-athletes. LYFE seeks to raise the graduation rates of Black male student-athletes at Florida State by utilizing culturally relevant pedagogy. Research on culturally relevant pedagogy implies that students can learn and develop through a purposeful cultural lens (Ladson-Billings, 1995). The purpose of this study is to learn about the experiences of Black male student-athletes in LYFE and the impact of the LYFE program on current LYFE members (LYFEletes). The study utilizes a mixed-methods approach to answer the research questions: (1) What are the experiences of Black male student-athletes who participate in the LYFE program, and (2) What program components do participants find most impactful to their perceptions of degree completion, and their professional and personal development? The results of this study indicated that LYFEletes understand the importance of obtaining a degree. Furthermore, they experience connection in relationships and broadened horizons through their engagement and participation in the program. Their engagement in the program led to a greater sense of belonging as well as a way to combat identity foreclosure. The LYFE program illustrates that implementing CRP positively impacts Black male student-athletes’ personal and professional development. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation explores twenty-first century presentations of Johann Sebastian Bach’s St. Matthew and St. John Passions (BWV 244 and 245) in the context of Bach festivals in the United States. Building upon music festival studies by scholars such as Jonathan R. Wynn, Felicia Youngblood, Philip Bohlman, Jeff Todd Titon, and Tamara E. Livingston, I discuss the importance of Bach festival infrastructures in creating community and sustaining modern interest in historical pieces such as the Passions. Though originally liturgical, Bach’s Passions quickly entered the concert repertoire after Mendelssohn’s 1829 Berlin performance; similarly, the Passions have a rich American performance history and an important connection with American secular concert environments. Bach festivals, including concert series and performances by professional and amateur choral societies, are currently the primary venue for Bach’s larger choral-orchestral works such as the Passions. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Although these presentations may take place in secular concert halls or amphitheaters, or in larger church or church-owned spaces, I argue that the overarching festival environments crucially allow diversely minded performers and audience members to interact with the religious content inherent in the Passions in a nonreligious performative space. I comparatively examine the original religious context of the works through the scholarship of musicologists including Christoph Wolff, Markus Rathey, Daniel R. Melamed, and John Butt. Modern Passion performances create spaces of community for performers, audiences, and administrators, as I explore through the spatial theories of Henri Lefebvre and Michel de Certeau. Passion performances create spaces of community for performers and audiences, as well as concert presenters, managers, and venue owners. My research at Passion performances by the Baldwin Wallace Bach Festival, the Bach Festival Society of Winter Park, the Bach Society of Saint Louis, the Carmel Bach Festival, the Oregon Bach Festival, the American Bach Soloists, the Chicago Bach Project, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst Bach Festival, illustrates the depth and breadth of the “Passion communities” that form around modern performances. Participants tend to value a diversity of approaches to interacting with the religious story of Christ’s Crucifixion. Some focus on larger, cross-cultural themes of love and sacrifice, while others treat the Passions as dramatic literary and musical pieces of Western cultural heritage. Others simply enjoy the sonic realizations of Bach’s skillful text-painting. My interviews with festival participants further reveal that while the religious content is often a topic of conversation, the value of diversity is perhaps the most meaningful result of performing, sponsoring, or listening to modern Passion presentations. Singing and playing these works in festival contexts forms a communal space that moves beyond the works’ liturgical origins to create a modern American community built upon a shared musical experience.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This treatise is divided into two parts. Part 1 examines elements of polystylism and their implications in the piano music of Carter Pann, particularly in the two sets, The Piano’s 12 Sides and the Five Serious Pieces for Piano. In addition to identifying the various styles and composers that influenced Pann’s works, this exploration seeks to highlight points of contact between Pann’s music and the broader trend of musical postmodernism, as well as discuss performance issues for the benefit of performers. Concerning the performance implications, the artistry of the late pianist Joel Hastings, for whom much of Pann’s piano music was written, offers valuable insight to future performers. Part 2 of this treatise examines the topic of piano variations inspired by the sacred music of J.S. Bach, including Franz Liszt’s Variations on a Theme by Bach, “Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen” S. 179, Richard Danielpour’s Piano Fantasy (“Wenn ich einmal soll scheiden”), and Ferruccio Busoni’s Fantasia nach Bach and Improvisation on the Bach Chorale “Wie wohl ist mir, o Freund der Seelen.” The analysis seeks to demonstrate themes of purpose and suffering shared by each of the four works, both in their internal characteristics and in the historical circumstances surrounding them.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation investigates the use of block copolymer self-assembly to create nanostructures with unique domain properties. Precise control over nanoscale feature size and properties of materials has become increasingly more important to keep up the ever-decreasing size of technology. Bottom-up approaches using block copolymers has been progressively more attractive due to their ability to autonomously self-assembly into an array of complex morphologies with features sizes as small as 2-3 nanometers. Modifications of these systems has generally been limited to only one domain as the processes under which modifications are carried out generally result in the disruption or destruction of the underlying morphology.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	We originally set out to create a block polymer system containing poly(vinylpyridine) (PVP) segments which can undergo several transformations such as protonation, metal coordination, or quaternization. By coupling PVP segments with poly(tert-butyl methacrylate), we believed that a well-ordered charged mosaic containing segregated opposite charges could be created without disruption of the underlying morphology. Thin films of hexagonally packed P4VP cylinders were self-assembled perpendicular to the surface and subsequently treated with bromoethane vapor at various durations to quaternize pyridinyl nitrogens. The PtBMA matrix was then partially hydrolyzed to poly(methacrylic acid), PMAA, through HCl vapor treatment followed by neutralization by brief submersion in KOH solution. Using techniques such as AFM, contact angle testing, and ToF-SIMS, we were able to determine the success of these transformations as well as methodologies in which structural morphology was maintained.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	An additional exploration into the use of tris(trimethylsilyl)silane (TTMSS) as non-toxic alternative to tin hydrides using only light was investigated as a method to remove reversible addition-fragmentation transfer (RAFT) chain transfer agents. As the end group removal from PVP polymers derived from RAFT has to our knowledge never been reported, we felt that these results would be invaluable to the scientific community due to the ubiquitous use of PVP in many systems. Not only was TTMSS found to be an effective reagent for RAFT removal of PVP polymers, it was also found to be effective for the removal of RAFT end groups from polystyrene which has been generally reported in literature to be difficult due to the stability of the benzyl radical. Reactions were found to be complete for most polymers in less than 2 hours whereas, other reported reagents typically took 24 hours or as much as 1 week.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Two important applications of the f elements lie in the separation of the components comprising spent nuclear fuel, and f element use as radionuclides in nuclear medicine. Two ligand systems applying to each of these applications are presented and investigated in this dissertation.	</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter 1 gives a brief introduction to the lanthanides and actinides, namely applications in separations and nuclear medicine. The following four chapters detail a systematic analysis of lanthanides and actinides with a precursor ligand potentially for separations, 4'-(4-nitrophenyl)-2,2':6',2''-terpyridine, TpyNO2. The comparison of the lanthanide and actinide structures with this system suggest a greater degree of covalent character in the actinide structures than in the lanthanide structures. Additionally, TpyNO2 polarizes the metal centers in such a way that engages the ligands directly across the metal from TpyNO2. This engagement is specifically enhanced in the berkelium and cerium structures.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The second half of this dissertation explores the interaction of the lanthanides, actinides, and barium, as a surrogate for radium, with the biological potassium ionophore, valinomycin. A range of interaction is noted with the lanthanides and valinomycin in Chapter 6, where at lanthanum, the structure contains both tridentate and bidentate interaction, and at lutetium, the structure has both a monodentate interaction and an unbound metal center stabilized inside the valinomycin cavity. There is an abrupt change in interaction between samarium and europium, going from purely bidentate with the samarium cation, to monodentate and unbound with the europium cation. Californium and uranium crystal structures with valinomycin were also obtained. Chapter 7 analyzes a novel barium valinomycin structure, breaking the previous trend of all reported alkaline earth metals interacting with the amide carbonyl groups. Instead, the barium valinomycin structure reported here binds to all six of the ester carbonyl groups of valinomycin, like the interaction of valinomycin with potassium. This leads to the hypothesis that valinomycin could be capable of transporting barium, and more importantly its surrogate radium, across cell membranes, in the same way it does with potassium. Finally, Chapter 8 completes the main text of the dissertation.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Recent advances have been made to measure suicidal thoughts implicitly using the Death Implicit Association Test (D-IAT). This measure is promising, but the D-IAT has some methodological flaws, one of which is that it relies solely on reaction time to map cognitive indecisiveness. To address this, we developed a new version of the D-IAT, the Death Mouse-Tracking Implicit Association Test (D-MIAT), to better measure neural processing that occurs during motor decision making. We tested the validity of the D-MIAT to see whether it distinguished those with a previous suicide attempt from those without a suicide attempt history. We also tested whether the D-MIAT was associated with suicide attempt history above and beyond the original D-IAT and other covariates. We recruited 117 undergraduate students oversampled for a history of a suicide attempt. Results did not support our hypotheses, as we did not find a significant interaction between suicide attempt history and mortality pairing (F[1.88, 215.68] = 0.481, p = .607, η2 = .003), nor did the D-MIAT predict suicide attempt history above and beyond the D-IAT (χ2[2] = 1.572, p = .456). Results suggest that those with a previous suicide attempt history do not differ in their average or maximum cognitive attraction to death or life. Future work may consider looking at other measures of the D-MIAT, or creating a standardized scoring algorithm similar to the D-IAT.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Recent advances in computing and measurement technologies have led to an explosion in the amount of data that are being collected in many areas of application. Much of these data have network or graph structures, and they are common in diverse scientific areas, such as environment, biology, computer science, and sociology, among other areas. This dissertation makes two contributions towards inference problems in Bayesian statistical network analysis. We are specifically interested in the setting where the edges (that connect nodes in the network) are referenced over covariates and spatial locations.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter 1 of the dissertation focus on areal data analysis, and a literature review is presented in Section 1.1. Traditional conditional autoregressive (CAR) models use neighborhood information to define the adjacency matrix. Specifically, the neighborhoods are formed deterministically using the boundaries between the regions. However, areas far apart may be highly correlated, and this use of CAR models does not account for this structure. We propose a class of prior distributions for adjacency matrices, which can detect a relationship between two areas that do not share a boundary. Our approach is fully Bayesian, and involves a computationally efficient conjugate update of the adjacency matrix. To illustrate the high performance of our Bayesian hierarchical model, we present a simulation study, and an example using data made publically available by the New York City Department of Health.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In Chapter 2, We develop a Bayesian approach to analyzing high-dimensional spatial point patterns. In particular, we extend the Log-Gaussian Cox Process (LGCP) model, where we replace Gaussian distributed random effects with multivariate log-gamma (MLG) random effects. Fitting a traditional LGCP model can be computational intensive and often requires the use of Metropolis-Hastings when implementing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Our model uses the MLG distribution which leads to conjugate full-conditional distributions within a Gibbs sampler that are computational straightforward to simulate from. Additionally, the LGCP often requires a subjective specification of a discretization of the spatial domain. We propose the use of prior distribution on this choice, which can be efficiently incorporated into our model through the spatial change of support. We demonstrate the proposed methodology through simulated examples and motivating analyses of Starbucks locations. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the final chapter of this dissertation we give a brief conclusion of this thesis.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Two-dimensional (2D) materials have recently caught much attention due to their exceptional properties and their potential applications in opto-electronics. Graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), and black phosphorus (b-P) are some of the main candidates from the 2D material family that show great promise in their ability to have properties such as high mobility, anisotropy, desirable band gap, and many more. Here, we'll discuss some of the history of these 2D semiconductors and some of the properties that make them unique and interesting. This will be focusing on the electrical and opto-electrical properties of 2D semiconductors in measurements conducted during my graduate research studies. Some of these measurements include 2-terminal and 4-terminal contact configurations, photoconductivity, transport, photoluminescence, and Raman spectroscopy. The 2D semiconductors used in these experiments are post-graphene such as TMDs, post transition metals, and b-P.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The photoconductivity was measured on few-layered WSe$_{2}$ field-effect transistors (FETs) using both 2-terminal and 4-terminal configurations under 532~nm laser source. For an incident laser power of 248 nW, we extracted 18 A/W and $\sim$4000\% for the two-terminal responsivity (R) and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) respectively, when a bias voltage $V_{ds}$ = 1 V and a gate voltage $V_{bg}$ = 10 V were applied to the sample. R and EQE saw an increase by 370\% to $\sim$85 A/W and $\sim$20000\% respectively, when using a four-terminal configuration. The photogating effect was observed in our few-layered (3–4 layers) ReS$_{2}$ FETs in which varying the incident optical power shifted the FETs’ threshold voltage. The photogating effect produced a significant gain in the electrical response of the FETs to incident light as measured by R and EQE. We obtained a maximum R of 45 A/W corresponding to an EQE of $\sim$10500\% in a 4-terminal measurement of the photoconductivity in the ON-state. We attribute both the photogating and the observed gain to the influence of charge traps.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We also presented a detailed study on the Raman spectra and on the temperature dependence of the electrical transport properties of arsenic-doped black phosphorus (b-AsP) with an As fraction of x = 0.25. Field-effect transistors fabricated from few-layered b-AsP exfoliated onto Si/SiO$_{2}$ substrates exhibited hole-doped like conduction with a room temperature ON/OFF current ratio of $\sim$10$^{3}$ and an intrinsic field-effect mobility approaching                $\sim$300 cm$^{2}$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$ at 300 K which increases up to 600 cm$^{2}$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$ at 100 K when measured via a 4-terminal method. The ON to OFF current ratio is observed to increase up to 10$^{5}$ at 4 K. Similarly to pristine b-P, its transport properties revealed a high anisotropy between armchair and zig-zag directions. Photoluminescence (PL) and transport measurements were conducted on vanadium-doped InSe FETs using 2-terminal configuration under 532 nm and 785 nm excitation. Low temperature measurements were also studied ranging from   295 K to $\sim$13 K in a cryostat. Transport measurements showed little to no current when drain-source and back-gate voltages were applied and under low temperature. Low temperature PL showed blue-shifted peaks at T $&gt;$ 50 K and red-shifted peaks at T $&lt;$ 50 K. Lastly, there are summaries on papers that I had a smaller role.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Disorganized, weakly forced convection is a routine summertime occurrence in the Southeast United States. Pulse severe storms are single cell thunderstorms that produce severe wind and/or severe hail for a brief period of time. These thunderstorms pose a major warm season forecasting problem, since forecasters presently do not have sufficient guidance to know which, if any, of the many single cells will become severe. The empirical Probability of Severe (ProbSevere) model, developed by the Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies (CIMSS), fuses real-time data to produce short-term, statistically derived probabilistic forecasts of thunderstorm intensity. Objects corresponding to storms are created from satellite and radar data, tracked in two-minute timesteps, and trained on a composite of all modes of severe thunderstorms. ProbSevere has been found to increase forecaster confidence and forecast lead time. However, it is unclear how well ProbSevere performs specifically for pulse severe storms. This study evaluates the ability of ProbSevere to represent and predict pulse severe storms.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Pulse severe environments are often classified as being unstable (CAPE  2000 J kg-1) and weakly sheared (0-6 km AGL shear &lt; 10 m s-1). ProbSevere objects fitting the accepted definition of a pulse severe environment were matched with severe events from Storm Data to create a dataset of ProbSevere objects that corresponded to pulse severe thunderstorms. A null dataset comprised of objects that corresponded to pulse severe environments but did not match with a severe event was also created. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Pulse severe objects were evaluated at two times - the time at object initialization and the time of the severe event. This way, the evolution of objects could be analyzed as would be done by a forecaster in real time. Objects were examined in four ways – 1) their temporal evolution, 2) their spatial evolution, 3) how well the severe hail and cellular wind models perform for pulse severe objects, and 4) how well individual predictors discriminate between severe and nonsevere objects. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Results reveal that ProbSevere’s ability to represent pulse severe thunderstorms is limited, both temporally and spatially. There is little difference between severe hail-producing objects and severe wind-producing objects. At object initialization, ProbSevere exhibits insignificant probabilities of severe weather. At the time of severe events, probabilities are greater but still small. No predictor, with the exception of lightning flash rate, shows a strong correlation with the increasing probability of pulse severe events. Furthermore, no discernable difference in the distribution of probabilities as a function of predictor value is found between severe and nonsevere objects. This study demonstrates that ProbSevere’s ability to represent pulse severe thunderstorms is limited, and that ProbSevere is not optimized to give forecasters sufficient guidance for pulse severe storm events.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This dissertation research explores health disparities through the lens of information behavior, as defined by Dervin’s Sense-making theory, and evaluates patients’ use of health information for when making BRCA screening decisions. It is a three-article dissertation , developed with the intent to reconceptualize health literacy as both consumer health information behavior and shared decision making in an ecological model to examine complex mechanisms that include socioeconomic, environmental, and system-level factors in breast cancer genetic screening decisions. Such a model is essential because addressing challenges like racial health disparities in relationship to information behavior and genomic screening decisions, requires a multilevel interdisciplinary approach.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This treatise introduces contemporary French composer Olivier Kaspar (b. 1962) to a wider audience of performers and scholars. The document opens with a chapter reviewing his career as a violist, conductor, teacher, and composer. The next two chapters analyze two of his works for voice and piano: Terre des salamandres, Op. 7 (1990) on texts of Yves Bonnefoy and Trois poèmes de Lionel Ray, Op. 26 (2002). The final chapter places Kaspar in the aesthetic context of later twentieth century France, noting that his compositional style is antithetical to the post-Webernian serialism that had been dominant in that country until recently. Stylistic trends observed in the two analyzed pieces are also explored, demonstrating how Kaspar’s nuanced treatment of contemporary French texts serves to illuminate their deeper meaning for the performers and audience alike. Appendices offer translations into English and phonetic transcriptions of the texts studied as well as a complete catalogue of Kaspar’s compositions to date.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Vector-borne diseases account for more than 17% of infectious diseases, causing more than 1 million deaths annually from malaria, dengue fever, yellow fever, etc. Diseases once thought to be controlled, have experienced a resurgence. For example, there has been a 30-fold increase in Dengue compared with fifty years ago, and the World Health Organization (WHO) has expressed concern about a potentially even greater increase in Zika. New developments in the cost of vector control and an increase in human travel limit the application of previous approaches to prevent the spread of vector-borne diseases. Precise spatial identification of disease risk can enable cost-effective control. This requires estimating the risk of infected and susceptible persons being present in a location with vector prevalence at a fine spatial scale. Human mobility patterns are the drivers of human-vector proximity. The sustainability of interventions developed through insight on human mobility depends also on the response of the community to these interventions. It is, therefore, desirable to understand community sentiments toward public health policies, actions, and communications.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Scientific insight into human mobility, disease risk, and public sentiments can guide effective public health strategy. However, this is hindered by the limitations of conventional data sources and models, especially in their spatial, temporal, and demographic resolutions, given the fast pace of changes in human mobility and public sentiments in the modern era. For example, air travel data can provide passenger flux from an epidemic hit country to the USA, thus providing insight into regions that are vulnerable to the importation of a disease. However, these data do not help identify specific neighborhoods that ought to be targeted for intervention. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>New data sources, such as social media, location-based services (LBS), cell phones, and land-cover maps promise the spatial resolution and real-time information needed to meet public health needs. Recent scientific models have incorporated mobile phone and air traffic data to predict disease risk. However, their ability to account for demographic heterogeneity is quite limited, and they still lack the desired spatial resolution required to guide cost-effective vector control measures. Social media and location-based services data could provide the desired resolution. However, machine learning solutions using such data have often had more success in fitting past data rather than in predicting future outbreaks, as shown from Google flu and dengue trends. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We believe that one reason for lack of success is due to bias and noise in social media data. Varying human behavior has been attributed to be one of the causes of this problem. We believe that yet another cause is that machine learning techniques, even with conventional data, often do not adequately leverage the fundamental underlying biophysical and human behavioral mechanisms responsible for disease spread.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We leverage the strengths of state-of-the-art epidemic risk models while developing new algorithms that can exploit novel data sources. Our goal is to develop general-purpose computational techniques that can be applied in a variety of situations, including those applications that involve public health issues.  We focus on the importation of Zika into Florida at the resolution of counties and neighborhoods within cities. We summarize our novel techniques below.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Conventional epidemic models use simple travel models, such as the gravity model. We have developed a more sophisticated destination-choice model and demonstrated that it is more effective than the traditional travel models used in epidemic simulations. We have developed a few techniques to leverage social media data to characterize human mobility, as well as a multi-scale solution using these data. In particular, we have developed a high-resolution home location prediction algorithm using Twitter metadata for tweets with geo-tags. We dealt with its computational load by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to identify regions at risk at a coarse scale, and then the high-resolution algorithm only in regions identified as high risk. LBS is an alternate data source and covers around 10% of the Florida population. This is a much larger coverage than for tweets with geo-tags. We linked the conventional American Community Survey (ACS) data with LBS, using a two-phase dynamic structure logistic regression model and ensemble weighted logistic regression model. Finally, we examined the understanding of human sentiments from Twitter data. We have developed a consensus deep learning model using XLNet on tweet content to ensure that our results are reliable, and they also consider hidden patterns in texts.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Our work on high-resolution home location prediction and sentiment analysis are general purpose and can be used in a wide variety of applications. Our decision-choice model can be used in a variety of mobility applications. Our methodology for linking the above techniques with conventional epidemic models has led to higher resolution risk assessment than those of the current state of the art. We believe this to be a major advance in high-resolution vector-borne disease modeling, which can also be leveraged for the spread of other types of infectious diseases.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Lycopene is an unsaturated carotenoid that provides fruits and vegetables with a natural red pigment. Lycopene is predominately found in tomatoes, watermelon, papaya, and grapefruit. Lycopene has eleven linear conjugated bonds allowing it to oxidize free radicals. Lycopene’s antioxidative capacity are suggestive to have protective effects against chronic disease. Serum lycopene concentrations are inversely associated with cardiovascular disease risk. Purpose: To use data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 2003-2004 and 2005-2006 cycles, to investigate the relationship between elevated serum lycopene concentrations and demographic, socioeconomic, and lifestyle factors (Aim 1), as well as cardiovascular disease risk profiles (Aim 2). Methods: Females and males  &gt;20 yrs. who completed the 2003-2004 or 2005-2006 NHANES cycles  were used in the current analysis (n=4442). Participants were excluded from the analysis if they were pregnant, had a previous cardiac event (i.e., heart attack, stroke, heart failure), or fasted &lt; 8 hrs before the blood draw. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted modeling serum lycopene concentration as the dependent variable and demographic (age, sex, race) and socioeconomic factors as independent variables (education, and income). A multivariate one-way ANOVA was used to determine which demographic and socioeconomic factors were independently associated with serum lycopene concentrations. Cardiovascular risk profiles were calculated by totaling the number of risk factors between -1 and 12. Each participant received a +1 risk factor if the participant met a given risk factor criteria: &lt;40 mg/dL serum HDL cholesterol, &gt;130 mg/dL serum LDL-cholesterol, &gt; 200mg/dL serum cholesterol, HDL to cholesterol ratio &gt; 5, currently taking cholesterol medication, &gt;130 mmHg systolic blood pressure, &gt;90 mmHg diastolic blood pressure, currently taking blood pressure medication, HbA1C &gt;7%, currently taking insulin, BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2, or currently taking a diuretic [1] [2] . Each participant received a -1 risk factor if the participant had &gt;60 mg/dL serum HDL cholesterol [1]. A linear regression model of total CVD risk and serum lycopene was conducted controlling for age (35-50, 51-69, &gt;70 yrs), race (Non-Hispanic-Black, Mexican American, Other Hispanic, Other Race), education (Less than High School (HS) Education, High School Graduate or GED, Some College or AA Degree), socioeconomic status (SES, &lt;100%, 100-199%, 200-299% poverty income guidelines), &lt; 150 min moderate physical activity per week, smoking,  and serum lycopene concentrations. Results: Serum lycopene concentrations were lower in participants aged 51-69 (40.4 ± 20.1 µg/dL , p-value = .001) and &gt;70 yrs. (33.0 ± 18.8 µg/dL)p-value = .000) compared to participants 20-34 yrs. Females (40.2 ± 18.6 µg/dL) had  reduced concentrations of serum lycopene compared to men (43.5 ± 19.4 µg/dL)(p-value = .000). Other Hispanics (44.7 ± 19.5 µg/dL) had significantly higher concentrations of serum lycopene compared to Non-Hispanic Whites (42.5 ± 18.9 µg/dL) (p-value = .015). Individuals with education status below a College Degree (45.6 ± 19.4 µg/dL) had significantly lower levels of serum lycopene compared to College Degree and Above [less that HS education (36.8 ± 18.7 µg/dL,  p-value = .000), High School Grad or GED, (41 ± 18.7 µg/dL, p-value = .001), Some College or AA degree, (43 ± 18.9 µg/dL, p-value = .001)]. There were no differences between SES and serum lycopene concentrations when compared to income &gt;300% (47.2 ± 20 µg/dL) of poverty guidelines [&lt;100% poverty guidelines (39.8 ± 20.7 µg/dL, p-value = .160), 100-199% poverty guidelines (40.8 ± 22.8 µg/dL, p-value = .515), 200-299% poverty guidelines, (43.7 ± 21.2 µg/dL, p-value = .542). Serum lycopene concentrations (p-value .000) were a significant positive predictor of CVD risk profile score. In addition, age [35-49 yrs. (p-value .000), 50-69 yrs. (p-value .000), &gt;70 yrs. (p-value .000)], sex [female (p-value .000)], Non-Hispanic Black (p-value .036), education [Less than HS Education ( p-value .008), High School Grad or GED (p-value .001), Some College or AA Degree (p-value .007)], socioeconomic status [&lt;100%  (p-value .045), 100-199% (p-value .011)], and physical activity [physical activity (p-value .002)] were significant predictors of CVD risk profile score. Race [Mexican American (p-value .912), Other Hispanic (p-value .405), Other Race (p-value .256)], socioeconomic status 200-299% (p-value .0539), and smoking (p-value .875) were not associated with CVD risk profile scores. Conclusion: In this cross-sectional study of the U.S. population, age, sex, race, education, and income were significant determinants of serum lycopene concentration. However, after multivariate analysis, age (&gt;50 yrs ), females, Hispanics, Non-Hispanic Black, and education less than a college degree were found to be negatively associated with serum lycopene concentrations. Age, education, 100-199% SES, physical activity, and serum lycopene concentrations were positively associated with CVD risk factor scores. The positive association between CVD risk factor score and serum may have occurred due to underlying determinants such as serum LDL and cholesterol levels.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this dissertation we explore three topics: 1) the extraction of the proton radius from electron scattering data; 2) the reconstruction of neutron distributions in nuclei from parity violating experiments; and 3) the propagation of dispersive corrections in electron-nucleus scattering to the estimated nuclear densities. We use various statistics tools and strategies including Bayesian analysis, bias-variance trade-off criteria, and a new framework we have developed under the name of ``the transfer function formalism".</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The first topic is motivated by the decade old ``proton radius puzzle": a stark disagreement between muonic based and electronic based experiments aimed to extract the electric radius of the proton. Given the long and impassioned discussion about what model should be used to recover the radius, the main question driving us is: What is the most robust and reliable way, from a statistical point of view, to extrapolate the electron scattering data and extract the radius?</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The second topic is motivated by the combination of the strong interest in weak charge densities by the nuclear physics and astrophysics communities, and the enormously challenging experiments needed to access neutron distributions inside a nucleus. Given the complexity and cost of such experiments, the main question driving us is: How to extract the most amount of information in cases with scarce data?</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The third topic is motivated by our lack of knowledge on the magnitude and energy dependence of dispersive effects, a fact that could negatively impact delicate experiments such as those involved with the second topic. In addition, the propagation of dispersive effects from raw data, to the calculated quantities through the fitted model, gave us a perfect benchmark to implement our proposed transfer function formalism. Given the uncertain structure of the dispersive effects, the main question driving us is: How to propagate small perturbations in the data to calculated quantities in a straightforward way (without re-fitting the model)? </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation is a contribution to address these questions, and to strengthen multidisciplinary efforts between physics and statistics.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Adjunct faculty have become the new majority faculty on campuses across the country.  There are two theories why adjunct faculty are so relied upon: cost or contingency.  Some institutions may employ adjunct faculty for cost-savings reasons. In contrast, other institutions may depend on the contingent, temporary nature of the employment contracts to quickly hire (and fire) faculty due to variations in enrollment and course offerings.This study tests the cost theory with a comparative interrupted time series analysis centered on the effective date of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA).  Effective in January 2014, the ACA requires all large employers to make health insurance available to their employees who work at least 30 hours a week or more.  Using publicly available personnel data for public universities and community colleges in Florida, analyses were done across three dependent variables – full-time headcount, the proportion of full-time faculty, and mean compensation – across seven years.
Of nine analyses, only one analysis found significant statistical effects from the ACA's impact on the employment of adjunct faculty.  This finding was surprising, particularly for the lack of statistically significant results at community colleges which rely more on adjunct faculty for instruction to a substantial extent, while also being more sensitive to cost increases due to their non-traditional student bodies.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Over the past 40 years, performance-based funding has become a common tool of state legislatures to hold institutions accountable for student outcomes.  Performance funding allocates state money to institutions based on a specific set of measures.  However, states vary in the measures they select, methods for determining funding allocations, and the proportion of state funds reserved for performance funding.  Common measures include retention rates, completion rates, labor market outcomes, and equity measures, but legislators may alter standardized measures to fit the political needs of their state.  Although recent research estimates that over 35 states have adopted performance funding policies, the effectiveness of these policies is inconclusive and the unintended consequences have led to institutional mission narrowing and decreased acceptance rates for underserved students.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study analyzed the adoption of performance-based funding polices with three models.  First, a state’s likelihood to adopt a performance funding 1.0 policy.  Second, a state’s likelihood to adopt a performance funding 2.0 policy.  Third, a state’s likelihood to adopt any performance funding policy.  Event history analysis was utilized to explore factors that impacted a state’s likelihood to adopt these policies, focusing on both the influence of adoption through policy diffusion (regional accrediting agency groups) and internal determinants (political factors, education/unemployment factors, and higher education factors).  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study extended the work of previous researchers in three important ways.  First, by comparing results for the adoption of performance funding 1.0 and 2.0 policies independently.  Second, by analyzing the adoption of performance funding policies through geographic regions, identified as regional accrediting organizations.  Finally, by including new internal determinants not utilized in previous studies focusing on the adoption of performance funding policies.  Data were collected from a variety of state-level sources and the dataset included information on 47 states from 1993 to 2013. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>All three models utilized similar syntax for the event history analysis and while there were statistically significant results, they were not consistent across all three models.  For state adoption of a performance funding 1.0 policy, a Republican controlled legislature, consolidated governing board, unemployment rate, percent change in Fall term enrollment, and number of doctoral institutions were found to have a significant impact.  For state adoption of a performance funding 2.0 policy, the percent of states in the accrediting region that already adopted a performance funding 2.0 policy and the educational attainment rate were found to have a significant impact on policy adoption.  Finally, for state adoption of any policy, a Republican controlled legislature, legislative term limits, consolidated governing board, and percent change in Fall term enrollment were found to have a significant impact.  In the variables listed above, a Republican legislature, legislative term limits, and states with more doctoral institutions increased the likelihood of policy adoption, while the percent of states in the accrediting region that already adopted a performance funding policy, the presence of a consolidated governing board, increases in a state’s educational attainment rate, and increases in the percent change in Fall term enrollment decreased the likelihood of policy adoption.  This study adds to the higher education literature by separately analyzing the adoption of performance funding 1.0 and 2.0 policies and finding differences in the factors that impact adoption.  These differences indicate the importance of viewing performance funding 1.0 and 2.0 policies as distinct, rather than under an umbrella term of performance-based funding.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study is to survey the piano music of Claude Debussy as viewed bymusicologist and philosopher Vladimir Jankélévitch (1903-1986). The Debussy performer is faced
with a tripartite challenge: how does one make sense of works that require musical artistry,
sensitivity to visual or imaginative inspirations, as well as philosophical depth? This treatise
intends to address and contemplate this question through Jankélévitch’s books Music and the
ineffable and Debussy et le mystère de l’instant. Debussy’s second book of Préludes (1913) is
presented as a window to the broader aesthetic context of his oeuvre.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation discloses the use of alkynes as a fundamental component in the design and development of new chemical reactions that pave the way for the construction of carbon-rich molecules and nanomaterials. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter 1 gives a short introduction into the fascinating world of graphene and other 2-dimensonal nanomaterials. A brief discussion of the chemistry that has been developed for the preparation of carbon nanostructures is also provided and the foundational series of reports for bottom-up construction of nanocarbons is presented.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Then, Chapter 2 delves deep into our group’s efforts to expand the available reaction toolset for the construction of polyarenes through ‘alkyne origami’. Central to this chapter is the development and evolution of oligoalkyne radical cascades that construct carbon-rich molecules. This chapter also contains a detailed account of why alkynes are the ideal high-energy, carbon-rich functionality to apply in this endeavor, as well as the use of a ‘weak link’ approach for selective alkyne activation, and its later evolution into the traceless directing group (TDG) method. Furthermore, this chapter provides the experimental and theoretical background that lead into the development of the first ever alkyne radical peri-annulations on acene cores.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter 3 discloses the development of peri-annulations as a tool to modify the zigzag-edge (L-region) of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons through their π-extension. Depending on the choice of reaction conditions and substrates, this flexible approach can provide Bu3Sn-substituted phenalenes, benzanthrenes, and olympicenes from simple arene starting materials. Subsequent reactions with electrophiles open synthetic access to previously inaccessible functionalized polyarenes. Computational chemistry helped unveil the complex reaction mechanism that governs this transformation and provided theoretical explanations for the scarcity of similar transformations reported in the literature.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Finally, a versatile synthetic route to distannyl-substituted polycyclic aromatic systems developed via double radical peri-annulations is presented in Chapter 4. The cyclization precursors were equipped with propargylic OMe traceless directing groups (TDGs) for regioselective Sn-radical attack at the triple bonds. The two peri-annulations converge at a variety of polycyclic central cores to yield expanded difunctionalized polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The product diversity derives from the identity of the polycyclic core and the choice of alkyne substitution. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This approach can be extended to triple peri-annulations where annulations are coupled with a radical cascade that connects two preexisting aromatic cores via a formal C-H activation step. For example, two naphthyl moieties can be fused to form a perylene core en route to the final peropyrene product. The installed Bu3Sn groups serve as chemical handles for further functionalization of the new polyarenes via direct cross-coupling, iodination, or protodestannylation. Furthermore, these groups allow for simpler processing and purification of the reaction mixtures by increasing solubility in organic solvents. Photophysical studies reveal that the Bu3Sn-substituted PAHs are moderately fluorescent, and their protodestannylation serves as a chemical switch for ‘switching on’ high fluorescence quantum yields. DFT calculations identified the most likely possible mechanism of this complex chemical transformation involving two independent peri-cyclizations at the central core.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The underground source of drinking water (USDW) is an aquifer or part of an aquifer, that supplies Unites States citizens with public drinking water. A USDW must contain water that is recoverable, and the water must possess a concentration of fewer than 10,000 mg/L of total dissolved solids (TDS). When drilling injection wells the depth at which the USDW ceases must be determined with the highest possible degree of confidence because the zones both above and below the USDW require monitorization. Through lithologic unit identification, analysis of geophysical logs, and the interpretation of packer test results, the base of the USDW was determined at the northern most Class I injection well on the west coast of the Floridan peninsula, in Pasco County, to occur at 725 feet below sea level (bls). The recoverability of water within the Floridan Aquifer System at the injection well site in Pasco County terminates at 725 feet bls, and it also contains far fewer than 10,000 mg/L TDS. The depth at which a concentration of 10,000 mg/L TDS occurs, and is maintained within the aquifer, is at a depth of approximately 1,125 feet bls. However, this depth falls within the confining unit of the Avon Park Formation and poses a conundrum with state regulations that require monitoring of the zones surrounding the 10,000 mg/L TDS occurrence. On this basis, the results require the interpretation of both professionally trained geologists and state officials to effectively determine the monitoring that must take place in order to protect one of the world’s most productive aquifer systems from contamination. Further research is necessary to identify factors that can update state regulatory requirements regarding injection wells that encounter a concentration of 10,000 mg/L TDS within a hydrogeologically confining unit. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Ireviken carbon isotope excursion (CIE) was a large-magnitude positive shift in δ13C values that is recorded in early Silurian (~432 Ma; Llandovery-Wenlock boundary) strata globally. Associated with this CIE is a marine mass extinction, the Ireviken Event (murchisoni Event in graptolites), during which approximately 80% of conodont and graptolite fauna went extinct, along with a ~50% reductions in trilobites and brachiopods, as well as a decline in corals, chitinozoans, and acritarchs (organic-walled phytoplankton group). Previous paleoredox studies of carbonate sequences throughout the Ireviken CIE and extinction event intervals have shown evidence for widespread euxinic (anoxic + sulfidic) conditions during this time in the Silurian oceans providing a possible causal mechanism for both of these linked biogeochemical events. This study investigates two localities that preserve deeper marine basinal mudstone/shale sequences to further test this redox-based hypothesis: the Baltic Basin (Latvia) and the Cape Phillips Basin (Bathurst Island, Arctic Canada). A set of local paleoredox proxies for both sites (34Spyr, [Mo, V, Mn], Fe-speciation) are utilized to constrain local marine water column conditions throughout the study interval. Additionally, samples were analyzed from both sections for thallium isotopes (205Tl), a global paleoredox proxy for Mn-oxide burial in the oceans. Local paleoredox proxy records (Fe-speciation and [Mn]) indicate both deeper water sections were reducing throughout the Ireviken CIE interval. Pyrite sulfur isotopes from multiple paleocean basins co-vary with previous 34SCAS datasets, both records indicate global pyrite burial initiated at the onset of the Ireviken CIE and continued throughout the peak carbon isotope interval. The new thallium isotope data presented herein suggest the global oceans were more reducing prior to the CIE interval and during the early stages of the marine extinction event, subsequently this interval was followed by a brief oxic event during the rising limb of the CIE and later stages of the extinction event. The thallium isotope data indicate a return to more reducing conditions globally during peak CIE and falling limb values. This study presents new insights and constraints on paleoredox conditions during this interval of the early Silurian suggesting a more complex marine redox history associated with the Ireviken extinction event and CIE. This study also presents a new mathematical model, deriving glacial ice growth from global precipitation, generated from a Milankovitch forcing mechanism which influenced glacial ice sheet growth and 5th order eustatic sea-level fluctuations throughout the Llandovery-Wenlock boundary.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This treatise presents a formalized, repeatable method for innovative recital preparation. The method created by the author, entitled the Aesthetic Performance Design Method (APD Method), is outlined in this document as a worksheet that serves as a curriculum module to be completed in the applied music setting by the teacher and student concurrently. The author also explores how elements of this method are currently being used in the field of music and proposes how its use in training students will create a closer relationship between audiences and classical music experiences. The author also includes a review of relevant research in interdisciplinary fields that aims to rationalize why the field is moving in the direction of more integrated and exploratory performance styles.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation examines the study of rigidity of collections of objects in various geometric spaces, and the correspondences shared between geometries. In particular, we take a look at vectors and lines in Lorentz $(n+1)$-space, points, ideal points and hyperplanes in hyperbolic $n$-space, and circles and points in the Riemann sphere. One main objective is to explore how much information invariant to a given space is sufficient for a collection to be unique up to the transformations of the space. The answer to this question changes with the qualities a collection of objects possesses. To this end, this dissertation focuses on the role independence of objects plays in uniqueness. As another primary focus, a new invariant is introduced in each geometric setting to provide a means with which to study the rigidity of intermingled collections of objects that are infinitely far away from one another.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The first chapter gives a history of circle, sphere, and point configurations, and the correspondences between configurations of objects in hyperbolic space and Lorentz space. All theorems stated in this chapter are well-established results and provide both motivation for studying conditions for rigidity and for introducing an invariant that allows for intermingled collections of points and spheres.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the second chapter, the main result is established entirely within the context of Lorentz space. An invariant of Lorentz transformations called the Lorentz ratio is defined that allows one to work with intermingled collections of vectors and light-like lines in Lorentz space. Three main statements are made about the rigidity of intermingled collections of vectors and light-like lines, each relying on a linearly independent collection of subspaces spanning the entire space. Each statement utilizes different information invariant to Lorentz space. These statements are crafted in Lorentz space with the intention of interpreting them in other geometric spaces.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the third chapter, a dictionary between the objects and tools of Lorentz $(n+1)$-space and those in hyperbolic $n$-space is outlined so that the rigidity results in chapter $2$ may be interpreted within the hyperbolic setting. Much of this information is standard and found within any given hyperbolic geometry text; some observations about the correspondence between linear independent vectors in Lorentz space and objects in hyperbolic space are novel. The Lorentz ratio also yields an invariant in hyperbolic space we call the hyperbolic ratio. The main rigidity result of objects in hyperbolic space is stated at the end of the chapter.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the final chapter, we turn our attention to the correspondence between objects in Lorentz space, and points and spheres in the $(n-1)$-sphere. There is an immediate correspondence that arises from the fact that the $(n-1)$-sphere can be taken as the ideal boundary of hyperbolic $n$-space. More specifically, circles and points in the Riemann sphere enjoy a geometry not dissimilar to points, lines, and planes in Euclidean space, so a notion of independence may be established within this geometry. This terminology is used to give a rigidity result for configurations of intermingled points and circles with independent collections of circles in the $2$-sphere. Whereas inversive distance is a common conformal invariant used between pairs of circles, an inversive ratio between a point and two circles is defined so that these intermingled configurations may be considered. This chapter ends with results on the rigidity of inversive distance circle packings that use independence as a tool.</DISS_para>

      <DISS_content>
         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Psychopathy is a personality disorder characterized by a lack of empathy, manipulativeness, the inability to feel remorse and regret, manipulativeness, and a glib, superficial charm. It is estimated that psychopaths make up anywhere from one to four percent of the general population. Despite their infrequency, they are especially dangerous because their superficial charm and artful demeanor belies their nefarious intentions. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Though not yet a term, psychopathy captured nineteenth-century American authors’ imaginations who understood the disorder by its earlier conception: ‘moral insanity,’ ‘dangerous individual,’ and ‘monster.’ At the same time, these authors sustained from the Revolutionary to the Civil War Era a discussion on sympathy’s role in shaping and democratizing the nation. From the Founders to the reform movements of the nineteenth century, sympathy played a pivotal role: authors of sentimental fiction grounded their works in sympathy to argue for women’s equal status with men in both domestic and political spheres; abolitionists and authors of slave narratives used it to demonstrate the horrors of slavery and argue for African Americans’ democratic inclusion; orators and authors to promote women’s suffrage, labor reform, and temperance. It may be difficult to measure sympathy’s productive value in each of these, but on its own, sympathy was incapable of securing these movements’ ideals. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation seeks to reconcile sympathy’s limits and vices as nineteenth-century authors imagined a nation in constant social, cultural, and political development. Why could women not be given the right to an agential voice, choose their marriage partner, or vote? Why did the majority population of a nation that boasted of its superlative freedom and democracy support slavery or, at least, feel indifferent to millions of brutalized, enslaved African Americans? How does a nation codify its laws to ensure that innocent, good people suffer while those who exploit them profit? Scholars often answer these questions by determining political power, social advantage, and economics as the limits for democratic exclusion. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>My dissertation articulates a theory of structural psychopathy as an alternative answer to these questions. As psychopaths are antithetical to sympathy, they can be understood as antidemocratic, nationally corrosive figures. Rather than a routine, individual diagnosis of characters, I strive to articulate how an entire nation might be psychopathic. Thus, structural psychopathy describes a nation whose social, cultural, and political architecture is consistent with the characteristic traits of psychopathy. Nineteenth-century American authors seized on what they understood to be sympathy’s adversary and portrayed this conflict in the affective and psychological conditions of a population whose framework determined their lack of—and ability to manipulate—sympathy while pursuing a self-interest that jeopardized the nation’s constitution.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Out of interest in better exploring the nature of actinide bonding, investigations have been undertaken which confront the problem of the unusual character of covalency as it occurs in the 5f elements by utilizing multiple analytical frameworks. In this way, nuances of the bonding character which might be invisible to any one theory alone can be illuminated. A series of complexes of lanthanides and actinides with the ligand bis(O, O’-diethyl)dithiophosphate have been synthesized and characterized by optical spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, single crystal X-ray diffraction, CASSCF and DFT simulation, and bonding analysis via the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules, the Interacting Quantum Atom, and Ligand Field DFT. These techniques combined expose in addition to the expected enhancement of covalent character in the actinides over the lanthanides, a variation in the source of that covalency between the adjacent actinides plutonium and americium. We are also able to identify a variable which has previously remained unremarked as impacting the covalency of bonds, that being the anisotropy of the metal ions. These results are used as footing to recommend future routes of inquiry with the potential to open new routes to solving globally important problems of f-element separation.
Additionally, recent research has suggested anomalous bonding behavior in the complex of californium with a well-known chelating ligand. To investigate this, a series of complexes of lanthanides and californium with the ligand diethylenetriaminepentaacetate, better known as DTPA, have been synthesized and characterized by solution and solid state optical spectroscopy and single crystal X-ray diffraction. Our results describe the very similar stability of multiple bonding archetypes, the high sensitivity of M-O bond lengths to the environment, and illustrate the unusual chemistry of californium as it interacts with this ligand.

            <DISS_para>Baryon and hybrid baryon wave functions were built from harmonic oscillator basis states with explicit flavor and color. The Relativized Constituent Quark Model was extended to calculate more baryon states. Improvements were made to the Capstick and Isgur model to handle baryons with three unequal mass quarks and calculate the three-body confinement term exactly. Using a better Moshinsky coefficient implementation, it was possible to calculate $H_{13}$ and $H_{23}$ for three unequal mass quarks. Parameters were fitted to a small number of ground state baryon masses and isospin symmetry violating mass differences. The model agrees well with the full experimental ground state baryon spectrum and mass splittings. The Capstick and Isgur model was extended by calculation of the masses and isospin-symmetry violating mass differences of baryons with multiple heavy quarks, as well as the masses of charge states that have not been observed in experiments. Isospin violating mass differences were calculated for low lying negative parity baryons, which have recently been observed experimentally for some heavy-quark baryons, and some which may become experimentally accessible in the future.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are very popular nowadays and offer reliable solutions to many</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>classification problems. Recent research indicates that these neural networks might be overparameterized and different solutions have been proposed to reduce the complexity both in the number of parameters and in the training time of the neural networks. Furthermore, some researchers argue that after reducing the neural network complexity via weight selection or pruning, the remaining weights are irrelevant and retraining the sub-network would obtain a comparable accuracy with the original one. This may hold true in vision problems where we always enjoy a large number of training</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>samples and research indicates that most local optima of the convolutional neural networks may</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>be equivalent. However, in non-vision sparse datasets, especially with many irrelevant features</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>where a standard neural network would overfit, this might not be the case and there might be many</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>non-equivalent local optima. In this work, we present empirical evidence for these statements and an empirical study of the learnability of neural networks (NNs) on some challenging non-linear real and</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>simulated data with irrelevant variables. Our simulation experiments indicate that the cross-entropy</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>loss function on XOR-like data has many local optima, and the number of local optima grows exponentially with the number of irrelevant variables. We also introduce a novel efficient weight or neuron node selection method to improve the capability of NNs to find a deep local minimum even when there are irrelevant variables. Furthermore, we extend our approach to a network pruning framework that is scalable in dealing with various kinds of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), both on structured and non-structured pruning without sacrificing inference accuracy.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to investigate undergraduate band conducting students’ exposure to conductors of color and women conductors. Specifically, this study sought to answer the following questions: 1)	Do undergraduate band conducting students have conducting role models? 
2)	Do undergraduate band conducting students perceive their conducting role models to be their same gender or race?
3)	Have undergraduate band conducting students’ been exposed to conductors in the following categories: White male conductors, White female conductors, male Conductors of Color, and female Conductors of Color?
4)	Where have students been exposed to White male conductors, White female conductors, male Conductors of Color, and female Conductors of Color?
5)	Overall, to what extent do students value and want exposure to White male conductors, White female conductors, male Conductors of Color, and female Conductors of Color?
6)	To what extent do male and female students value and want exposure to White male conductors, White female conductors, male Conductors of Color, and female Conductors of Color?
7)	To what extent do White students and students of color value and want exposure to White male conductors, White female conductors, male Conductors of Color, and female Conductors of Color?
Participants (N = 106) were undergraduate instrumental music education students specializing in winds and percussion who were currently enrolled or had previously been enrolled in a conducting class. A Qualtrics survey was constructed and distributed to participants consisting of demographic information, one set of questions about conducting role models, and four sets of questions investigating the participants exposure to Male Conductors of Color, White Male Conductors, Female Conductors of Color, and White Female Conductors. The findings in this study reveal that female students and Students of Color have significantly fewer role models with whom they identify than White male students. The findings in this study also indicate that lack of exposure could be a main source of this discrepancy. The participants in this study had been exposed to more White male conductors than non-White male conductors in every role. This study’s findings also indicate that undergraduate band conducting students, specifically women and Students of Color, placed a high value on matched conducting role models and expressed a strong desire for more exposure to non-White male conductors.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The study consists of two parts. Part one examined the clinical use of the multimodal neurologic enhancement music therapy intervention (MNE) in the NICU and compared clinical outcomes of infants who received MNE with those who did not. A post hoc analysis was utilized to examine clinical data of infants from 2018 who were hospitalized in a single NICU unit. Subjects (N = 530) were infants born preterm, which is defined as less than 37 weeks postmenstrual age. Demographics were compared between the infants who did and did not receive NICU-MT. There was a significant difference between the groups with infants receiving NICU-MT being born younger and at a lower birthweight, and with more acute diagnoses indicating referral for NICU-MT going to more acute preterm infants.  In order to compare clinical outcomes, the researcher matched infants based on sex, gestational age at birth, birthweight category, number of acute diagnoses, diagnoses of bronchopulmonary disease, and diagnoses of a feeding problem. Clinical outcomes for the matched infants (n=55 in each group) were compared between the two groups, showing that infants who received NICU-MT went home sooner, gained more weight per day, and ended oxygen treatment sooner. The benefits of NICU-MT were the greatest for infants born extremely preterm or at an extremely low birthweight. 
Part two was a two-year follow-up study that examined developmental outcomes in the domains of communication, gross motor, fine motor, problem solving, and socio-emotional skills of infants at two years of age who received MNE in the NICU compared to normative data for term infants. Subjects (N = 30) were toddlers who were born premature (&lt;37 weeks), hospitalized in a neonatal intensive care unit after birth, and received the MNE intervention. Parents completed developmental questionnaires about their toddlers who were two years adjusted age. 
	Developmental outcomes were measured using two standardized developmental questionnaires. The Ages &amp; Stages Questionnaire, 3rd edition, (ASQ-3) was used to assess overall developmental outcomes (Squires, 2009). The Ages and Stages Questionnaire: Social &amp; Emotional, 2nd edition, (ASQ:SE2) was used to assess behavioral and social-emotional outcomes (Squires et al., 2015). Outcomes on the ASQ-3 showed that the majority of follow-up infants were in the no- to low-risk category in all domains of communication, gross motor, fine motor, problem solving, and personal social skills. The follow-up infants exhibited better outcome scores than did the normative sample on the ASQ:SE2 with a lower median score and fewer infants identified as being at high risk for a social-emotional delay. Regression analyses indicated that the number of MNE intervention sessions did not significantly predict the outcome scores for any domain on the ASQ-3 or the total score on the ASQ:SE2. However, the number of music therapy sessions did significantly predict the outcome scores on the communication and fine motor domains (p &lt; .05) in the multiple linear regression analyses. These outcomes warrant the need for further research on the potential long-term impacts of NICU-MT interventions. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The goal of this research is to understand the interwoven relationships among policy, market, and organizations in health care. Investigating how transparency and competition influence health care providers’ performance from a three-dimensional managerial perspective, I found that the current transparency tools did not contribute to achieving the intended policy outcomes. The effectiveness of APCDs was limited in that the state-governed databases have failed to curtail hospital costs nor improve quality of care. Data availability was found to only partially contribute to quality of care. Competition worked for higher hospital technical efficiency and perceived outcome, yet not for cost nor clinical outcomes. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	With regard to hospital costs, I found that transparency policy is significantly related to higher average hospital operating expenses, regardless of market competition. This was in contrast with the hypotheses that the disclosure of data would induce cost reduction, and that competition would provide incentives to hospitals to economize their operating expenses. The findings raise concerns about the efficacy of transparency tools and market competition for cost savings in health care. The negative association between hospital expenses and market competition under greater transparency suggest that hospitals still compete largely on quality rather than costs. Despite results that did not support the hypotheses, this study is cautious to conclude that provision of information or market competition fail to contain hospital costs, because cost analysis alone, without regard to quality and efficiency, can be misleading if not self-defeating (Porter, 2010). The role of public reporting and competition warrants multifaceted assessment because the U.S. health care system seeks multiple goals not limited to cost containment. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	It is widely agreed that public disclosure of quality information fosters a spirit of openness in health care markets, where problems of asymmetric information are embedded. Despite the merits of transparency, the present study did not offer supportive evidence for the public data profiling on quality of care, and learned that pursuing transparency may even inadvertently harm quality of care. The ability of transparency initiatives to enhance quality of care remains obscure. The data profiling of hospital performance was found to have power to differentiate hospitals’ quality of care, but it failed to reach the desired outcomes without market pressure. In addition, market competition is one of the devices that steered hospitals toward quality improvement. It is important to note that market competitiveness can also work in collaboration with transparency policy in achieving enhanced quality performance. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The study on transparency, competition, and technical efficiency of hospitals demonstrated inconclusive patterns in the relationships among them. The impact of APCDs reported a negative association with efficiency, while the availability of patient satisfaction data showed a positive link to efficiency with market competition as a mediating variable. It was noteworthy that specific policies on disclosure of hospital information may have disparate impacts on hospital technical efficiency. The divergent policy impact possibly stems from providers’ managerial strategies or consumers’ selection pathways. From a provider-oriented perspective, I assumed that the two types of transparent environments may create different market pressures on hospitals to perform better by reducing costs or improving quality of care. One policy made hospitals focus more on quality than costs, and the other made hospitals focus more on costs than quality. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	It is important to note that different transparency approaches have different impacts. I assume that the disparate policy impacts may stem from the different public awareness and policy designs that Hospital Compare data and APCDs have, even though they pursue similar goals through public reporting. The two transparency initiatives have different levels of public awareness that come from the supremacy of ownership. Hospital Compare data, managed at the federal level, is more widely-acknowledged by over 4,000 Medicare-certified health care providers than by APCDs. In addition, whether the performance data reported by hospitals are tied to payment is one of the major determinants for the difference. One suggestion for improving the efficacy of APCD is to tie the state-mandated reporting to the state Medicaid payment system.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	All things considered, I conclude that a transparency policy alone is not likely to produce the intended outcomes (Jencks, 2000; Lemire et al., 2013), and thus there is need for complementary tools for the current public reporting, if not a complete redesign of the tool. I also noted that the existence of varying public reporting schemes may generate confusion instead of clarity (Austin et al., 2015). The current performance measurements were fragmented and often misaligned among various public reporting initiatives at the different levels (e.g., state vs. federal levels). They should be better aligned in order to provide meaningful guidance to health care service organizations that face multifaceted pressures to outperform in the market.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>We develop a unifying framework for the treatment of various types of persistent homology using the notion of correspondence modules. In this formulation, morphisms between vector spaces are partial linear relations, as opposed to linear mappings. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the one-dimensional case, among other things, this allows us to: (i) treat persistence modules and zigzag modules as algebraic objects of the same type; (ii) give a categorical formulation of zigzag structures that allows a continuous parameter; and (iii) construct barcodes associated with a filtered space that are richer in geometric information. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A structural analysis of 1D persistence modules is carried out at the level of sections of correspondence modules that yield sheaf-like structures, termed persistence sheaves. Under some tameness hypotheses, we prove interval decomposition theorems for persistence sheaves and correspondence modules, as well as an isometry theorem for persistence diagrams obtained from interval decompositions of persistence sheaves.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Applications of correspondence modules in levelset persistence and $1$D slicing of $2$D persistence modules are introduced. Also, a Mayer-Vietoris sequence in correspondence module category is formalized.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>As the rise in availability of natural language data, the underlying language structures can be better learned and play the important roles in many natural language processing tasks. Although the neural language representation models like Transformer trained on large-scale corpora have achieved amazing performance on different natural language processing (NLP) tasks, how to further incorporate the structural knowledge information is not well explored. In this thesis, we propose to explore the structure modeling for existing powerful neural models of natural language via explicitly and implicitly ways, in order to further boost the performance of the models.We describe three general approaches for incorporating structure information into the Transformer, the state of the art model of many NLP tasks. The first method is mainly based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and we propose a novel Attentive Recurrent Networks (ARNs) to introduce the recurrence into Transformer. The second method leverages the RNNs' variants ordered neuron Long short-term memory (ON-LSTM). The third method leverages multi granularity phrases information of the sequences, which enables Transformer to capture different segments structure from words to phrases. The linguistic representations learned as a result of structure modeling are shown to be effective across a range of downstream tasks such as neural machine translation (NMT) and text classification. 
We validate our approaches across a range of tasks, including machine translation, targeted linguistic evaluation, language modeling and  logical inference. While machine translation is a benchmark task for deep learning models, the other tasks focus on evaluating how much structure information is encoded in the learned representations and how it can affect models. Experimental results show that the proposed approach consistently improves performances in all tasks, and modeling structure is indeed an essential method for further improving the performance of the NLP models such as Transformer.
Furthermore, in the last part of the thesis, we conduct a series of experiments to analyze the importance of syntax information in NLP tasks. In detail, we investigate the role of syntax in NMT and language modeling. More specific, we adopt the On-Lstm decoder, which can be used to induce the latent structure of natural language, to integrate the syntax information into the state-of-the-art Transformer model. Then, by conducting  fluency and adequacy evaluation experiments, we illustrate the role of the syntax information in such tasks. Our analysis shade the lights on the role of syntax for NLP tasks especially for the sentence generation in machine translation.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) has recently gained traction as a music-theoretic and music analyticaltool, providing a mathematically robust way of modeling various musical phenomena. I
examine both local and large-scale harmonic structures by using computational methods to interpret
the pitch classes of a digitally encoded musical score through the discrete Fourier transform. On
the small scale, my methodology shows relationships between sonorities within Fourier space, and
aids in making statements about proximity, similarity, and distance between individual harmonic
structures. On the larger scale, my methodology offers a broad view of the backgrounded scales
and pitch-class collections of a piece: the "macroharmony. The DFT has the distinct analytical
advantage of being stylistically and historically neutral. This allows a single methodology to apply
to music from a wide variety of genres, time periods, and styles.
In Chapter 1, I present the conversations scholars have had thus far pertaining to the DFT and
its applications to harmony and pitch classes. I focus particularly on the contributions of David
Lewin, Ian Quinn, and Jason Yust as three of the most influential people in promoting the DFT as
a viable music-theoretical tool. Chapter 2 contains an overview of how the DFT applies to pitch
classes in 12-tone equal temperament, along with a tutorial on its application. I then discuss some
of the challenges of computational approaches to music analysis.
In Chapter 3, I focus on simultaneities--the amalgamation of pitch classes sounding in a particular
moment in time--and the distances traveled in Fourier space when moving from one to another.
My approach is an expansion of Justin Hoffman's cartographies of multisets in Fourier space, which
I apply to a chorale by J. S. Bach and a passage from a string quartet by Thomas Adès. In Chapter 4
I expand the span of musical time used to define the multiset. Instead of a single moment in time
defined by a discrete harmonic event, I use the technique of overlapping windowing to examine the
macroharmony of musical excerpts by W. A. Mozart and Olivier Messiaen. Chapter 5 expands the
applications of the DFT even further, now to quarter-tone and other microtonal systems. I apply
the techniques from previous chapters to works by Charles Ives and Alois Hába. Finally, Chapter 6
provides a short summary of the project, and includes ideas for future research endeavors.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Father involvement is critical for youth’s development across their lifespan (Barton, Kogan, Cho, &amp; Brown, 2015; Doyle, Clark Goings, Cryer-Coupet, Lombe, Stephens, &amp; Nebbitt, 2017; Passley, Gerring, &amp; Gerson, 2007). Thus, researchers indicate the importance of understanding factors that impact father’s involvement. A father’s perception of fatherhood and father’s identities are two factors that significantly influence father involvement. Additionally, several contextual factors have been highlighted in prior research as impactful of father involvement. However, initial research on fatherhood was conducted primarily with White fathers, therefore informing fatherhood norms based on the experiences of White men. Scholars have advocated more research on fathers of color and an emergence of literature on Black fathers has surfaced. This study aimed to contribute to the fatherhood literature by understanding Black fathers’ experiences in constructing their perception of fatherhood and developing their father identities. Of extant literature few studies have sought to understand how father perceptions, identity, and involvement inform each other and change over time. Thus, this study sought to address this gap in the literature. Additionally, 48% of Black children are raised in single-parent homes (United States Census Bureau, 2018). This study aimed to gain insight on fathers from various family of origins experiences on constructing their perceptions, identities, and involvement. A phenomenological qualitative design was utilized to address the aims of this study.  Participants in this study included 30 Black fathers who completed semi-structured focus groups. Qualitative results revealed numerous themes encompassing fathers’ perceptions, identities, and involvement. Implications for clinicians, researchers, and program developers are discussed.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Despite increases in the numbers of children and adolescents seeking and receiving mental health treatment, rates of self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITBs) in youth continue to rise. In the hopes of aiding ongoing efforts to alleviate the burden of SITBs in this vulnerable population, the present meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) summarizes current knowledge on the efficacy of SITB interventions in children and adolescents. A total of 77 articles comprising 461 total effect sizes were included in our analyses. We used a random-effects model to evaluate both overall intervention efficacy and effects on specific SITB outcomes. We also explored several potential moderators of treatment efficacy. Results revealed that nearly all interventions produced nonsignificant reductions in SITBs. These patterns were largely consistent across SITB outcomes, regardless of intervention type, treatment components, sample characteristics, and publication year. This meta-analysis highlights several opportunities for improvement in the way that SITB interventions are developed and implemented in child and adolescent populations. The most effective interventions are likely to directly target the causes of SITBs; therefore, future research is needed to identify the causal processes underlying the onset and maintenance of SITBs in youth.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation considers how composers deviate from strict chromatic sequences in post-tonal triadic repertoire and introduces multi-dimensional voice-leading spaces that are flexible enough to accommodate these minute alterations while still maintaining mathematical rigor in their construction. The first chapter of this dissertation presents the need for this research and situates it within the larger body of literature on transformational theory including neo-Riemannian theory and Julian Hook’s theory of Uniform Triadic Transformations (UTTs). Chapter two introduces the methodology employed to build multi-dimensional voice-leading spaces that use UTTs as generators. Such spaces can be created through the intersection of a primary UTT with a secondary UTT on a voice-leading grid. The designations of primary and secondary tie a theoretically abstract UTT space to a specific musical context where the primary UTT accounts for the majority of relationships between triads in a sequential passage, and the secondary UTT serves as an interruption that breaks the sequence. Such sequential breaks often result in the substitution or insertion of a triad that is related to the next expected harmony by one of Frank Lehman’s quintet of Neo-Riemannian operations— P, L, R, S, and N. The analytical vignettes in chapters three, four, and five demonstrate the usefulness of UTT-generated voice-leading spaces through an examination of the triadic music of Alfred Schnittke. Chapter three introduces Schnittke’s triadic compositional techniques and includes passages from Five Preludes and Fugues for Piano, Septet, Concerto Grosso no. 2, and String Trio. Chapters four and five provide model analyses of Schnittke’s Requiem and Piano Quintet, and Piano Sonata no. 1, respectively. Finally, chapter six proposes the successful application of UTT-generated voice-leading spaces to repertoires as diverse as pre-tonal triadicism and film music, and the extension of the system to account for voice-leading between non-triadic pitch class sets. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The seemingly elusive connections between a West African ceremony and a Southern blues scape is this thesis’s central focus. In Unmasking The Blues: Gẹlẹdẹ And The Creation Of Blues Alchemy, I explore the blues culture phenomena of alchemy (a personal, cultural, collective liberation attained through transformative ritualized, energetic shifts), all through the dancing body. Focusing on historical images of blues dance, I analyze the presence of Africanisms: the aesthetic characteristics that manifest symbolic and literal representations of African identity. Maintaining a focus on two blues dance performers and the choreographic processes of three African American modern-based artists, I examine the surviving attributes of Nigerian Gẹlẹdẹ in blues dancing. In particular, understanding the presence of Gẹlẹdẹ masking, ancestral embodiment, and gender fluidity as primary to blues making deepens our understanding of African Diaspora dances, including locating African retentions within American forms. The driving agenda for this thesis, then, is to first to illuminate and contribute to identifiable sources of surviving Africanisms in blues aesthetics and secondly, bring attention to blues dance and its aesthetic as a foundational element of African American dance. As my initial substantial inquiry into African American cultural dance identities, this thesis intends to locate Africanisms and Africanist identity within blues aesthetics. My desire is to delve further than previous dance histories, and—akin to many histories of dislocated memories and people—reunite the Africa/blues dancing connection via scholarship, a task equally as important as the ongoing reunions found within recent scholarship concerning transnational, African diasporic musical and dance practices. It is therefore essential to address the roots of African American development. Not only the first evolving sounds of the drum, but also the signature movements of labor and toil born in the southern fields of the United States defy what appeared as a death upon the transatlantic ships. That journey was actually a rebirth; it equipped enslaved Africans with weapons of resilience and strength needed to survive. This ignited the phenomenal equation I explore in the following pages: the Continent’s alchemist tools, embedded with àṣẹ, produced the birth of blues. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Las conexiones aparentemente esquivas entre una ceremonia de África Occidental y un paisaje de blues sureño es el enfoque central de esta tesis. En Unmasking The Blues: Gẹlẹdẹ And The Creation Of Blues Alchemy, exploro los fenómenos de la alquimia de la cultura del blues (una liberación personal, cultural y colectiva lograda a través de cambios energéticos, rituales transformadores), todo a través del cuerpo danzante. Centrándome en imágenes históricas de la danza del blues, analizo la presencia de africanismos: las características estéticas que manifiestan representaciones simbólicas y literales de la identidad africana. Manteniendo un enfoque en dos artistas de danza de blues y los procesos coreográficos de tres artistas afroamericanos de base moderna, examino los atributos supervivientes del Gelẹdẹ nigeriano en el baile de blues. En particular, comprender la presencia del enmascaramiento Gẹlẹdẹ, la encarnación ancestral y la fluidez de género como primordial para la creación del blues profundiza nuestra comprensión de las danzas de la diáspora africana, incluida la localización de las retenciones africanas dentro de las formas estadounidenses. La agenda impulsora de esta tesis, entonces, es primero iluminar y contribuir a las fuentes identificables de africanismos sobrevivientes en la estética del blues y, en segundo lugar, llamar la atención sobre la danza del blues y su estética como un elemento fundamental de la danza afroamericana. Como mi investigación sustancial inicial sobre las identidades de la danza cultural afroamericana, esta tesis pretende ubicar los africanismos y la identidad africanista dentro de la estética del blues. Mi deseo es profundizar más que las historias de danza anteriores y, similar a muchas historias de recuerdos y personas dislocadas, reunir la conexión entre África y el baile de blues a través de la beca, una tarea tan importante como las reuniones en curso que se encuentran en la investigación reciente sobre temas africanos transnacionales. Prácticas de danza y música diaspórica. Por lo tanto, es esencial abordar las raíces del desarrollo afroamericano. No solo los primeros sonidos evolutivos del tambor, sino también los movimientos característicos del trabajo y la fatiga que nacen en los campos del sur de los Estados Unidos desafían lo que parecía una muerte en los barcos transatlánticos. Ese viaje fue en realidad un renacimiento; equipó a los africanos esclavizados con las armas de resistencia y fuerza necesarias para sobrevivir. Esto encendió la ecuación fenomenal que exploro en las siguientes páginas: las herramientas alquimistas del continente, incrustadas con àṣẹ, produjeron el nacimiento del blues.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This qualitative study aims to explore the experiences of undocumented college students enrolled at public institutions of higher education in the state of Florida who engage in the phenomena of activism. The research will explore significant policy factors that influence undocumented college students who engage in various forms of social activism. In addition, the review of literature will provide historical context related to immigration policies, laws, and judicial decisions that shape the current tensions between public colleges and universities in Florida and students who secured both the Federal Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) status and benefit from Florida House Bill 851, also known as the tuition equity bill enacted in 2014. Critical Race Theory (CRT) and Latina/o Critical Race Theory (LatCrit) will serve as a theoretical framework used to elevate the voices of DACA students engaged in social activism during their college years.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This thesis examines the intonational behavior of Galician-Spanish bilinguals in the production of yes/no-questions in Spanish and Galician. Considering that Spanish and Galician have been in contact since the early middle ages (Ramallo, 2007), it is likely that this intense contact has resulted in longstanding effects (Thomason &amp; Kaufman, 1988). Previous research on intonation and language contact has shown that intonation can be affected by contact with another language (e.g., Bullock, 2009; Elordieta, 2003; Elordieta &amp; Calleja, 2005; Mun-tendam &amp; Torreira, 2016; Simonet, 2011). However, the precise outcome of language contact might differ from case to case. Thus, this study investigates the intonational contours attested in Spanish-Galician bilinguals for yes/no-questions while considering the effects of age, gender and language dominance on the intonation of these questions. Although yes/no-questions in many varieties of Peninsular Spanish are characterized by having final-rising intonation (Face, 2004, 2006; Navarro Tomas, 1974; Prieto, 2004; Quilis 1988, 1993; Sosa,1999), Galician and varieties of Spanish in Northern Spain show falling contours (Cantabria:López-Bobo &amp; Cuevas-Alonso, 2010; Asturias: Alvarellos Pedrero et al., 2011; Troncoso-Ruiz &amp; Elordieta, 2017; Basque Country: Elordieta &amp; Romera, forthcoming; Robles-Puente,2011; Galicia: Fernandez Rei, 2019; Perez Castillejo, 2012). A yes/no-question elicitation task based on the one used in Muntendam &amp; Torreira (2016) was used to collect data produced by 19 Spanish-Galician bilinguals. Data were recorded and analyzed acoustically to examine the intonation patterns they produced in 2,553 tokens (1,330 in Spanish and 1,223 in Galician). Participants completed the Bilingual Language Profile (Birdsong, Gertken &amp; Amengual, 2012) to determine their language dominance. Findings showed that three main contours were produced in both Spanish and Galician: rising L+H* HH%, falling H+L* L% and alternate rising L* HH%. Data were analyzed statistically and results showed that most participants used the same intonation in their two languages. There were also significant effects for age (older participants produced more falling contours), gender (male participants produced more alternate rising contours) and language dominance (Galician-dominant participants produced more falling contours). These findings contribute to the limited literature on intonation patterns of yes/no questions in Galician Spanish and Galician as well as to the limited research on the prosodic effects of language contact in Galicia.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Crystalline intermetallic phases grown by metal flux synthesis are discussed in terms of structure-property relationships. Flux growth is employed as the primary synthesis methods across different systems from single element fluxes like molten bismuth or aluminum, to low melting combinations of metals whether cerium and copper or magnesium and aluminum in an effort to elucidate a deeper understanding of crystal growth for intermetallic phases. The growth and characterization of the intermetallic MgNi2Bi4 is presented, which represents a new structure type containing nickel-centered mono-capped trigonal prism units that are seen across a variety of Ni-Bi compounds. A hydride-stuffed variant of the Nd2BC structure is reported, Ce4B2C2H2.42. Hydride presence in the structure was confirmed through Neutron Diffraction studies. Magnetic, heat capacity, and resistivity measurements indicate that the compound displays moderate heavy fermion behavior. The cerium analog of Na2HgO2 is reported, which is only the second reported borocarbide phase in this structure type. The Ce2BC2 phase contains Ce+4 with isolated [C=B=C]5- units. Early investigations are reported for attempts to synthesize UB6, including the first reported synthesis of CeB6 from an aluminum flux.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Proteins, polymer chains comprised of amino acids, are one of the fundamental machines that drive life. They perform a wide variety of functions within the cell such as nutrient transport, cell signaling, energy production, DNA repair, enzymatic reactions etc.. It was generally accepted that in order to perform these functions the sequence of amino acids would fold into a low energy structure, i.e. the “structure-function” paradigm. At the turn of the century, a new category of proteins was discovered which did not follow this paradigm, intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). In fact, we know now that IDPs perform a variety of functions through folding-upon-binding to partners, forming dynamic fuzzy-complexes, or liquid-liquid phase separation, while maintaining a unfolded/unstructured state in solution.  These dynamic, unstructured ensembles are incredibly difficult to characterize using previous methods such as X-ray crystallography. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, with previous success modeling structured proteins, became one of the key computational methods for determining the conformational ensembles of IDPs. There are two main problems associated with MD simulations of IDPs: sampling and force-field selection. In this dissertation, we discuss these issues using two intrinsically disordered proteins/regions: Q15, a simple disordered peptide, and ChiZ-NT, disordered region from the TM protein ChiZ in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.  In the first chapter, we compare the conformational ensembles of Q15 over a series of temperatures with multiple replicate conventional MD (cMD) simulations as well as two enhanced sampling methods, temperature replica exchange (TREMD) and replica exchange with solute tempering (REST), showing that the conformational ensembles of all three simulations are similar, but only the two enhanced sampling methods could reproduce physically correct temperature dependent helical melting. The second chapter focuses on solving the conformational ensemble and backbone dynamics of ChiZ-NT in solution using long-multiple replicate MD simulations. After extensive force-field validation against various experimental parameters, a viable force-field was found which could model the structural properties, and without initial validation, the backbone dynamics of ChiZ-NT. ChiZ-NT exhibits disparate dynamics in the two halves, and long-MD determined that the dynamics is due to sequence specific interactions.  Finally, this force-field is used to sequentially model ChiZ in a Mtb mimetic membrane environment, a previously difficult simulation for IDPs due to both sampling and force field-selection. Again long-multiple replicate MD simulations accurately modeled the structure and dynamics of the disordered region of ChiZ as verified by solution and solid-state NMR. Several IDPs form amphipathic helices upon association with membranes, but ChiZ-NT remains disordered upon association with anionic membranes. The strict characterization by solid-state NMR in combination with MD simulations results in the first identification of a disordered, fuzzy complex between disordered regions and the membrane as has been observed between IDP-protein interactions.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this dissertation, I investigate the role of the Atlanta Braves’ new baseball stadium and surrounding development within the emerging context of team-driven mixed-use urban development. Conceived as a replacement for the 20-year-old Turner Field, Truist Park (originally called and hereafter referred to as SunTrust Park) opened at the start of the 2017 Major League Baseball season north of Atlanta in suburban Cobb County. The stadium cost $622 million in total, with $392 million coming from Cobb County (Tucker, 2015b). In addition to the park itself, the Braves also financed a $400 million development surrounding the park branded as The Battery Atlanta, which includes food, retail, entertainment, hotel, office, and apartment spaces, resulting in a mixed-use construction capable of capturing a wide variety of consumer behavior (Cooper, 2017).  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	 Here I examine several interrelated phenomena vital to the political and experiential aspects of the new Braves development. The mixed-use district surrounding the stadium characterizes a new trend for professional teams, evolving from older paradigms of stadiums either set amidst numerous parking lots or constructed within downtown sites independent of the surrounding development. Team-controlled districts represent an extension of the physical experience of sport franchises, and these master-planned team districts produce different kinds of social practices than prior projects. In addition, the SunTrust project also includes a move from the center-city to the suburbs (in opposition to many contemporary stadium trends) as well as reorienting the Braves as a real estate developer.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	To this end, I conducted an inquiry into the social production of space at The Battery Atlanta using a Lefebvrean framework. Lefebvre (1991) wrote that space could be understood as a social production and conceptualized it as a tripartite arrangement of spatial practices (the built environment and social behavior), representations of space (how planners and the powers-that-be conceive of the space) and representational spaces (how users of the space actually conceive it, often at odds to the “intended” representation). For this, I conducted a content analysis of government and media records (including the online resources from the Cobb County government, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, and other Atlanta newspapers) to determine frames pertaining to the development of The Battery Atlanta and the franchise’s move from downtown, as they represent the articulation of the local elite’s representation of space for The Battery Atlanta.  Ethnographic research was also conducted on-site at The Battery Atlanta to examine the spatial practices therein, along with interviews of the users of the space to understand the representational spaces they construct for it. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The findings of the study can best be understood through Bryman’s (2004) concept of Disneyization. The study complements the existing literature on the political economy of stadium development which has primarily focused on quantifying potential tangible and intangible economic costs and benefits as well as the governance processes supporting stadium development and subsidization. The Battery makes ample use of the Disneyization aspects of theming, hybrid consumption, merchandising, performative labor, and the use of control and surveillance. While none of these aspects of Disneyization were invented by or are unique to The Battery, the Braves’ development holistically integrates them and intensifies their use in a novel fashion, which has poised the development to become a trendsetter for the next phase of team-controlled neighborhood stadium development. The Lefebvrean physical and imagined spaces of The Battery thus construct a consumer-focused wonderland that successfully operates as a sphere unto itself, excluding undesirable citizens while adopted glocalized versions of a Disneyization systemscape. Examining the social production of space of the project assists in understanding both the natural progression of existing stadium development logics as well as potential future directions for stadium development from a perspective of the political economy of space.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This thesis examines ideas of authentic folk music in America and the role it plays in the Tallahassee folk music community. In looking at how the identification of folk music has changed throughout the history of its research and collection, we can now see how this shift of focus from the performance to the performer. We can also use these observations to view the role that authenticity has in the establishment of folk communities. To approach this subject, I conducted four oral history interviews with individuals that have been involved in the establishment of this community. By conducting these interviews, we can acquire a firsthand take as to how and why this community was originally established, the importance of this community to its members, and the ways that new ideas of authenticity affect the identity of the Tallahassee folk music community.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Suicide is a leading cause of death among young adults. Despite the relative affordability and accessibility of mental health care services for college students, rates of treatment utilization remain relatively low among undergraduates reporting serious thoughts of suicide. Thus, efforts are needed to improve connection to mental health care services among undergraduates at elevated suicide risk. This study aimed to identify correlates and predictors of help-seeking behaviors (e.g., researching treatment options) and treatment engagement (e.g., attending therapy sessions) among a sample of undergraduates not currently engaged in mental health treatment who had experienced suicidal ideation since beginning their college careers. At baseline, participants (N = 237) completed explicit (i.e., self-report) and implicit (i.e., implicit association tests) measures of attitudes toward suicide and mental health service use, as well as self-report measures of structural barriers to care, suicide literacy, prior mental health treatment experiences, suicidal symptom severity, and readiness to change. Two months later, participants completed a self-report survey assessing help-seeking behaviors and treatment that had occurred during the study period. One-way ANOVAs, ANCOVAs, logistic regression analyses, and zero-inflated Poisson regression models were utilized to identify correlates and predictors of help-seeking and treatment engagement. At baseline, 66% and 28% of participants reported having engaged in help-seeking behaviors and mental health service use, respectively, since beginning their college careers. At two-month follow-up, 59% of participants reported having engaged in helping-seeking behaviors and 25% reported having initiated mental health service use during the study period. Cross-sectional analyses revealed that a lower degree of stigma concerns was significantly correlated with both help-seeking and mental health service use. Longitudinal analyses identified greater readiness to change as the only significant predictor of help-seeking during the study period. No factors significantly predicted whether or not participants initiated mental health service use during the two-month study period; however, those reporting greater structural barriers to care at baseline attended fewer treatment visits over the study period. Findings suggest that enhancing readiness to change might serve to encourage help-seeking among at-risk undergraduates. Our results also suggest that addressing structural barriers to care might facilitate greater treatment retention among at-risk undergraduates who have initiated mental health treatment. Additional research is needed to replicate these findings and to identify predictors of mental health service use among at-risk undergraduates over longer periods of time.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Introduction. Overparenting is a parenting practice defined as parents being overly involved in their young adult children's lives by providing excessive assistance and exerting developmentally inappropriate control. Research conducted in the U.S. has consistently related overparenting to emerging adults' psychological maladjustment. It is, however, unclear whether the relation between overparenting and psychological maladjustment differs across cultures. Cultural universalism endorses a cultural-invariant view, whereas cultural relativism contends the effects of parental behaviors on child outcomes to be more culturally specific. This debate raises the question of whether the influence of overparenting on emerging adult children and its underlying mechanisms are more culture-invariant or culture-specific. Objective. Grounded in the self-determination theory and bioecological theory, using mixed methods, this cross-cultural study aims to advance the understanding of cultural similarity and difference in emerging adult children's experience of parental overparenting. Study 1 (a quantitative study) examines a mediation mechanism—the satisfaction of basic psychological needs—linking overparenting to emerging adult children's psychological well-being problems, and the moderating effect of cultural normativeness on the association between overparenting and psychological needs satisfaction in the U.S. and China. We investigated the cultural similarity and difference in these two markedly different cultures, with the U.S. known for an individualistic culture where people strive for autonomy and independence and China marked by collectivistic culture where people value interdependence and intergenerational relatedness. Study 2 (a qualitative study) aims to explore cultural similarities and differences in emerging adult children's conceptualization and experience of overparenting. This study compared typical patterns of parental overparenting behaviors across cultures, emerging adults' interpretation and coping with overparenting, and their perceived consequence of overparenting.
Method. In Study 1, participants were college students recruited from the U.S. (N = 414, M age = 20.38, 92% female) and China (N = 612, M age = 20.21, 69% female). In an online survey, participants reported their mothers' and fathers' overparenting (Helicopter Parenting Instrument-HPI), basic psychological needs satisfaction (autonomy, competence, and relatedness), perceived normativeness of overparenting in their culture, and psychological well-being (depressive symptoms, anxiety, and life satisfaction). Key demographic variables (i.e., age, gender, family income) were included in the analyses and controlled for. In Study 2, in-depth interviews were conducted among 29 American and 32 Chinese participants whose overparenting scores ranked highest from the survey pool from Study 1. Interview questions included how they conceptualize, experience, and attribute overparenting, as well as how they respond to and cope with overparenting, and their perceived consequences of overparenting. 
Results. For Study 1, consistent with the universalistic view, results from structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed that basic needs satisfaction was a mediating mechanism explaining the link between overparenting and psychological well-being problems in both Chinese and American emerging adults. Results from multi-group SEM also supported the relativistic perspective in that the negative associations between overparenting and basic needs satisfaction were significantly stronger among American emerging adults than among their Chinese counterparts, suggesting overparenting may be more threatening to American emerging adults' needs satisfaction with autonomy, competence, and relatedness than to Chinese emerging adults'. Results from each country also revealed that cultural normativeness moderated the association between overparenting and psychological needs satisfaction. Specifically, the negative effect of overparenting on psychological needs satisfaction was significantly weaker among emerging adults with higher normativeness perception of overparenting than those with lower normativeness perception. For Study 2, results from grounded theory approach revealed prominent cultural differences in parents' display of overparenting across children's life domains. More cultural similarities than differences, however, were identified in children's emotional experience of overparenting. 
Conclusion. This cross-cultural mixed-method study advanced the understanding of cultural similarities and differences in the associations between overparenting and emerging adult children's psychological well-being. The findings suggested a middle ground between cultural universalism and cultural relativism, embracing the principle of universalism without uniformity (Shweder &amp; Sullivan, 1993). A future direction is to unpack the factors that could explain the observed cultural difference to inform culturally sensitive practices for improving emerging adults' well-being.

            <DISS_para>Numerous pre-Contact fishhooks have been recovered from the Aucilla River in northwest Florida. These specimens have provided evidence of small capture fishing methods such as hook and line fishing, primarily in the form of bone hooks. But the types of materials used as line are still a mystery. Through an experimental approach, I narrowed down the possibilities for what types of materials would have been good candidates to have been used as possible fishing lines on and around the pre-Contact Aucilla River. To do this, I looked at the ethnohistoric record, the availability of the materials, the speed and efficiency of production of each type of cordage starting from harvesting raw materials and ending with cordage, and finally I tested the structural integrity of each material using two phases of testing. This analysis suggests that the best cordage for line fishing in multiple environments would be yucca (Yucca filamentosa), when compared to red mulberry tree (Morus rubra) and cabbage palm (Sabal palmetto).</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This study offers an examination of available double bass music from two Mandarin-speaking countries: Taiwan and China. Western music and Western instruments were introduced to China and Taiwan throughout the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centuries. The author of this treatise is a double bass performer of both American and Taiwanese backgrounds, thus offering a unique perspective on research that combines East Asian and Western musical cultures.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This treatise briefly introduces the history of Western music and the development of the double bass in China and Taiwan. It then presents selected compositions for double bass by Chinese and Taiwanese composers in an annotated bibliography, including solo works, transcriptions, and chamber works.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this project is to make these works accessible to a wider audiences of double bass performers and pedagogues throughout the world by providing the beginnings of a systematically-created catalog of compositions by Chinese and Taiwanese composers.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>AbstractAfter developmental education (DE) reform took place among the 28 Florida College System (FCS) institutions in 2014, different colleges adopted the policy with various resources, perspectives, and reactions. This study seeks to examine what institutional characteristics, interacting with SB 1720, related to various institutional trajectories of cohort-based course passing rates and the change of student course success probabilities in the pre- and post-policy period. 
On average, across the 28 FCS institutions, the study shows that the cohort-based English passing rate increased abruptly upon the reform, and the slope of the passing rates’ trajectory decreased in the post-policy period. Regarding the trajectory of college-level English passing rates by cohort, the 28 colleges performed similarly with a small annual increase before the DE reform, had a similar abrupt increase in 2014 when the DE reform took place and showed different trajectories in the years after DE reform. Specifically, the passing rate in colleges located in rural areas and colleges with more White students are lower than their counterpart after the DE reform. Comparing student course passing probability change in pre- and post-policy period, students going to colleges in a rural area, with more White students, and more free/reduced lunch eligible students experienced less increase and even decreased in passing probability of college-level English by the end of the first year.
The results showed that the DE reform has little influence on the college’s passing rate trajectory for college-level math courses. The policy has a significantly different influence on cohort-based math passing rates in different colleges in the post-policy period, and students going to various colleges had different changes in math passing probabilities from pre- to post-policy period. However, institutional characteristics in this study did not capture inter-institutional differences effectively.

            <DISS_para>This dissertation contributes to the intersection of public management and policy studies by examining the impacts of executive turnover on interlocal service delivery and urban sustainability. The first paper investigates how the predictability and frequency of turnover events alter the de- cision on interlocal collaboration regarding public service delivery. After proposing hypotheses on policy conflict and executive turnover, I conducted the empirical test by using the State and Local financial survey data. In the second paper, policy changes in urban sustainability are of interest. The findings of the longitudinal analysis support that while managerial turnover could weaken local engagements in sustainable development, the successors recruited externally after turnover events do initiate more sustainability programs due to the infusion of fresh ideas and skills. In addition to internal dynamics surrounding turnover events, the third paper focuses on the synergy of intergov- ernmental influences and managerial turnover, affecting the adoption of sustainable energy policy. The results of the multilevel regression model indicate that intergovernmental influences seem to be conditioned on not just policy attributes but career incentives of appointed officials. Although the widely held assumption that turnover events are averse, the key findings of this dissertation clearly inform that the outcomes of executive turnover could be either adaptive or disruptive depending on the pre- and post- turnover as well as within and outsider organizational contexts.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>	The aim of this quantitative, causal-comparative study was to examine differences in teachers’ perceptions of cooperative learning and factors influencing their implementation in the classroom. In order to assess teacher perceptions and current use of cooperative learning, the Cooperative Learning Implementation Questionnaire (CLIQ) developed by Abrami, Poulsen, and Chambers (1998) was used; it was based on the Expectancy Theory, and evaluated the teacher's expectancy of success, perceived value, and perceived cost. For this study, participants were chosen through a convenience sample. This included third, fourth, and fifth grade teachers in public schools located throughout rural and suburban school districts in Florida and Georgia. The 80 participants included, n= 34 third grade teachers, n= 23 fourth grade teachers, n= 23 fifth grade teachers. A Kruskal-Wallis (H test) was used in this study to determine if a statistically significant difference existed in CLIQ mean scores for: expectancy of success, perceived cost, perceived value, and current teaching practices between the three different groups of teachers. In this study, the results revealed no statistical significant difference, as third, fourth, and fifth grade teachers have similar perceptions of cooperative learning. Additionally, the participants had similar scores for Current Teaching Practices, H(2) = 0.31, p = 0.86, and Teacher Perceptions, H(2) = 0.27, p = 0.87. The study did reveal teachers with prior training in cooperative learning were most likely to implement it.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Single-Index models are a semiparametric tool which offer a compromise between the flexibility of a fully non-parametric model and the interpretability of a parametric model. Additionally, restricting the link function to be monotone ensures the index has a clinically relevant interpretation, with changes in the index having a monotonic relationship with changes in the predicted response. In this manuscript, we develop novel methods for a monotone single-index model with the goal of re-analyzing a mental health study regarding the onset of depressive symptoms in adolescents. In the first half, we present novel Bayesian and frequentist methodology using the Bernstein polynomial basis to represent the link function to fit a monotone single-index model for mean regression. In the second half, we extend the standard single-index model framework by including a functional predictor, along with scalar predictors, within the index and develop novel Bayesian methodology to address multiple practical challenges present in the mental health study and many other biomedical studies, such as a bounded response and heteroscedasticity. We present Bayesian methodology for a single-index model in a quantile regression setting where the link function is assumed to be monotone and bounded and the index includes both scalar and functional predictors. The practical advantages of our methodologies over existing methods are demonstrated via multiple simulation studies and through the re-analysis of the mental health study.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Obesity is a pervasive public health concern that is associated with several comorbidities like Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (Abdelaal, le Roux, &amp; Docherty, 2017; Fruh, 2017; Pi-Sunyer, 2009; Williams, Mesidor, Winters, Dubbert, &amp; Wyatt, 2015). Diet, specifically high intake of calorically dense high-fat or high-sugar foods, significantly impacts the likelihood of developing obesity (Blundell &amp; Cooling, 2000; Williams et al., 2015) and a factor which uncontestably influences diet is taste. Taste signals are channeled into circuits that a) provide information about the sensory features of a food stimulus (sensory-discriminative), b) drive or discourage intake (ingestive motivation), and c) trigger physiological reflexes (cephalic phase responses), all of which influence our dietary choices (Epstein, Carr, Lin, &amp; Fletcher, 2011; Kershaw &amp; Mattes, 2018; Kourouniotis et al., 2016; Negri et al., 2012; A. C. Spector, 2000). Nevertheless, the relationship between obesity and taste has not been fully elucidated. One of the most fundamental processes of any sensory system, including taste, is the detection of the stimulus. Research on the impact of obesity on taste detection in humans is largely inconsistent with some studies finding higher (Kindleysides et al., 2017; Overberg, Hummel, Krude, &amp; Wiegand, 2012; Park et al., 2015; Tucker, Edlinger, Craig, &amp; Mattes, 2014), some lower (Hardikar, Höchenberger, Villringer, &amp; Ohla, 2017; Pasquet, Frelut, Simmen, Hladik, &amp; Monneuse, 2007), and others no differences (Asano et al., 2016; Costanzo, Orellana, Nowson, Duesing, &amp; Keast, 2017; Heinze et al., 2018; Monneuse et al., 2008; Tucker, Nuessle, Garneau, Smutzer, &amp; Mattes, 2015) in sensory thresholds of obese versus lean patients to various taste stimuli. Moreover, taste detection thresholds in a rodent model of obesity for which factors like diet exposure, stimulus experience, and long-term test conditions can be controlled have yet to be examined. Historically, the assessment of a sensory system at the limens of sensitivity, coupled with experimental manipulations, has been exceptionally effective in discerning the contribution of sites along the gustatory neural axis to taste function, especially in animal models (Bales, Schier, Blonde, &amp; Spector, 2015; Blonde, Bales, &amp; Spector, 2015; Laugerette et al., 2005; Sun, Yan, Sun, Song, &amp; Yan, 2017).
While there are few nonsurgical treatment options for morbid obesity, bariatric surgery, such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), reliably induces substantial weight loss that is maintained long-term via a complex of physiological and behavioral postoperative mechanisms (Lutz &amp; Bueter, 2014; Pournaras &amp; le Roux, 2009; L. Sjöström, 2013). Decreases in appetite accompanied by increased satiation, altered concentrations of postprandial gut hormones, and progressive changes in diet choice and preference are among the postsurgical outcomes hypothesized to promote the long-term success of this surgery (le Roux &amp; Bueter, 2014; Lutz &amp; Bueter, 2014; Miras &amp; Le Roux, 2010; L. Sjöström, 2013; Lars Sjöström et al., 2004; Zoon et al., 2018). Research on the changes in intake and choice induced by RYGB has focused primarily on processes related to motivation, reward, and post-ingestive consequences, while very few studies have examined the impact of this surgery and of diet on post-surgical taste sensitivity. Of the few studies that have measured taste sensitivity in humans (M. Bueter et al., 2011; Burge, Schaumburg, Choban, DiSilvestro, &amp; Flancbaum, 1995; El Labban, Safadi, &amp; Olabi, 2016; Holinski, Menenakos, Haber, Olze, &amp; Ordemann, 2015; Scruggs, Buffington, &amp; Cowan, 1994), there is little agreement. Much of this inconsistency may be due to methodological differences across studies and limited control over environmental factors that are endemic in human-subjects research and can be influential on these outcomes (M. B. Livingstone, 1995; Schoeller, 1995). Thus, whether RYGB has effects on sensory-discriminative taste function remains an open issue.
Chapter 2 focuses on the influence of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery on ingestive motivation domain of taste function. Licking response to, caloric intake of, and preference (vs. water) for sucrose and glucose solutions were measured in female rats with and without RYGB. The rats did not display differences in concentration-dependent licking to sucrose or glucose when these stimuli were presented in brief access (10 s) trials. This effect was maintained even after significant home-cage stimulus experience, and after a marked decrease in fluid and caloric intake and preference for high concentrations to these sugars.  These data suggest that reported changes in post-surgical diet preferences may not be attributable to a change in motivational potency of the taste of sugars in female rats. In Chapter 3, tastes sensitivity was assessed again to determine the influence of RYGB on detection thresholds in female rats maintained on 3 diet conditions. Again, there was no effect of RYGB on threshold concentration for NaCl or sucrose when rats are maintained on chow diet, but RYGB was associated with a decrease in NaCl threshold in rats maintained on a high-fat diet. These data support that RYGB does not influence sensory-discriminative taste function but may interact with diet to influence changes in some taste sensitivity. Further, these data compliment the results found in Chapter 2 and together, suggest that taste function may not be a primary factor in reported changes in diet choice or preference following RYGB. Finally, because the vast majority of RYGB patients are women (H. Buchwald, Buchwald, &amp; McGlennon, 2014; Henry Buchwald et al., 2004; Kizy et al., 2017), but the bariatric rodent model literature is largely based on male animals, our surgical experiments were conducted on female rats.
	Male rats were also included in the experiments conducted in Chapter 3 to determine the effects of fat exposure on taste detection and microstructural patterns of licking. Here, there was no diet-specific differences in taste thresholds for NaCl or sucrose; however, males maintained on high-fat diet expressed attenuated licking responses that traditionally reflect stimulus palatability. 
These experiments are the first to directly assess sensory-discriminative taste function in these diet and surgical contexts. Collectively, these data reveal that reported RYGB-induced changes in food preference and related ingestive behaviors do not rely heavily on taste sensitivity as surgery alone does not inherently drive changes in the sensory-discriminative domain of taste function. Additionally, fat content of a diet does not interact with detection thresholds in male rats but does have some influence on hedonic responding to palatable stimuli, suggesting a potential association between diet and reward processing or facets of the motivational domain of gustatory function.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>        The African immigrant population in the U.S. has roughly doubled every year since 1970 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2014). The increase in African immigrant families in the U.S. coincides with a rise of African immigrant families interacting with U.S. institutions such as the educational and healthcare systems. African immigrant cultures may hold different values, attitudes, norms and beliefs about educational success and what makes a person emotionally well. Comparatively little is known about the cultural meaning of education, parent’s educational expectations and emotional distress among African immigrant families. One way to better understand the cultural meanings of these concepts among African immigrant families is to compare other immigrant groups present in the U.S and to look at within cultural group differences inside this population. Research is needed to explore the culture of African immigrant families in hopes of informing practice for service providers and intervention development. Thus, my overall study goal is to improve understanding of the role of culture in shaping the daily lives and experiences of educational expectations and emotional distress among African immigrant families. This goal was accomplished by conducting a two study, dissertation where both study methods complement each other.	My first study was a quantitative, secondary data analysis of the CILS dataset (Portes &amp; Rumbaut, 2006). The purpose of the first study was to determine if culture influences parent educational expectations and child emotional distress across Latin American, Asian and African immigrant families in the U.S. Family systems theory (Broderick, 1993) and self-discrepancy theory (Higgins, 1987) theoretically supported this study by explaining the regulatory nature of family systems and explaining what happens when those regulations are not met. Study participants included N = 1,308, Cuban (58.3%) and Philippine (41.7%) children of immigrants from Southern states in the U.S. Participants were on average age 13.94 years, mostly male (62.8%) and had an average GPA of 2.64. Data analyses included descriptive statistics and Ordinary Least Squares Regression. I found Philippine children experienced .587 units of emotional distress more than Cuban children. I also found significant group mean differences in the interaction of parent help with homework, and child perception of parents’ educational expectations across immigrant cultural groups. Lastly, the interaction between parent help with homework and child cultural group predicted emotional distress for Cuban and Philippine children. 
         My second study was a qualitative, primary data analysis using a narrative design (Creswell &amp; Plano Clark, 2011). The purpose of my study was to explore the cultural meaning West African immigrant families’ have about education, parent’s educational expectations and emotional distress in the U.S. This study was grounded by an explanatory models approach (Kleinman, Eisenberg, &amp; Good, 1987). Study participants included N = 22 individuals (n = 11 parent-adult child dyads). Parent participants were West African immigrants that have lived in the U.S. for at least 10 years. Adult child participants were children of immigrants with (2) West African immigrant parents that have lived in the U.S. for at least 10 years. Participants were recruited using purposive sampling (Creswell &amp; Plano Clark, 2011). There were two components to this study: (1) Semi-structured, individual interviews conducted in-person, over-the-phone, or video conference; and (2) a survey packet with informed consent and demographic questions. Data analyses included using a phenomenological coding process (Creswell, 2013). Demographically, most immigrant parents were female (72.7%) and on average 53.27 years. Most adult children were female (81.8%) and on average 21 years. Rich themes emerged from the data. For education, I found two themes: Education is the primary route to success, and Education is power. Two themes concerning parent’s educational expectations emerged from the data: Child’s education is parents’ security, and Child shares parent’s educational expectations. Emotional distress themes were reported following the explanatory models approach (Kleinman, Eisenberg, &amp; Good, 1978): Description of emotional distress, What causes emotional distress and Ways to handle emotional distress. Lastly, I found one theme that answered the research question: Does culture influence how adult children emotionally respond to parent’s expectations for their education? The theme was: Yes and no. 
         Overall, these studies underscored the importance of using appropriate parent educational expectations for different children of immigrants, and there is consensus that culture influences the relationship between parent’s educational expectations and emotional distress in immigrant families. Implications of this study are to inform immigrant parents, scholars, and service providers about the differences in parent’s educational expectations and child emotional distress across immigrant cultural groups. Also, the way we think of the expectation-distress relationship is fundamentally reframed for West African immigrant families.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This thesis contends that the colonial and postcolonial anthropological and ethnomusicological disciplines promoted “African rhythm” and, by extension, the “African drum” as the ultimate canon of study in Africanist ethnomusicology and as the defining parameters of authenticity in African music, thus ultimately undermining the authenticness of African popular music. The direct implications of these pursuits are linked with ideas and expectations that posit African music as wholly rhythmic and different, perhaps “exotic” in some ways, creating and sustaining exaggerated notions of difference that assume that we must have influenced them when they sound like us. Everything other than the “African drums” becomes “foreign” in these essentialist pursuits. Terms like hybridity and syncretism then become useful to highlight what is different in order to credit such to Western influences. This thesis deals primarily with the implications of these ideas and situates them within the broader discourse of the usage of terms like acculturation, appropriation, hybridity, and syncretism in the study of African popular music. This thesis argues that these terms are burdened with racial and ethnic connotations that often suggest a colonizer-colonized relationship, perpetuating ideologies that sustain Western hegemony. It highlights their use as identity markers and for categorization purposes and traces their underlying political nuances, which often serve Western interests. Thus, this thesis (1) renounces the positioning of the “African” drum as a marker of authenticity in African music; (2) demystifies ideas that assume that Africans are incapable of other musical sensibilities beyond rhythmic imaginations; and (3) denounces the claim that the use of “Western” musical instruments in African popular music blurs its authenticity. This thesis’s overarching goals are to recontextualize hybridity and syncretism to celebrate African popular music’s viability and emphasize individual musicians’ role in it; promote the ingenuity, novelty, and creativity of African musicians; and reposition African popular music as authentically and indigenously African.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The modern oboist is frequently called upon to perform concertos from the Classical Era. Often, this means performing the Oboe Concerto in C; K. 314 by W.A. Mozart. Theorists and oboists alike have extensively researched the form, history, and performance practice of this work throughout the years. However, performers have paid little consideration to how Mozart</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>intended cadenzas to operate within this concerto.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The cadenza, defined as “A virtuosic passage inserted near the end of a concerto movement or aria, usually indicated by the appearance of a fermata over an inconclusive chord such as the tonic 6-4,”  may be written by the composer or improvised by the performer.  While the Barenreiter Urtext and Boosey and Hawkes editions claim one-to-one accuracy with Mozart’s original Oboe Concerto manuscript, there is no evidence of Mozart having composed original cadenzas. Consequently, the oboist is required to actively participate in the compositional process and craft their own cadenzas. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The problem oboists face as they consider cadenzas for this concerto, then, is twofold. There is inherently a high degree of subjectivity in “tasteful” cadenza composition, and modern oboists are often ill-equipped when it comes to composition in the true Classical style. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This project will seek to remove elements of subjectivity by analyzing Mozart's notated cadenzas in other concertos as well as the writings of notable pedagogues. In doing so, this project will provide a guidebook for the modern oboist seeking instruction in the composition of Classical cadenzas.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This thesis explored the general acceptance and syntactic form of a newly identified contrastive topic configuration in Peninsular Spanish—the D-construction (i). According to a recent description of the D-construction in Galician (ii) and European Portuguese (iii) in de Andrade (2018), this construction features a left-dislocated topic resumed by a characteristic d(emonstrative)-pronoun at the left edge. As part of this seminal description, de Andrade divulged diachronic/synchronic evidence of the construction in Galician and Portuguese by exploring corpus data, intuition judgments and data collected from a reading task. Overall, de Andrade (2018) offered syntactic insight about the nature of this previously overlooked construction. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In general, the current study sought to confirm whether this construction also existed in Spanish, and if so, with which syntactic properties the D-construction would manifest. Additionally, this work served to verify that the findings related to the syntactic form of the Galician/Portuguese D-construction also hold for its Spanish counterpart, while situating this unnoticed configuration within previous research of discourse notions at the left periphery in Spanish. In order to do so, a carefully designed acceptability judgment task was administered to fifteen native speakers of the Peninsular variety featuring manipulated instances of the D-construction alongside Clitic Left Dislocation (CLLD) (iv), Hanging Topic Left Dislocation (HTLD) (v) and Focus Fronting (FF) (vi)—the other available left-dislocated topic and focus configurations in Spanish (e.g., Campos &amp; Zampini 1990; Hernanz &amp; Brucart 1987; López 2009; Rivero 1978, 1980; Villalba 2000; Zagona 2002; Zubizarreta 1998). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>More specifically, this task contained instances of CLLD, HTLD, FF and the D-construction that varied in terms of (a) the category of the left-dislocate, (b) resumptive elements, (c) DP case connectivity, (d) subject-verb inversion, (e) embedding, (f) recursivity, and (g) various syntactic island constraints (wh-islands, the Complex NP constraint, relative clauses and adjunct islands). Upon viewing each experimental item, participants were instructed to rate the acceptability of each experimental item within the given discursive context on a scale of 1 very bad to 7 very good. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>As a result, a qualitative and quantitative analysis of their rating behavior on experimental items revealed that seven participants gave consistently high acceptability ratings to simple instances of the D-construction, suggesting that this construction does indeed exist in Spanish and has been previously overlooked by scholars within the field. Syntactically, the D-construction within the task permitted fronted DPs and PPs, (both with and without DP case-agreement features and/or subject-verb inversion), was non-recursive and sensitive to strong island constraints only. Based on these properties alone, the D-construction does not exactly pattern with any of the previously described left-dislocated structures in Spanish (CLLD, HTLD, FF). Therefore, the results from this task revealed, not only, that the D-construction exists in Spanish (at least for some speakers), but that it is comprised of a unique set of syntactic properties; thus sharing key similarities and differences with CLLD, HTLD, FF and its Galician/Portuguese counterparts that set it apart from these previously described constructions. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To account for these characteristics, I proposed a derivation akin to that represented in (vii), whereby both left-dislocated elements were base-generated at Spec, TopP—with the fronted DP acting as a hanging topic and its resumptive d-pronoun, like CLLD, appearing linked to a resumptive clitic within the main clause via an A'-chain. Overall, this study paved way for further analysis of this newly attested left-dislocated topic configuration in Spanish.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is an atherosclerotic condition characterized by narrowing of the arteries to the lower extremities. PAD patients experience ischemia (oxygen deprivation, or hypoxia) during activity and muscle reperfusion (oxygen restoration, or normoxia/hyperoxia) during rest. Chronic cycles of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) are thought to increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and oxidative damage, which results in a compromised metabolic myopathy in the lower legs. One of the main features of this myopathy is skeletal muscle fibrosis, contributing to limb dysfunction. Previous studies in gastrocnemius biopsies from PAD patients showed that transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1), the most potent inducer of pathological fibrosis, is increased in the vasculature of PAD patients and correlated with collagen deposition. However, the exact cellular source of TGF-β1 remained unclear. Thus, to identify the mechanisms by which chronic I/R increases the expression of TGF-β1, we conducted mechanistic studies using a novel, in vitro model of I/R by culturing primary human aortic endothelial cells (ECs) under cycles of normoxia (20% oxygen)-hypoxia (5% oxygen)-hyperoxia (30% oxygen). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Cycles of normoxia-hypoxia-hyperoxia (NHH) significantly reduced the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) compared to normoxia. ROS production, mitochondrial ROS, measured as MitoSOX fluorescence, and oxidative damage, measured as protein carbonyl content, were also significantly increased in ECs undergoing NHH cycles compared to normoxia. Furthermore, NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) mRNA and protein expression was upregulated in ECs undergoing NHH cycles relative to ECs cultured under constant normoxia. Interestingly, treatment of ECs with NOX2 siRNA to induce NOX2 knockdown (NOX2KD) led to a significant increase in ROS production compared to control, untreated ECs. This may be explained by the increased expression of NOX4 observed in NOX2KD ECs, suggesting a potential compensatory mechanism. Treatment of ECs with the mitochondrial antioxidant Mito-TEMO led to significant reductions in ROS production. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The mRNA and protein expression of the pro-fibrotic factor platelet derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB was significantly upregulated in ECs undergoing cycles of NHH compared to normoxic ECs (2.36-fold, p&lt;0.001 and 11.31 ± 1.11-fold, p&lt;0.001, respectively). Similarly, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) mRNA and protein expression was significantly upregulated in ECs undergoing NHH cycles (5.96-fold, p&lt;0.001 and 8.19 ± 0.83-fold, p&lt;0.001, respectively). In contrast, Mito-TEMPO-treated ECs demonstrated reduced mRNA expression of PDGF-BB (0.49-fold, p&lt;0.05) as well as CTGF (0.31-fold, p&lt;0.001) compared to untreated ECs. There was a significant correlation between oxidative stress with PDGF-BB and CTGF protein expression in ECs (r=0.73, p=0.04). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Furthermore, primary human arterial smooth muscle cells (SMCs) were cultured and treated with 20% media from normoxic ECs, media from ECs undergoing NHH, media from NOX2KD ECs, or media from Mito-TEMPO treated ECs. Treatment of SMCs with media from ECs undergoing NHH cycles led to significant increases in TGF-β1 mRNA (3.90 ± 0.04-fold, p&lt;0.001) and protein (5.63 ± 0.93-fold, p&lt;0.001) expression relative to SMCs treated with normoxic EC media. Addition of neutralizing antibodies against PDGF-BB and CTGF to the NHH media blunted the increases in TGF-β1 protein expression (0.40-fold, p&lt;0.001). Increases in TGF-β1 expression in SMCs were accompanied by significant increases in the synthetic SMC markers, l-caldesmon and vimentin, and decreases in the contractile SMC marker, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). Addition of neutralizing antibodies against PDGF-BB and CTGF prevented these changes in l-caldesmon, vimentin, and α-SMA. Finally, collagen I protein expression was significantly increased in SMCs treated with media from ECs undergoing NHH cycles (2.81 ± 0.56-fold, p&lt;0.001) relative to untreated, control SMCs. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this study, we have identified that cycles of NHH increase ROS production and oxidative stress in ECs, which produce the pro-fibrotic factors PDGF-BB and CTGF. EC-derived PDGF-BB and CTGF may cause SMCs to transition from a contractile to a synthetic phenotype that produces TGF-β1 and collagen. Since treatment of ECs with Mito-TEMPO reduced ROS production as well as PDGF-BB and CTGF secretion, targeting mitochondrial ROS may prove to be an effective strategy to combat fibrosis in response to I/R. Limitations to our model is the in vitro nature of the experiments, and thus our culture conditions may not reflect in vivo conditions. Future studies should also investigate these mechanisms and the effectiveness of Mito-TEMPO treatment in an in vivo model of PAD.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this treatise, I study four of Kenneth Frazelle’s piano works, Elixir, Appearances, Inventions to Marden and Wildflowers. In composing these works, Frazelle took inspiration from extramusical sources including Paul Cezanne’s artistic technique, the artworks of Brice Marden, and the wildflowers of North Carolina. Musical influences include the music of Johann Sebastian Bach, Frédéric Chopin, Robert Schumann, Aaron Copland, and Roger Sessions. More specifically, Elixir takes inspiration from the nocturnes of Chopin, infusing the nocturne genre in its compositional technique and style. Appearances is a set containing seven miniatures that feature Americana and modernist idioms. The work reflects Frazelle’s analysis of Paul Cézanne’s technical abilities as a painter. Inventions to Marden is cyclical work that expressesthe composer’s impression of Brice Marden’s paintings and drawings. I reexamine the qualities of J. S. Bach’s Inventions and how they relate to Frazelle’s own Inventions. I also explore the many allusions to art, literature, and history in the piece. Wildflowers is a set that is inspired by the visual properties of North Carolina wildflowers. In addition to examining how these flowers are symbolized in the music, I analyze how individual movements of Wildflowers achieve unity through the development of a basic musical idea. Prior to my analyses, I provide a brief biography of the composer and a historical background for each piece.

            <DISS_para>        The purpose of this study was to examine multicultural children’s choir octavos from leading music publishers in the U.S.  For the purposes of this study, the multicultural choral octavos evaluated were identified by each music publishing company.  Specifically, the following research questions were asked: (1) How many multicultural children’s choir octavos were available per music publisher? (2) What voicings were available in the multicultural children’s choir octavos? (3) Which countries and/or cultures were represented in the multicultural children’s choir octavos? (4) What languages were represented in the multicultural children’s choir octavos? (5) Which music styles were represented in the multicultural children’s choir octavos? (6) What specific instrumentation and/or orchestration was included in the multicultural children’s choir octavos? (7) Are the phonetic/pronunciation, translation, and performance/composer notes provided in the multicultural children’s choir octavos? and (8) Who were the leading composers of multicultural children’s choir octavos?  	The children’s choral octavos (N = 217) for this study were collected from 17 leading music publishing companies: Alfred Music, Heritage Music Press, Hal Leonard, Chorister’s Guild, Shawnee Press, Brilee Music, Boosey &amp; Hawkes, Carl Fisher, Pavane, Alliance, E.C. Schrimer, Excelcia, Henry Leck, Growing Grace, Hinshaw, Jubilato, and Santa Barbara.  The publishing companies were selected based on the American Choral Directors Association (ACDA) website listing of leading choral repertoire publishers at the time of the study.  Results revealed that out of the countries and/or cultures represented in this study, Africa was the most represented culture, followed by the Spanish culture.  However, a considerable amount of octavos could not be discerned from the available information provided from music publishers.  It was found that publishers were inconsistent with listing the language, music style, countries/cultures, and the culture of origin within the country/culture in the multicultural children’s choir octavos.  Conversely, there were several cultures that were represented by a single octavo (&lt;1%) and many cultures were underrepresented in the multicultural children’s choir repertoire.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In Weaver, humans are the alien invaders. In this epistolary science fiction novel, the reader learns through many documents—police reports, legal depositions, speech transcripts, and diary entries—that a human company has attempted to enslave two alien species: the Laffians stranded on a planet-wide ocean and the feline HoFe living on a bed of hofellium. Now, those same aliens have come to take control of Earth in the hopes of using the planet to safely repopulate. The question at the heart of Weaver is whether these three groups can reconcile on Earth without killing each other first—and whether they should.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Organic geochemical proxies (OGPs: δ13C, δ15N and C/N) preserved in coastal lake sediments appear to be more sensitive indicators of past storm events than traditional proxies used in paleotempestology. However, the method has not been tested in many lakes and with modern data. In this research, we measured the δ13C, δ15N and C/N values of suspended particulate organic matter (POM), along with salinities and stable isotopic compositions of water (δ18O and δ2H) from two coastal lakes in north and northwest Florida on seasonal or shorter time scales throughout a 3-year period (from May 2016 to October 2019). The time-series geochemical data not only show that geochemical properties of these lakes varied seasonally, reflecting variations in lake biological and environmental conditions, but also displayed unique variation patterns in response to large storms that caused either seawater (SW) flooding or freshwater (FW) flooding of the lakes. Our data show that SW flooding led to higher δ13C and δ15N values, with either lower or no change in the C/N ratios of the POM, generally consistent with a previously proposed conceptual model for detecting SW flooding events. The data also show that FW flooding reduces δ15N and increases the C/N values of POM, and lowers the salinity, δ18O and δ2H of lake water. These modern time-series data demonstrate the feasibility of detecting past storm events that were large enough to cause either SW or FW flooding from analysis of OGPs preserved in coastal lake sediments. Applying this understanding, we reconstructed a high-resolution proxy record of storm history from a coastal lake (Mullet Pond) in North Florida over the last 4500 years. The OGP-based storm record suggests 30 flooding events over the last 166 years, which can be matched (within the dating uncertainty) with almost all of the historic hurricanes that are known to have passed within 150 km of the Mullet Pond site in north Florida. This further confirms that OGPs preserved in coastal lake sediments may be used as reliable recorders of past storm activity. The OGP record reveals three active periods with storm frequencies near this site ≥ 15 storms/century based on both SW and FW flooding events, and two particularly quiet periods with &lt;1 or no storm event detected during the past 4500 years. The OGP-based reconstruction of storm activities suggests that storm activity peaked between 1120 Cal yr BP and 1380 Cal yr BP with storm frequencies ≥ 21 storms/century, and the peak of this active period is offset by ~300 years (due to radiocarbon age uncertainty) from the Medieval Warm Period (MWP: ~900-1300 C.E.). The active storm interval from ~990-820 Cal yr BP (960-1130 C.E.) coincides with MWP. The peak active period between 1380 and 1120 Cal yr BP in the OGP record exceeds the storm frequency in the post-1850 era, consistent with the statistical model predictions of past tropical cyclone activity based on instrumental and other proxy-reconstructed climate indices.  
We have also applied the OGP approach to a similar coastal lake the Cedar Key area in the northeastern Gulf Coast of Florida and developed a high-resolution proxy record of storm history over the last 2300 years. The OGP record reveals five active periods based on both SW and FW flooding events, with storm frequencies near this site are greater than the mean storm frequency (2.8 storms/century), and three quiet periods with &lt;1 storm/century have been detected. The OGP-based storm reconstruction suggests that storm activity peaked between -60 Cal yr BP (1890 C.E.) and 75 Cal yr BP, which is consistent with storm reconstruction from southwestern Florida and Caribbean sites, with relatively warm sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the Gulf of Mexico. The two other active storm intervals (between 290-480 Cal yr BP and 520-640 Cal yr BP, the later one roughly corresponds to MWP) at Cedar Key site between 1310 and 1660 C.E. show frequent hurricane activities, likely due to warm SSTs, that are also consistent with other proxy records from GOM sites, the North American east coast, and the Bahamas.
The results from both the study sites are generally comparable to those of other studies using different storm proxies. These results support the concept that long-term hurricane activity is cyclical and likely driven by variations in large-scale climate and oceanographic conditions.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The issue of language policies in Ukraine gained prominence in 2014 when Russia launched an armed aggression against this Eastern European country at the pretext that language rights of its Russian-speaking citizens were violated. Three language laws in particular caused outrage of the Kremlin, and all of them were related to the media. These laws include the 2016 law, “On Amendments to Certain Laws of Ukraine Concerning a Share of Musical Works in the State Language in Programs of TV and Radio Organizations,” the 2017 law, “On Amendments to Certain Laws of Ukraine Concerning the Language of Audiovisual (Electronic) Mass Media,” and the 2019 law, “On Ensuring the Functioning of the Ukrainian Language as the State Language.” While language policies in Ukraine have been studied by Ukrainian and international scholars, most of their research focused on education and public administration. Additional research of the media is necessary, recognizing their place in a modern society. Media create informed citizenry in a democracy and affect meaning-making of their consumers. They are also a part of the economic market. By regulating media, a state sets up conditions for a media system that would meet its economic, political, social, and ideological goals. Therefore, by examining language policies in media regulation, this study set out to better understand processes taking place in the society. To achieve this goal, the following research questions were posed: What were the reasons for creating policies regulating language use in the media? What were the goals of the policies? What are the results of the policies? Did the policies accomplished what they were supposed to do and why? If not, what are the alternatives? The primary theoretical foundation was in the political economy of media, which recognizes a dual nature of media in a capitalist democracy as a source of information and a profit-generating industry. Using political economy allowed for a comprehensive analysis of the studied social phenomenon. In addition, theories of media regulation were used to analyze principles applied by the Ukrainian state to govern media systems. This research also operated with the concepts of language ideologies, practices, and policies, borrowing from the fields of sociolinguistics and rhetorical theory, as well as studies of nationalism.
Methods of research included historical analysis, policy analysis, and semi-structured in-depth interviews. As Ukraine is transitioning from a totalitarian state to a capitalist democracy, historical analysis was used to study political, economic, and social factors that contributed to the development of Ukraine’s media regulation and language use. Policy analysis focused on the review of the 2016-2019 language policies affecting media and the public discourse around them. An important part of the study included interviews with Ukrainian media workers and policymakers. Interview participants reflected on the reasons, goals, results, and effectiveness of the language policies in the media, as well as their alternatives. Their thoughts provided a much-needed insiders’ perspective on media regulation in Ukraine. 
The research showed that the 2016-2019 language policies in the media were caused by a rapid transition of Ukraine from a republic in a totalitarian state with a dominant Russian culture to a capitalist democracy based on a Ukrainian nation state. Ambiguous language policies in the media allowed for an unrestricted use of any language while declaring Ukrainian the official state language, thus maintaining stability in the de facto bilingual country. Commercialization and consolidation of the media led to capturing of the media by oligarchs who favored Russian products and had cultural and business ties with Russia. When territorial integrity of Ukraine was threatened by the Russian aggression, the state tightened language policies to strengthen the country’s national identity. Thus, the goals of the language policies in the media were to secure the dominant status of the Ukrainian language as a critical element of the nation state by opening the media market for and popularizing media content made in Ukrainian and/or in Ukraine. These goals were partially achieved as Ukrainian became more prominent in the media, but reforms are slowed down by the resistance of large media owners. Russian aggression essentially ruled out alternatives to current media policies. Considering the success of media quotas and the current government’s commitment to language policies despite lobbying efforts of the oligarchs, the language provisions in the media regulations analyzed will likely endure.
Based on the research findings, recommendations for policymakers and media workers include continued support to the policies, focus on localism and public media, open discussion of language ideologies, and protection of journalism.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The critical analysis of race often has been considered the domain of fields like history, sociology, and ethnic studies, yet African American literature has always been fertile ground for the examination of race and whiteness, defined here as the structures and practices of racism, white supremacy and inequality that often define racialized experiences. Especially in the early part of the 21st century, the treatment of an intersectional inquiry between whiteness and literature, within the context of the African American Literary tradition and the American literature classroom, deserves additional attention in an effort to reveal how authors of fiction written during this era interrogate the changing dynamics of race and oppression in a post-race world. African American fiction then becomes an important venue for the interrogation of dynamic systems that maintain structural racism by providing critical distance for the reader. Select texts present as case study opportunities for the exploration of how African American literature can serve as a conduit for understanding how whiteness is operationalized and how readers can gain critical racial literacy skills through engaged analysis of these and similar texts. Whiteness in action becomes observable through the analysis of works from contemporary black-identifying authors like Edward P. Jones, Paul Beatty, and Toni Morrison, all of whom explore concepts like white anxiety, white invisibility, white privilege and white supremacy in a post-civil rights age. The use of a curated African American literature curriculum is proposed to offer pedagogical strategies to overcome whiteness. Centering critical whiteness theory and its application to African American literature functions as a tool for an activist-oriented, engaged racial critique poised to combat these structures in the present. The classroom serves as the contact zone where conversations about whiteness with both Black and non-Black readers can occur naturally and form conscious critiques of existing systems in a way that spurs readers to actively dismantle structural racism.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>While social media and the internet have become popular platforms in information dissemination amid the proliferation of using social media networks, they simultaneously lead to quick spreads of fake news and misinformation. Especially, the openness of the internet has had severe repercussions for fake news even though its positive function cannot be ignored. Further, it is notable that spreading of misinformation may produce irrevocable and appalling results towards many arbitrary users in a very short time. Thus, minimizing the damages of fake news by accurately detecting them becomes the essential challenges facing this generation. Some state-of-the-art models based on linear models such as count-based methods were proposed after many people recognized the importance of fake news detection, yet these models showed poor accuracy to identify fake news without error. For the reasons set forth, I newly propose a neural network-based model consisting of three layers to detect fake news; (1) It is obvious that there is a structural hierarchy in documents, provided that words are composed of letters, sentences are composed of words, and paragraphs are composed of sentences; (2) It is more plausible to adopt an attention network to increase the accuracy of detecting fake news or misinformation, taken from the fact that the same word may have different importance on individual sentences. Therefore, I hereby propose a model named HAND (Hierarchical Attention Networks for Fake News Detection) which consists of three layers of word-level, sentence-level, and paragraph-level. The experiment examined the performance of HAN and HAND models with the fake news labeled from Kaggle, which showed both models' outperformance over the classic methods and state-of-the-art approaches. By using 18,197 articles, the experiment yielded great results of 95.92%, with more detailed descriptions presented in the Experiment and Results section.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is one of the largest-served populations in the field of music therapy. The purpose of this study was to investigate and analyze presentations given at the American Music Therapy Association (AMTA) National Conference regarding autism, 7 preceding and 7 years following the definition change in the DSM (2006-2019). This content analysis looked at the different categories of presentations, as well analyzed the national presentations by key words, looking at how many presentations included (in the title or description) only ASD (n = 199), only inclusion (n = 36), or both ASD and inclusion (n = 7). Overall, presentation sessions had the highest number and Continuing Music Therapy Education courses (CMTEs) had the fewest presentations. Additionally, this content analysis sought to discover any trends in numbers of presentations based on the DSM-5 definition change of autism spectrum disorder, noting no significant trends. The results of this content analysis suggest more research as well as more presentations done at the AMTA national conferences. Approximately 40% of music therapists reported working with individuals with ASD (AMTA, 2018), suggesting that more options be available for music therapists seeking more information about ASD and inclusion.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>        The purpose of this study was to examine the potential of a digital awareness workshop with preservice art education participants to develop art curricula and instructional strategies designed to promote positive dispositions, digital awareness, and benefit students' lives on and off the internet.         My own experience with digital harassment and my students' harmful online encounters led to my research interest in this topic. After reflecting on my students' problematic digital situations and my lack of an effective response to meet their needs, I realized that the problem was not unique to my students. Digital harm is a problem faced by students across the country and around the world, and it is one that educators, parents, and policymakers should address. I also realized that the art classroom might be an excellent place to help students learn more about protecting themselves from digital harm through the development of the artist’s critical eye, the aesthetic reflection of the artist, aesthetic or intellectual puzzles, dispositional learning, and reflective art-making. This study provides suggestions for those instructors who are interested in addressing a similar topic with their students. 
         This pragmatic practitioner research founded on Noddings' ethics of care took place at a large Southern university within a Program Development for Educational and Community Contexts course with a convenience sample of eight preservice graduate students in art education. The preservice art teachers who engaged in the study completed art curricula during a multi-part classroom workshop. This curriculum included dispositional learning themes such as critical thinking, problem-solving, care, empathy, and compassion to enhance behaviors that might benefit students during digital interactions. During the workshop, participants engaged with aesthetic puzzles drawn from contemporary art, group discussions and brainstorming, lesson planning, visual-verbal reflections, and art-making.
          The data analysis results found that there is significant potential for a digital awareness workshop to influence preservice art teachers to utilize dispositional themes as they develop art lesson plans and instructional strategies to benefit students' lives on and off digital platforms. During interviews, before the start of the research, participants unanimously agreed they had not thought about the need to address digital awareness when teaching art. The majority of participants successfully created a curriculum that connected artists, dispositions, and art-making with the development of digital awareness skills. Although some participants had difficulty making connections to the various lesson elements in their curriculum, all exhibited an understanding of how dispositional learning could address digital awareness through their visual and verbal reflections or during interviews that took place at mid-term and following the digital awareness workshop. Beyond the practical suggestions offered by this study, the digital awareness workshop presents a model for the field of art education to consider: the use of dispositional learning themes and aesthetic puzzles can be powerful tools for addressing big ideas that are important in life. 
         There continues to be a clear and present need for preservice teachers to explore the ideas surrounding digital awareness and how activities in the art room can benefit students as they move through their connected lives. While digital needs and interactions will change over time, creating an art program with a digital awareness component should be considered by all—K-12, college, or community educators—who focus on social justice since digital life with its global connections as well as positive and negative interactions, are a daily part of students' lives from a young age. It is hoped that the findings from this study can be used by other experienced or preservice teachers as well as university instructors who are interested in addressing similar topics with their students.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Developing functional inorganic nanocrystals for biomedical uses, such as cellular labeling, bio-imaging and optical sensing, has attracted great momentum and many activities in both academia and industry over the past two decades. Many efforts were made starting from the choice of appropriate nanoparticles (NPs) that provide desired photophysical and chemical properties, tailoring the surface coating with modular organic ligands, ensuring compact size and biocompatibility, to finally realizing their bio-applications. The aim of this dissertation is to provide a better understanding of the synthesis and growth of inorganic NPs, to explore various surface conjugations strategies in aqueous media, and to use the control over optical features for application in biomedical sensing. The dissertation is organized into seven chapters, as follows:</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>       Chapter 1 provides basic optical, physical and chemical properties of quantum dots (QDs) and gold colloids. The synthetic chemistry and surface coating strategies are briefly introduced, with emphasis on the recent progress on ligand design. We then discuss several effective bioconjugation approaches on the particle surfaces and review representative examples of using energy transfer-based bio-nano hybrids for sensing and intracellular delivery purpose.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>       Chapter 2 first presents the exact transformation of the anhydride rings, in a poly(isobutylene-alt-maleic anhydride)  block copolymer, PIMA, upon reaction with primary amino nucleophiles. We find that the ring opening reaction occurs under mild conditions. Conversely, cyclic imide formation is promoted when the reactions are carried out at high temperatures, or the use of a protic solvent, such as methanol, or addition of thionyl chloride. Based on this work, in Chapter 3 the as-prepared multi-coordinating polymer ligands, LA-PIMA-PEG under ring-opening conditions, are then applied for coating on various gold colloids and the effectiveness of a photoligation strategy is tested. We find that photoligation on gold surfaces occurs within 1 h and consumes a fraction of ligands often required in a large amount using a conventional ligation strategy. In Chapter 4, we show that the natural swelling of polymer macromolecules on particle surfaces leaves a fraction of the lipoic acid groups in coordination free, which are targeted for activation and conjugation to other molecules, using the reliable sulfhydryl-to-maleimide reaction.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>       The next part of the dissertation shows the application of nanomaterials (e.g., QDs and AuNPs) for biosensing purpose. In Chapter 5, we exploit the use of PEGylated AuNPs, covalently coupling with dye-labelled peptides, as optical-addressed nanoprobes for detecting the activities of MMP-14 enzyme. Quantitative analyses based on a jammed Michaelis–Menten model show a slow proteolysis at interfaces and theoretical calculations within diffusion-collision framework is employed to describe the complexity and irregularity of interfacial enzymatic reactions. Furthermore, Chapter 6 presents a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based QD-peptide-dye assemblies that are able to detect the proteolytic activity of matrix metalloproteinases-14 (MMP-14) enzyme. The sensing capability is enabled by correlating the FRET efficiency changes with the alternation of donor-acceptor spatial separation, which is induced by the enzyme proteolysis on the surface-docked peptides. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>       The last part of the dissertation focuses on investigating the growth mechanisms of anisotropic gold nanorods. In Chapter 7, ex-situ TEM images indicate that the shape anisotropy is due to truncated octahedral single crystals favor the deposition of gold precursors on (111) facets and therefore present preferential growth along (100) direction. In-situ liquid-cell TEM show the complex dynamics of growth which includes oriented attachment and formation of filament structures, yielding striking aspects on the symmetry breaking at early growth stages. This emphasizes the importance of integrating nonclassical crystallization models to the traditional interpretations of how post-nucleates grow in synthetic systems.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>DDisciplinary literacy theory has become a prominent subfield in literacy education and research, and, as a result, policy and education reform have called for teachers to expand their literacy instruction from a sole emphasis on generic reading strategies toward including students’ engagement in disciplinary literacy practices. This broadening in literacy education for content area teacher development raises concerns due to major gaps in the research base supporting disciplinary literacy instruction. Specifically, little is known about how secondary history teachers select and use texts as part of their disciplinary literacy instruction. This gap is particularly important considering texts’ fundamental nature to most disciplinary knowledge production within the history discipline. The purpose of this research was to explore the relationship between two secondary history teachers’ text selections and uses and their disciplinary literacy instruction. The conceptual framework and methods were rooted in sociocultural understandings of literacy and learning as social and developmental processes mediated by diverse cultural tools and languages. The following question guided this research: What is the relationship between two secondary history teachers’ text selections and uses and their disciplinary literacy instruction? I generated data through initial interviews, exemplar texts provided by teachers used for instruction, classroom observations, teacher-made and student-made artifacts from observed lessons, and post-observation interviews. Findings from investigating two history teachers suggest three complex features of teachers’ text choices in relation to their disciplinary literacy instruction: (a) they are cultural tools, (b) they require cognitive processes, and (c) they are rooted in epistemic beliefs. In this study, teachers’ selections and uses of texts were crucial to students’ opportunities for disciplinary engagement by mediating which texts students were exposed to, how students were taught to approach texts, and how students were taught to think about texts. Findings illuminated that teachers’ selection of the “right” kinds of text was one small part of their disciplinary literacy instruction. What teachers did or did not do with texts created particular kinds of opportunities that positioned students to either obtain someone else’s history knowledge or critically produce their own history knowledge. Unique traits of teachers’ disciplinary literacy instruction, including their text selections and uses, were heavily dependent on the teacher’s experiences, values, knowledge, and beliefs and, as such, opportunity for disciplinary participation was defined and offered differently in each classroom. In addition to considering how knowledge is produced within disciplines, which has been well-established in the literacy field, this study draws attention to the ways teachers think about and participate in disciplinary work and suggests that disciplinary literacy instruction is located not only in the discipline, but significantly in teachers’ text choices. I offer a re-conceptualization of disciplinary literacy instruction for history that includes the complex mediational roles of teachers’ text selections and uses: In secondary history, disciplinary literacy instruction is shaped through teachers’ cultural, cognitive, and epistemic text selections and uses, which can provide or prevent opportunities for students to consume, evaluate, and produce historical knowledge. The findings from this study raised important questions concerning the influences of teachers’ disciplinary instruction without professional development or researcher-created intervention on students’ disciplinary literacy development. If the overall goal of disciplinary instruction is to teach students how to gain and critique knowledge, future research should focus on students’ disciplinary participation as a consequence of teachers’ text selections and uses.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study focuses on the American liberation experiences when encountering Nazi atrocities in occupied areas, concentration camps, and prisoner of war (POW) camps. While highlighting the plight of Jewish, political, military, and other individuals at the hands of Nazi Germany, this work is centrally focused on the American soldier. How were soldiers informed about Nazi atrocities? What did soldiers know about their role in liberating those under Nazi rule? Soldiers understood the Nazis were bad, but did they fully grasp the nature of Nazi atrocities against the Jews and other groups of people in Europe? I argue that while the Army prepared soldiers for combat operations, the Army did not prepare soldiers to encounter the humanitarian crisis of liberation.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>My research draws from primary sourced material including individual letters, government documents, official military records, articles from Stars and Stripes and Yank, and many other personal accounts by soldiers, leaders, and prisoners. The historiography I draw from is diverse and substantive; ranging from German passivity to Nazi crimes, American ignorance and indifference to atrocities, and personal accounts and actions by United States Army personnel.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In general, American soldiers knew the Nazis were evil and harmful to religious and individual freedom. Soldiers did not understand the unprecedented scope of Nazi atrocities committed in towns, POW camps, and concentration camps across North Africa and Europe during World War II. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Cardiomyopathies are a heterogenous group of myocardial disorders that are frequently associated with a genetic etiology. The cardiac/slow skeletal troponin C gene (TNNC1) encodes a sarcomeric protein (TNNC1) that has a central role in the Ca2+-dependent regulation of myocardial contraction and is linked to cardiomyopathy in humans. Although the genetic basis of cardiomyopathy is well documented, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the pathophysiology remain poorly defined. The overall objective of my dissertation research was to test the hypothesis that biophysical defects at the molecular level underlie the pathogenesis of rare cardiomyopathic variants in TNNC1. Studying these rare variants provides a unique opportunity to uncover new regulatory properties of TNNC1 that are essential for cardiac physiology. The findings in this dissertation also suggest novel therapeutic targets to potentially augment contractile performance in the setting of heart failure, irrespective of etiology. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para> In the first project, an integrative approach was leveraged to establish pathogenicity and an underlying molecular mechanism of a previously unreported heterozygous variant in TNNC1 identified in a newborn with sporadic cardiomyopathy. Trio whole exome sequencing revealed that this variant arose de novo and encoded an isoleucine to methionine substitution at residue 4 in the primary amino-acid sequence of TNNC1. The proband carrying the TNNC1-I4M variant displayed the clinical hallmarks of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Reconstitution of this recombinantly produced human TNNC1 mutant (cTnC-I4M) in permeabilized cardiac muscle preparations (CMPs) decreased the magnitude and rate of isometric tension generation at physiological Ca2+ concentrations. Mathematical modeling indicated that cTnC-I4M decreased the rates of cross-bridge attachment and detachment. Further, a novel interaction between the carboxy terminus of recombinantly produced human cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and regulatory N-domain of cTnC-WT was identified and cTnC-I4M exhibited tighter binding to cTnT. Solution-state spectroscopy experiments suggested that altered binding between cTnC-I4M and cTnT could be explained by changes in the overall structure and backbone dynamics of cTnC-I4M. According to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) criteria, there is strong evidence of pathogenicity for TNNC1-I4M. Together, the observations led to the proposal that the cTnT carboxy terminus directly interacts with cTnC-WT to modulate myocardial force generation by controlling the dynamic equilibrium of the three states of thin filament activity. Thus, the increased binding affinity between cTnC-I4M and cTnT is expected to shift these thin filament equilibrium states to a conformation that favors contractile impairment. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the second project, a Tnnc1 knock-in (A8V) mouse model of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) was used to determine whether TNNC1 has a direct role in regulating the kinetics of cross-bridge cycling through myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity. To address this question, permeabilized, osmotically compressed, CMPs were prepared from A8V mutant (HCM) and wild-type (Ctrl) mouse hearts and subjected to muscle mechanics experiments. Increased Ca2+ sensitivity of isometric contraction was observed for HCM CMPs, as well as WT CMPs treated with a TNNC1-targeting Ca2+sensitizer, bepridil, compared to untreated Ctrl CMPs. Furthermore, HCM CMPs and bepridil-treated Ctrl CMPs increased the rate of cross-bridge cycling and increased the magnitude of force per cross-bridge. Mathematical modeling of cross-bridge kinetics revealed that TNNC1-mediated myofilament Ca2+ sensitization, through bepridil or the A8V variant, accelerated cross-bridge cycling kinetics by promoting a faster rate of cross-bridge detachment. To ascertain the biophysical basis for such observations, small angle X-ray diffraction was used to simultaneously monitor inter-myofilament spacing and isometric tension in permeabilized, osmotically compressed, CMPs during Ca2+ activation. At submaximal Ca2+ activations, increased isometric tension was accompanied by increased inter-myofilament spacing.  Together, these observations led to the proposal that the regulatory N-domain of TNNC1 controls isometric force production by modulating the rate of cross-bridge cycling and number of force-generating cross-bridges, which may in part be mediated by changes in the inter-myofilament distance. Furthermore, these findings also provide a potential structural explanation for myocardial hypercontractility and pathophysiology of HCM in this knock-in mouse model.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the final and third project, the same Tnnc1 knock-in (A8V) mouse model of HCM was used to address a different question. Although it is well documented that sarcomeric variants associated with cardiomyopathy, including TNNC1-A8V, typically perturb the biophysical properties of the sarcomere (i.e., contractile force generation), it has been unclear whether the physical properties of cardiomyocyte nuclei are also altered. To this end, measurements of cardiomyocyte nuclear morphology were carried out on myocardial tissue sections and freshly isolated, living cardiomyocytes from the HCM mice. Cardiomyocyte nuclei from HCM mice were significantly smaller in area and volume, as well as rounder in shape compared to control mice. Interestingly, the alterations in nuclear morphology could not be explained by differences in DNA content or size of the cardiomyocytes. The HCM cardiomyocytes also revealed evidence for defective nuclear mechanics and decreased nuclear localization of TNNC1. Together, these results suggest that a mouse model of sarcomeric cardiomyopathy is associated with marked abnormalities in cardiomyocyte nuclear structure and function and point to a new role for TNNC1.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>My Time Among the Cannibals is a collection of prose poems that use absurdist techniques to address themes such as community, performance, spectacle, and commerce in late capitalism. Russell Edson, considered by many to be the godfather of American prose poetry, once referred to the prose poem as “a poetry freed from the definition of poetry, and a prose free of the necessities of fiction” (100). He saw this sort of misfit status of the form as its saving grace, a break from the work of the more traditional “self-serious poet with his terrible sense of mission, whose poems are gradually decaying into sermons of righteous anger” (99). “Beware or serious people,” he warned, “for their reality is flat.” This sense of playfulness and irreverence is what first attracted me to the form. I’ve always been drawn to the use of humor in addressing dark subject matter, so the prose poem seems like the most natural vehicle for my sensibilities. It also provides a much-needed check on certain impulses. Given my tendency to respond to events with righteous political anger, the humor typically associated with the form prevents me from hopping atop the soapbox, becoming the “self-serious poet” Edson warns about. As someone with a fairly mundane daily life, the fantastical and surrealist tendencies of the prose poem allow me to transcend the flat reality that Edson decries. I’m also attracted to the casual nature of the form. James Tate and Charles Simic, two other prominent practitioners of the prose poem, have identified it with a sense of humility. I think this humility makes the prose poem an ideal vessel for vernacular English, the language I typically choose to work with. This makes the form accessible to a wide number of readers, and this approachability can be advantageous, increasing the reader’s capacity for surprise. As Tate describes the effect of a prose poem, “You look at it and you say, Why, I thought I was just reading a paragraph or two, but, by golly, methinks I glimpsed a little sliver of eternity.” This is the effect I ultimately hope to achieve in the poems in this manuscript. 
    The manuscript’s first section, My Time Among the Cannibals, presents the type of concise narratives most commonly associated with the prose poem form, from the work of early French pioneers such as Charles Baudelaire and Max Jacob to Americans like Edson and Tate. It’s a style that has come to be closely associated (and arguably even indistinguishable from) flash fiction in recent years, and, indeed, a number of the pieces in this section have been published under the flash fiction label in journals. For what it’s worth, I’m not particularly concerned with these types of labels, but with the way the prose form seems to suit the types of narratives I’m presenting.  
The section’s title poem is indicative of the style of these narratives, with the speaker describing his experiences in a small town. The bulk of the poem is devoted to rather mundane activities like chatting with locals at the grocery store and performing karaoke with work friends at the local bar, but much like the camera panning down in the opening of David lynch’s Blue Velvet to reveal the worms wriggling beneath the peaceful surface of suburbia, the end of the poem reveals the violent nature of the citizens, cannibals who try to convince the reluctant speaker to accompany them on the occasional raid of a neighboring town. The speaker is conflicted, left attempting to reconcile the kindness they show him and the pleasant nature of his life in the town with these brutal actions. 
The speakers in the other poems find themselves similarly torn between the mundane and the brutal, with a speaker finding himself casually transformed into a human coat rack by the town sheriff in one poem, and a wealthy schoolboy learning archery on a live human target alongside watercolor and philosophy in another. My hope is that this dichotomy will be reflective of the real experiences of people in a country where you can sit in your living room and enjoy a bowl of chips while you watch footage of a man being murdered by the police followed by a commercial for laundry detergent on a television crafted by sweatshop laborers half a world away.
    Charles Simic writes that poetry that is too explicitly political leads to “propaganda,” while “a poet who ignores the world is contemptible,” their work consumed by “narcissism” (75). With these poems, I attempt to find some productive middleground between these two extremes, presenting politically charged scenarios but forgoing any explicit prescriptions. Instead, I try to present everyman narrators through whom readers can experience and contemplate these conflicted and ambiguous situations. In his analysis of the work of Franz Kafka, Albert Camus identities the fundamental characters of Absurdist work, work in which the “perpetual oscillations between the natural and extraordinary, the individual and the universal, the tragic and the everyday, the absurd and the logical, are found . . . and give [the work] its resonance and its meaning” (126). He observes the way that Kafka’s characters embody these contradictions, reacting to the extraordinary in an ordinary manner. In “an odd but obvious paradox,” he writes, “the more extraordinary the character’s adventures are, the more noticeable will be the naturalness of the story: it is in proportion to the divergence we feel between the strangeness of a man’s life and the simplicity with which that man accepts it” (125). 
The poems here belong to this Absurdist tradition and present speakers who are similarly stoic in the face of the absurd. While this is frequently a source of humor in the work, it is also an attempt to capture the sense of stoic resignation that oftentimes accompanies the working class position they occupy. Their everyman position is further amplified by a relative lack of cultural references that could date the poems. Simic writes of omitting references that are too specific from his work in an attempt to achieve an “anonymous, timeless” quality (16), and I suppose I am trying to do the same thing here, creating an environment that can stand in for any number of smalltowns in America. Of course, much of the inspiration ends up being pulled from the smalltown in Kentucky where I grew up. 
    The second section of the manuscript, The Biography of the Leitchfield Walmart Supercenter, trades the anonymous quality of the first section for explicit references to both that smalltown and the corporate behemoth at the center of its economy. By now the retail chain’s impact on the local economies of towns (particularly small towns) where it chooses to open stores is well-known, a phenomenon often referred to as “the Walmart Effect.” Charles Fishman, the author of The Wal-Mart Effect: How the World’s Most Powerful Company Really Works -- And How It’s Transforming the American Economy, writes,</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A megacorporation with sales that consistently rank it as the number-one or number-two publicly traded company in the United States and in the world, Wal-Mart has impacted wage rates, prices, and economies on a local, national, and global scale. It is arguably the world's most important privately controlled economic institution. It not only has no rivals, it actually influences the prices set by its suppliers and has often seemed impervious to challenge, let alone accountability. (6)</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>My own hometown has not been immune. By effectively driving out most other retail options (both in terms of employment and consumption), it has become the sun in the solar system of Grayson County, taking on many peculiar social aspects in the process. In addition to going there for groceries or furniture, people go there to run into old friends or acquaintances. High school kids hang out in the parking plot, a location where the homeless and travelers also sleep in their vehicles. With the poems in this section, I attempt to convey the Walmart Supercenter’s omnipresence by placing it at the center of every piece, exploring the tragicomic potential of the setting in oftentimes surreal ways that continue the narrative style established in the first section. In his book Capitalist Realism, English critic Mark Fisher writes that it’s “easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism” (1), and the speakers in these poems find it similarly impossible to think beyond the world of Walmart. The pieces range from personal in tone (the speaker and his brother debating the best way to go about spreading their grandmother’s ashes in the Walmart Supercenter) to historical (a speaker whose memories of 9/11 are tied to the Walmart Supercenter) and mythological (a reimagining of the tale of Adam and Eve where Eden has been replaced with the Walmart Supercenter).  
The most obvious antecedent for this is Joe Wenderoth’s Letters to Wendys, a collection of epistolary prose poems in which the speaker uses Wendys customer feedback cards to explore a range of confessional and philosophical tangents, humorously building the fast food chain up as a sort of Godlike presence in the process. This can be seen in a piece titled “August 19, 1996” in which the speaker fantasizes about a “Wendys life-support system” he can be hooked to in his last days, equating Wendys with the life force itself (35). While my poems in this section attempt something similar, my hope is that the more specific, local focus in many of my pieces will set my treatment of Walmart apart from his treatment of Wendys. This focus comes through not only in the references to small town Kentucky culture, but in the speaker’s dialect. The casual, conversational tone of the pieces is reinforced by the unassuming form of the prose poem, and prose’s privileged status as the vehicle for most everyday communication (the type of thing you might see in a Walmart advertisement or product review) is continually exploited, drawing the reader in with a familiar form before subverting their expectations.  
The manuscript’s third section, The Levita Dispatches, breaks from the comparatively straightforward narrative mode of the preceding sections, presenting prose poems that are considerably more collage-like in construction. In his book Postmodernism, Fredric Jameson regards “channel switching” as the “very epitome of a postmodern attention and perceptual apparatus,” describing artistic works that blend fragments from disparate genres and cultural areas to create an effect like “switching channels on a cable television set” (373). The resulting texts demand active participation from readers, challenging them to “reorganize the . . . fragments  . . . according to schemes which probably reveal more about the reading mind than the text itself” (79). The poems in this section function along these lines. While individual sentences and sentence fragments present content that still bears a tonal and imagistic resemblance to the poems in the preceding section, they do not build up to conventional narratives. Instead, they leap between disparate topics in a surrealist manner, relying on the power of suggestion and juxtaposition. The ellipses that separate these fragments serve as a sort of visual stand-in for the noise that might mark the switching of channels or stations. 
The section takes its name from the Levita Township, a small cult that existed near my hometown while I was growing up. Information about the insular world of the group was scarce, leaking out in mysterious fragments that took on new life in the conversations of those of us on the outside. My hope is that the pieces of these fragmented poems will serve a similar function, intriguing readers enough to fill in the gaps with their own speculations.
In his essay “The New Sentence,” Ron Silliman describes a type or prose poetry in which the sentence relates to the paragraph in the same way the line relates to the stanza in more traditional poetry, occupying a function that’s more rhythmic than typical prose. Rather than all of the sentences in a paragraph serving the same theme or subject (the way they would in fiction), the sentences resolve themselves “at the level of the sentence” (394), standing as self-contained units that can then be set into play with one another at the paragraph level. Silliman’s own work in The Alphabet models this, stitiching together everything from sex jokes to political musings to create collage portraits of contemporary American life. The work of fellow L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poet Lyn Hejinian finds her using disjointed prose poetry to similar ends. 
My own poems in this section function in a similar manner, with particular attention being paid to the sentence. Sentences like “. . . conspiratorial chatter in the bleachers of the annual softball game between Team Space Camp and Team Bible Camp . . . ” and “. . . in the made-for-TV movie chronicling my childhood near-death experience and subsequent visitation of Heaven, something endearing in the obviousness of the mother’s wig. . . ” suggest the types of surreal narratives found in the preceding sections when taken on their own, but when placed alongside one another in the same poem they converse in new rhythmic and tonal ways. In addition to the aforementioned L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets, the poems are heavily influenced by the montage theory of Soviet director and film theorist Sergei Eisenstein. He writes of images as “montage phrases,” describing the way “[t]he simple combination of two or three details of a material kind yields a perfectly finished representation of another kind -- psychological” (32). These poems aim to produce details sharp enough to take on this suggestive power when combined, generating a cumulative psychological effect different than that produced by more traditional narrative poetry.
The manuscript’s fourth and final section, Against the Confederate Living, was the result of feedback from my dissertation co-director, Dr. David Kirby. After reading an earlier draft of the manuscript, Kirby suggested I bookend the manuscript with poems that allowed the reader to enter and depart the cannibalistic world suggested by the manuscript’s title. I restructured the opening section with this in mind, cutting a number of poems and moving the collection’s title poem to the front to serve as a clear introduction. The poems pulled from the first section were then used to create the fourth. My hope is that the brief return to the more traditional narratives of the opening section will give the reader a sense of grounding and resolution by the collection’s end. I also think this new distribution of the poems creates a greater sense of balance and more comfortable pacing for the reader, with shorter sections buttressing the longer Levita section. 
While the poems in the first section utilized a variety of points-of-view, anticipating the frequent shifts in voice that would characterize the third section, the poems in the fourth section are all written in the first-person, lending them a more intimate tone. The title poem opens the section with what I hope is an obvious play on the title of Robert Lowell’s landmark collection For the Union Dead, evoking both the southern landscape that most of these poems take place in and the sense of tension that the speaker feels toward it. The poem serves as a sort of microcosm of the entire collection, combining humor and resignation, working class concerns and art history, irreverence and sincerity. This tonal mixture anticipates the poems that follow. Poems like “Legacy,” in which the speaker recounts a job that requires him to bang his head against various objects, or “Poem,” in which a naive speaker marvels at the beauty of his own simple thoughts, indulge in ridiculous humor while still sincerely touching on themes of frustration and wonder. Poems like “The Other People” and “Everybody Knows This is Nowhere” deal with incredibly dark subject matter (in this case, public executions) while still finding some light and humanity in depictions of the simple pleasures of sharing time with family or having a drink. The dark themes are further balanced by a poem like “Our Anniversary,” an unabashed love poem that still operates within the absurd realm of the other pieces. 
The collection ends with “Leitchfield by Lamplight,” a poem in which the speaker finds that every business in his small town has been turned into a church. This casual transformation suggests the possibility of the sacred in the mundane, a possibility that poetry, at its best, can reveal, and one that all of these poems are, in their way, working toward. The poem ends with a character pressing their ear against an inanimate object (an ax) as if it is about to speak. I like to think that somewhere in the infinite possibility of the white space following the text’s end, it does. 
 My hope is that, while the general surrealism and dark humor that pervades the content of all four sections will provide the manuscript with a sense of cohesion, the formal shifts between sections will also create an engaging arc, charting the progress of the prose poem form from its most recognizable narrative application to a more experimental application and back. Though the work seeks to avoid becoming didactic, I hope that the third section in particular offers a substantial response to the political tensions introduced in the others through its encouragement of active participation. In The Art of Recklessness, Dean Young writes, “Art’s great obligation is to its own liberty, and by demonstration, the realization of ours” (36), and I would ultimately like for this work to transfer some sense of creative empowerment to readers in this manner.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Stress is a prevalent and concerning reality for families, and when stressors are long lasting or severe, they can lead to a crisis. The ABC-X Model of Family Stress proposes that experienced stressors lead to family outcomes of bonadaptivity, adaptivity, or maladaptivity (crisis) based on family resources and perceptions of the stressor. These two factors act as mediators of the impact of experienced stressors and affect how a family responds. Attachment Theory suggests the relationship between parents and adolescents can determine how both respond to one another under stress. Physiological theories suggest that stressors affect the mind and body in ways that lead to either poor responses or prosocial responses. The study aims were to test the ABC-X Model of Family Stress by 1) a double mediation of the relationship between experienced stressors and family functioning using the mediators of parent-adolescent relationship quality and stress perceptions, and 2) to test parent and adolescent relationship quality reports in a dyadic model with a Common Fate Model design. Using an archival secondary data set from the LONGSCAN study, these aims were tested on a sample of 769 families. Results of the model for hypothesis 1  showed that both mediation paths were significant, while the direct effect between experienced stressors and family functioning, while previously significant, was no longer significant when the mediators were added to the model, indicating mediation of both variables. Hypothesis 2 was also supported with results showing that parent and adolescent reports were both significant on the latent variable of relationship quality. These findings support the ABC-X Model of Family Stress and highlight how the family resource of parent-adolescent relationship quality is a significant factor in how families respond to stress. Clinical implications include family level interventions, especially those focused on improving attachment and relationship quality, and improving  stress perception through physiological and neurological awareness.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Since natural resource issues, such as the changes in species habitat due to drought or sea level rise, are occurring at larger scales, it is challenging for a single entity to govern them independently. As a result, large scale collaboratives focus on bringing scientists, resource managers, and organizations together to address complex issues that cross multiple jurisdictional boundaries. The influence of scaling up these collaborative arrangements remains an underdeveloped topic. Moreover, some of these collaborative arrangements are producing knowledge to connect resource managers with the applied scientific information and tools to improve decision making and planning throughout a region. Far less attention has been given to understanding how scale influence collaborative arrangements that co-produce knowledge or the factors that influence the process and its implications on management. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation explores how collaborative groups co-produced knowledge at the landscape scale to address challenges surrounding natural resource management. Each of the chapters ask the following research question: 1) How do collaborative arrangements co-produce scientific knowledge at the landscape scale? 2) To what extent and how does the co-production of knowledge in collaborative groups lead to learning? 3) To what extent and how does the knowledge co-produced in large-scale collaborative groups influence actors responsible for the implementation of natural resource management? The study uses a qualitative cross comparison case study, the Landscape Conservation Cooperative (LCC) Network. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The results provide empirical support and further conceptualizes critical aspects of knowledge co -production. The process and implementation of the co-producing scientific knowledge supports collectively addressing socio-ecological conservation challenges presented at the landscape scale. Additionally, the findings highlight how the shared knowledge throughout the co-production process results in learning changes and outcomes. The work increases our understanding of the extent to which and how co-produced science is used to support planning and decision making in natural resource management, while adding to the broader body of knowledge on collaborative governance at the landscape scales.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Interest in understanding cohabiting relationships has increased with the rapidly increasing rates of cohabiters in the United States.  Despite a large amount of research, little is known about the sexual frequency of women in cohabiting relationships, and how these compare to experiences of women who are married.  Studies that do focus on the sexual frequency of cohabiting women tend to look at a singular time point, and very few studies have looked at cohabitation over relationship duration.  At the same time these changes are occurring for cohabitation, marriage is transitioning.  Rates of marriage are decreasing, and the age of first marriages is increasing.  The meaning of marriage is in transition; though marriage used to be a stepping-stone in the life course, it has become more of an ultimate achievement.  More married couples are sharing housework, childcare, and income generation than in decades prior.  Using two nationally representative data sets--the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), and the Integrated Fertility Survey Series (IFSS), Series 7, this dissertation focuses on two major areas of sexual frequency differences.  Chapter 4 addresses the sexual frequency differences between cohabiting and married women, and sexual frequency over relationship duration.  To address changes across decades, Chapter 5 adds to the study an analysis of the differences between these two relationship types over historical time.  Drawing on the literatures on gender inequality and life course perspective, I argue that relationship type (married versus cohabiting) impacts the sexual frequency of women, independent of other relationship characteristics.  Results from Ordinary Least Squares Regression analysis of data in 2013/15 found that women who cohabit experience higher rates of sexual frequency than their married counterparts, but that sexual frequency declines more rapidly for cohabiting women than for married women over relationship duration.  Results using data from 1982 to 2013/15 find the same patterns, and that the differences between cohabiting and married women’s sexual frequency have not changed over this historical time period.  These findings suggest that the social structures and norms surrounding cohabitation and marriage may have shifted, in that marital relationships are different at least with regards to sexual frequency.  This shift could be due to the social constraints that remain for cohabiting women, and suggests that while entering a relationship may be a meaningful life course transition, it is not an equivalent transition between these relationship types with regard to sexual frequency.  Notably, this may have occurred in spite of the increase in rates of cohabitation, increased social acceptability of cohabitation, and marriage becoming more egalitarian.  This could be due to the social constraints that remain for cohabiting women, and suggests that while entering a relationship may be a meaningful life course transition, it is not an equivalent transition between these relationship types with regard to sexual frequency.  Overall, these results extend the sociological literature on sexual frequency among cohabiters and married women by highlighting the differences between their experiences and the lack of change in these differences over the last 33 years.

            <DISS_para>Accumulating evidence suggests that schizophrenia is a disorder of the brain’s communication, a result of functional and structural dysconnectivities. Patients with schizophrenia exhibit irregular neuronal circuit and network activity, but the causes and consequences of such activity remain largely unknown. Inhibition of 14-3-3 proteins in the mouse brain leads to the expression of multiple schizophrenia endophenotypes. Here we investigated how 14-3-3 inhibition alters neuronal network activity in the mouse hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, key brain regions implicated in schizophrenia pathophysiology. We implanted monopolar recording electrodes in these two regions to record local field potentials both at rest and during a cognitive task. Through our assessment of band power, coherence, and phase-amplitude coupling, we found that neural oscillations in the theta and gamma frequency ranges were altered as a result of 14-3-3 dysfunction. Utilizing transgenic and viral mouse models to assess the effects of chronic and acute 14-3-3 inhibition on oscillatory activities respectively, we observed several fundamental similarities and differences between the two models. We localized viral mediated 14-3-3 protein inhibition to either the hippocampus or prefrontal cortex, allowing us to assess the individual contributions of each region to the observed changes in neural oscillations. These findings identify a novel role of 14-3-3 proteins in neural oscillations that may have implications for our understanding of schizophrenia neurobiology.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Each year, tropical cyclones (TCs) impact communities around the world by producing rainfall with devastating damage, loss of life and can contribute a non-trivial amount to climatological annual mean rainfall. The representation of TC precipitation in datasets such as reanalyses is thus crucial for both forecasting purposes and climate projections. This study quantifies the spread in TC precipitation across eight different reanalysis datasets: CFSR, ERA-20C, ERA-40, ERA5, ERA- Interim, JRA-55, MERRA-2 and NOAA-20C. TC precipitation is assigned using two TC tracking methods, manual tracking and objective tracking, via a fixed 500-km radius from each TC center. Climatological TC precipitation and TC precipitation fraction assigned using TempestExtremes is generally lower than that assigned using IBTrACS. This is due to the fewer number of TCs tracked in TempestExtremes, position differences between the best-track and reanalyses, as well as the underestimation of reanalysis TC intensity. Both methods capture the same general spatial patterns of TC precipitation and TC precipitation fraction globally. Compared to TRMM, assignment from both methods provides less annual average TC precipitation and TC precipitation fraction over most areas, with the exception of land and some ocean basins. In most basins, with the exception of the West Pacific Ocean, and most reanalyses, with the exception of MERRA-2, the systematic bias toward IBTrACS-derived TC precipitation is greatly minimized by considering TC precipitation normalized by TC density. The relative spread in TC precipitation across reanalyses is larger for TC precipitation derived from TempestExtremes than from IBTrACS, where the East Pacific Ocean has a higher relative spread than the WPAC with both tracking methods. Partitioned by Saffir-Simpson best-track intensity, the largest relative spread across reanalyses in TC precipitation is from TCs of major hurricane strength. A comparison of IBTrACS-derived extratropical phase TC precipitation in the North Atlantic shows that there is a large relative spread across the reanalyses, likely a limitation of the fixed radius method when assigning extratropical phase precipitation. Finally, a comparison of mean precipitation rate in TCs as a function of reanalysis intensity shows that the spread across reanalyses is larger for higher intensity TCs, but that the inability of reanalyses to properly represent weaker intensity TCs also contributes. Overall, TC precipitation in reanalyses is not only a function of their resolution or any TC pre-processing that is done, but also how they assimilate data and parameterize finer-scale processes.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The saliency of politics in organizational settings makes perceptions of organizational politics (POPs) an impactful organizational factor capable of eliciting psychosocial, psychological, attitudinal, and behavioral outcomes for employees at work. Despite its documented importance, there exists dissimilarity in theory and practice. Although researchers describe and theorize POPs as being volatile and fluent across time, scholars have exclusively measured POPs at a between-person level of analysis; thereby, disregarding the fundamental role personal perceptions play in day-to-day work life. The primary goal of this dissertation is to provide evidence of within-person variability in POPs and unmet motivational strivings at the daily level. A secondary goal of this dissertation is to examine the role of POPs on employees’ daily motivational strivings and, subsequent, experienced meaninglessness at work. Furthermore, this dissertation seeks to provide a better understanding of the possible arousing effects of deficient motivational strivings and experienced meaninglessness on daily political responses (i.e., political enactment, work engagement, and job withdrawal). The final goal of this dissertation is to present political skill as a personal tool alleviating unmet motivational strivings in the wake of POPs. Employing an experience sampling methodological design, utilizing 128 employees providing a total of 1023 day-level data points, multilevel modeling documents within-person variability in POPs, as well as all other substantiative variables of interest. Significant associations between POPs and all four unmet motivational strivings also were documented. Indirect effects through (and moderating effects on) two of the four unmet motivational strivings (i.e., achievement and autonomy/growth) were significant. Findings support tenants of the theory of purposeful work behavior and highlight the importance of POPs and motivational strivings at the day-to-day level.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Reading comprehension and its predictors have been extensively studied.  One predictor of reading comprehension, listening comprehension, has consistently been shown to have strong cross-sectional and longitudinal associations with reading comprehension. Previous research suggests that earlier listening comprehension is predictive of later reading comprehension; however, little research has explored the nature of this predictive relation. The present study used latent change score modeling to examine developmental relations between listening comprehension and reading comprehension in a longitudinal study from first through fourth grade. In addition to finding expected correlations between listening comprehension and reading comprehension, the results provided evidence for a direct influence of listening comprehension on the subsequent development of reading comprehension. The results did not support an opposite direct influence of reading comprehension on the subsequent development of listening comprehension. Implications of the results are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>When deciding what to write for my master’s thesis at Florida State University, I was inspired to compose a piece based on my Finnish heritage mainly because of a recent award I had received through the Finlandia Foundation. Originally, I wanted to work with Finnish folklore and create a piece filled with epic depictions of beings from mythology. However, as I continued to ponder the narrative behind the piece, I discovered that stories from the Kalevala, a compilation of epic poetry devoted to Finnish mythology that is nationally accepted as one of the most important pieces of Finnish literature, have been set to music time and time again, leaving little room to insert original ideas. This led to plenty of searching through Finnish literature, ranging from centuries ago to the present day. Ultimately, I came across Tove Jansson’s stories and became immediately enthralled. Most of her work is intended for younger children, but in doing some more in-depth research, I found this collection of short stories, The Summer Book, which is not distinctly intended for any age group. Published in 1972, the book revolves around a granddaughter, father, and grandmother who live on an island in the Gulf of Finland and their experiences. The stories being mostly unrelated, I found “Dead Calm” to be the most inspiring of them, and I immediately started my composing process. The beginning of the story centers around the observation of the sea and how unusually calm it is, leading our family to venture out to an island known as The Cairn. After some banter between the granddaughter and grandmother, they go exploring on the island and eventually discover a canyon in which they go swimming, much to the dismay of the father. Once relaxed, the granddaughter begins to climb a wooden plank wall and climbs so high that the grandmother immediately becomes worried and instructs her on how to descend. After this intense scene, they decide to relax once more, which is when our story finishes. In my piece, I represent the stillness through a single pitch that slowly grows into a massive sonority. This sonority then becomes an energetic section following the conversation between our characters, then is finished by returning to the original material.

            <DISS_para>The lectures were developed with two purposes: to introduce composers Shinuh Lee and Uzong Choe and their relatively unknown works to the public and to study their distinct compositional styles and sound philosophies by analyzing the forms and compositional techniques of the pieces presented. Accordingly, both Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 of the treatise provide accounts of the composers’ biographies, compositional styles, musical influences, and finally analyses of forms and compositional features. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The first part of the treatise focuses on Shinuh Lee’s Chorale Fantasy No. 2 ‘The Collar’ and No. 3 ‘Alleluia.’ Each work is based on the poem The Collar and Psalm 117. Following some background information on the poem, the analysis of Chorale Fantasy No. 2 focuses on the relationship of the music to the poem. Sound world of Chorale Fantasy No. 3 ‘Alleluia’ represents religious influences. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The second part of the treatise explores selected piano preludes by Uzong Choe. Each prelude was inspired and established by a distinct idea that is discussed in the section. The author focuses on how each musical idea contributes to the development in the prelude.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>While the two parts of this treatise are not directly connected thematically, the author hopes that the discussion offered in these pages will help spread awareness of and generate more interest in some of the most original 21st century Korean piano works.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This case study used activity theory to explore how members participate in Wikidata and how they organize their work. This study addresses the need to have greater understanding of knowledge curation work in a large-scale peer-curated ontology. Wikidata is a free collaborative multilingual database collecting structured data for Wikimedia projects, which was launched in October 2012. It provides a centralized location for Wikimedia projects to query data allowing easier updating of information. According to Wikidata January 2021 statistics, there are more than 92 million items and have an active base of over 26 thousand people. Two sources of data were collected and qualitatively analyzed: discussion pages and interviews. Wikidataians are a diverse international group of people who contribute and use data for tasks inside and outside Wikidata. A mixture of intrinsic and extrinsic rewards was found. Wikidataian activities include curation, community building and usage of data. Six curation activities were identified: conceptualizing the curation process, appraising objects, and ingesting objects from external sources. These activities can be mapped to the earlier stages of the DCC Curation Lifecycle Model. Community focused activities are similar to Wikipedia. Wikidata has different kinds of communities: globally with other Wikimedia projects, locally within Wikidata, Wikiprojects, and short-term communications. Wikidata also interacts with other institutions' Wikibase instances. This study adopted Preece and Shneiderman's (2009) Reader-to-Leader framework to identify roles present in Wikidata. Many Wikidataians see themselves as a contributor or collaborator. However, many have informal leadership roles. The three types of tools identified in this study are Wikimedia hosted communication; non-Wikimedia hosted communications; and bots, scripts, and other tools. As Wikidata has matured the available tools have become powerful and user-friendly. Currently, Wikidata has two categories of policies and guidelines: behavior and content. The most important norm/rule cited by Wikidatians participating in this study was to use common sense. The findings of this study can go beyond understanding how Wikidata curates knowledge and potentially inform the design of other similar online peer-production communities, scientific research institutional repositories, digital archives, and libraries. Future studies could use other methods including quantitative methods to add more data points to further triangulate the  findings. Since Wikidata connects the Wikimedia projects a study could compare research focusing on other Wikimedia projects such as Commons or Wiktionary to Wikidata. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The marine biological carbon pump is a primary control on atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations by transporting fixed organic carbon into the ocean’s interior thereby isolating it from the atmosphere, often for years to centuries. The biological pump is also the first step to long-term marine carbon sequestration through burial of carbon in sediments. Although important, much of the marine carbon cycle remains poorly constrained, especially between the lit surface and darker mesopelagic where gradients and fluxes of organic matter are largest. Here we investigate through several oceanographic process studies the connections between the physical, chemical and biological environment and the biological carbon pump. We first estimate the biologically mediate transport of carbon across a range of productivities in the California Current ecosystem and find that vertically migrating mesozooplankton may be responsible for 18 – 84% (median: 42%) of carbon export in these waters—a number far greater than previously assumed and one which has immediate ramifications for regional carbon budgets. Following this, the nutrient sources supporting vertical export in the oligotrophic Gulf of Mexico are investigated. Based on our field data alone, there was an apparent imbalance between the rate of nitrogen supply and removal in these systems with far more nitrogen being exported than supplied through vertical processes such as mixing. Through two independent modeling systems we positively identify the oligotrophic Gulf of Mexico as a net recipient of organic matter from nearby coastal environments. Due to the combination of enhanced surface currents and strong lateral gradients in organic matter concentrations, over 90% of export production in the oligotrophic Gulf of Mexico may be supported by lateral connections rather than through vertical mixing processes. 	Back in the California Current ecosystem, long term patterns in export efficiency (i.e. the fraction organic matter exported vs. produced) were investigated by merging remote sensing data products with data from Lagrangian process studies. No statistically significant trends with El Niño state were found, although there was substantial interannual variability in export efficiency. We hypothesized, and illustrated, that sea surface temperature could be a predicter of export efficiency in the California Current due the importance that regional circulation and upwelling have in modifying primary production and export efficiency. To briefly summarize: cold waters tend to be more recently upwelled than warmer waters (i.e. waters off southern California tend to warm up over time) leading them to have communities (and chemical environments, e.g. transparent exopolymers) with distinct export efficiencies. This pattern is validated through a simple Lagrangian particle model coupled to a 3D hydrodynamic ocean model.
Finally, we investigate export production along a mesoscale filament in the California Current and quantitatively assess patterns of lateral decoupling between particle production and export production. By integrated lessons learned in the prior chapters, we designed a novel particle model that includes gravitational settling, remineralization, and mesozooplankton fecal pellet production. From this model we estimate that particles were being advected nearly 100 km on average between formation and export from the euphotic zone during the lifespan of the filament. Taken together, we have found through these diverse approaches that small scale idiosyncrasies may be clues to important drivers of export production and that many first order approximations, which are adequate for global patterns, fail to capture regional patterns.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>	Throughout ancestral times, women faced significant adaptive challenges during pregnancy, and thus evolution may have selected for psychological mechanisms designed to help women prepare for birth and motherhood. Previous researchers have conceptualized such mechanisms as comprising a form of “nesting,” which may consist primarily of a tendency to be highly selective in one’s social relationships and to prepare a safe physical space for childbirth (Anderson &amp; Rutherford, 2013). The current study was aimed at replicating and extending previous evidence for nesting. Consistent with previous work, results demonstrated that pregnant women engaged in more nesting than nonpregnant women, and that degree of nesting increased across week of gestation. Among pregnant women, high levels of germ aversion and having relatively high socioeconomic status (SES) were both associated with high levels of nesting. High levels of progesterone were not responsible for observed variability in nesting. Although we measured a number of life history-related variables, none of those variables predicted nesting within pregnant women. The present work suggests that nesting is a pervasive phenomenon among pregnant women. Future directions are discussed.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>COVID-19, since its onset in December 2019, has not only sent a health shockwave to the world but has also disrupted the global economy. The unprecedented hit has been suffered majorly by the luxury industry as well. Just like for utilitarian products for which consumers have been witnessed engaging in panic purchase, shifts in consumer behavior across the world for luxury goods have also emerged, and are conjectured to prevail even when the pandemic is over. This paper aims to empirically predict luxury consumption shifts that may happen in a Post-COVID19 world, by gauging consumers’ purchase intentions for them today. In short, the purpose of the study is to provide research-backed insight into future luxury behaviors (that may surface once the pandemic is over), by investigating consumers’ current purchase intentions for them. It employs a quantitative survey procedure to examine whether these purchase intentions will tilt in favor of silent luxury or revenge consumption styles, in-store influx or online purchasing once the pandemic ends. In addition, the aforementioned phenomena are investigated for the moderating effects of ethnicity, cultural dimensions and gender (including non-binary genders and lgbtq+ community). The study findings have several pertinent corporate and managerial implications as the US$1.52 trillion luxury goods world is reimagined (Statista, 2020).Keywords: luxury consumption, silent luxury, conspicuous consumption, ethnicity, online vs. in-store, gender, Hofstede

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Every day, computer software becomes more important for the functioning of the world. The expectation causes increasing code size and complex logic. These factors unavoidably lead to more and more vulnerabilities, many of which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code or leak sensitive information. This dissertation focuses on protecting computing systems by securing complex computer programs. It includes 1) identifying and fixing software bugs, and 2) retrofitting defense mechanisms to programs for runtime protection. This is because we could not guarantee safety of a system using only one of the approach; because attackers continuously surprise us with unique vulnerabilities; they always find a new way to exploit existing vulnerabilities; and real-world concerns, such as performance, often force the system to relax defense mechanisms.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this dissertation, we first present the COIN attacks, a systematic analysis of the SGX interface attack surface. Intel SGX is a trusted execution environment (TEE) that offers hardware-based memory encryption to isolate specific application code and data in memory. COIN attacks consist of concurrency, order, input, and nested call attacks. We design an extensible framework targeting the COIN attacks and implemented the design with eight detection policies that cover many common vulnerabilities. We evaluated the system with ten open-source SGX projects and found (and reported) 52 vulnerabilities in them, including a whole SGX memory leak. The next two research studies two practical context-sensitive policies: callsite- and origin- sensitive; for Control Flow Integrity (CFI). CFI is an effective defense mechanism against the control-flow hijack attack. CFI restricts the control-flow of an application to valid execution traces. Callsite-sensitivity enforces a policy that look-back (LB) to call-stack (i.e. return addresses) while the origin-sensitivity tracks down the origin of the code pointer and uses it to verify the call target. Origin sensitivity substantially reduces the largest equivalence class (EC) sizes over the callsite-sensitivity that alone significantly reduces the average EC size. We also propose a universal quantitative metric to measure and compare the security of both context-insensitive and context-sensitive CFI systems. We design CFI-LB, a call-site sensitive CFI system featuring adaptive context sensitivity and multi-scope CFG to provide balanced security. CFI-LB is the first CFI system explicitly designed to protect the integrity of its reference monitors against race conditions. In addition, our localized concolic execution can significantly extend the dynamic CFG with low false positives. We designed OS-CFI that enforces both types of context sensitivity. The system re-purposes the bound table of MPX to securely store and retrieve origins at runtime. We piggyback SUPA, a precise static points-to algorithm, to build the origin-sensitive CFGs. We thoroughly evaluated the security and performance of the prototype with SPEC CPU2006, NGINX, and a few real-world exploits. The source code has been published in GitHub and extensively introduces new research. We also discuss two (co-lead) research projects: a record \&amp; reply mechanism to pinpoint vulnerability and a system architecture to securely execute codes in the cache protected against cold boot attack. At the end of this dissertation, we discuss our future research plan in the area of TEE and CFI.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was  to examine Georgia STEM certification requirements for schools and the resources and barriers associated with acquiring certification. This was  achieved by investigating the certification experience of a state of Georgia STEM certified school. The study aims to understand how certification decisions were made, what resources were needed, and what barriers had to be overcome in order to gain certification. The STEM school design is beneficial to students because of the cognitive development it provides in terms of mechanisms operating within the individual. Additionally, STEM certified schools emphasize the interpersonal and cultural context of development and the importance of not seeing the student as a lone learner but as a participant in joint, culturally determined problem solving exchanges with others. Learning in this manner is likely to benefit children throughout their academic careers, even if they do not choose to pursue advanced studies in a STEM field. This study is framed by the theories of social stratification and status attainment (Apple, 1996). These theories focus on the extent to which learners from varied social circumstances have access to school experiences that promote social and academic success, and in what ways achievement or failure in school affects later life chances (Rowan, 1995). 
The Stratification Theory is the three-component theory of stratification, also referred to as Weberian stratification or the three class system. The theory was developed by German sociologist Max Weber using class, status, and power as distinct model types. The sociologist created a multidimensional approach to social stratification that mirrors the relationships between power, prestige and wealth (Rudasill et al., 2018). 
This research revealed several key findings about the state STEM certification process. First, administrators, teachers, and school staff identified the surrounding community’s desires, and the will of the school’s administration as important in seeking state STEM certification. Second, the resources identified as critical to certification differed based on whether participants were administrators or teachers. Administrators indicated that having a knowledgeable and competent staff, at the school, district, and state levels as critical. They also viewed having strategies for gaining staff “buy-in,” and staff development as critical. Teachers thought that community relationships, and the proper dissemination of application process information were critical to obtaining resources, as well as certification informational sessions. Participants also stressed the importance of visiting schools that were already STEM certified. 
Lastly, there were multiple barriers associated with applying for STEM certification. Administrative participants reported lack of “buy-in” from some teachers due to the additional work required for the certification process. This required strategic delegation of assignments, and identifying staff concerns to provide the necessary professional development to resolve any teacher apprehensions. Teacher reported barriers included the need to visit STEM schools to see what STEM learning looked like. Learning how to teach students with a project-based learning focus. Also, students had to adapt to project-based learning, while teachers had to become more “hands-off” with students. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation explores the relationship of arts administrators in isolated Appalachian communities in Kentucky and Tennessee with their respective representative state arts agencies. Using the narrative inquiry methodology, I participated in interviews with both groups of arts administrators and interpreted those findings through a conceptual framework from the field of healthcare (Feldman-Stewart &amp; Brundage, 2008). This framework recognizes the breakdown of communication that sometimes occurs when one party (the doctor, or in this case, the state arts agency) holds the expertise and position of power, and the other party (the patient, or in my case, the small arts organization) lacks specialized knowledge but has first-hand experience facing the obstacle. This framework allowed me to identify and account for the divergent priorities of these two stakeholder groups. 
	Participants representing the small, isolated, rural arts organization population included four community theatres. Two are located in Kentucky and two are in Tennessee. As their state agency representatives, I also included participants from the Kentucky Arts Council and the Tennessee Arts Commission. Interviews were semi-structured and included the photo-elicitation method to stimulate deep reflection and reflective storytelling.
	I used the philosophical structure of feminist pragmatism to negotiate the space of difference between these two primary stakeholders with the final objective to inform and advise state arts agencies regarding future resources allocated to small, rural arts organizations. In a region and a time when every art dollar is hard earned and hard to come by, arts agencies cannot afford to squander them. Every dollar must be spent wisely. If State Art Agencies and small, rural arts organizations could communicate more effectively, maybe the arts sector, as a whole, would benefit. This study aims to establish the baseline that makes that possible.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to examine undergraduate ensemble musicians’ perceptions of the function of facial expression in conducting. The primary research question was: (1) What are undergraduate ensemble members’ perceptions of the function of facial expression in conducting when presented with video-only clips of conductors’ facial expressions? Additional research questions were: (2) Are there differences in the perceptions of facial expression function between choral ensemble members and instrumental ensemble members? (3) How do undergraduate ensemble members perceive the importance of conductor facial expression in rehearsal and performance?Experienced choral conductors (N = 4) made stimulus video recordings of 5 facial expression functions defined through previous research: Expressive, Positive Feedback, Negative Feedback, Modeling, and Neutrality (the lack of expression). The conductors created each of the five targeted facial expressions over 12 beats that began and ended with no expression. The conductors recorded each facial expression were three times. Audio stimuli were not a part of the creation or presentation of the final videos. Experienced choral conductors (N = 5) evaluated the intensity of the video on a 10-point scale. The final phase of the study utilized the 20 videos rated most intense for each condition and each conductor. Undergraduate ensemble musicians (N =120) from two ensemble disciplines- choral (n = 60) and instrumental (n = 60), viewed each video and manipulated sliders on a 10-point scale to indicate their perception of the presence of the five targeted facial expression functions in each video.
Statistical analysis revealed significant main effects for function, conductor, and presentation order. Participants perceived the Modeling and Expressive functions as having the highest mean intensity, while the Neutrality condition had the lowest mean intensity ratings. Statistical analysis also revealed significant interactions between conductor and function; presentation order and function; presentation order and conductor; and presentation order, function, and conductor. An analysis of participants’ scores in relation to the intended function of the stimulus video revealed that participants perceived the intended function correctly for 95.40% of Neutrality responses, 67.70% of Negative Feedback responses, 65.20% of Expressive responses, 58.30% of Positive Feedback responses, and 42.70% of Modeling responses. A general survey of participants’ perceptions of the importance of facial expression on a 10-point scale in three conditions indicated that participants perceived the Expressive function as most important (M = 7.97, SD = 1.29), followed by Feedback (M = 7.70, SD = 1.60) and Overall (M = 7.28, SD = 1.45). Participants (N = 85) offered their perceptions of facial expression in rehearsal and performance in two Free-Response opportunities. Data indicated stronger perceptions of Positive Feedback (55.95%) and Negative Feedback (54.76%) facial expressions in rehearsal. The strongest perceptions of performance facial expression were in the Expressive function (44.71%) with lesser emphasis on the Feedback function and other functions related to remembering ideas from rehearsal and being engaged and excited by the conductor’s facial expressions.
The findings of the present study suggest that facial expression does have multiple functions and ensemble musicians can perceive those functions. The effects of presentation order on these perceptions suggests that conductor facial expressions are context dependent and individualized, while still being recognizable enough for participants to successfully perceive them as differing from neutrality and to perceive both a primary function and a blend of other functions. Data suggests that undergraduate ensemble musicians perceived the Expressive function and the Positive/Negative Feedback functions as being of the most importance in rehearsal, performance, and the overall art of conducting. Future research in this area could expand the present study with conductors and ensemble musicians of different musical disciplines, ages, musical experience, and the use of audio stimuli, as well as implications for pedagogical strategies to increase conductor facility with the use of facial expression in conducting.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The field of sociology has long acknowledged the importance of social relationships. Some of the most well-known research in sociology on relationships stems from the foundational work of Durkheim (1951), who found those who were socially integrated were less likely to commit suicide than those who were socially isolated. Durkheim’s was among the first sociological studies to argue that social relationships are critical to health and wellbeing. Over the last several decades, scholars have begun to parse out casual explanations regarding social relationships and health (House, 1987; House, Landis, &amp; Umberson, 1988; Siebert, Mutran, &amp; Reitzes, 1999). Social support emerged as a key social resource protective of health, shown to be associated with adaptive behaviors, and a buffer to negative health outcomes (Cassel, 1976; Cobb, 1976). More recent sociological research has explored the relevance of social support at different phases of the life course, with a specific focus on later life (Krause, 2006; Pearlin et al., 2005) establishing older adults as proactive in managing their social network to fit their social needs (Carstensen, 1992; Rook, 2009; Streeter et al., 2019). This work acknowledges the contextual forces shaping social support (Elder, Kirkpatrick, &amp; Crosnoe, 2003; Moen &amp; Hernandez, 2009), and shows that social support changes over the life course (Antonucci &amp; Akiyama, 1987). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Despite growing attention to social support in sociological research, there are several key gaps in current scholarship that can be addressed by looking to theories and research grounded in other disciplines. Although social support is typically treated as a stable resource (Norris &amp; Kaniasty, 1996; Sarason et al., 1986), much like other resources, growing evidence suggests that social support changes throughout the life course and is likely to be influenced by important role losses and life transitions (Rook, 2009). Understanding the dynamic nature of social support is a necessary step for exploring how it serves as a resource for health. When individuals experience role losses or social losses in later life, the composition of one’s social network and frequency of interactions with others are likely to change (Antonucci et al., 2014; Antonucci &amp; Akiyama, 1987; Carstensen, 1992; Pearlin, 2010; Rook, 2009). Sociology alongside scholarship in fields such as psychology, social work, public health, and economics collectively show that role losses related to losing the ability to drive, retirement, widowhood in later life, and life are particularly likely to influence the composition, quality, and frequency of our social interactions and relationships (Chihuri et al., 2016; Lee &amp; Bakk, 2001; Powers, Bisconti, &amp; Bergeman, 2012; Wrzus, Hänel, Wagner, &amp; Neyer, 2013). Understanding the ways these kinds of life course changes relate to changes in our social relationships are critical to understanding how our health is subsequently affected. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation aims to fill gaps in sociological scholarship about changes in dynamic social resources that occur during later life. Specifically, I examine changes to structural and functional support in association with three role losses that have been shown to have important health consequences in later life – the loss of driving (Study #1), retirement (Study #2), and widowhood (Study #3) – and whether the associations between these three role losses in later life and changes in social resources vary by race, class, gender, or marital status.</DISS_para>

It wanders, because I have wandered, but as I did, it wanders with purpose. The poems roam from work to travel, from travel to home, from family to isolation, from one love to another love always taking with me the love left behind. Perhaps what all these subjects hold in common is the speaker’s tension between wanting to be unfettered yet also wanting to belong. In this collection of poems, a flush of images unfurls to immerse the reader in the speaker’s world. Many of these images arrive straight from the world of swamp, salt marsh, mountain, and hills rolling in sage brush. Still others roll down out of booze-soaked brawls in small town bars, hospital rooms, and small trucks riding the pulsing white line of cross-country travel. These places have been my primary influence while writing these poems.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Genres exist to organize and homogenize musical works into definable categories. With a knowledge of genre, musicians, audiences, and general listeners develop an understanding of musical concepts based on the similarities and differences between categorized works. This provides listeners with a set of expectations that will influence their response to new musical material. While this can help listeners gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter, works that do not follow the rules of one specific genre may be miscategorized by subjective or uninformed review of musical content. Listeners tend to first react to the aesthetic nature of music before considering the much deeper meanings and traditions behind the music: This can distort our views and create a biased and misrepresented historical outline of a genre’s development. Additionally, genres have been used to create power structures that suppress the ideas of certain peoples and cultures for the sake of maintaining “traditional” rules, which has created unequal and unbalanced representation within the canons of jazz, free jazz, and experimental music styles. If a work’s relation to these restrictive genre norms, rather than musical merit or quality, can influence its ultimate success, is genre even a necessary categorizing tool?	The purpose of my project is to apply an analysis of genre theory to saxophone works by Alex Mincek, Anthony Braxton, and Jack Wright that transcend traditional genre labels. Chapter 1 outlines genre theory and its applications within the context of contemporary musics that exhibit characteristics of multiple genres. In Chapter 2, I discuss the role that genre, criticism, and bias have played in the development and reception of jazz, free jazz, free music, and experimental music. In Chapter 3, I use this history to understand Alex Mincek, Anthony Braxton, and Jack Wright’s distinct approaches to music making and saxophone playing, and I examine how these approaches push past detrimental ideas of institutionalized genre norms to create their own musical voices. Finally, I apply these ideas in Chapter 4 to analyze and interpret Mincek’s saxophone works Ali and Karate, Braxton’s “KSZMK’2 (Opus 77D)” from his album Alto Saxophone Improvisations, 1979, and Wright’s improvisation “Untitled 1” from his album The Indeterminate Existence in order to demonstrate how an analysis that is not based in genre norms can more effectively interpret these works.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Previous studies investigating the effects of high altitude (1500 – 3500 m) exposure on energy balance demonstrate various physiological adaptations that support negative energy balance, such as increases in resting metabolic rate and reductions in energy intake and appetite. Normobaric hypoxic exposure using a hypoxic tent system at sea level may provide a more feasible alternative to induce negative energy balance than travel to high altitude. Previous studies investigating the effects of normobaric hypoxic exposure on determinants and modulators of energy balance provide conflicting results, likely due to differences in study design and methodology. The objective of this randomized, single-blind, crossover pilot study was to investigate the effects of passive (i.e., no exercise intervention), one-night normobaric hypoxic (NH) exposure on energy intake, appetite, and food preferences in healthy, normal weight individuals. We hypothesized that one-night of NH exposure would result in reduced energy intake at an acute ad libitum buffet meal and for the following 24-h, decreased appetite, and increased consumption of sweet food items compared to a one-night exposure to normobaric normoxic (NN) conditions. Participants (n = 20, age = 20 – 45 yrs, BMI = 18.5 – 24.9 kg/m2) were recruited to sleep one night (8-h) in NH conditions (~15% oxygen; achieved with nitrogen dilution, equivalent to ~2,590 m elevation) and another night (8-h) in NN conditions (control, ~20% oxygen; equivalent to ~304 m elevation) with at least a 2-wk wash-out between visits. Study visits for all female participants were scheduled within the first 7-d of their menstrual cycle. Dietary intake was monitored using an automated, self-administered 24-h dietary recall (ASA24®) on the day before, during, and after each visit. Following overnight exposure to NH or NN, participants were given access to an ad-libitum buffet-style breakfast meal designed to assess energy and macronutrient intake and food preferences. Pre-meal (0 min) and postprandial (30, 45, 60, 90, 120 min) subjective appetite ratings were obtained using visual analog scales. This thesis manuscript is an interim analysis of an ongoing study and includes 9 participants (3 males, 6 females). There were no statistically significant treatment differences in appetite, energy intake, or food preferences following the ad-libitum buffet meal. There was a trend (P = 0.11) for a greater gram weight of low-fat sweet foods consumed following NH compared to NN, but this did not coincide with an increase in caloric intake. There was a numerical, but not statistical, trend towards decreased total daily energy intake following NH compared to NN (1732 ± 532 vs. 1914 ± 507 kcal, respectively; P = 0.60). These data may inform subsequent research investigating the effects of chronic (e.g., weeks to months), consecutive overnight exposures to normobaric hypoxia to induce negative energy balance in overweight or obese individuals. Furthermore, this study may demonstrate a novel protocol to quantify food preferences in future nutritional studies. In conclusion, this interim analysis demonstrates the feasibility of measuring energy intake, appetite, and food preferences following a one-night, 8-h exposure to either normobaric hypoxia or normobaric normoxia in healthy, normal weight males and females.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Living organisms engineer complex architectures that address many of their survival needs such as strength, flexibility, self-healing properties, and the fast transport of resources. The typical starting materials are abundant and inexpensive, but yield poorly performing characteristics if produced outside of the biological context. The secret behind this synthesis paradigm is often found in structural complexity through hierarchical ordering which transforms these building blocks into useful, long-lasting architectures. Using far-from-equilibrium processes, organisms are able grow these structures that adapt to the limitations imposed by their environment, respond to external stimuli, and often readjust the basic template to address specific short- and long-term needs. To date, the physiochemical processes responsible for the growth of these architectures are not well understood and their ``magic'' appears to be uniquely innate to biological systems. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Exploration into the nontrivial extension of molecular complexity to macroscopic length scales offer profound insights into the hierarchical organization of living matter while also suggesting a novel engineering paradigm under which materials and devices are grown biomimetically far from the thermodynamic equilibrium. Inorganic microstructures called biomorphs are an ideal model system to study such approaches. Biomorphs are polycrystalline assemblies composed mostly of metal carbonates (70-90\%) with small amounts of silica (30-10\%). At the micrometer scale, they form smoothly-curved shapes such as leaf-like sheets, helices, funnels, urns, and corals. High-magnification imaging techniques reveal that they consist of thousands of metal carbonate nanorods that are coaligned in the direction of the growing structure. This dissertation focuses on the spatial self-organization across seven orders of magnitude from the attachment of nanoparticles and their transformation into the characteristic nanorods to the assembly of micrometer scale biomorphs into centimeter-sized aggregates.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Electron microscopy reveals that nanorods are absent at the active growth fronts of biomorph sheets. Instead, spherical nanoparticles are found in these newly forming regions whereas older regions display the nanorods. This self-assembled architecture does not emerge in the crystallization front but rather through a nanodot-to-nanorod transformation that occurs up to 15~min later. The main biomorph growth is driven by inclusion of nanodots from the solution to the active front and, as suggested by polarization measurements of the birefringent material, crystallographic alignment is established within 4~min or less.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Transitioning to the macrometer scale, this dissertation describes a reaction–diffusion model for sheet growth that reproduces the experimentally observed biomorph shapes. The sheet edges are logarithmic spirals caused by the propagation failure of the crystallization front. The resulting defect motion is dynamically related to nonlinear wave dynamics in subexcitable media such as the photoinhibited Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction. An expanded model includes a nematic-like director field that sets the average nanorod orientation irreversibly during crystallization. The growth front of worm-like biomorph helices also obeys logarithmic spirals, suggesting future applications of reaction–diffusion models for the simulation of three-dimensional biomorphs.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>While freely rotating Archimedean spirals do not exist in subexcitable systems, numerical simulations in this dissertation show that pinning sites can stabilize the rotating front. This finding is confirmed experimentally for biomorph systems that, around pH 11, produce both logarithmic and Archimedean spirals. The latter are pinned to globular BaCO$_3$ crystals and have a constant pitch in the range of 20 to 40~$\mu$m. Akin to screw dislocations, the Archimedean spirals consist of multiple layers of constant height, around 1~$\mu$m. Their front speeds on glass and pre-existing biomorph substrate are essentially identical. In addition, intermittently pinned fronts detach at highly curved features of the pinning site.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Biomorph sheets form at the solution–air interface and begin to move due to convection with speeds of 1–10~$\mu$m/s. Short-range interaction via capillary forces induces the formation of clusters and eventually a single, centimeter-scale aggregate. Within this pattern, biomorphs are arranged into simple chains with some branching points yielding fractal dimensions of 1.2–1.3. Importantly, crystallization continues within the aggregate and diminishes internal motion. The resulting structures are qualitatively different from those formed from solitary units and often include very large sheets connected to several biomorph units. Both aggregation and collective growth extend the hierarchical order to the centimeter scale and constitute a novel aspect of the system’s crystallization dynamics.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>For elevated pH conditions, a novel biomorph shape is observed that resembles hair strands that smoothly curl into spirals or twisting fiber ribbons. They can thicken through continuous fractal‐like branching or abrupt events in which fibers split simultaneously. Raman and energy dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy as well as optical polarization microscopy reveal that their composition is very similar to classical biomorphs. They are most abundant in the absence of glass substrates; however, if a glass surface is covered by a thin SU‐8 resin layer, their growth is observed. Photolithographically produced SU‐8 posts serve as nucleation sites and the hair‐like structures can detach these resin posts from the glass surface and reposition them due to continued growth at the hair‐resin interface. Collisions of growing biomorph sheets with SU‐8 posts result in overgrowth or a sheet-to-hair transition.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This treatise examines the practical application of the piano technique known as the Taubman Approach to one of Maurice Ravel’s most challenging works, Gaspard de la nuit. The Taubman Approach provides strategies based on physiological and biomechanical principles to overcome technical difficulties while concurrently enhancing the music-making experience. Various causes of pain and injury among pianists are discussed, including specific hand positions and motions that have proven disadvantageous and potentially harmful. Both professional and non-professional pianists can benefit from understanding concepts of healthy pianism and how the Taubman Approach relates this to a musical context.This study also investigates Ravel’s compositional style demonstrated in Gaspard de la nuit and the literary sources that inspired him to write the work. Technical challenges in each movement are categorized, analyzed and decoded in accordance with the principles of the Taubman Approach. Excerpts from other works are given to demonstrate similar situations in different contexts.
In light of the high number of injuries among musicians, my hope is that this treatise will serve as a useful resource to help other pianists and teachers learn about the Taubman Approach and its perspective on the fundamentals of healthy pianism, demonstrate its effectiveness through the practical application to Gaspard de la nuit, help prevent or provide solutions to playing-related issues, provide necessary tools to express musical ideas and interpretation in piano works regardless of their difficulties and promote a healthy lifestyle both in and outside of the practice room.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Reform-based mathematics instruction is a complex process, involving an interaction of students, content, and pedagogical approaches (Cohen &amp; Ball, 1999).  To implement such instruction, teachers not only need to have the knowledge of content, students, and pedagogy, but be able to integrate the different forms of knowledge (Davis, 2003, 2006; Lampert, 2001).  The aim of the current study was to describe how elementary teachers related aspects of mathematics content and pedagogy to student learning during collaborative lesson planning meetings.  The teachers were engaged in mathematics lesson study, which is a form of practice-based PD with substantial empirical and theoretical underpinnings for teacher learning and knowledge reorganization (Lewis et al., 2009).  While capturing how teachers interconnect aspects of their practice, my goal in this study was to characterize the potentially evolving nature of teachers’ knowledge integrations as well as to explore the role of a teacher leader involved in facilitating the lesson study process in shaping participants’ knowledge integration across lesson study planning meetings.  I conceptualized teacher knowledge integration in terms of the connections among the foci on students, mathematics content, and teaching (Murata et al., 2012), and I assumed the students’ engagement with mathematics content to be at the core of the 3D knowledge integration, with teaching positioned dynamically in relation to this core.  Moreover, I was informed by the perspective on teacher knowledge as situated in practice, mediated by talk-in-interaction (Vygotsky, 1986).  This research was a qualitative case study (Stake, 1995) of a group of four primary grade teachers and one teacher leader, who was the facilitator, participating in one lesson study cycle focused on primary-grades mathematics.  The lesson study team had four meetings to plan a research lesson focused on the topic of number decomposition.  The main data for this study included videotapes and transcripts of the four lesson planning meetings.  Other forms of data included facilitator and teacher interviews, post research lesson written reflections, videotape of the research lesson, research lesson plan, and a teacher background survey.  To answer the research questions, I used the qualitative data analysis methods (Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994).  Inductive analysis strategies (Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998), as well as the existing frameworks for facilitation of PD discussions (van Es et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2011), also informed the data analysis.  Analysis in this study revealed two broad categories of 3D knowledge integration statements, demonstrating that when participants connected aspects of teaching, students, and mathematics during collaborative lesson planning discussions, they positioned teaching either as responsive to students’ work with mathematics (i.e., responsive statements) or as impacting students’ work with mathematics (i.e., impact statements).  Given that each broad category of 3D knowledge integration statements was further organized into three sub-categories each, one of the contributions of the current study is the identification of specific teacher knowledge markers that integrate the foci of teaching, students, and mathematics.  Throughout the lesson planning meetings, participants used the 3D knowledge integration statements primarily to offer resolutions to the research lesson implementation issues and to visualize the implementation of the lesson, which suggests that these statements were used as part of conversational routines (Horn &amp; Little, 2010).  The majority of 3D knowledge integration statements, particularly where the teacher assessed, advanced, directed, and represented students’ work with mathematics, were in form of rehearsals, or portrayals of classroom interactions that included teacher or student anticipated talk, which were also identified in prior research (Horn, 2005, 2010).  There was a concentrated presence of 3D knowledge integration statements in discussions centered on anticipating students’ mathematical responses to the lesson tasks along with the identification of student-related issues and associated instructional actions.  Moreover, in the current study, discussions that involved disagreements among the participants also tended to feature a concentrated presence of 3D knowledge integration statements.  The teacher leader’s approach to facilitation of lesson study was to stand back, giving space to other participants to drive the lesson planning process and perhaps allowing teachers to begin developing a disposition towards their practice as a site for learning, which may be the first step in developing pedagogical content knowledge and analytic skills in a practice-based learning environment.  Overall, while participants seemed to adopt the student lens and curriculum developer lens during the lesson planning process, more work is needed to facilitate the development of the researcher lens (Fernandez et al., 2003).

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to investigate where pre-service and in-service music educators perceive they will learn/did learn marching, music acquisition, design, logistical, and teaching skills for marching band. This study also examined if there were differences between perceptions of where pre-service and in-service music educators perceive they will learn these skills for marching band. The participants for this study (N = 63) were pre-service (n = 25) and in-service (n = 38) music teachers from one large, southeastern public university. All pre-service teachers were undergraduate instrumental music education majors, who had not yet completed the marching band techniques course, and had participated in high school and/or college marching band. All in-service teachers had graduated with an instrumental music education degree, were currently teaching secondary band, and participated in high school and/or college marching band.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The researcher-designed surveys asked participants about 19 marching band skills divided among five categories: marching, music acquisition, design, logistical, and teaching skills. For each of the skills, participants indicated where they think they will learn/did learn the named skill, selecting from university course, marching band participation, or on your own. Results indicate pre-service teachers perceive they will acquire marching band skills primarily through university coursework while in-service teachers indicated they acquired those skills primarily on their own. The influence of marching band participation on marching band skill acquisition was relatively similar between pre-service and in-service teachers. A two independent sample 2 test was calculated to determine if there was a significant difference between pre-service and in-service responses for all 19 marching band skills. Results suggest pre-service and in-service music teachers have similar perceptions of where musical skills are learned, but differing opinions of where the non-musical skills are learned. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Along with the concepts of corporate responsibility and sustainability, corporate social responsibility (CSR) has received significant attention and has become a global trend that challenges the role of business. The purpose of this study is to examine how the fashion industry responds to public pressure in terms of sustainability by promoting its CSR commitments through CSR advertising. More specifically, the types of CSR practice, the objectives of CSR campaigns, and the ways CSR advertising is framed on social media are investigated using a content analysis. The findings from the study indicate that the fashion industry uses different strategies for CSR advertising campaigns to maintain its legitimacy in society. In addition, it provides evidence that fashion brands, overall, focus on sustainability efforts for the environment and visually communicate their CSR practices through a framework that highlights greenness and environmentally friendly messages in CSR advertising. CSR advertising is an emerging field, with a number of researchers focusing on promoting CSR efforts mainly through print magazines. However, little work has been done to analyze CSR advertising on social media. Therefore, the present study adds values to the existing literature on CSR advertising, which is important to both academic researchers and practitioners.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this study, I investigate the history and ethical implications of Christian discourses of political power, expressed through the modern phenomenon of bureaucracies. I argue that as a technical system of political power there is little in the Christian tradition at odds with bureaucratic systems but that as a mindset (Weber’s ‘Iron Cage’ of Modernity) bureaucracy is incompatible with the wider Christian tradition’s conceptions of power, political life, and humanity. I suggest some tentative ideas on how to navigate this power structure.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study is prompted by three interrelated concerns. First, I seek to add to the fields of Christian Ethics and Political Theology by expanding on and clarifying aspects of these scholarly domains. Second, I aim to address the gap in Christian Ethics regarding power and political life. Modern Christian ethics have too often reduced ethical reflection on power to its effects instead of investigating the nature of power: the how and why power is used, for good or ill. Third, the material on the primary political concern of the study, bureaucracy, is spread over several different disciplines, is relegated to minor status in many cases (especially in the humanities), and often does not receive the critical ethical attention such a ubiquitous aspect of modern life deserves.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation is an examination of two community-based theaters operating in informal and social contexts to co-create cultural change. More specifically, through performances the two theaters in question seek to build relationships between community members as well as produce differential social movements/actions. Through the co-created performances at the grassroots level, the enactment of salient cultural messaging and relationality became the overall contributing base of this dissertation. One theater is in middle Appalachia and is called Appalachian Theater; the other is located on the Gulf Coast of Florida and is called Sitting in the Shade Together Theater. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The research with both theaters was conducted, to varying degrees, through actively assisting performances, participants, and the construction of interpersonal and intimate relationships. The implications of this vulnerable transparency as a reflexive positionality led to the theorization this dissertation stands upon. The research led to a questioning of current theorizations and conceptualizations regarding how one begins to know others/self/world through relationality as a socio-cultural intimate and supportive praxis of constructivist embodiment (chapter 2). The chapter argues that planners must behaviorally adapt themselves to the lived experiences of others for the ethical integration of institutions with the everyday lives of citizens – particularly those who are oppressed and vulnerable. As an extension of this theorization, I build on and critique current theorization and conceptions of therapeutic planning (chapter 3). In this critique, I problematize the use of short-term interventions seeking to ameliorate long-standing community traumas and suggest more generative and long-term relational community building praxes. Lastly, as an examination of intensive communicative and relational performance, the last chapter provides guidance on how the two community-based theaters operate as places of asset-based community development (chapter 4). More specifically, this chapter problematizes and reformulates McKnight and Block’s (2011) conceptualization of abundance. This piece emphasizes a need to progress beyond asset-based praxes and more into generative dimensions of ‘incarnation’ (Brummans, 2011) to assist in both building relationships, as well as adjusting how relationships are experienced at the community level.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Research finds that students with specific learning disabilities have disparate academic performance, increased amounts of grade retentions, increased health and behavioral problems, and lower chance of obtaining employment or attending a four-year college (Zhao, et al., 2019; Curtis, Rabren, &amp; Reilly, 2008). These students also continue to struggle to perform at the level of their peers and continue to have poorer post-school outcomes (Theobald, Goldhaber, Gratz, &amp; Holden, 2019). Students with specific learning disabilities typically read below a basic level (Al Otaiba, Rouse, &amp; Baker, 2018). They also face unique difficulties in the classroom that increase the likelihood of high school dropout (Al Otaiba, Rouse, &amp; Baker, 2018). However, because they typically receive their instruction and services in the general education classroom, they are expected to achieve grade-level standards (Kurz, Talapatra, &amp; Roach, 2012). The purpose of this study was to understand how students with specific learning disabilities are served within a public charter school. I used a qualitative exploratory case study design to answer research questions about the school experiences of students with Specific Learning Disabilities (SLD) in grades third through fifth at Golden Charter School (GCS) during the 2019-2020 school year. I gathered student data and reviewed each student’s Individual Education Plan (IEP). I also surveyed general education teachers who had students with IEPs for SLD. I then began the interview process, interviewing the two ESE teachers, two administrators, and six general education teachers. I also interviewed eight parents. I coded the interviews to identify themes across interviews. 
The findings of this study support the idea that charter schools often do not provide services for students with disabilities who have intensive needs (Anderson, 2017). Oftentimes, charter schools discourage families from enrolling, and tend to serve a lower proportion of students with disabilities than the traditional public schools (Anderson, 2017). At GCS, students with disabilities are accepted and are served by the ESE department at the school. However, they do not serve every disability category, such as intellectual disability or emotional/behavioral disability. This is due to a more intensive level of needs and a lack of resources, which is often an issue for charter schools (McKittrick, Gill, Opalka, Tuchman, &amp; Kothari, 2019). The data gathered in this study shows that GCS does meet individual needs of students with Specific Learning Disabilities. In general, parents, teachers and administrators interviewed felt confident about the services and support provided to students with SLD. The ESE teachers did report feeling like they could be doing more for students. This is where there was tension between what was written on the IEPs and what was occurring during the school day. Exceptional Student Education and general education classroom teachers reported spending one-on-one and small group time with their students with IEPs, which was not always consistent with documentation. However, the intentions of these educators were clear: they may have felt they had limited time or resources, but they were determined to meet the needs of their students. This approach is likely what makes families feel confident in the school’s support of their children (McKittrick, Gill, Opalka, Tuchman, &amp; Kothari, 2019).</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Research on the intersectionality of exercise, motivation, barriers, functional disability, psychological factors, and CI in undergraduate college students is limited.  The aim of this dissertation was to investigate relationships between exercise behaviors, exercise motivation, barriers to exercise, functional disability, and psychological factors (i.e., anxiety, depression) amongst healthy undergraduate students and those with chronic illnesses (CI).  Exercise behaviors, motivation, and barriers were compared across health status (CI vs. healthy) and the predictive capacities of functional disability and psychological factors were evaluated.  Undergraduate students (N=200) completed online surveys (Qualtrics).  Statistical analyses performed included Hotellings T2, multiple linear regression, and multinomial logistic regression. Findings displayed no differences between health status groups on motivation, but the CI group reported significantly more barriers.  Functional disability and depression significantly positively predicted barriers to exercise for both groups.  Functional disability significantly inversely predicted physical activity (PA) for students with CIs and significantly positively predicted PA for healthy students.  Depression was found to significantly inversely predict PA for healthy students.  Anxiety displayed no effect on PA or barriers for either the healthy student or those with CIs.  Lastly, students reporting higher functional disability or depression displayed statistically increased odds of motivation from external regulation as opposed to internal regulation. Universities could use this research to implement programs aimed at increasing PA through teaching providers Motivational Interviewing (MI) techniques.  Practitioners could use Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to benefit students in changing their perceptions about barriers to exercise and functional disability.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>A substantial amount of work exists for tensor regression analysis in a variety of clinical settings, including neuroimaging, genomics, and dental medicine. Our motivation for this paper is from a study of periodontal disease (PD) with a three-dimensional tensor response: multiple biomarkers measured at pre-specified tooth sites within each tooth, for each subject. A careful investigation would reveal considerable skewness in the responses, in addition to response missingness. To mitigate the shortcomings of existing multivariate regression tools (that ignore the inherent tensor structure) and tensor normal based methods (that ignore response skewness), we propose a new Bayesian tensor response regression method that facilitates interpretation of covariate effects on both marginal and joint distributions of the tensor response, accommodating missing responses under a closure property. Furthermore, we present a prudent evaluation of the overall covariate effects, as well as identifying their possible variations on only a sparse subset of the tensor components. Our method promises MCMC tools that are readily implementable. We illustrate substantial advantages of our estimation proposal over existing methods via simulation studies and application to the PD dataset. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We propose a general class of skewed elliptical distributions for tensor responses to ensure that any linear combinations of tensor variables still follow tensor elliptical distributions. Additionally, the marginal density has the same form as the conditional density of skewed tensor elliptical distribution. Our class of skewed elliptical distributions has useful properties including the following: the class is closed under marginalization 
and includes skewed tensor normal and skewed tensor-t distributions as special cases. 
Exploiting tensor form provides multiple benefits; 1) we can use maximum information of tensor structure that cannot be employed by multivariate methods, 2) tensor covariance structure captures the dependence of each direction of tensor.
Practical applications of this new class are provided via Bayesian tensor response regression analysis with two types of prior for tensor regression coefficients: tensor normal (TN) prior, and tensor spike-and-slab lasso (TSSL) prior. We illustrate the practical advantages of TSSL prior to detecting fast decaying teeth types and sites in a periodontal disease study. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>	ABSTRACT	Students need proficient literacy skills if they are to be successful in school and in life. Students typically master foundational literacy skills in the primary grades, and their abilities continue to develop throughout middle and high school as they encounter increasingly difficult academic work. Unfortunately, a substantial percentage of students move from elementary to middle school without proficient literacy skills. When students are working below grade level, educators oftentimes “intervene” or provide an “intervention” in order to accelerate the growth of students so they can catch up with their peers. In the context of this Dissertation in Practice, the term “intervention” refers to the instruction provided for students who do not have proficient literacy skills. While there is a growing knowledge base of best practices in literacy instruction, schools have a large degree of discretion in how they organize their literacy and reading approaches. This study examines the literacy intervention programs at three middle schools with high populations of students scoring below “satisfactory” on the state assessment provided at a large suburban school district in Florida. The study explores how these intervention programs, which included instruction in intensive reading courses and in other instructional opportunities during and beyond the school day, were implemented, the challenges of providing them, and the differences in implementation across the three schools.
This is a multi-level comparative case study with data collected through interviews with assistant principals in charge of curriculum, literacy coaches (known as instructional coaches at the schools), intensive reading teachers, and English teachers at each of the three schools. I analyzed this data, along with documents related to the literacy interventions provided, to gain a clear and comprehensive picture of literacy intervention programs at the schools. In addition, I conducted a cross-case analysis to ascertain the similarities and differences in implementation.
	This study found that while the schools approached their literacy intervention programs differently, they all provided intervention to students scoring at Level 1 and Level 2 on the FSA in an intensive reading class using the purchased i-Ready curriculum or Corrective Reading, facilitated primarily by second-career teachers. Teachers reported that students were largely disengaged and discouraged. Although there was some support for intensive reading students in the form of tutoring or other opportunities for additional instruction, there was no collaboration between English teachers and intensive reading teachers in an effort to align support for students at any of the three participating schools.
	The implications of this study are relevant for district policymakers and for practitioners. District policymakers make decisions regarding the content and implementation of the literacy intervention program at the schools in their district, and practitioners at the school level carry out those policies. Given the fact that teachers adamantly voiced their frustration regarding the lack of student motivation and engagement, district leaders may consider examining the instruction in the intensive reading class to see if they can make improvements. At the practitioner level, school administrators, coaches, and teachers may wish to prioritize student motivation and engagement strategies, especially since COVID-19 has resulted in a substantial change in the way they deliver instruction. It is important that the district and schools participating in this study take steps to examine their literacy intervention programs so that students receive strong and engaging instruction that leads to improvement in their literacy skills.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In the classical literature of Statistics, a large amount of methods have been addressed for data analysis on Euclidean space. Over the past few decades, however, a growing interest has been devoted to non-Euclidean data analysis. In other words, newly collected data, extracted from a variety of new digital sensors, was unimaginable in the previous flat world of classical data analysis. Examples of such new data types include planar or 3D shapes, neuroimaging data (DTI, fMRI), and other types of medical images (CT, X-Rays). Due to the underlying geometry of the space where data lies, such complex data type can, however, not be analyzed in a Euclidean way. 
%
In order to address this comprehensively, a new research field, so-called object-oriented data analysis (OODA) has emerged in Statistics. From the OODA point of view, data objects are represented as points on nonlinear metric spaces called object spaces. In various types of object spaces where data objects naturally lie are smooth manifolds. So the focus of this dissertation is on the development of statistical methods on manifolds.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Corrosion adversely affects the performance of metal alloys that are widely used as structural materials in the automobile, naval, and aircraft industries. In this work, we present a simplified multiphase (solid, liquid, and porous interphase) nonlocal model for pitting corrosion in aluminum alloys.  I propose and solve nonlocal reaction diffusion equations that (i) explicitly account for multiple dissolved species, and (ii) enforce a nonlocal electroneutrality constraint. Initial results are presented, and shown to be qualitatively consistent with experimental observations. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para/>
            <DISS_para>I also apply the model to the one dimensional liquid junction problem, in which two electrolytic solutions of different ionic concentrations are brought into contact via a permeable membrane. Transport of ions through the membrane induces an electric field which is modeled using two separate nonlocal conditions: charge conservation and Gauss' law. We  investigate how well they satisfy the criterion of strict electroneutrality which stipulates that the net charge at each point in the domain is zero, by considering four different initial scenarios. Charge conservation and Gauss' law yield similar results for most practical scenarios in which the initial condition satisfies strict electroneutrality. However, Gauss' law has two important advantages over charge conservation: (i) it is numerically more stable and can be applied even when the concentration of all the charged species drops to zero and (ii) computationally, it is significantly cheaper.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para/>
            <DISS_para>Chemical reaction networks are often highly nonlinear, consuming most of the computational effort even for relatively small networks.  An exploration of model reduction of chemical reaction networks using sensitivity analysis is detailed.  Initial concentrations of the aluminum chemical reaction network are perturbed and the dynamics of the return to equilibrium are recorded. The sensitivity indices are used to rank the species for removal from the network. The structure of the intermediate models revealed a grouping of species into two groupings. One group contained the byproducts of aluminum corrosion, which was removed first. The other group comprising H, H_2O, and OH acts as a bridge between all species, was removed last.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para/>
            <DISS_para>Finally future work is outlined which includes expanding the simplified model to include more detailed chemical kinetics, fitting the model parameters to experimental data, and integrating my corrosion models into a larger peridynamic framework for material failure.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The work in this dissertation presents microfluidic platforms developed for the evaluation of islet function. Pancreatic islets of Langerhans release glucagon and insulin to maintain blood glucose levels, and the release of these hormones is dysregulated in diabetes mellitus. Methods developed for monitoring their secretion dynamics and investigating their interactions with peripheral tissues are of importance. To monitor glucagon secretion from a single islet, initial incorporation of an offline noncompetitive glucagon assay onto a microfluidic platform was achieved. The developed microfluidic system had several distinct features. To maintain appropriate flow rates in the presence of the high concentration of salt that was required for the assay, a piezo-actuated pressure transducer with in-line flow sensors was used to drive sample flow through 80 x 50 μm (width x depth) channels, while electroosmotic flow was used to gate the sample away from 15 x 5 μm separation channel. Flow rates tested with this system were 50 – 200 nL min-1 with relative standard deviations (RSDs) ranging from 1 – 4 %. Use of pressure-driven flow was found to increase the amounts of clogs in the system, so a method to incorporate in-line filters into the channels was developed. A total of 4 low resistance, in-line microfabricated filters were evaluated, with all designs prolonging the operation time of the microfluidic device to more than 4 hours without clogs observed. Use of this system enabled highly reproducible injections (3-6% RSD). During initial incorporation of the noncompetitive assay for glucagon, it was determined that Joule heating was problematic, and temperature measurements revealed the separation channel increased to more than 50°C during operation. A 3D-printed manifold was used to hold a Peltier cooler in place on the microfluidic device, which produced a 2.6-fold improvement in the amount of the noncovalent glucagon complex that was detected compared to without cooling. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To simulate the negative feedback of the interactions between the pancreas and the liver, a microfluidic system containing islets was coupled to a mathematical model of a liver. To measure insulin, an electrophoretic competitive immunoassay was integrated into the islets-on-a-chip system, and an online method for quantitation of secreted insulin levels was developed to enable rapid input into the liver model. The method developed for online quantitation of insulin was an automated system that extracted the peak parameters of the electropherograms that were obtained in an online electrophoretic competitive immunoassay. The methodology included automated baseline calculation and subtraction, followed by peak recognition and measurement of peak heights. The developed method showed similar B/F ratios to an offline method with 94% accuracy over 342 consecutive electropherograms. This method was able to accurately pick sample peaks even in the presence of noise or bubbles. With these methods, two different mathematical liver models were integrated into the islets-on-a-chip system. The insulin levels measured were input into the models which affected the glucose levels that were delivered to the islets. With high levels of insulin, the glucose levels delivered to the islets were decreased (negative feedback). Using this system, synchronized insulin responses were observed from groups of islets on the device, with similar patterns as found in vivo.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>It was shown that a longer oscillation period of the synchronized insulin release might be associated with the time delay (~3 min) that was inherent in the system described above. To investigate the effects of different time delays on feedback, an islets-on-a-chip system that imaged intracellular Ca2+ instead of measuring insulin was developed with the ability to control the delay time for feedback glucose delivery. An initial test of the system was performed with a 0 s time delay and resulted in oscillatory glucose and coherent Ca2+ oscillations with a period ~ 6 min, indicating successful coupling of the islets-on-a-chip to the liver model. The microfluidic system was well established and future experiments are warranted to examine effects of different time delays on islets synchronization and pulsatile insulin release.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Domenico Gabrielli’s Seven Ricercari not only represent the first exploration of the technical and musical possibilities of the cello but are also assets to modern cello pedagogy. This treatise examines the pedagogical value of these pieces. Chapter 1 provides background information on their composition; it addresses the early development of the cello and the cultural context of seventeenth-century Bologna, and it offers an overview of the musical language and pedagogical significance of the Ricercari. Chapter 2 opens the discussion of the pedagogical value of the Seven Ricercari by explaining the general approach that cellists should adopt when learning them. It then highlights benefits concerning left-hand and right-hand techniques, as well as aspects of musicality that cellists can gain. By working on these pieces, cellists of different levels can refine their fundamental skills and musicianship in preparation for their studies of more advanced works in the cello literature. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This thesis focuses on the production of medical expertise over women’s reproductive health and the normalization of biomedical interventions into women’s reproductive systems. To unpack this, I analyze the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists’ (ACOG) Long-Acting Reversible Contraception (LARC) Program for training in IUD clinical counseling and insertion. I examine the knowledge these training materials disseminate about the IUD and the reproductive body. Chapter 1 analyzes ACOG’s gynecological gaze as a resurfacing of the racialized population politics deeply embedded in the IUD. Through the shared decision-making framework, ACOG enrolls patients in the production of the reproductive biography, and this becomes a technology of power that categorizes bodies as timely (responsible) or untimely (irresponsible). I analyze the IUD insertion resulting from this categorization as the production of the uterine cyborg, in which the IUD biomedically removes the need for the mind to control reproductive subjectivity in untimely bodies. In Chapter 2, I show how ACOG training materials and biomedical discourse silence the affected body that results from IUD insertion. Pain is almost entirely left out of the LARC training materials, presenting a mythical singular experience of the IUD-uterine meld. This silences the multiplicity of IUD user’s experiences. Using my own auto-ethnographic data in addition to Reddit forum data, I establish how many women’s pained or bleeding experiences with IUDs exceed the singular idea of reproductive health constructed by biomedicine. To contrast the automated biomedical uterine cyborg, I conceptualize the Chthuluteri, a collective digital feminist cyborg of counter-knowledge.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Virtual reality (VR) is an emerging technology with an abundance of uses. While VR has been used in various fields, it has only recently become a topic of research and application in sport. As such, it has become increasingly important to develop an understanding of how this technology can be used in sport. However, within the current literature, several gaps exist. Specifically, the populations studied are largely homogenous, and little research has been conducted to examine coach and athlete attitudes toward the use of VR and its capabilities. Additionally, while VR technologies have advanced, the use of VR use may not have kept pace, leaving VR under-utilized in research and application. As such, the purpose of this study is to examine collegiate athletes’ experiences and perceptions of using VR for sport training, identify potential barriers to advancing VR in sport training, illustrate the potential shortcoming of understanding regarding the use of VR in sport training, and outline the practical implications of the use of VR in sport training. This study examined 278 NCAA athletes’ experiences and perceptions of using VR for sport training. Participants completed the Experiences and Perceptions of VR in Sport Survey that was designed for this study. Results determined that VR is seldom used for skill training among college athletes; only approximately six percent of participants had ever used VR for sport training. Results also indicated that, when comparing potential reasons for a lack of VR use, participants were significantly more likely to have never considered using VR to train mental skills. There was also a significant difference in the skills participants believed VR may be useful to train (e.g., anticipation, decision-making, movement, coping, and motivation). Moreover, the results provided insight on the 4 Ws (i.e., where, when, why, and what) of VR use for sport training. The findings of this study contribute to the growing framework of VR research and its applications in sport.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used and have an impressive performance in detecting and classifying objects. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>However, the CNN's performance is sensitive to variations in rotation, position or scaling of the objects to be detected.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Fully Convolutional Neural Networks were trained for guidewire detection and retinal vessel detection in this dissertation. We highlight what challenges are encountered during training for the guidewire detection.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We present a novel method for simultaneously detecting the guidewire pixels and predicting the guidewire orientation using trained oriented filters. We also show how to train, in the same framework, these oriented filters as steerable filters in a low rank representation.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We introduce the Spherical Quadrature Filters (SQF) for guidewire detection and show how they can be used to improve the training data.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We propose a steerable CNN that can detect an object rotated by an arbitrary angle without being rotation invariant.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The proposed steerable CNN is discriminative like a regular CNN, but it has a latent parameter representing the object's 2D orientation.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>For any value of this parameter, the steerable CNN will be sensitive to detect only objects having that orientation.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We apply the SQF, CNN and steerable CNN to detect the guidewire in fluoroscopy (real-time X-ray) images and to detect vessels in retina (fundus) images. The guidewire is a thin wire used in coronary angioplasty interventions, which are visualized using fluoroscopic images. The fundus images are noisy because of the similarity between the background and the vessels.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Experiments show that the steerable CNN outperforms the regular CNN and other popular approaches such as the Frangi filter, the Steerable Quadrature Filter and a state of the art trained classifier based on hand-crafted feature.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>In the first part of this thesis, we study the asymptotic behaviors of implied volatility of an affine jump-diffusion (AJD) model. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Let log stock price under risk-neutral measure follow an AJD model, we show that an explicit form of moment generating function for log stock price can be obtained by solving a set of ordinary differential equations. A large-time large deviation principle for log stock price is derived by applying the G\"{a}rtner-Ellis theorem. We characterize the asymptotic behaviors of the implied volatility in the large-maturity and large-strike regime using rate function in the large deviation principle. The asymptotics of the Black-Scholes implied volatility for fixed-maturity, large-strike and fixed-maturity, small-strike regimes are also studied. Numerical results are provided to validate the theoretical work.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the second part of this thesis, we study the European option pricing problem when the underlying stock follows an AJD model whose jump interarrival time has a Cox–Ingersoll–Ross type intensity dynamics.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>An analytic formula of a European option pricing is derived using the Fourier inversion transform technique.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We develop a Monte Carlo algorithm to simulate the dynamics of an AJD model.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We observe AJD At-The-Money (ATM) European option prices using the Monte Carlo simulation converge to the Fourier analytic ones as the number of simulation paths increases.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Thermoelectric technology has been treated as a candidate to convert heat into electricity and reuse the waste heat. By using the body heat, the thermoelectric generator is promising to apply to wearable devices as the power source. The organic thermoelectric materials have drawn more and more attention in such applications due to their good flexibility, low density, low toxicity, low cost, low thermal conductivity, and good processability. In contrast to conductive polymers, the thermoelectric performance of insulating polymers with better processability and lower cost is limited by the low electrical conductivity. In this dissertation, two methods, including polymer pyrolysis and transition metal-polymer coordination, which were reported to improve the electrical conductivity of some insulting polymers were studied in their effects on thermoelectric properties of insulting polymer composites. The results indicate that both these methods effectively enhance the power factor of MWCNT/PAN composites and the thermoelectric performance is comparable to that of conductive polymer composites. Through pyrolysis, a maximum power factor of 18.6 µW/mK2 was obtained from the stabilized MWCNT/PAN, which was almost 3 times higher than that of the MWCNT/PAN. Moreover, both p- and n-type properties were obtained from the pyrolyzed MWCNT/PAN. The power factor of MWCNT/PAN was also improved to 22.3 µW/mK2 through transition metal coordination. The feasibility of these methods on some other insulating polymers has been proved. With the contribution of these methods, more options are provided for the studies of flexible thermoelectric materials with better processability and lower cost.

            <DISS_para>Dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) in the surface ocean has a dual role as both the product of primary production and as a phosphorus substrate for phytoplankton when inorganic forms of phosphorus (P) are scarce. DOP has increasingly been recognized as an important source of P, especially in oligotrophic gyres, where recent modeling work suggests it may support 8% of net primary production and 33% of biological nitrogen (N2) ﬁxation. However, there are few DOP concentration measurements in the global ocean, especially compared to measurements of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON). In particular, there are few DOP concentration measurements from the Indian Ocean and South Paciﬁc Ocean. Consequently, a robust understanding of the role of DOP in supporting primary production and N2 ﬁxation remains data-limited. Here, I present 365 DOP concentration measurements from the 2016 GO-SHIP I08S and I09N cruise in the Eastern Indian Ocean, 199 DOP concentration measurements from the 2017 GO-SHIP P06 cruise in the South Paciﬁc Ocean, and 188 DOP concentration measurements from the 2016 P18 GO-SHIP cruise in the Eastern Paciﬁc Ocean. Additional DOP concentration measurements were made in the Gulf of Alaska (n = 36), South Atlantic (n = 20) and Eastern Tropical South Paciﬁc Ocean (n=115). Together with nitrate+nitrite (NO3−), phosphate (PO43−), and dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen concentration measurements made in same samples, I evaluate trends in surface ocean DOP concentrations to identify regions of net DOP accumulation and loss. I ﬁnd that upper 50 m ocean DOP stocks are positively correlated with surface ocean chlorophyll a concentration and negatively correlated with iron stress in the Eastern Paciﬁc Ocean, indicating a region of net DOP accumulation. In contrast, the upper 50 m ocean DOP stocks are negatively correlated with surface ocean chlorophyll a concentrations and positively correlated with surface ocean iron stress in the Eastern Indian, Western Tropical South Paciﬁc, and Atlantic Oceans, indicating net DOP loss in these regions when iron stress is alleviated. Additionally, DOP concentration is signiﬁcantly negatively correlated with subsurface NO3−:PO43− concentration ratios, indicating that PO43− availability plays a key role in regulating surface ocean DOP stocks. Together, these ﬁndings signiﬁcantly expand the global surface ocean DOP dataset and provide a mechanism to explain DOP distributions, with primary roles for DOP accumulation and loss in the context of phosphate and iron stress.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Energy crises have been a major problem in Pakistan for many years. The country, which became independent in 1947, has struggled to meet the gap between the demand and supply of electricity. The electricity demand, as in most countries, has been significantly increasing over time. Most of the power generated to meet this demand is by using fossil fuels. As it is well known, these fuels are not only harmful to the environment but are also finite.  Renewable energy has the potential to replace conventional fuels, and among renewables, solar energy is one of the most abundant resource. Two predominant energy conversion processes that enable the conversion of solar energy to electricity: photovoltaic (PV) and Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) conversion. Both conversion technologies rely on storage. CSP uses thermal storage, while PV relies mostly on electrochemical storage. The thermal inertia and storage make a CSP plant dispatchable, similar to a conventional fossil fuel-based plant.  This work focuses on the design, optimization, and performance analysis of CSP power plants for Pakistan, and also includes the development of a novel central receiver plant optimization software. This thesis is a combination of three projects. 
The 1st project presents a comparative study of different CSP technologies: line concentrated (Parabolic Trough Collector (PTC), and Linear Fresnel Reflectors (LFR)) and point concentrated technologies (central receiver system (CRS)) for Pakistan. Switching between the line and point concentrated technologies opens a new window of available sites. Thus, two different locations, Quetta and Nawabshah are selected based on the type of technology. A model of 100 MW integrated with 10 hours of thermal energy storage is proposed for each plant. The objective of this project is to find the best combination of site and technology for a CSP plant in Pakistan. 
The 2nd project presents the effect of using molten salt-based nanofluids for performance enhancement of the CSP plant for Pakistan. This work aims to find an optimal combination of nanoparticles and molten salt. The selected site is Nawabshah in the province of Sindh. A 100-MW PTC plant is modeled using the System Advisor Model (SAM) and is integrated with thermal energy storage of up to 10 hours. From literature, nanoparticles with the highest share of usage in performance enhancement of PTC collectors (CuO, Al2O3, and TiO2) with different fractions are selected and Hitec Solar Salt is considered as the base fluid. The performance is compared based on annual power generation, capacity factor, plant efficiency, and required thermal storage volume.
The first two projects utilize existing modeling and optimization tools and are in the context of Pakistan, but the final project is a contribution to the overall CSP community and industry. The performance of the central receiver system plant is significantly affected by the positioning of heliostats and their aimpoints. Optimal aimpoints for heliostats are required to prevent receiver material damage due to excess heating and to obtain desired flux profile on the receiver. In the 3rd project, we develop a software decision tool (HALOS) that uses innovative optimization methods to determine the optimal aimpoints and layout for the solar collection field. The tool allows a plant designer to obtain a well-planned solar field layout that accounts for the aimpoint strategy to the receiver, which will: (i) reduce capital requirements for the heliostat field, by reducing the required land and number of heliostats to send the target amount of irradiance to the receiver; and (ii) increase the optical efficiency of the system, by minimizing field losses and reducing the number of inactive heliostats due to thermal flux constraints on the receiver. We also present a case study that utilizes the tool developed in this project to improve the plant design proposed in the 1st project. The development of HALOS was a team effort and had a large scope; hence, the contribution of each team member and specifically of the author of this thesis are acknowledged in detail in Chapter 4. 
The main conclusions and contribution for our study are: 
•	Switching between point- and line-focused CSP technologies results in improved performance of CSP plants it allows to use high sloped terrains, which opens options for sites with the higher solar resource in Pakistan.
•	Showing that the use of a nanofluid can enhance the performance of CSP power plants in Pakistan. 8.85% increase in annual energy is recorded with nanofluids compared to the base fluid.
•	 Developing a novel decision tool that optimizes the solar power tower system and can help improve not only future but existing plant designs as well.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>His Visible Bones follows its speaker from active illness and addiction through recovery and into a long-term relationship. The poems focus on lived experiences of queerness, mental illness, addiction, recovery, and romance. They operate within inherited forms such as the sonnet, and through freer forms like the open field, within and outside genres like allegory, aubade, and elegy. Story drives many of these poems, which often use narrative gestures to complement the lyric, meditative, associative, and rhetorical. This is especially true for the first section of the manuscript. In the second section, the speaker interrogates his own complicity in systems of violence with a heavier reliance on rhetoric and associative imagery, and in the final section, lyric gestures foreground emotional, often less-narrative experiences of romance for a speaker in recovery. The dissertation opens with an introduction that seeks to situate the manuscript of poems within four categories of influence: essays on poetry and poetics, essays on the lyric “I,” primary critical influences, and dominant poetic influences. The introduction is then followed by the manuscript of poems described above. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Over the past decade, there has been increasing attention devoted to the use of digital games in education. However, prior studies on game-based learning have found mixed results in transferring in-game performance to other scenarios. One plausible explanation for these findings is that learners’ performance is often assessed at a far transfer level at posttest, which is very different from the learning context. If learners fail to recognize the similarity between the learning context and the transfer context, the learning transfer is not likely to happen. Another possible reason is that learners are not solving game problems systematically. Instead, many learners rely on trial and error to complete various tasks in games. Hence, they do not learn the underlying concepts from the game-based learning experience and are not able to apply the concepts to demonstrate the far transfer.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study used an experimental design to address this problem. A total of 79 students from two schools participated in the study. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the two conditions. The control condition received basic game supports while the treatment condition received additional cognitive supports (e.g., modeling and advice) in Penguin Go, an educational game that teaches computational thinking skills by tasking students to control a penguin’s movement with code blocks. The supports aimed at facilitating in-game problem-solving and improving learning transfer after gameplay. Participants were assessed at both near and far transfer level. In addition, participants’ perceived enjoyment and perceived learning were collected at the end of the study.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Results showed that after two hours of gameplay, students’ CT skills improved significantly on near transfer with medium effect size, but not on far transfer. Between the two conditions, students performed equally well on near transfer. The control group outperformed the treatment group in terms of far transfer significantly. Further analyses revealed that accessing general game supports voluntarily (i.e., digital almanac on game mechanics) significantly predicted the near transfer performance while accessing level-specific supports voluntarily (i.e., game tips that facilitate goal setting and provide partial worked example) predicted the far transfer performance. In addition, adding additional cognitive supports did not decrease the enjoyment of the gameplay. At the same time, it did not increase students’ sense of perceived learning.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The method will also be applied for computing solutions to the Stefan problem involving complex deforming geometries. The interface propagation equation is resolved by using the unsplit cell-integrated semi-Lagrangian method. The level set method is also coupled during this process in order to assist in the initialization of the (transient) provisional velocity field. Our method is validated on both canonical and challenging benchmark tests. Algorithm convergence results based on grid refinement are reported. It is found that the new method approximates solutions to the Stefan problem efficiently, compared to traditional approaches, due to the localized finite volume approximation stencil derived from the underlying supermesh.  The new kind of supermesh approach provides a general framework for solving many complex deforming boundary problems containing inherent deforming micro-structural components.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>With the theme of leaving home to return home, my dissertation starts with my memory of being born like a stranger in the extended family and growing up as an only child in Wuhan, the hometown’s history and current struggle examined later. A parallel thread turns to myself again being a stranger, this time in the States a new land, and being gradually accepted by two families of geese, whose trust and friendship led to my transformation, from an avid meat eater whose favorite food was roast goose to a vegetarian. My family history mirrored by the vicissitudes of the geese families on the basis of my seven years’ observations, the story ends with a return in multiple senses, with hope and love.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Semiconductor spintronics has been widely regarded as a viable pathway to overcome many limitations in the current microelectronics technology. Molecular spintronics, an emerging research area in spintronics, aims to incorporate the unique functionalities of organic components into the solid-state device architectures. The overarching theme of this dissertation research is to explore a new nonmagnetic pathway of spin injection and detection in semiconductor spintronics by employing chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) in chiral molecules.This dissertation begins with a study of spin transport in an inorganic semiconductor, the persistent photoconductor Si-doped Al0.3Ga0.7As. The persistent photoconductivity facilitates spin transport measurements on one and the same sample over a broad range of carrier densities across the insulator-metal transition (Chapter 3). Three-terminal (3T) and four-terminal (4T) Hanle measurements have been performed to ascertain the dependences of spin lifetimes on bias current and carrier density. The spin lifetimes in the AlGaAs channel are extracted from fittings to the Lorentzian function and one-dimensional spin drift-diffusion model. The comprehensive results from our experiments show broad similarities between 3T and 4T Hanle signals, providing evidence that 3T Hanle measurements in our systems do result from spin accumulation instead of spurious effects. The results provide a solid experimental basis for understanding the spin relaxation mechanisms in semiconductors.
The second project (Chapter 4) focuses on the formation and micro/nano patterning of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of thiol molecules on the semiconductor GaAs. We demonstrated that by etching and passivating the GaAs surface with ammonium polysulfide, alkanethiol molecules can form high-quality SAMs by solution assembly. Moreover, using molecular patterning methods of dip-pen nanolithography and micro-contact printing, nanoscale and microscale thiol SAM patterns can be created directly on the prepared GaAs surface. The functionalities of the molecular SAMs were then demonstrated by using 4-aminothiophenol SAMs as templates for directed self-assembly of Au nanoparticles on GaAs. The experiments demonstrated the viability of the experimental techniques for fabricating molecular/semiconductor hybrid structures and bottom-up fabrication of nanoplasmonic structures.
The unique combination of the physics knowledge and experimental skills from the first two projects laid the foundation for the implementation of my primary dissertation project: Utilization of CISS to generate spin polarization in semiconductors without using any magnetic materials. The two main methods of spin detection are the spin-valve effect and Hanle effect. For the spin-valve effect (Chapter 5), we fabricate vertical planar junctions of (Ga,Mn)As/α-helix L-polyalanine (AHPA-L) molecules/Au. The magnetoconductance (MC) of the junction is measured, which provided direct evidence for spin selective transport through chiral molecules assembled on a ferromagnetic semiconductor (Ga,Mn)As. Importantly, the junction structure in our experiments allowed for robust measurements of the bias dependences of MC, which show both a pronounced nonlinear-response component and a nontrivial linear-response component. Our results are in direct contradiction of the expectation of some theoretical models and provide an important constraint for a viable theory of CISS and its device manifestations.
The Hanle effect, presented in Chapter 6, has been performed by the 3T configuration, in junctions of n-GaAs/AHPA-L molecules/Au, with the (Ga,Mn)As replaced by the non-magnetic Si-doped GaAs. The signals show two distinct components consistent with contributions from the Hanle effect and dynamic nuclear polarization respectively. The signals are observed to exhibit exceptional sensitivities to temperature, bias current, and the orientation of the applied magnetic field with respect to the junction plane. Details of the experimental results are not fully understood and warrant further experimental and theoretical investigation. The definitive demonstration of a CISS-induced Hanle effect in nonmagnetic semiconductors would be a significant step forward to a new paradigm in spintronics, namely, semiconductor spintronics free of any magnetic materials.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Unsupervised Learning is a critical topic in Machine Learning. It studies how a system can learn a particular representation without explicit outputs (i.e labels in Supervised Learning). In this thesis, we introduce two novel and efficient methods in Unsupervised Learning, in Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Firstly, we propose a novel clustering algorithm for a variant of classic Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), where the data is corrupted by outliers sampled uniformly in the space, which we call GMM with a uniform background. Robust loss minimization is the backbone of the proposed algorithm and it performs well in clustering GMM with a uniform background. 
We also prove theoretical guarantees that the algorithm obtains good clustering with high probability. 
We support the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithm with experiments on synthetic and real datasets. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The investigation on high dimensional data of the first clustering algorithm mentioned above motivates us to study ways to combine together Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering. In this respect we propose a generic framework for Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering based on Manifold Optimization, which can learn the dimension reduction and clustering parameters simultaneously. 
The clustering framework studied in this work is a Gaussian Mixture Model and the projection functions are Linear Projection and a simple Neural Network.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The goal of the study was to examine the impact of executive function on solving intermixed problems that require different solution strategies. 138 participants completed an arithmetic choice task where participants choose the correct answer of a rational number arithmetic equation from two options. Individual differences in inhibition and shifting were also measured. Participants were randomly assigned to the Blocked condition where they complete rational number arithmetic problems in a blocked sequence, the Notation-Intermixed condition where they complete problems of the same operation (addition or multiplication) but different notation (fraction or decimal) consecutively, or the Operation-Intermixed condition where they complete problems of the same notation but different operation consecutively. We found a significant condition main effect such that participants in the Operation-Intermixed condition had worse performance than participants in the Blocked condition. We found a significant condition*inhibition interaction effect such that inhibition was a significant predictor of performance in the Blocked condition but not in the Operation-Intermixed condition. While shifting was significantly correlated with performance, shifting was not a significant predictor of performance in the Blocked condition and we did not find a condition*shifting interaction. These findings shed light on the mechanism by which inhibition and shifting influence math problem-solving performance. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In the present study, a replication was conducted based on the Cummings et al. (2008) study, in which, a sample of predominantly White couples participated in a 4-week psychoeducational program that found positive results including greater couple relationship satisfaction, better parenting, and improved child adjustment. The current study was conducted to test the effectiveness of an intervention with an all-Black sample of 36 African American (AA) married or cohabiting couples with at least one child age 9-17 years old. The goal of the study was to test if similar positive results could be obtained from an intervention designed to improve couples’ conflict resolution strategies. With that goal in mind, four research aims were explored. The first aim was to determine if participation in the intervention program increase observed constructive behaviors, decrease destructive behaviors, and increase resolution leading to greater conflict resolution within African American (AA) couples. The second aim was to determine if differences pre-test to pos-test upon completion of the intervention exist for treatment vs control groups related to parental knowledge, communication, and relationship satisfaction for men and women within AA couples. The third aim was to investigate if differences pre-test to pos-test upon completion of the intervention exist for treatment vs control groups regarding parent reports of improved parenting behaviors and child emotional security within AA families. The fourth aim was to explore the cultural acceptability of the intervention materials among AA couples. Using repeated measures ANOVA significant differences were found for the treatment and control group comparisons regarding conflict resolution behaviors and parental knowledge about martial conflict. No support was found related to differences pre-test to pos-test upon completion of the intervention for treatment vs control groups regarding parent reports of improved marital communication, relationship satisfaction, parenting behaviors, or child emotional security for men and women within AA couples. Lastly, support was found for the need to modify the current intervention to make the intervention more culturally acceptable. In general, these findings support the positive results that can be obtained from participating in the intervention including improved conflict behaviors, as well as, potential for greater effectiveness of the intervention with some modifications making the intervention more culturally relatable and acceptable to AA couples. This may be particularly important to enhance the relationship satisfaction, parenting behaviors, and child functioning within AA families.  The current study highlighted the unique differences in culture and communication styles among Blacks that may impact the effectiveness of the intervention. The overall pattern of results in this dissertation suggest the Cummings et al. (2008) intervention yielded very different results for AA couples.  The pattern of findings suggests that assumptions made in the theoretical or practical execution of the intervention may be inappropriate for AA families. A detailed contrast of the findings of this dissertation with those of the original study to highlight potential improvements in the intervention design or delivery more suitable for AA families is provided. Implications for future research and intervention design are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Understanding properties of quasiparticles in novel two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors, such as atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) and group-III metal monochalcogenides, is among the most interesting topics in condensed matter physics in recent years. Their distinctive excitonic effects resulting from strong Coulomb interaction in the truly 2D limit, strong light-matter interaction, spin-valley locking (in TMDCs), and the availability of new degrees of freedom (stacking and twisting) for tuning electronic properties make these materials a unique platform for exploring excitonic physics and for potential optoelectronic applications. In this thesis, we use low temperature optical magneto-spectroscopy to probe the fundamental properties of excitons and excitonic complexes in monolayer TMDCs and few-layer InSe.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the first part of this thesis, we identified and characterized the intrinsic spin conserved (bright) and spin-flip forbidden (dark) exciton states as well as their related exciton complexes in monolayer WSe2 and MoSe2. The dark excitons are originated from the spin-orbital coupling splitting of the conduction band. We demonstrate that by applying strong in-plane magnetic fields, one can induce mixing and splitting of bright and dark exciton branches, which enables an accurate spectroscopic determination of their energies. We establish, for the first time, the bright-dark excitons splitting in an archetypal TMDC monolayer semiconductor, MoSe2, which helped to resolve a long-standing puzzle of its surprisingly high valley depolarization.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the second part of the thesis, we examine the optical properties of monolayer MoSe2 away from the charge neutrality point. Monolayer TMDCs have extremely high exciton binding energies, which makes the excitonic effects dominate the optical processes even at high electron densities when the Fermi level is in the conduction band. Here, we study excitons dressed by the Fermi sea of electrons forming new quasi-particles, repulsive and attractive exciton-polarons, as well as their Landau quantization at high magnetic fields.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the third part of the thesis, we study another 2D direct-gap semiconductor, InSe, in the regime where the Fermi energy approaches the exciton binding energy. Due to the high mobility of electrons in the conduction and the flat valence band, few-layer InSe provides a nearly ideal system to study many-body phenomena using optical spectroscopy. In this thesis, we report the observation of Fermi edge singularity, spectroscopic measurements of quantum Hall gaps, and detection of possible signatures of fractional quantum Hall states in InSe.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Computational thinking (CT) is an analytical thinking approach to solving daily problems by utilizing fundamental concepts of computer science. In the past decade, CT has been regarded as an essential life skill to be taught to everyone, especially young learners. One overarching and unresolved issue related to including CT into the K-12 curriculum concerns the optimal time and learning environment to introduce students to CT. Like in STEM fields, one huge challenge in CT development is the disparate outcomes between males and females. Digital games have become an increasingly popular way to teach CT concepts to young learners. It has been noted that the main characters in most of the CT games have adopted a third-person perspective rather than a first-person perspective. However, little is known about how the degree of perspective taking and gender would affect CT skill development in the context of digital game-based learning. This dissertation study examined the effects of perspective taking on the development of CT, using two game versions in a 2D game called Penguin Go: (a) the control version, using the third-person perspective, and (b) the experimental version, with a first-person perspective. I also explored how different perspective taking (i.e., first-person vs. third-person) in the game affected the students’ gameplay experiences and perspective-taking skill development. I recruited 52 middle-school students and randomly assigned them to play either the third-person perspective or the first-person perspective version. Although there were no significant differences found between the two conditions in terms of CT learning, females performed significantly better in the first-person version than in the third-person version. There was also no significant group difference in terms of perspective-taking skills and gameplay experiences. Implications of the findings for future researchers and game designers are discussed.  </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>How can regional organizations create differences in coordination and planning decisions based on their organizational and institutional makeup? As metropolitan areas are increasingly expanding beyond the geographical and political boundaries of the local level, Regional Intergovernmental Organizations (RIGOs) have been theorized as a mitigation tool to calming fragmentations of authority at the local level. While literature of the organizations is new, there has been evidence that regional organizations are creating an impact when connecting local and state level organizations to a unified plan handling a wicked problem. A gap in regional literature currently is a specialized look into a standardized group of regional organizations, required to complete specific tasks yet are allowed the freedom to decide on supplemental areas if needed. Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) are an example of one such version of regional organizations, a regional organization created by the federal government to provide several standardized documents that fiscally constrain all transportation planning projects within the region. Previous data gathering of these organizations has varied between gathering of several states or of specific regions, only providing minor views of MPOs that may contain differences based on the location or region the MPO is in. In this manuscript, the research has created a national MPO database of all 400+ MPOs within the United States; the information contained includes organizational and institutional makeup of the organization, state influences, interregional partnerships, and goal and objective setting language within their required transportation plan documentation. This dissertation fills further gaps in regional literature and collective action scenarios by examining the local effects of the MPO, its coordination with similar regional entities, and the influences that come upon MPOs when creating long range transportation plans. The research findings suggest that: (1) there are influences of the MPO at the local government level in terms of adoption risk of sustainability plans; (2) that regional to regional coordination is affected by similar risks that local level entities may face;  (3) that there are noticeable effects of institutional and organizational pressures towards transportation plan language in regards to sustainability goal and objective setting. Together these studies add important literature to the field of RIGOs, further expanding upon the burgeoning area of research the effects of regional organizations and their inner machinations.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>There is a need for evidence-based research in the field of music therapy, and interest in evidence-based practice among music therapists in the United States has led to the development of neuroscience informed approaches to music therapy. Neurologic Music Therapy (NMT) is a specialized application of music therapy that applies research from neuroscience to evaluate what occurs in the brain as music is being perceived or produced and how it influences non-musical behavior and function in order to provide effective therapeutic outcomes for people undergoing neurologic rehabilitation. NMT is a system of twenty therapeutic techniques categorized by the various functions of the brain they were designed to address into three domains: cognitive, sensorimotor, and speech/language. The techniques include Musical Sensory Orientation Training (MSOT), Musical Neglect Training (MNT), Auditory Perception Training (APT), Musical Attention Control Training (MACT), Associative Mood and Memory Training (AMMT), Musical Executive Function Training (MEFT), Musical Mnemonics Training (MMT), Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS), Pattern Sensory Enhancement (PSE), Therapeutic Instrument Playing (TIMP), Oral Motor and Respiratory Exercises, (OMREX) Musical Speech Stimulation (MUSTIM), Melodic Intonation Therapy (MIT), Rhythmic Speech Cueing (RSC), Vocal Intonation Therapy (VIT), Therapeutic Singing (TS), Symbolic Communication Training Through Music (SYCOM), and Developmental Speech and Language Training Through Music (DSLM). The purpose of this study was to investigate if there has been an increase over time of populations and diagnoses for which neurologic music therapy is utilized to target areas of focus for future researchers. A content analysis of 632 journal articles published in scholarly music therapy journals was conducted and 22 articles were identified for further inspection. Overall, both the age groups and variety and breadth of diagnoses of participants included in studies has increased over time. This suggests that music therapists are actively researching and utilizing NMT, which is vital given that the burden of neurological disorders has risen since 1990. Further research is needed to continue expanding our knowledge of how and for whom NMT can best serve as a successful music therapy approach.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The cis-regulatory elements encoded by the genome and the epigenetic regulation that influences their function are necessary for defining organismal phenotype. However, a gap exists in our understanding of the role that epigenetic regulation plays in the interaction between cis-elements and the trans-acting factors that bind them. The focus of this work is on understanding these relationships by dissecting them in maize (Zea mays). In this dissertation, I describe my efforts to 1) characterize the target genes of RNA-directed DNA-methylation (RdDM), 2) to determine the comprehensive landscape of chromatin-interacting proteins of the b1 tandem repeat paramutation locus (b1TR), and 3) to characterize the physiological and transcriptional responses to severe drought stress in mutant plants that are defective in epigenetic silencing. To characterize the target genes of RdDM, I developed a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) protocol which enables recovery and analysis of chromatin associated with an epitope-tagged version of MOP1 expressed in mutant plants lacking RdDM components. These tools will be used to determine the genome-wide binding sites of the RNA Polymerase IV:MOP1 transcriptional complex by future members of our lab. To identify the chromatin-interacting proteins of the b1TR, I developed a single-locus immunoprecipitation proteomics method to capture and identify proteins cross-linked to an integrated b1TR transgene that is sufficient for transcriptional silencing. Characterization of the putative b1TR-interacting proteins revealed a potential overlap between the RNA-interference (RNAi) and RdDM pathways in transgene-mediated transcriptional silencing of the B-I allele. I also identified components of the RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) transcriptional complex and RNA-processing proteins, highlighting the involvement of Pol II transcription in b1TR regulation. I explored the role RdDM in stress response by exposing mop1-1 mutant plants which are defective in 24-nt small interfering RNA biogenesis to severe drought. I then analyzed their physiological and transcriptional responses to drought and learned that loss of Mop1 is associated with vegetative and reproductive defects which may be related to the misregulation of thousands of genes involved in stress response. Broadly, this work increases our understanding of gene regulation by identifying proteins that interact with a well-characterized epigenetically regulated cis-element and provides data that can contribute to global efforts for improving food security in a changing climate.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Magnetic two-dimensional (2D) materials, proposed to exhibit non-trivial electronic topology, have been discovered recently. In particular, a potential for devices based on van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnetic heterostructures was demonstrated for Fe3GeTe2, which displays the same crystallographic structure as Mn3Sn. The opportunity exists to design and fabricate many devices based on vdW materials, where they can be employed in unique spin–orbit torque configurations when stacked with vdW metals that exhibit strong spin–orbit interactions [1, 2]. However, in order to exploit ferromagnetic vdW materials as building blocks for heterostructure-based spintronics, we are tasked to understand the nature of 2D magnetism for compounds of interest. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Among all the predicted and experimentally observed vdW ferromagnetic materials, the most promising candidates are part of the Fe-Ge-Te (FGT) family: Fe3GeTe2 (FGT 312) and Fe5GeTe2 (FGT 512). This is due to their relatively high Curie temperatures: near 220 K [3] and 280 K [4] in their bulk state, respectively. At low fields, both compounds display an anomalous Hall effect (AHE) that scales with the magnetization. For ferromagnetic (FM) materials, this AHE has been described using Berry phase concepts depending on the band geometry (or band topology) of the material [5, 6], with a specific scenario [7] proposed for FGT 312. However, measurements of the magnetic torque reveal a second metamagnetic transition observed in both compounds in fields exceeding 10 Tesla. These indicate that neither FGT compound can be considered as a simple collinear ferromagnet [8], in agreement with Ref. [9], and hence suggests that the origins of their AHE may not be trivial. For both compounds, the AHE remains oblivious with respect to the occurrence of these metamagnetic transitions, indicating that an unconventional scenario is required to explain this anomalous Hall response. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this study, we have synthesized crystals of Fe3-xGeTe2 and Fe5-xGeTe2 using Chemical Vapor Transport and Flux methods. For nominal FGT 312, we report the AHE, magnetic torque, planar Hall effect, Righi-Leduc (thermal Hall) effect, heat capacity, and anomalous Nernst data. For nominal FGT 512, we have collected AHE, magnetic torque and heat capacity data. We then detail the fundamental principles of operation and procedures including the methodology in characterization, synthesis and growth.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This treatise is about the Filipino composer Col. Antonino Buenaventura and his 1969 Viola Sonata. It discusses the Sonata’s importance in the Philippines’ search for a distinctive national identity. It also offers information on how to perform the Viola Sonata and suggested bowings and fingerings in the piece's included facsimile. The first chapter addressesBuenaventura’s childhood, education, and musical career. The second chapter considers aspects of his musical language and examines two of his earlier works that implement the compositional techniques also used in the Viola Sonata. The third chapter focuses on the Viola Sonata, its creation, its themes and harmonic progressions, and performance considerations. It also highlights instances in the music that suggest his experimentation with modernist style elements. Finally, the fourth chapter offers a macroscopic view of the Viola Sonata’s legacy in helping to establish neoclassicism in the Philippines in the 1960s, which led to the rise of a modernist movement in music there. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Wetlands are transitional ecosystems between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. They are among the most productive and diverse ecosystems and make a critical part of larger ecosystems. Functional wetlands provide numerous significant environmental, social, and economic benefits and services. However, wetlands are probably the most threatened ecosystems on Earth. The ability of wetlands to function is increasingly threatened by the direct and indirect impacts of human disturbances. From the mid-1950s to the mid-1970s, agricultural drainage of wetlands was responsible for 87 percent of the United States' wetland losses. Since 1780, Florida lost more wetland acreages than any other state.This dissertation research investigated the association between Wetland Habitat Quality (WHQ), wetland patterns, and anthropogenic disturbances from the landscape ecology perspective. Statistical and spatial models are used to analyze these associations and to predict WHQ. The study area is a landscape typical of Florida's wetland and agriculture interface that is also subject to mining activities. The first chapter of this study is a literature review of fundamental concepts such as wetland (definition, importance, function, ecological services, their condition in the world and the United States), landscape ecology (island biogeography, landscape mosaic, and landscape patterns), habitat quality, and anthropogenic disturbances (agricultural activities and roads). Furthermore, this chapter explores how the spatial configuration of the most common human disturbances influences the habitat quality of the nearby wetlands in a landscape of wetland-farmland interface.
The second chapter explores two objectives of this research on how wetlands spatial patterns (measured by selected landscape pattern metrics) and the landscape matrix composition influence WHQ.  The first Objective results show that WHQ is strongly associated with some spatial characteristics of wetland patches, such as area. Some other spatial characteristics that were expected to be strongly associated with individual patches WHQ showed a small to no meaningful association. The results of multiple variable stepwise analysis showed that the best subset of available data explaining the variation of WHQ is wetland type, core area index, and the contiguity index. 
The second objective's results show that local adjacency and distance to anthropogenic disturbances (or natural and semi-natural landcovers) significantly impact WHQ. Overall, chapter two shows the significant impact of landscape's spatial configurations on wetland habitat conditions. However, these impacts are widely overlooked in Florida's environmental policies and regulations.
The third chapter aims to develop a predictive WHQ model called WPM (Wetland Habitat Quality Predictive Model) based on a combination of landscape patterns and projection of nearby developed lands anthropogenic disturbance intensity. The proposed WPM can serve as a US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) National Wetland Condition Assessment (NWCA) Level I Landscape Assessment tool. WPM uses a thermodynamic base approach in a sense that human disturbance intensity is mainly inferred by the nonrenewable energy consumption rate to maintain a specific type of human activity. The model was built by interpolating the disturbances imposed on wetlands from nearby human disturbances and based on the wetland’s shapes and distance to the sources of disturbances, where the previous chapter supported the selection of variables. The model was built using cokriging geostatistical interpolation methods. The results showed that WPM provides a more accurate prediction of WHQ compare to the traditional thermodynamic methods used by Florida’s environmental agencies for decades.
Overall, the entire dissertation work enriches the research on modeling and predicting wetland qualities using landscape ecology measures as well as other spatially calculated indicators, as mentioned in the last conclusive chapter. This study bridges the two relatively separated research fields, one being landscape ecology at the broader spatial scale and the other precision habitat evaluation at the micro-scale. For the latter, the novel WHQ dataset used in this study consists of a high-quality ecological field study of 899 wetlands collected and confirmed by expert wetland biologists and ecologists. Such datasets have been rarely used in conjunction with pattern metrics usually applied to broader-scale landscape patterns. This interdisciplinary study is unique in terms of the integration of knowledge gained in physical geography, biology, ecology, information sciences, and environmental administration. 
Environmental managers and policymakers benefit from quantitative assessment of habitat quality, which provides a knowledge base for managing or conserving wetland habitats. The accuracy and precision of the landscape-level wetland assessment method proposed in this research is significantly better than the methods traditionally used in Florida. This Research’s results are beneficial to environmental managers as a decision support tool for the numerical evaluation of different anthropogenic disturbances scenarios based on the spatial configuration of human-nature systems. Scholars and environmental managers can use this study's numerical models as an extra layer of information for investigating habitat connectivity and land suitability models.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>       	Hate crime laws were highly contentious when they were first passed in the early 1980s; they remain particularly divisive in America’s current political and social context. More specifically, while a majority of Americans are supportive of hate crime laws, estimates indicate that approximately one-third of the population still do not support such legislation. It is particularly important to understand this variation in support for hate crime laws for three main reasons. First, hate crimes are increasingly being recognized as a pressing social issue, especially following recent increases in such incidents. Second, hate crime laws send important symbolic messages of equality to marginalized groups, and opposition to such laws could be conveying a message to marginalized groups that they are not accepted or equal in conventional society. Third, while federal legislation has been in place for more than a decade, there is still significant debate surrounding the implementation and revision of hate crime laws at the state-level; better understanding of differences in support for these laws can inform this debate. Following this, the current research examines variation in support for hate crime laws using data from approximately 2,682 survey respondents across the U.S. who expressed opinions regarding hate crime legislation. 	Using these data, the current research aims to address three primary goals. First, I follow–and build on–prior research by examining how support for hate crime legislation varies across multiple individual-level constructs, including age, gender, race, education, and political affiliation. Second, this research examines the differential impact of prejudicial attitudes and prior hate crime victimization on hate crime law support. Third, this research considers the impact of community factors on variation in individual support for hate crime law. Results from the current research suggest at least six important findings related to variation in individual hate crime law support. First, results indicated the lack of a direct race effect in predicting hate crime law support. That is, an individual’s race was not directly related to or significantly associated with either favoring or opposing hate crime law. Second, there was some limited support for gender differences in hate crime law support. More specifically, women were slightly more likely to favor hate crime laws than men. Importantly, the first two findings suggest that hate crime law support is much more than just a racial or gender issue. Third, results indicated that age was significantly related to hate crime law support. Specifically, I found that as age increased, hate crime law support also increased, with individuals between the ages of 40 and 60 being the most likely to support hate crime laws. This finding suggests a potential cohort effect, in which those who were born between the 1960s and the 1980s might be especially likely to support hate crime laws because they experienced the battle for civil rights and the passage of initial hate crime laws first hand. 
	Fourth, vicarious and direct hate crime victimization experiences were both significantly related to hate crime law support. However, while vicarious victimization, or knowing someone that has been directly impacted by a hate crime, was associated with an increase in support of hate crime law, I found that direct hate crime victimization was associated with a significant decrease in hate crime law support, especially among Black victims. One potential explanation for these lower levels of support for hate crime law could be legal cynicism, in which cynical views of the criminal justice system handling of hate crimes may lead hate crime victims to believe that such laws are ineffective. Fifth, prejudice had a significant, negative effect on hate crime law support. Finally, when I limited my sample to a subsample of those respondents who voted in the 2016 election and were willing to share voting information (N= 1,929), results indicated that those who supported former President Donald Trump were particularly unlikely to support hate crime law. Taken together, the current research suggests that hate crime law support is a complex phenomenon, but that it is particularly associated with both political affiliation and prejudicial attitudes. Moving forward, this research has the potential to inform important debates surrounding the implementation and expansion of hate crime laws.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>There is an outpouring of resources, a large body of research, and a string of costly interventions concerning the literacy disparities between low-income African American families and middle-income families and families of other ethnicities. Many studies fail to consider the beliefs and behaviors of African American families, which could very well be the missing link in understanding how children engage in literacy activities and why there are varying degrees of readiness for formal schooling. The present study explored the early literacy beliefs of 11 African American mothers and grandmothers with primary childcare responsibilities, examined their perceptions of their role in supporting literacy acquisition, and further investigated how their beliefs manifest in their interactions with their children and grandchildren from birth to 4 years old. Female participants accessed through a local daycare center completed a demographic survey and participated in interview sessions lasting 45-60 minutes. The results showed that African American parents are engaging in literacy activities at home but differ in the developmental stage at which they begin and the quality, duration, and frequency of their engagement. Their home language use establishes norms that highlight the pervasiveness of systemic inequalities, which make significant differences to their children’s overall literacy development. Many see these indicators as deficits, not merely differences, and they are significant in predicting disparities in educational attainment and the trajectory of the academic careers of marginalized youth. More research is necessary to mediate the home language use of low-income families, establish universal standards and definitions of kindergarten readiness, and support parents in accessing information to undergird their efforts.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In Snatched, I bring together historical accounts of kidnappings, as recorded in the Old Bailey Proceedings, and fictional accounts of kidnappings, as popularized by Samuel Richardson, Frances Burney, Oliver Goldsmith, and John Gay. Deploying a feminist and historicist methodology, I demonstrate how the events and settings present in the legal records haunt later novels and plays. Brief, typically unremarkable movements become hyper-visible scenes of violence. Dragged down a hallway, pulled up a flight of stairs, rushed into a carriage, fictional heroines move through surprisingly treacherous domestic spaces. I also reveal how Richardson, Burney, Goldsmith, and Gay write under the looming shadow of the transatlantic slave trade, weaving anxieties about objectification and forced mobility into narratives that revolve around wealthy, white heiresses. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>An estimated 60 to 80 percent of the undergraduate population work on and/or off campus. The student employment literature has primarily focused on two themes, which are the impact of work on both academic outcomes (grade point average, graduation and retention rates) and post-graduation labor market success. Although there is an assumption in the literature that on-campus student employment influences leadership learning, there is a lack of research directly exploring this topic. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore how on-campus student employment influences leadership capacity. The conceptual framework guiding this research was the culturally relevant leadership learning model with a focus on the development of leadership capacity as the central component for the model. The student leadership competency model was used to define leadership capacity. This research was grounded in a narrative inquiry methodology where participants completed a survey and interview. Nineteen undergraduate students who worked in Student Affairs at my institution of interest in the Southeastern United States participated in this study. The findings suggest that on-campus student employment does influence leadership capacity development for undergraduate students who work. Therefore, results from this study can be used to inform and adapt current on-campus practices associated with student employment to facilitate the development of leadership capacity in on-campus working students.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The modern electrical power grid increasingly features semiconductor-based power electronics converters in place of traditional transformers. Known as solid-state transformers (SST), these converters are distinguished for their controllability, their efficiency, and their reduced size and weight. Of the existing converter topologies, the modular multilevel converter (MMC) is popular for implementation as a solid-state transformer, including in direct current (DC) grid interfaces.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the existing engineering literature, the MMC is often studied operating under a low-frequency sinusoidal modulation, and is often implemented with large passive components. This tends to make the converter more stable, and relaxes the requirements placed on the control system. By changing the MMC so that it instead operates with a medium-frequency square waveform in a DC SST, the passive components can be significantly reduced, as well as the semiconductor device ratings. However, a greater emphasis and burden is then placed on the control system’s speed and accuracy. This is problematic because an MMC with small passive components experiences tight coupling among its state variables, which significantly complicates efforts to design a traditional control system for it.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation proposes and investigates methods for modeling and controlling an MMC that uses small passive components. Two major strategies are investigated: two approaches based on the traditional proportional-integral (PI) control, and one approach based on the increasingly popular model predictive control (MPC). By taking advantage of the square-wave operation, it is possible to design simplified model-based PI controllers that achieve power flow control. A more complete model that fully accounts for the MMC’s internal dynamics is also proposed and studied in this dissertation. Although it is difficult to apply the full benefits of this model to PI controller design, an MPC-type controller can easily make full use of it and achieve good control of the MMC’s power flow and internal dynamics. Unlike most other MPC controllers in the engineering literature, the MPC controller proposed in this dissertation has a very low computational burden and does not require iterative solutions. Simulation and experimental results are provided to validate the proposed models and the developed control systems.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>A growing body of research has investigated the stigma surrounding immigration, the impact it has on individual and group level attitudes, interactions, and well-being, as well the role of individual factors and media influences. The current study aimed to build on this research by exploring the impact of perceived threat on U.S. native-born college students’ endorsed levels of intergroup anxiety and attitudes towards Mexican immigrants specifically. Additionally, the potential moderating roles of media influence, educational level, and personal connection were explored. The design of this study was informed by a combined theoretical framework of Intergroup Threat Theory’s (ITT; Stephan &amp; Stephan, 2000) three dimensions of perceived threat- economic, symbolic, and physical- and cultivation theory (Morgan, Shananhan, &amp; Signorielli, 2009). Consistent with past research, this study focused on the experiences of native-born U.S. college students (n = 393) who were of voting age (18+). The participants were presented with vignettes to prime one of the perceived threat dimensions or the control no threat condition. A modified version of the Attitude Towards Immigrants Scale (ATI; Bae, 2016) was used to measure attitudes towards Mexican immigrants, while the Self Other Intergroup Anxiety Scale (SOIAS; Greenland, Xenias, &amp; Maio, 2012) was used to measure intergroup anxiety. A researcher-designed measure of media exposure and the Bias Toward Immigrants Measure (Beyer &amp; Matthes, 2015) were used to measure media influence as a proximal moderating factor. Correlational analyses indicated a significant relationship between attitudes towards Mexican immigrants and endorsed levels of intergroup anxiety (r = -.21 at p &lt;.01). Regression analyses found no evidence of a significant difference among the dimensions of perceived threat, however, the data supported media influence and personal connection as significant predictors of the outcome variables. The current study suggests that negative attitudes towards Mexican immigrants can lead to negative intergroup anxiety for native-born U.S. college students.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Accumulating evidence suggests that dysfunction in the neuroendocrine systems that influence feeding constitutes a key mechanism in the pathophysiology of disordered eating. The studies presented in this dissertation identify behavioral and neuroendocrine mechanisms related to the intermittent overconsumption of palatable food, as occurs in binge eating. We focused on the satiating effect of nutrients in the gastrointestinal tract, and the role of the pancreatic hormone amylin in this process. We first characterized feeding patterns in a rodent model of intermittent high-fat diet access (INT HFD). Our findings that this diet regimen produces an excessive intake phenotype characterized by the consumption of unusually large meals strongly suggest that INT HFD causes impairments in the satiation processes that influence meal size. Using gut nutrient infusion and detailed behavioral analysis, we found that rats maintained on the INT HFD regimen show blunted responsiveness to the satiating effect of nutrients in the gastrointestinal tract. A similar pattern of results was revealed when we examined responsiveness to amylin treatment. This behavioral evidence suggests that satiation impairments contribute to disordered eating behavior. To identify where in the brain this impairment may occur, we need to know how satiation hormone effects are mediated within the brain under normal, healthy circumstances. We examined neural circuitry that may mediate the satiating effects of amylin and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and in doing so, we discovered limited projections of amylin-sensitive neurons to the lateral hypothalamus and the widespread projections of LPBN GLP-1 receptor neurons. In the final study, we conducted a translational collaboration to investigate whether amylin and insulin responses following a meal are altered in women with eating disorders. Together, our findings provide clear evidence that impairments in the physiological responses to food intake are involved in disordered eating behavior.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The contributions of historically Black colleges &amp; universities (HBCUs) go beyond degree conferrals and are displayed in the positive effects of community, support, and persistence of their students. For Black women at the intersection of race, class, and gender, the benefits of this environment can prove vital to their post baccalaureate success. Several studies have shown that Black women at HBCUs have greater satisfaction with the campus climate, more positive experiences with faculty and peers, and greater overall satisfaction with their college experience as compared to their peers at historically white institutions (HWIs) (Alexander &amp; Bodenhorn, 2015; Mitchell, 2018). HBCUs provide an environment that is advantageous to the development of Black women and nurture the elements of cultural capital as outlined by Yosso’s (2005) conceptual model of community cultural wealth. This wealth creates a counternarrative to existing research on Black women in higher education that has labeled them as at risk due to their marginalized identities, or paradoxically exemplary based on their ability to overcome these deficits (Kaba, 2008). Thus, Black women’s cultivation of cultural capital in the HBCU environment produces an array of knowledge, skills, abilities, and relationships to help them succeed. However, the transition from an HBCU to an HWI for the pursuit of a doctoral degree can challenge the value of this cultural capital and negatively impact the doctoral socialization process.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This qualitative dissertation used a Black feminist methodology to explore the experiences of ten Black women graduate students that earned their bachelor’s degree at an HBCU and transitioned to an HWI for a doctoral program. Community cultural wealth was applied as a conceptual lens to understand their experiences. Findings from this research suggest that Black women HBCU graduates enrolled in HWI doctoral programs cultivated community cultural wealth during their enrollment at an HBCU, and were able to apply the six types of cultural capital to help them navigate the distinctly different environment of an HWI doctoral program. Major takeaways included the significance of HBCUs in cultivating cultural capital for Black women, the existence of pressure to acculturate to dominant values of educational merit in HBCU and HWI environments, and an increased understanding of the many challenges faced by Black women in higher education and the tools they use as resistance. Implications of this research include the necessity for increased diversity and support in HWI doctoral programs for Black women, the need for HBCUs to reject damaging and counterproductive ideologies of white superiority, and an increased need for studies that investigate Black women’s postsecondary experiences that employ the use of methodological approaches that are akin to their cultural identity.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This study examines issues surrounding writing center social media usage and non-usage, a topic that is often discussed in informal venues like conference sessions and blogs hosted by writing centers but is seldom researched. Specifically, this study raises the question of whether or not writing centers use social media. Regarding social-media-using writing centers, this study additionally asks what platforms they use, what purposes they have for using such media, the audiences they target, the multimedia content (e.g., images) and web-based affordances (e.g., hyperlinks) they use in their posts, and whether or not narratives emerge from their posts. In addition, this study looked into the purposes writing centers have for choosing not to use social media. To gather data related to these questions, this study implemented 3 methods: a national survey distributed to US writing center administrators; interviews with five writing centers, two not currently using social media and three using social media; and an analysis of social media posts from the three sites using social media created during the Spring 2019 semester. Data from these three sources revealed that, of the 244 writing centers represented by the survey data, 153 (63.7%) were using social media. A little less than one-fifth of these writing centers were using a single platform, with the rest using two or more. Across all 153 writing centers using social media, the three most common platforms were Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, and these three platforms together were the most common combination. Writing centers commonly used social media for information-sharing, which took the form of promotion or outreach, and tended to target current students and faculty, though some did target alumni. Further, these writing centers were commonly using images in their posts, but hashtags and other web-based affordances were less common, particularly on Facebook. Together, these posts told a common narrative of writing centers as supporting individual writers, but they also told localized narratives of community connections and welcoming spaces. The 91 writing centers not using social media had commonly used social media in the past but no longer did for three common reasons: a lack of time, a lack of staff, and a lack of interest among current staff, three issues that together affected the sustainability of writing center social media use.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In my paper, I investigate how money is depicted and the way it plays a primary function and catalyst in its interactions with the other protagonists, how attitudes toward money manifest in the characters’ actions and reveal their characteristics, and how it contributes to the plot developments in three of Dostoevsky’s novels: Crime and Punishment (1866), The Idiot (1868), and The Brothers Karamazov (1879). I will provide close readings of three novels and provide information about the social and biographical conditions in which they were written.Money plays an important role in the subplot of Crime and Punishment. It is a socio-psychological and philosophical novel where Dostoevsky provides his vision of Russian people in post-reform Russia. Significant social changes in all spheres of society followed abolition of serfdom of 1861 and created a number of social evils, such as alcoholism, poverty, immorality, socialism, nihilism, atheism and materialism, which the writer openly condemns. He blames the social trends and situation on contemporary intelligentsia, particularly socialism and moral degradation of society. In the novel he portrays the environment of capitalism where money crosses the boundaries of economic and financial spheres, becomes entangled in socio-psychological aspects of human existence and aggravates these problems.
In The Idiot Dostoevsky shows how socialist ideology caused future social issues by dramatically shifting people’s social and ideological beliefs and foundations. The writer introduces the world of huge money where millioners, capitalists, usurers, merchants and dealers play major roles. They exist in the environment of usury and deal in money, valuables and debts making up their fortunes from capitals completely detached from production and without any signs of labor origin. According to Dostoevsky's ideological, social and political conception, socio-economical crisis is the result of people’s departure from Christian values. People in post-reform Russia were seeking new ideals and found then in money. In the novel Dostoevsky portrays the destructive influence of money over human souls and lives. 
In The Brothers Karamazov Dostoevsky continues the portrayal of social problems in Russia in the second part of the nineteenth century along with the ever growing fatal power of the “golden sack”. He describes the socio-psychological phenomenon of contemporary everyday life ‘karamazovshina’, the description of the uttermost degree of people’s moral degradation, which is caused by capitalist ideology and the socio-economic conditions of the time. Further, in the novel the writer depicts the power of money to infiltrate the sphere of love and intimate human relations subjecting them to the abusive power of uncontrolled passions and constant vacillations from moral falls to the sublimest virtuous deeds.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Today, the modern tubist is required to be proficient at both the bass tuba and the contrabass tuba in academic and professional spheres. However, this was not always the case. Due to advancements in tuba manufacturing and demands on professionals to play both instruments, the bass tuba is now implemented in university curricula throughout the United States. Young collegiate tubists now play both the bass tuba and contrabass tuba. A student who only studies one of these instruments and not the other will be impeded in attaining the skills required of modern tubists. The era of a dual-tuba demand on students has begun, and the bass tuba’s use in academia is more prominent than ever.     Currently, there is a large gap in pedagogical resources addressing the dual-tuba demand on students. Most of the material that does exist is either for teaching the bass tuba alone or for teaching tuba in general. This document acknowledges the reality that serious students of the instrument now study both the bass and contrabass tuba.
     Since documented and published scholarship on simultaneously teaching the bass tuba and contrabass tuba is limited, much of the information and data in this document was generated by a survey conducted in 2020. Twenty-six prominent teachers and professional tubists responded to the survey. The intent of this document is to help tubists approach doubling on two different instruments with greater efficiency and guidance by highlighting problems and solutions to the new dual-tuba demand.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>We perform linear and nonlinear stability analyses for thermal convection in a fluid overlying a saturated porous medium, in addition to conducting novel numerical simulations. We use a coupled system, with the Navier-Stokes equations and Darcy’s equation governing the free-flow and the porous regions, respectively. Incorporating a dynamic pressure term in the Lions interface condition (which specifies the normal force balance across the fluid-medium interface) permits an energy bound on the typically uncooperative nonlinear advection term, enabling new nonlinear stability results. Within certain regimes, the nonlinear stability thresholds agree closely with the linear ones, and we quantify the differences that exist. We then compare stability thresholds produced by several common variants of the tangential interface conditions, using both numerics and asymptotics in the small Darcy number limit. Furthermore, we investigate the transition between full convection and fluid-dominated convection using both numerics and a heuristic theory. This heuristic theory is based on comparing the ratio of the Rayleigh number in each domain to its corresponding critical value, and it is shown to agree well with the numerics regarding how the transition depends on the depth ratio, the Darcy number, and the thermal-diffusivity ratio. Finally, we detail the numerical methods used to simulate the coupled system. Our analyses and the heuristic theory are then verified with our numerical results.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The experiences encountered during combat and military service can have lasting effects on mental health, physical health, and well-being for our nation’s veterans. Older veterans make up a large majority of the U.S. veteran population and the unique needs of this demographic must be considered.  Military service can impact a variety of long-term outcomes related to health and well-being for older veterans and providing effective therapeutic interventions to process these life experiences can aid in improved health outcomes. Art therapy papermaking can be a meaningful and dynamic therapeutic modality for processing trauma, developing resilience, reminiscing, and narrative storytelling. This dissertation investigated a unique papermaking method which focuses on the military uniform, deconstructing the fabric, and transforming the material into handmade paper. A mixed-methods sequential explanatory design was used to investigate the impacts of this art therapy papermaking method on self-efficacy and to gain an understanding of the significant themes and aspects of this unique method for older veteran participants. This dissertation research explored the use of the military uniform in the papermaking process and its benefits for reminiscing, life review, and processing of powerful life experiences for the participants in this study. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Set in the near future, North imagines a world where the oceans have risen faster than expected, triggering economic and political dysfunction. The novel has two storylines that ultimately intertwine. In the first, 20-year-old Olin abandons a partly inundated Miami and travels north to start a new life. In the second, 29-year-old Rose investigates a mysterious series of bombings, which leads her to a religion founded in Las Vegas. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Musician’s hand Dystonia, or focal hand dystonia in musicians, is a devastating movement disorder that occurs in musicians after expertise had been acquired.  Musician’s hand dystonia can develop in anyone but typically occurs later in life, after a performing career has been firmly established, and is believed to be caused by the interaction of many different factors, including genetic and environmental factors.  The disorder has devastating effects on performers and ends the careers of most performers in whom it develops.  Although there are many promising strategies for improvement of symptoms, there is no definitive cure.  Research studies that have successfully cured and improved musician’s dystonia are discussed, including the methodology of these treatment/therapies.  The lack of knowledge surrounding the disorder in the medical community and musicians is extremely limited.  Prevention strategies and the implementation of these strategies among performers and educators are outlined and specified.  The purpose of this dissertation is to increase knowledge of musician’s dystonia among performers and educators of instrumental music.  The emphasis of this document will be on prevention and treatment of focal hand dystonia in the hopes of preventing unnecessary confusion, misinformation, and distress among instrumentalists who are unfortunate enough to experience it.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Wilhelm Killmayer’s compositions span a wide range of instrumentations, voicings, genres, and styles. While some academic research on Killmayer’s works is available, many of his compositions have yet to be the subjects of serious academic inquiry. His song settings of poetry by Heinrich Heine are such works. Over the course of his life, Killmayer composed musical settings of thirty-eight of Heine’s poems, and thirty-five were published together in 1998 as the Heine-Lieder. The collection is divided into four themed sections that vary in style. This research document draws from existing information about Killmayer and Heine and presents a musico-poetic analysis of the first section of the Heine-Lieder. This first section is titled Ich hab’ im Traum … and comprises seven songs united by the theme of dreams. The study includes brief biographical sketches of both Wilhelm Killmayer and Heinrich Heine, a survey of Killmayer’s compositions for solo voice and piano, and a stylistic overview of Killmayer’s compositions. Each of the seven songs are discussed, with examples from the scores provided as illustration. A special focus of the musical analysis seeks to understand Killmayer’s understanding and interpretation of Heine’s characteristic quality of irony. The research concludes by discussing whether the seven songs constitute a song cycle and what this implies for the other three sections and the Heine-Lieder as a whole.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation analyzes the intersections between technological innovation, commercial expansion, and the practices of liberal governmentality in nineteenth-century Britain. After the Napoleonic Wars, the steamship began to replace sailing vessels for both commercial and military purposes, but governments faced the challenging prospect of deciding how to adopt this unproven and still developing technology. While Britain had emerged triumphant in 1815, twenty years of war caused severe financial strain, and the post-war period was one of austerity, even as new expenses, such as the development of a steam fleet, had to be financed. In order to achieve this, the state turned to private companies, paying them subsidies to carry the mail, and using the resulting influence over these firms to direct them to develop improved steamships, even as these firms influenced the goals and practices of the state in turn. For years this approach, following the patterns of “liberal governmentality” as defined by Patrick Joyce and other scholars, allowed Britain to develop both civilian and military ships to help them to cost-effectively control and consolidate their empire, as the principles of freed trade came to increasingly define it, and at least until the changing nature of technology once again required the state to reevaluate their methods.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Likewise, this new technology and the systems used by the central government affected those across all classes. Engineers, especially those in the Royal Navy, began the century as solidly part of the working class before rising into the “labor aristocracy” as their wages rose and their work became both increasingly necessary and respectable. While not every naval engineer managed to attain the respectable domestic sphere desired by so many, and while others attained this only insecurely or temporarily, many men and their families were able to rise further and enter the ranks of the Victorian middle class. Yet, this path to higher social standing was, by 1870, an increasingly difficult one to follow. Rising standards for those accepted into service, the need for preparatory education, and the increased cost of training meant that a career as a naval engineer was increasingly reserved for the sons of those already in the middle classes.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>These systems were also in constant negotiation and served multiple purposes, as can be seen in relation to the attempt to join Ireland more closely with Britain after Union. In this period, increasing crop failures, large-scale emigration, and land ownership issues only exacerbated the divisions that had long existed between the rural peasantry and those in large cities. While many of the latter embraced the possibility of layering a British identity over an Irish one, using the connection with the British state and British business interests to improve the economic condition of Ireland, those suffering in the countryside found this nearly impossible. Instead, Ireland’s problems in the nineteenth century, and the inability of the systems fostered by British state to address them, saw many Irish embrace an identity that made what it meant to be Irish mutually exclusive from what it meant to be British, undermining the faith of those who believed economic development might lead to greater accommodation or even reconciliation.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>By examining the development of the steamship, and the social, cultural, economic and political systems that made it possible, we can gain greater insight into the relationship between government and business, the formation of identity as seen in Ireland, and the lived experience of the working class during the Industrial Revolution. While many other technologies shaped the course of the nineteenth century, the steamship’s power to move people, goods, and information around the world make it exemplary of the forces that defined modernity and its associated transformations in nineteenth-century Britain. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Research efforts in shock wave/boundary-layer interactions (SBLI) are motivated by the pursuit of faster, lighter, and more maneuverable aircraft. Flow separation, strong pressure fluctuations, and high aerodynamic heating are all detrimental phenomena associated with these interactions. With a deeper understanding of the physics that drive the inherent unsteady pressure and shear forces, engineers can apply control techniques that target important flow regions and frequencies instead of overdesigning vehicles to survive these adverse effects. However, the mechanisms that drive the unsteady behavior in SBLI have been difficult to isolate and accurate predictions of unsteady pressure are not currently achievable for simulations with realistic Reynolds numbers. In order to further the understanding of 3-D SBLI physics, an experimental investigation of controlled perturbations introduced to a fin-generated swept shock wave/boundary-layer interaction is conducted. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The principal mean and unsteady flow features are studied with special emphasis on the difference between separation found in two-dimensional and three-dimensional interactions. Regions of high-amplitude pressure fluctuation on the surface beneath the interaction and coincident unsteady flow features above the surface are identified to support the development of physics-based models of interaction unsteadiness. Several techniques are employed to measure the flow response, including steady and unsteady surface pressure measurements using pressure-sensitive paint (PSP), shadowgraph to capture shock motion, particle image velocimetry (PIV) to quantify velocity fields in the flow, and high-bandwidth unsteady pressure sensors. Global measurement techniques, including steady and unsteady PSP, tomographic PIV, and multiple planes of high-speed stereo PIV permit uniquely illuminating analysis of the flow dynamics. Some of the experimental methods are novel for the facilities and types of flows, and validation and uncertainty quantification efforts are included.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Controlled flow perturbations, which have been historically difficult to implement in supersonic flows due to strong momentum of the flow and limited bandwidth of available actuators, are introduced within the interaction to gauge flow response to frequency and location of the disturbance. The perturbations are generated from Resonance-Enhanced Microjets (REM) which produce pulsed supersonic jets at frequencies on the order of several kilohertz. An evolution in the design of surface-mounted, modular REM actuators produces an improved implementation with greater repeatability and bandwidth. The frequency range studied here (between 2 and 4 kHz) has been selected based on separation and reattachment dynamics measured by unsteady pressure on the surface beneath the interaction.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Measurements combining the plate and heretofore-unstudied fin surface provide significantly more information about the response of this complex, highly three-dimensional interaction with details that are not easily obtained using traditional sensors. In general, the disturbances created by the actuators were found to excite convective mechanisms within the interactions and remained localized. Large-scale alterations in the flowfield due to microjet blowing are noted, including reduction of the size of separation and smaller shock traverse distances. The flow response to pulsed actuation reveals varying sensitivity of interaction key features, which offers promise for future efforts to design more effective flow control devices.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to measure how classifying bands by music/visual effect scores rather than band/school size affect band placements at North Carolina Bandmasters Association (NCBA) Marching Band Competitions. Specifically, the research questions are: (1) How does music/visual effect-based classification affect the overall band placements at competitions? (2) How does music/visual effect-based classification affect the band placements within competitive classes? (3) Was there a significant difference between the original scores and the music/visual performance scores bands received at each competition? (4) Was there a correlation between the band music/visual effect score and the music/visual performance score? (5) Was there a significant difference between the original scores of schools whose percentage of economically disadvantaged students was below average and those whose percentage was above average? (6) Was there a significant difference between the music/visual performance scores of schools whose percentage of economically disadvantaged students was below average and those whose percentage was above average? (7) Was there a significant difference between the music/visual effect scores of schools whose percentage of economically disadvantaged students was below average and those whose percentage was above average?  	Marching Bands investigated in this study (N = 323) were those that participated in the 20 competitions that utilized the North Carolina Bandmasters Association (NCBA) Marching Band Adjudication Scoring System during the 2019 competition season. For every competition within this study, there were changes in the overall band placements of more than half of the performing ensembles (n = 173 or 54%). Furthermore, the competitive class placements also changed for 233 bands (72%). This indicates that the music and visual effect scores have an impact on the final score. These results could provide a clearer picture of how the music/visual effect captions affect band placements. The score changes coupled with the demographic information collected on all participating ensembles also allows NCBA leadership to begin to examine how resource availability can help and/or hinder band placements at competitions. A more detailed listing of results can be found in the paper.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The interest in cryo-electron microscopy has been reinvigorated by the recent introduction of direct electron detectors and the development of new software. Images of frozen proteins can now be collected with significantly higher signal-to-noise ratio than before. Furthermore, the fast read out of the new detectors allows for images to be collected in a series of frames that can be aligned to reduce the blurring of the proteins during exposure. The development of counting mode used by the next generation of direct electron detectors has made the reconstruction of well-behaved proteins to near-atomic resolution an almost routine occurrence. Nevertheless, questions still remain on key issues. One of them is the efficacy of Fourier shell correlation ability to properly assess the quality of a reconstruction. Up to this date, there is still an ongoing debate on the best practices for reconstruction assessment and new methodologies are continuously published on this topic. Moreover, the resolution of a reconstruction is dependent on the number of protein images used and it remains unknown at what point, if there is one, the high throughput of integrating mode results in higher resolution reconstructions.The beginning of the first chapter of this dissertation contains a brief description of what is a protein and how it is synthesized. It also explains the significance that cryo-electron microscopy has in the understanding of biological processes and how it may help in the development of novel drugs to combat diseases. The rest of the first chapter is dedicated to the theory and instrumentation of cryo-electron microscopy. This includes, the microscope anatomy, different detection devices, the theory of image formation, data collection and processing, among other topics. The second chapter details a novel quality assessment methodology for reconstructed structures that is independent from the Fourier shell correlation. The assessment is capable of discerning statistical differences between protein reconstructions that report identical resolutions. In addition, the metadata that was available allowed us to make observations that are often overlooked. The third chapter examines the performance of the next generation direct electron detector, DE64 from Direct Electron when operated in two modes, integrating and counting. The modulation transfer function of the DE64 in counting mode is near-ideal and the detective quantum efficiency at low spatial frequencies is remarkably high. Additionally, the importance of the high throughput of the integrating mode is compared to the superior data from counting mode in terms of resolution. The fourth chapter contains ongoing work on whether the high detective quantum efficiency of the DE64 allows for the reconstruction of challenging proteins given their small molecular weights.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Several animals build structures to shield themselves from external threats. In some species, however, the function of these constructions goes way beyond that of a simple physical barrier. The odd-shaped mounds created by soil termites are a prime example of this. These natural structures provide a suitable microclimate for the termites that live within them, whether by behaving as a respiratory system, a water-retaining system, or a temperature regulator. Most of the previous relevant works in the termite biology field focus on the respiratory function of termite mounds. Until now, the reason behind the odd and different shapes of termite mounds has remained understudied. Several works in relevant literature report disconnected evidence of the differences in the mounds of the same species in different regions and similarities in the mounds of different species in regions of similar climate, indicating that there exists no apparent connection between the mound shape and the termite species, but pointing to the connections between the mound structural forms and mounds’ local material and environment; this thesis aims to investigate this connection.A thorough review of the literature identifies the lack of fundamental understanding of the connection between the mound shape and their function, material, and local environment. As an attempt to understand this connection, a new methodology based on the fundamentals of thermodynamics and heat transfer is developed. This methodology is applied to African termite mounds, validated, and utilized to investigate how the environment shapes the structure of Macrotermes michaelseni mounds, elucidating the thermal reasons behind the structural characteristics of these mounds. The methodology is applied to the mounds of Australian Amitermitae termites with significantly different characteristics to explore how the environmental factors shape the characteristic North-South orientation of these structures and reveal the reasons behind this distinct orientation and the diversity in the orientation of mounds in different regions. The impact of the regulatory functions and local environment over the mound structure is investigated, revealing that the wide variety of forms observed in nature arise due to different trade-offs between the regulatory functions and environmental effects. In addition, the transient water retention function of termite mounds is explored, revealing the underlying mechanisms that make termite mounds a short-term buffer for the environmental changes that can harvest water vapor throughout the night to provide ideal humidity conditions for the termites throughout the whole day.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In two meson photoproduction off a nucleon, for the case in which two of the three final state hadrons are products of the decay of an intermediate resonance, general expressions for its decay distribution and for polarization observables are derived in a model independent way. These are functions of either the spin density matrix elements (SDME's) or statistical tensors of the resonance, and the angles of its decay products. The expressions are general enough that it also describes cases where more than one resonance of arbitrary quantum numbers contributes, including interference effects. They can therefore be used to extract the SDME's or statistical tensors of the resonances that contribute to the reaction.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Robotic assistive devices hold enormous promise for augmenting and rehabilitating human locomotion (e.g. exoskeletons). Existing control techniques for lower-body exoskeletons, however, take significant time to design and tune because they are dependent on training with human subjects for hours or more. To build a theoretical foundation for faster-tuned model-based exoskeleton control, this thesis explores simple and fast-to-compute math models for predicting how human behavior will adapt to forcing from external devices. Specifically, we take a reduced-order modeling approach to find a generalizable model dependent on fewer subject-specific parameters. This work investigates the predicted behavior patterns of these models for a simple human locomotion task: bouncing up and down on two feet. This thesis tests a variety of minimalist math models and objective functions (used to model hypotheses about human control preferences) to assess the degree to which they explain observed human behaviors. Using trajectory optimization, we systematically generate optimal bouncing strategies for each combination of math model and objective function for a variety of bounce frequencies. The work concludes by analyzing patterns in thousands of numerical optimizations of hypothetical bouncing tasks and compares their features to the experimental literature on human bouncing. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This qualitative study examined how Black undergraduate women made meaning of their racial and gender identity at a Historically Black College and University (HBCU) and at a Predominately White Institution (PWI). Black women live their lives at the intersection of race and gender. The varying environments in which Black women live and operate can impact their development and how they make meaning of their racial and gender identity.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to understand the identity development process of Black undergraduate women and how they made meaning of their racial and gender identity at and HBCU and a PWI.  Porter’s (2013) Model of Identity Development of Black Undergraduate Women (MIDBUW) was the conceptual framework used to understand how Black undergraduate women are socialized around race and gender at different stages prior to and during college. Whereas previous identity development models, Cross &amp; Phagan-Smith (2001) focused on racial identity development and Belenky, Clinchy, Goldberger, and Tarule’s (1986) Women’s Ways of Knowing focused on gender identity development, MIDBUW considers both.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Narrative Inquiry was utilized for this study. Data collection included a demographic questionnaire, semi-structured interviews, and a focus group with eleven Black undergraduate women from an HBCU and a PWI. Data analysis involved thematic coding based on the conceptual framework, inductive coding, memoing, and peer debriefs.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The findings of this study identified the ways that pre-collegiate socialization around race and gender had an influence on collegiate choice and collegiate socialization around race and gender. Most importantly, I found that socialization prior to and during college, regardless of college choice, influenced identity construction of Black undergraduate women. All of the participants had early socialization experiences that reinforced being a Black woman meant being strong. Related to race, the Black women in this study dealt with being questioned about their Blackness; specifically, if they were Black enough or if their lived experiences were valid enough to classify as Black. Additionally, they all expressed concern with how White people saw them and their desire to not feed into the stereotypes White people may have of Black women.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>There were several unique ways that HBCU of the South contributed differently to the women’s development than PWI of the South. For example, HBCU participants were socialized to have immense pride in themselves as Black people. Participants enjoyed and were motivated by being surrounded by other high achieving Black people, Black women specifically. Identity construction around gender, however, was more complicated due to an underlining feeling of competition amongst other Black women on the HBCU campus.  PWI participants had more interactions around race and gender in student organizations, socially and in the classroom. Participants at both institutions found support from Black women faculty and staff on campus. They sought out organizations that furthered their career goals as well as organizations that supported them as Black women. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study provides context to the environmental factors that influence identity formation and articulation of Black undergraduate women. I suggest that institutions interrogate the role that their historical and structural foundations have in perpetuating a White standard which influences the experiences of Black women and thus how they articulate their identity as Black women. Additionally, the study findings provide insight into the need for environmental assessments of the campus climate to better understand the experiences of their students, particularly Black students. Recommendations for practice and future research provide further direction for the ways that institutions and individuals can better support and learn about Black undergraduate women’s experiences.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this secondary data analysis study was to investigate the possible association between the use of behavior management strategies by interventionists in kindergarten small-group interventions and the self-regulation of the participating children through the use of multilevel modeling. The sample consisted of 395 children from 144 classrooms participating in 117 small groups conducted by 95 interventionists in 33 schools. The behavior management strategies of the interventionists were coded with the use of audio-recordings of lessons collected during the intervention. The results suggest that the use of behavior management strategies was not significantly related to the development of children’s self-regulatory skills. However, the relations between three behavior management strategies (Non-Specific Academic Praise, Specific Behavioral Praise, and Rule Review) and children’s impulse regulation/hyperactivity did approach significance. The results show promise for the use of Rule Review in supporting children’s understanding of the expectations to participation in instruction and self-regulatory development. Recommendations are given regarding how the more frequent use of behavior management strategies may support children’s self-regulatory development and future directions in this line of research.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This mixed-methods outcomes study investigated the number of in-school and out-of-school suspension reports before and after the implementation of a preventative-based discipline method, classroom circles. The study was guided by five research questions, (1) What is the relationship between the use of classroom circles school-wide and ISS and OSS behavior reports in a low income school?  (2) Are classroom circles more or less effective at decreasing ISS and OSS reports for certain grade levels?  (3) Is there variation in the effectiveness of classroom circles for decreasing ISS and OSS for students of certain demographics such as gender, race, and socioeconomic status?  (4) Are circles more or less effective in decreasing ISS and OSS reports for students in a particular educational setting (individual, group, direct instruction)? (5)  What are the strengths and weaknesses of using classroom circles from a teacher point of view? Data was collected from a Title I middle school in Bay County, FL. Discipline reports from three years prior to (2013-2014 to 2015-2016) and three years after (2016-2017 to 2018-2019) the implementation of classroom circles were analyzed. Two-way ANOVAs were used to find differences in discipline rates between students groups such as grade level, gender, race/ethnicity, and class setting before and after implementing circles. T-tests were used to further compare student groups on pre and post data.  Interview data on the strengths and weaknesses of classroom circles was also collected from teachers that were at the school for all six years. 
The quantitative findings suggested there was a significant difference in mean discipline reports before and after the implementation of circles at the .05 level for eighth grade OSS reports, Caucasian student ISS reports, individual work ISS reports, whole group work ISS reports, whole group work OSS reports, and unstructured work OSS reports. There was a decrease in mean discipline reports per student population across most dependent variables. The qualitative findings suggest that circles improve student-teacher communication and respect. Furthermore circles were useful as a social emotional tool after the impacts of Hurricane Michael on the community. It was brought to light that teachers need time, training, and incentives to efficiently implement classroom circles. Overall, this study provides information on the outcomes of implementing classroom circles school-wide and recommendations for future implementation.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Whereas aging is associated with an increase in the successful use of Emotion Regulation (ER) strategies (Mather &amp; Cartensen, 2005; Urry &amp; Gross, 2010), depression prone older adults have been found to demonstrate deficits in ER processes (Kraaij et al., 2002). Identifying patterns of ER deficits in depression prone older adults may further our understanding of the mechanisms that maintain depressive symptoms in aging, and provide information on potential treatment for depression in older adults. The current study examined differences in ER processes between groups of older adults scoring high on self-reported ER (high ER) or low on self-reported ER and high on depressive symptoms (low ER), during an ER task while electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. The late positive potential (LPP) was used as a neural measure of emotional reactivity. We then examined changes in these neural processes over time within the low ER group specifically. The low ER group were randomly assigned to receive one of two interventions (Problem Adaptation Therapy, PATH or Physical and Psychological Health Education, PHET), the former of which specifically focused on increasing ER skills. We examined the efficacy of these interventions on improving ER and depression. We found an overall blunting in LPP reactivity for the low ER group compared to the high ER group at Time 1, potentially due to the depressive symptoms present in the low ER group. Further, we did not see changes in this LPP reactivity over time for the low ER group nor did changes in depressive symptoms or self-reported ER relate to changes in LPP reactivity. We did find a difference in intervention efficacy as the PATH condition saw a significant decrease in depressive symptoms whereas the PHET condition did not. Both interventions saw a significant increase in self-reported ER skill.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Terraforming Modernism adopts the term terraforming from a largely science fiction canon, typically used to describe the imagined refashioning of extraterrestrial planets to make them more like Earth and more hospitable to human life. Ecocritics, techno-optimists, and others, however, have employed the term to discuss the transformation of nature on Earth; in these conversations, usually situated in the discourse of the Anthropocene, terraforming is invoked as the cause and/or cure of the world’s current ecological crisis. But an ambiguity in the word is neglected: terraforming indeed signifies earth-shaping, alterations to nature, through which humans impose their will upon an object; conversely, earth-shaping also suggests the Earth as an impersonal subject, a polymorphous nature always in the process of generating and altering its forms.These meanings are joined to develop a theory of modernism’s deep entanglement with nature, examining the way in which certain modernists view modernity and its artifice as part of nature. While modernists see their art as adding to and reconfiguring nature’s forms—i.e. terraforming—they do not see this production as opposed to nature or separate from its own processes. This account of modernism and modernity runs counter to many of the narratives currently existing that view these agents as deliberately self-fashioning an artifice intended to be anti-nature. Nature itself is in fact often presented as “modern,” as a principle of change and flux. Throughout, the double meaning of terraform is invoked to talk about the reciprocal relationship of modernism forming nature and nature forming modernism. The consequent picture of nature has significant implications within ecostudies: complicating, for example, theories that suggest that the rupture between nature and culture is the primary grounds for the violence humans inflict upon the nonhuman other; challenging the anthropocentrism within the discourse of the Anthropocene by always situating the human in a larger nonhuman or inhuman environment; and fighting the essentialism that sometimes comes through the backdoor in ecological scholarship, staunchly insisting instead on a polymorphous, historical, and mutative nature.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This narrative inquiry study illuminated the stories of Black men educational leaders who work to improve educational outcomes for other Black males. It began by exploring the concept of the Black male being perceived as a problem to be solved and explore the precarious relationship between the Black male and the educational system and society general. Utilizing Harper’s (2012) Anti-Deficit Achievement Framework, the researcher conducted interviews with 10 Black men educators and reviewed relevant documents that helped to elicit stories of how and why they come to engage in their current work, and what motivates them to continue. Findings indicated that in as much as the men had varied paths to their common vocation a recurring motivating theme was a sense of responsibility and desire to make a difference in the lives of young Black men.      </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>	The environmental impacts of COVID-19 and the “new normal” of working from home are being explored in the scientific community. However, there is currently no published study on the COVID-19 impacts to nitrate load via septic systems. This study aims to determine the increase of septic system sourced nitrate load due to the COVID-19 pandemic associated restrictions and stay-at-home orders. A field investigation was conducted to collect nitrogen data that were compared with historical data and used for model validation. The numerical model ArcNLET (Nitrate Load Estimation Toolkit) was used to simulate the nitrogen transport and estimate the nitrate load from septic systems to surface water bodies. Nitrate concentrations of surface waterbodies increased during the time of this study compared to baseline levels from a 2016-2018 nitrogen speciation study by an average ratio of 2.6. The new data collected in this study is integrated with various model scenarios to estimate the change in nitrate load to surface water bodies. Household nitrate load increase scenarios were determined to be reasonable, where the septic system sourced nitrate concentrations at the water table may have increased by up to or greater than three-fold in comparison to the baseline concentrations.  This study shows that the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated “new normal” led to an increase of nitrate load via septic systems within the study area. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>An Appropriate Age is a novel told through the alternating third-person perspectives of three women in the same family: Anna, Presley, and Gigi. It is divided into three parts. It is set in a fictional retirement community in central Florida, inspired by the actual largest retirement community in the United States: The Villages.  In the world of the novel everyone has an anecdote or two about the infamous residents of The Groves. However, Anna, Presley, and Gigi—connected by blood and with varying levels of proximity to The Groves—pull aside the velvet curtain: revealing the gears of the fastest-growing metropolitan area in the country, and the rural community it threatens to erase. The novel opens with Anna—twenty-five, recently home from Spain after a divorce and a diagnosis of a rare tumor—as she experiences her hometown through a new, nihilistic lens. Meanwhile, her cousin Presley, too young to remember life before The Groves, begins freshman year at the private high school attended only by the children of the developers. Gigi, Anna’s paternal grandmother, fears that The Groves, planning to double in size, will price her out of the place her family has called home for generations.
As Anna, Presley, and Gigi face forces larger than themselves—economic powers, failing bodies, the betrayal of those they trust—all three women begin to realize that they play a part in a larger, connected history. A history that is under threat, not only by environmental destruction, by also by false narratives: of a carefully crafted aesthetic, a palatable and profitable fantasy of an American hometown.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In the U.S., the education of children living in poverty has a history riddled with confounding challenges many of which are linked to a lack of fundamental resources and supports not only in the home but also in schools and within the community (Payne, 2005; Wils &amp; Bonnet, 2015). As early as the 1800s, there has been evidence of partnerships between schools, families, and communities; since then, however, many advancements have been made. While a variety of community partnership school models have been implemented around the country, what has unified these models has been that each of these educational institutions (PK-12) have sought to increase student potential through school-based systematic collaboration with legitimized partners from outside the traditional school day (City of New York City, 2017). This approach to education has proven to positively impact student outcomes in a holistic manner, building the capacity of parents and staff and strengthening structures even beyond the school walls to influence whole communities (Jehl, 2017). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>While such models have taken root in many cities and states across the U.S., within the state of Florida these models have only begun to gain ground. In fact, there are currently only fifteen official community partnership schools in the state.  This dissertation has taken a critical look at one of these schools in the Northwest Florida region which in 2017 became the first and only elementary community partnership school in Florida that had attained certification. In effort to support the potential of community partnership schools within the state and region, the purpose of this dissertation was to define the benefits and challenges of community partnership schools as seen through the eyes of three primary stakeholder groups: school, family, and community. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Through this triadic lens, the primary researcher highlights five primary and recurring themes derived from case study interviews across stakeholder participant groups. These findings included an uncommon level of support made available to students from low income households, enhanced teacher job satisfaction and capacity as well as participant-observed reduction in teacher turnover, an advanced capacity to serve through cross-sector partnership collaboration, a continued struggle to maintain desired levels of parental engagement, and a need to continue to define feasible and appropriate approaches to enabling service-population self-sufficiency.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Publicness is a critical concept in the field of public administration as it relates to the unique characteristics of public organizations. Not surprisingly, publicness has long been studied in the public administration literature, mostly centering on how organizational publicness affects organizational outcomes. Despite the large body of scholarship on publicness, what is still missing from the literature is how publicness elicits organizational outcomes. One way to uncover this missing link is by analyzing the multi-level nature of publicness. As the multi-level publicness framework involves individual, organizational, and institutional characteristics in examining publicness, it serves to clarify mechanisms underlying how publicness contributes to achieving intended results from a wider perspective. Therefore, the purpose of this dissertation is to explore publicness dynamics at the macro and micro level. More specifically, this study aims to answer questions such as how publicness is shaped by the institutions within which the focal organization is situated and how employees understand publicness in their work settings. Furthermore, this study examines how institutional forces and individuals’ perceptions of publicness influence organizations’ choices and strategies. To answer these questions, this dissertation involves three separate but related studies. The first employs multiple regression analysis to examine the effects of various institutional features of publicness on hospitals’ cross-sector collaborative activities for community benefit. This study finds that regulatory publicness, normative publicness, and cultural publicness each influence hospitals’ external collaboration in public value creation. The second study is qualitative and based on in-depth conversations with government employees regarding how they understand publicness. Participants’ rich stories reveal that practitioners view publicness in a more broad and nuanced way. Lastly, the third study is a follow-up of the second, in which a measure of felt publicness is developed and validated via confirmatory factor analysis using a survey.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Considering the effects of public and non-profit managers’ actions in federal-level programs and community services at the local level, my dissertation seeks to contribute to three separate bodies of scholarship: public and non-profit management, organizational behavior, and the institutional logic framework. The three essays in my dissertation specifically explore organizational improvement and change in public and non-profit organizations through a variety of lenses. The first two essays use quantitative panel data covering 10 years of program performance information and feedback in order to examine how public agency executives respond to past and present performance information to improve organizational outcomes. More specifically, the first essay in chapter two suggests a new classification of distinct responses from diverse performance feedback signals, in an attempt to consider how different performance information signals lead to performance improvement. The second essay in chapter three builds a theory of public management decision-making processes based on feedback-seeking behavior of public managers in which their problem identification leads to performance improvement. The third essay in chapter four employs a qualitative analysis of public, non-profit, and quasi-non-profit (hybrid) organizations to examine how organizational change occurs in a variety of forms in collaborative governance contexts. Taken together, these essays illuminate a broad scope of organizational learning and change.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This exploratory, mixed-methods study aspired to learn more about teachers’ experiences, their perceptions of self-efficacy (SE), their posttraumatic growth (PTG) outcomes, and their sensemaking surrounding these interrelated factors within a post-natural disaster context (Hurricane Michael). Through this inquiry, I primarily hoped to understand better how to support teachers in these situations for their own well-being and development which would in turn be beneficial to their students. Ten teachers from a public school within a community adversely affected by Hurricane Michael participated in the study. To investigate these themes, teachers’ SE and PTG were assessed quantitatively through survey data but also qualitatively through the evidence that emerged from semi-structured interviews. The degree to which teachers experienced the hurricane as well as demographic information was also included in the survey. Teachers reported moderate to high levels of professional efficacy and moderate posttraumatic growth. Teachers’ SE, PTG, sense-making, and experiences emerged as an ecology reflective of Urie Bronfenbrenner’s Bioecological Model of Human Development and Process, Person, Context, Time (PPCT) theory. Teachers’ response to and development following a natural disaster were shaped by Centrality of Event, their personal characteristics (Force, Demand, and Resource), their access to and participation in a network of proximal processes, and the passage of time. The complex nature of teachers’ development post-disaster points to the importance of proximal processes, adult psychological development, and the need for exploring problems in education through an ecological lens.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Prevention efforts that focus on parents are efficacious in reducing rates of child behavioral and emotional problems, and some work has shown that changes in child behavior is mediated by positive changes to parenting skills. However, the reach of parent skills training programs remains limited, particularly in preventive parenting interventions. This lack of engagement has negative implications for children and families, for quality of research, and for disseminability of preventive parenting interventions. Some evidence suggests that including neuroscience explanations can increase subjective credibility and favorability ratings of information. In this study, I examined whether the inclusion of neuroscience information pertaining to child development and parent skills training enhanced parental intent-to-enroll. In a sample of 166 parents with at least one child aged 5-12, two methods of advertising a preventive parent skills training program were directly compared using short video presentations. Parents who did not receive neuroscience information self-reported lower interest in learning new parenting skills after watching an informational video compared with parents who did receive neuroscience information. However, there were no significant differences between conditions in behavioral measures of intent-to-enroll, including number of mouse clicks, amount of time spent on a page of parenting resources, and requests to receive parenting resources. These findings provide preliminary evidence that the inclusion of neuroscience information may enhance parental initial engagement in parent skills training, specifically parental interest in learning new parenting skills.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Extratropical cyclones are responsible for the generation of large amounts of latent andsensible heat fluxes over the ocean. These fluxes are the main mechanism by which the ocean
influences the atmosphere. Extratropical cyclones that form in the Atlantic interact with the
relatively warm western boundary current known as the Gulf Stream. Surface currents in the
Gulf Stream are much faster than the surrounding ocean. Previous studies have shown that
including ocean currents in the calculation of fluxes can cause latent and sensible heat flux to
change.
Ocean and atmospheric reanalysis of extratropical cyclones from 1994-2015 are used to
study the impacts that surface ocean currents can have on the latent and sensible heat fluxes
generated by extratropical cyclones. Fluxes are calculated using a method developed by Kara et
al. (2000) and the effect of the current is represented by replacing the 10m windspeed used in the
calculation with the magnitude of the vector difference between the windspeed and the current
speed: i.e., using surface relative winds rather than Earth relative winds. Changes are widely
variable but typical changes are 10-30 Wm-1 for both sensible and latent heat flux.
The largest changes in flux occurred in areas of highest current, but that change is
dependent on other factors such as windspeed, air-sea temperature difference, and air-sea
humidity difference. Currents can impact flux gradients depending on the locations of greatest
changes. It was found that the impact of currents will result in decreased flux values in the cold
sector of extratropical cyclones (the area where the greatest magnitudes of flux are produced).
This study shows the importance of accurately representing the ocean in models of weather and
climate. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This treatise proposes an approach for teaching music students with dyslexia using Orton-Gillingham techniques. The Orton-Gillingham Approach takes a structured, multisensory approach that can be used as a template for teaching music students. Orton-Gillingham addresses the encoding and decoding skills necessary for learning to read and write in one's spoken dialect. This treatise presents proposed adaptations to Orton-Gillingham methods that will meet the needs of those learning to read and write within the context of the language of music. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Historically-oriented and revisionist scholars advance two main approaches to contemporary just war thinking. Historically-oriented scholars argue for the continued use of historic just war thinking as it has provided sufficient, substantial, and extensive consensus regarding just war criteria. Revisionists, however, argue that this approach has enabled unjust wars through statist and collectivist emphases, which has resulted in producing unique moral norms for war. Therefore, revisionists argue that just war criteria should be defined by universal moral norms of justified violence and revolve around individuals rather than political entities. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In particular, two of the most prominent revisionists, Jeff McMahan and Cécile Fabre emphasize the primacy of individuals and their rights by arguing for war as morally symmetrical to cases of self-defense. Revisionists claim to focus on the moral principles of just war criteria rather than the historical formation of the just war tradition. The revisionists’ moral principles approach has led to several controversial conclusions that reorder, revise, or reject historical just war criteria. In response to these “revisions”, scholars’ primary attention has revolved around revisionists’ controversial ethical conclusions. Revisionists’ methodological and political claims, however, have received far less attention. Therefore, my dissertation discusses and critiques revisionists’ method and the political theory which significantly influences and motivates their approach. I argue that revisionists’ method is inadequate for its ahistorical approach and mischaracterization of the historic just war tradition. In contrast, I argue for James Turner Johnson’s historical-oriented approach, which emphasizes utilizing past just war thinkers’ moral, political, and pragmatic wisdom to guide political leaders in the restraint and application of armed force.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Additionally, I display the way in which classical and modern just war thinking is derived from one’s political theory. More specifically, I argue that the revisionist approach to the use of armed force is based on an individualistic political vision resulting in an atomistic and reductive instrumentalization of political life. Revisionist political theory emphasizes the primacy of individuals and their rights without properly acknowledging the importance of humans’ communal context and the non-material goods of political community. Revisionists’ individualistic priority is seen most clearly in their rejection of the criterion of legitimate authority. They claim that this criterion is particularly problematic in the context of armed rebellion against political tyranny. Therefore, revisionist just war thinking attempts to jettison the primary criterion on which classical just war thinking was based. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para> By way of contrast, I present Thomas Aquinas as a historical just war thinker who defends the centrality of the criterion of legitimate authority in just war thinking even in the context of a justified armed rebellion. Further, I argue that Aquinas’ account of legitimate authority is to be preferred for the way in which it is tied to his larger political framework, which promotes an interdependent conception of human flourishing in the context of political community. Aquinas’ communitarian political perspective is based on political leaders who maintain an other-regarding orientation by serving their citizens in protecting and cultivating the common good for the flourishing of all. This political approach highlights the reality of human interdependence and the intrinsic value of political life. Further, given the political nature of war and the depiction of political authorities as representatives of their communities, I argue that the criterion of legitimate authority is not an antiquated relic of the past, but the central criterion on which just war thinking should be based. The criterion of legitimate authority for just war thinking should not be “jettisoned” but emphasized as vital for theory and practice. Therefore, the political theory which grounds and motivates just war thinking is of utmost importance in determining which method and theory will best lead to the articulation, defense, and application of just war criteria in the contemporary era. In contrast to revisionist method and theory, I argue that a Thomistic approach that draws on the historical just war tradition and a communitarian political foundation provides a richer and more adequate account on which to base future just war thinking.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>ABSTRACT</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation examines the realization of vowel sequences across word boundaries in Arabic-Spanish bilinguals and Spanish monolinguals in Puerto Rico, as in the phrase hombre inteligente ‘intelligent man’. Spanish and Arabic have different syllable structures, which cause differences in their strategies of resyllabification. The onset is obligatory in Arabic (Abu-Salim, 1982; Broselow, 2017; Watson, 2007), while this is not the case in Spanish (Hualde, 2014). In Arabic then, resyllabification occurs to accommodate syllable weight and comply with the permitted types of syllables in the language. Conversely, in Spanish vowel sequences may be realized as hiatus, diphthongized, or coalesced. In addition, one vowel may be elided, and infrequently, epenthesis can occur. Given these linguistic differences between Arabic and Spanish, the aim of the present study was to examine how Arabic-Spanish bilinguals are affected by the linguistic constraints of Arabic when resyllabifying vowel sequences across word boundaries in Spanish. Linguistic factors including stress, vowel height, and word length, among others, were examined. Additionally, this study aimed to investigate how the social factors language dominance, age of acquisition, gender and age affect these realizations. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In order to examine vowel sequences across word boundaries, a reading task and sociolinguistic interviews were used. Bilingual participants also completed the Bilingual Language Profile questionnaire in Spanish (Birdsong, Gertken &amp; Amengual, 2012) to elicit information on language dominance, proficiency, age of acquisition, and language use. The participants in the reading task were divided among 10 monolinguals and 14 bilinguals, with a gender distribution of nine women (six monolingual, three bilingual) and 15 men (four monolingual, 11 bilingual); age range 19-65 years. The participants for the sociolinguistic interviews consisted of four monolingual men and 11 bilingual men; age range 19-55 years. All participants had at least an Associate’s degree. A total of 1921 tokens were produced in the reading task and 427 tokens were produced in the sociolinguistic interviews. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The findings of the present study showed that Arabic-Spanish bilinguals and Spanish monolinguals differed in their realization of vowel sequences. Bilinguals employed a strategy of glottal epenthesis more frequently than their monolingual counterparts in both tasks, although this was not significant. However, the results also showed that bilinguals diphthongized sequences significantly more than monolinguals. Within the bilingual group, those who were dominant in Arabic glottalized significantly more than Spanish-dominant bilinguals in both tasks. However, an examination of the sociolinguistic interviews showed that Spanish-dominant bilinguals favored more reduced forms (diphthongization, elision, coalescence). In both tasks, monolinguals’ and bilinguals’ realizations were significantly impacted by the linguistic factors stress and vowel height. Sequences where one of the vowels was a low or mid vowel were conducive to realizations of vowel retention (i.e., glottalization, hiatus, or two homogeneous vowels), while sequences containing a high or low vowel were conducive to reduction (diphthongization, elision, coalescence). When one of the two vowels in contact was stressed, particularly the second vowel of the sequence, reduction was less likely.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>These findings show that language dominance strongly impacts how vowel sequences are realized in Arabic-Spanish bilinguals. Language dominance appeared to be a stronger indication of phonetic outcomes than age of acquisition in these bilinguals. Lastly, although infrequently, the results also showed that monolinguals of Puerto Rican Spanish utilize glottal epenthesis between vowels as a stratey for hiatus resolution. The findings suggest that there are universal linguistic conditions that favor glottalization, in addition to factors associated with bilingualism, such as language dominance and the onset of bilingualism.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>“Every Man is Now in the Market” is a study of informal institutional change in medieval Liguria during the second half of the thirteenth century.  Informal institutions are social rules that are enforced by commonly held values and norms, rather than by any law.  The goal of this study is to use this methodology to consider the active role of the Genoese laity in articulating a Christian identity for commerce.  For the Genoese laity, the performance of commercial labor and the legitimacy of profits derived from trade were deemed acceptable within the Christian moral worldview.  By the thirteenth century, the medieval economy was increasingly oriented toward the exchange value of goods as opposed to immediate consumption, meaning that the scope of trade was geographically expanded and invited investment cooperation between multiple partners.  Traditional religious attitudes toward commercialization tended to stigmatize commerce, warning of the danger of avarice and greed, the corruptibility of money, and encouraging the rejection of worldly wealth.  Over the course of the thirteenth century scholastic theologians helped mediate commerce and Christianity, producing sophisticated treatises on economic thought and market behavior, but the scholastic and clerical perspectives on the dangers and benefits of commerce have been emphasized over that of the laity who lived and worked in the market.  When it comes to the laity, twentieth century scholars of economic history have tended to associate commercial sophistication with a de-emphasis on personal piety, resulting in a conception of medieval merchants as prototypical capitalists struggling against old world values.  This thesis challenges this view by using the methodologies of informal institutionalization and stigma management to bring together a wide range of sources, including statutes, commercial contracts, hagiography, and land leases to uncover the role of the laity in articulating their own ideals of Christian commerce.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This thesis argues that commerce became informally institutionalized in three sectors of civic and spiritual life.  Chapter one examines the emergence of lay associative life in Genoa in relation to the broader religious movements of Northern Italy.  These groups functioned as accommodating informal institutions that provided internal ordering and external advocacy, enabling membership in a community which provided a more intimate role in the practice of their religion while also fostering individual connections, group solidarity, and a positive public image for commercial trades.  Chapter two explores the process of creating a religious identity for Christian merchants through the elaboration of positive and negative aspects of the stigma.  The vitae and miracles of thirteenth-century lay saints with commercial occupations are analyzed as a form of celebrity stigma, providing positive associations for commercial trades.  References to negative traits such as avarice in penitential literature need not reflect a tension between Christianity and commerce, but instead show the successful identity construction of the archetypal Christian merchant. This served to integrate commerce into a penitential framework, helping to regulate commerce by associating immoral activity with non-Christian identity, encouraging Christians active in commerce to turn to confessors for guidance in commercial life. The third chapter will sketch out the charitable landscape of thirteenth century Genoa, highlighting the prevalence of lay bequests and gifts to hospitals.  This chapter will consider charity not only in terms of the alienation of money toward an institution, but also the voluntary donation of time and labor by laypeople, though the two often went hand in hand. These hospitals were patronized and staffed predominantly by laypeople, but their ties with the laity went beyond their walls.  Land around the hospitals was often denoted in rent agreements as developed, partially developed, or undeveloped, and the latter two types often included rent estimated per tavola instead of in a lump sum.  These commercial tenants were invited to improve and build on the land that they occupied, increasing the value of the hospital’s patrimony while also integrating themselves into its social network and living in close proximity to an institution of misericordia.  The concluding chapter uses an excerpt from the Anonimo Genovese, an anonymous poet active between 1290-1310, to recapitulate the argument and offer some thoughts on the sustained relevance of the Christian merchant identity into the fourteenth century and beyond.  </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation presents a survey of ab initio models developed based on the merger of multireference (MR) methods and density functional theory (DFT) in order to provide an accurate and efficient description of electron correlation effects in strongly correlated systems. We first introduce a reduced density matrix (RDM)-based formulation of multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory (MC-PDFT) which addresses two of the three common problems in MR+DFT framework: double counting of the electron correlation and symmetry dilemma. MC-PDFT minimizes the double counting of electron correlation by computing the classical effects within MR part while accounting for quantum mechanical interactions via DFT part. Symmetry dilemma is also addressed through a change of variables from spin densities to on-top pair-density (OTPD). In order to resolve the third issue in MR+DFT framework, the computational cost barrier of the MR methods, we adopt the variational two-electron reduced density matrix (v2RDM)-driven complete active-space self-consistent field (CASSCF) approach. The favorable polynomial computational cost of v2RDM-CASSCF allows one to go beyond the active space size limitations of conventional configuration interaction (CI)-based MR methods. In order to reduce the delocalization error (DE) plaguing almost all density functionals, we extend MC-PDFT to its global and range-separated hybrid variants where a fraction of local exchange from OTPD functionals is replaced with its nonlocal counterpart computed by v2RDM-CASSCF reference RDMs. The efficiency and accuracy of our MC-PDFT-based models have also been demonstrated through their application to a wide variety of realistic and challenging molecular systems with dominant MR character such as the calculation of dissociation potential energy curves for di- and polyatomic molecules, reaction energy barriers of 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction of ozone to ethylene and acetylene and singlet/triplet energy gaps of large members of oligocene molecular series. After providing numerical evidence for usefulness of our models for strongly correlated systems, we focus on the sources of errors and metrics for error quantification in DFT. Through introducing constrained search-Kohn-Sham density functional theory (CS-KSDFT), we have addressed two fundamental and controversial problems in KS-DFT: inaccessibility of the exact density within finite basis set and lack of a universal mathematical metric for the density error. Applying CS-KSDFT to strongly correlated systems, such as the triple-bond dissociation of N2, we have numerically showed that non-interacting KS-DFT electron densities can be far more accurate than those calculated by the conventional exchange-correlation (XC) functionals, regardless of the size of the basis set. By applying our basis set-independent metric</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>to rank the performance of conventional density functionals for strongly correlated systems, we have numerically presented that the errors caused by the approximate forms of XC functionals (as opposed to density-driven errors) are the main source of error in KS-DFT. Lastly, we have analyzed the contentious onset of open-shell character in the singlet ground state zig-zag narrow graphene nanoribbons via a variety of metrics such as effectively unpaired electrons, natural orbital occupation numbers, singlet/triplet energy gaps and structural indicator of C–C bond length alternation.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Above the Waterline is a literary family novel of about 78,000 words. The Kurkjians, an Armenian-American family who live on the island of Grosse Ile outside Detroit, are reeling from the death of Mari Kurkjian, the eldest member of their youngest generation, after she swam into Lake Michigan with no intent of returning to shore. As her family attempts to cope with her suicide, their shortcomings and secrets rise to the surface, all while they live in the shadow of the epic mythos of Mari’s great grandfather, who fought for his freedom on the peak of Musa Dagh during the Armenian Genocide. In the vein of Tommy Orange’s There There and Kamila Shamsie’s Home Fire, Above the Waterline is told from the Kurkjian family’s varying perspectives over the course of one tragic summer.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This treatise serves two primary goals. The first is to showcase three of Sérgio Assad’s Portraits for solo guitar, Eli’s Portrait, Sandy’s Portrait, and David’s Portrait. Each chapter on these works will provide biographical information on each Portrait’s dedicatee before analyzing the compositions and discussing performance considerations. Guitarists studying these works will learn about important figures in the guitar community including pedagogues, performers, and donors. Second, this treatise provides an extension to the previous research on Assad, specifically, Dr. João Paulo Figueirôa da Cruz’s treatise, An Annotated Bibliography of Works by the Brazilian Composer Sérgio Assad. Appendix A of this treatise, Assad’s Solo Works 2008–2020, is an annotated bibliography picking up where Figueirôa’s bibliography ends. This treatise provides a valuable reference to those studying the music of Sérgio Assad. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Tomographic reconstruction is a method for obtaining a three dimensional image of a specimen with a series of two dimensional projection images of the specimen taken from different tilt or projection angles. There are mainly two factors that can affect the quality of a reconstruction. When the signal-to-noise ratio from the projection images is low, the tomographic reconstruction can be noisy. And due to the instrumental limitation, the projection images cannot be taken for certain angle ranges, which incurs missing wedge of information. Tomographic reconstruction with the missing wedge contains signiﬁcant image blurring and image artifacts due to the missing wedge. This dissertation presents three new approaches to largely mitigate the effect of noise and missing wedge.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We ﬁrst propose a novel ﬁltered backprojection that optimizes the ﬁlter of the backprojection operator in terms of a reconstruction error. This data-dependent ﬁlter adaptively chooses the spectral domains of signals and noises, suppressing the noise frequency bands, so it is very effective in denoising. We also propose the new ﬁltered backprojection embedded within the simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique for mitigating the effect of missing wedge. The third approach considers a number of possible shapes of a specimen and allows data to choose the most plausible shape through the proposed maximum likelihood modeling. The estimated object shape is used to inﬁll the missing information, and the reconstruction can be then achieved with a combination of the estimated information and observed sinograms.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We present the numerical performance of the proposed approaches with various simulated scenarios and real data studies in electron tomographic reconstruction of nanoparticles and compare the results with other existing tomographic reconstruction methods. Our numerical studies show the performance gain of the proposed approaches over the state-of-the-art.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Introduction: Social support and loneliness have been identified as important factors in mental and physical health. People with social anxiety disorder (SAD) often report low levels of social support and high levels of loneliness (Alden &amp; Taylor, 2010). Fear of intimacy, or someone’s reluctance to share personal thoughts, feelings and struggles with others, has been linked to poor romantic relationship satisfaction (Bartholomew, 1990; Descutner &amp; Thelen, 1991; Emmons &amp; Colby, 1995) and is also associated with lower social support and greater social anxiety. Building Closer Friendships (BCF) was developed to increase social support and reduce loneliness through reducing fear of intimacy in individuals with SAD. The current study was a preliminary test of this intervention.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Method: A sample of individuals with current SAD (N = 55), were randomized to BCF or waitlist control conditions. Participants completed self-report measures of fear of intimacy, loneliness, and social support at baseline, mid-treatment, post-treatment, and one-month follow-up, and completed additional measures of social anxiety, depression, general anxiety symptoms and suicide vulnerability throughout the study. An in vivo conversation task (with an actor) was also administered at post-treatment to assess distress and perceived disclosure, warmth, and friendliness of participants when interacting with a stranger.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Results: In the full randomized sample, the BCF group reported lower fear of intimacy at post-treatment compared to the control group. Among completers, BCF led to lower fear of intimacy at post-treatment and follow-up, and lower loneliness and depression at follow-up compared to the waitlist control. No treatment effects were found in the conversation task or with other symptom outcomes, including social anxiety. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Discussion: This preliminary study found modest support for BCF as a computerized intervention to reduce fear of intimacy and loneliness in individuals with SAD. Limitations, clinical implications, and directions for future research are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Osteoporosis is characterized as a disease of low bone density and increased fragility, which results in more than 8.9 million fractures annually, approximately one fracture every three seconds. Although osteoporosis is mainly present in female populations, men over the age of 50 also experience gradual bone loss. Hence, 39% of all osteoporosis related fractures result in men. Dietary interventions have been shown to benefit bone health in postmenopausal women. However, the mechanisms of action are not completely understood. There is evidence that the polarization state of macrophages may influence bone anabolism, where M2 polarized macrophage have been shown to secrete osteogenic factors that promote bone anabolism.The purpose of this research was to investigate the effects of dried plum supplementation on modulating cytokines involved in macrophage polarization, osteoblast differentiation biomarkers, and functional outcomes of bone health in osteopenic men. Sixty men (Group A, n=24; Group B, n=23; Group C, n=13) between the ages of 55 and 80 with moderate bone loss (T-score between -0.1 and -2.5 SD below the mean) were included in this study. Group A, B, and C consumed 100g, 50g, or 0g of dried plums daily for six months, respectively. All three groups also consumed a multivitamin containing 450mg calcium and 800 IU vitamin D.  Serum samples of 49 participants (Group A n=18, Group B n=18, and Group C n=13) were analyzed at baseline, three months, and six months for concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-4 (IL-4), bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-Β ligand RANKL, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). DXA scans were performed to measure site specific bone mineral density and bone mineral content at baseline, three months, and six months.
Our results indicate that after supplementation of dried plums for six months there was no significant differences for anthropometric or body composition measurements. Neither dried plum group had a protective effect on bone density, however, there was a time dependent decrease in left hip BMD  at six months compared to three months (p &lt;0.05) and radius BMD at three months compared to baseline (p &lt;0.05). A significant time*treatment effect was detected for concentrations of TNF-α for both dried plum groups compared to control. There were no significant differences for any of the other serum biomarkers assessed. Furthermore, there were no significant correlations between baseline BMD values and baseline concentrations of blood biomarkers.
The results of our study indicate that six months of dried plum supplementation in men with moderate bone loss does not have bone protective properties. Perhaps, the participants in our study did not have a sufficient degree of bone loss at baseline to experience benefits from dried plums. Furthermore, our study demonstrated that dried plums attenuate increases in TNF-α, which is a proinflammatory cytokine that is involved in M1 macrophage polarization. Future research should focus on a wider range of baseline BMD scores, and should assess other biomarkers associated with macrophage polarization states to fully understand the relationship between the immune system and bone.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Density, or the number of individuals per unit area, is known to have substantial effects on individual organisms and on populations. In particular, densities at small spatial scales often affect species interactions, e.g., predation and resource competition. Because of this, variation in local densities within a population (e.g., when individuals are patchily distributed) may lead to differences among individuals in interaction strength and fitness. Previous work shows that variance in local density can influence populations by affecting population growth independently of total density or by selecting for traits that maximize density-dependent performance. Determining the consequences of local density dependence is therefore critical for understanding how interactions occurring among individuals translate into patterns of population growth and phenotypic change through time. However, our ability to predict the long-term or large-scale effects of local density is limited by many factors. Specifically, we lack empirical data describing the spatial scale(s) at which density dependence occurs, a mechanism for integrating the direct and indirect effects of local density across life stages, and studies that address how local densities affect both ecological and evolutionary processes.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this dissertation, I addressed these gaps using a combination of experiments and modeling. Specifically, I (1) investigated how densities at hierarchical scales affect individual performance across the life cycle, (2) determined how the effects of local density integrate across individuals to shape population-level patterns of selection, and (3) quantified genetic and environmental sources of variation in phenotypes that help to set the local densities experienced by individuals. These studies are based on a specialist leaf beetle, Leptinotarsa juncta, and its interactions with its host plant (Solanum carolinense) and a community of generalist predators. As is the case with many insects, populations of L. juncta tend to be patchy, with substantial spatial variation in local densities.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>For the first study, I manipulated the density of immature L. juncta at three nested spatial scales (patch, plant within a patch, and leaf within plant) to determine how local densities affect predator-mediated survival and resource-mediated growth across multiple life stages. My results showed that the effects of local L. juncta density on individual performance varied with spatial scale, with some consistency in the direction of these effects across life stages. For example, survival of both eggs and late-instar larvae was higher on plants with low L. juncta densities and in patches with high L. juncta densities. The greater final mass of larvae at low plant-scale densities additionally suggests that the reduction in plant-scale larval density due to predation is beneficial for survivors. These findings demonstrate the role of spatial scale in mediating the effects of density-dependent interactions and reveal the interdependence of predator- and resource-mediated effects of density across the life cycle.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>For the second study, I developed and parameterized a novel structured population model in which both life stage and conspecific density are predictors of individual vital rates. Using evolutionary analyses, I quantified how both the direct and indirect effects of particular density-dependent interactions affect fitness. I additionally demonstrated that local and population densities jointly affect the strength and shape of selection on traits such as clutch size and sensitivity to local density (via reduced growth), while evolutionarily stable clutch size depends on the factor that most limits oviposition (e.g., time constraints, egg availability, or both). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>For the third study, I used maternal families of L. juncta to examine how genetic and environmental factors affect the expression of traits that help determine local densities. Specifically, I measured clutch size, egg size, egg cannibalism, larval aggregation, and larval movement among host plants for several maternal families; I also characterized density-dependent reaction norms for a subset of these traits (egg cannibalism, larval aggregation, and larval movement). I found evidence of genetic variance in some, but not all, of these traits. In contrast, density-dependent plasticity was common. For all three traits measured, at least some of the maternal families exhibited plastic responses to local density. These findings establish the evolutionary potential of some density-determining traits, suggesting that phenotypic evolution may play a role in shaping patterns of local density within populations.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Together, this research demonstrates the critical role of local density dependence in both ecological and evolutionary processes and suggests that feedbacks between individual traits and emergent spatial patterns are an important source of eco-evolutionary feedbacks in natural populations.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This qualitative study seeks to make meaning of the lived experiences of Black women administrators serving in senior housing officer (SHO) roles at predominantly White institutions (PWIs.) This study will highlight the intersection of participants’ racial and gender identities to understand how their identities contributed to their experiences as senior housing officers. As Black women are often faced with dual forms of oppression, racism and sexism, this study will use a narrative inquiry approach to capture voices that are often silenced in the academy. Black feminist thought will serve as a theoretical framework to allow narratives from Black women to illuminate the experiences of Black women serving in critical roles in housing and residence life programs at PWIs. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Religious topics and themes have been represented in classical music literature throughout history. This treatise considers Christian religious themes expressed in two selected piano works by Korean composers: Talitha Cumi by Won-Jung Lee and Via Dolorosa by Eunseon Yu. It reveals how each composer represented Christian values, biblical stories, and religious concepts through their own musical languages. Essential elements of the music and the composers’ intentions are examined through style analysis in conjunction with my personal interviews with the composers. They are discussed alongside aspects of biblical symbols and meanings behind the music and the biblical stories with which the pieces are associated. Through this analysis, performers can more accurately and sensitively interpret and express the deeper meanings in these pieces and guide listeners’ experience of the music.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>While the electrochemical energy storage systems are paving their ways to solve the existing theoretical energy and power challenges, alternative cell chemistries are highly desirable. Lithium-Ion Capacitors (LIC) and Hybrid Lithium-Ion Capacitors (HLIC) incorporate the fundamental properties of intercalation/deintercalation-based Lithium-Ion Battery (LIB) materials and adsorption/desorption-based Electric Double Layer Capacitor (EDLC) materials. The combination of battery and capacitor components assist in bridging the gap between the high power-low energy EDLCs, and high energy-low power LIBs. The presence of the battery-like material is essential for providing energy in a sustained period of time; however, these materials impose long-term capacity fade based on their extent of utilization during the redox reactions. In this report, initially, the importance of a balanced design for the anode to cathode capacity ratio in the LIC consisting of Activated Carbon (AC) cathode and Hard Carbon (HC) anode was studied. We showed that increasing the HC:AC capacity ratio from 1.1. to 3 promoted higher capacity retention at both low and high current rates (C-rates). Also, the EIS characterization at different State of Charges (SOCs) was conducted to help us elucidate the Lithium-ion  (Li+)  kinetics inside the  LICs with different  HC:AC  capacity ratios. The finding from the Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) characteristics was further verified using the 3-electrode galvanostatic tests and showed a direct correlation between the HC:AC capacity ratio and HC’s degree of utilization. It was demonstrated that battery-like HC anode can maintain better long-term capacity retention, EIS characteristics, and potential swings if its capacity ratio is at least three times larger than that of the AC cathode.
Furthermore, the anode/cathode matching capacity technique was used in a HLIC based on battery-like Lithium Ferro Phosphate (LiFePO4 abbreviated as LFP) and highly porous capacitor-like AC hybrid cathode and HC anode. Investigating the impedance characteristics of the HLIC allowed us to gain a better understanding of the synergies between the AC-LFP composite materials. In particular, different active materials dominated the impedance response of the hybrid cell at different voltages, highlighting the need for analyzing individual components’ contributions. The use of the Lithium metal electrode (Li-metal) in half-cells enabled the quantitative measurements of the counter-electrode. However, our results indicated that the presence of the Li-metal perturbed the EIS response due to the continuous reconstruction of the Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) layer at different SOCs. Using the aforementioned capacity design, a novel EIS measurement approach based on full-cells was introduced, where anode to cathode capacity ratio was accurately designed to minimize or maximize anode’s contribution to the cell impedance. Namely, the Li-metal in half-cell was replaced by a carbon-based anode that only operated in its pre-deintercalation potential region. We demonstrated that the absence of the redox reactions in this region allowed for the HC anode to act as a neutral electrode. Moreover, our Electric Circuit Models (ECM) showed that a parallel LFP-AC impedance unit in the hybrid cell was a reasonable model to visualize the synergy between the LFP and AC materials.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Estimating a treatment effect is problematic when selection bias exists. This dissertation sought to elucidate the problem of estimating the treatment effect size of the Response-to-Intervention (RTI) policy when selection bias exists. In this study, students were assigned to either Tier 1 or Tier 2 based on a cut score determined in the RTI framework. In addition, it was possible for a teacher to override the assignment of a student to a tier. How a student is assigned to a tier, whether through test-score assignment or teacher-decision assignment, determines the estimation of the growth outcome for individual students. Indeed, the overridden treatment recipients are a source of the estimation difference.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>However, there is no systematic research on the relationship between selection bias and the degree to which the distribution of true tier effects varies across samples and settings depending on the assignment of different tiers. For that reason, I fill this gap in research by using override probability models to evaluate the biasing impact on the estimation of each tier treatment effect. The objective of this study was to demonstrate how the mechanism of educator override decisions affects the estimation of the treatment effect.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The override model’s outcome estimates were compared with the non-override model’s results as follows: First, initial sample scores (e.g., true scores, observed scores) were randomly generated from a standard normal distribution at Time 1. Second, based on a cut score, students were assigned to each tier. Third, difference-in-difference (DID) estimates of the mean difference parameter of Tier 2 incremental growth were calculated under each override condition. Finally, the bias and root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of parameter estimates were compared across all the conditions.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The results showed that the bias of the extra Tier 2 effect parameter estimate is almost negligible. Also, the bias of the extra Tier 2 effect estimate is being (disproportionally) identified, as an override function is considered in the model. It is notable the interaction between override size and sample size had a large effect size for the bias of the extra Tier 2 effect estimate. Only sample size mattered for the RMSE of the extra Tier 2 growth rate parameter estimate. However, the finding that increasing sample size entails decreasing RMSE is not very surprising. The biasing impact (due to educator override) unequally occurred for the growth rates of the treated and untreated groups (i.e., the difference in the two-tier growth rates stayed different). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Tier 1’s growth (π) parameter estimate was more saliently biased, especially by the interaction of the override size and the override shape, along with the main effect of override size and override shape. The right unbalanced override model (RUOM) obtained the least bias than the balanced override model (BOM). When we consider a fact that the individuals who are close to a cut point have higher measurement errors, a newly constructed Tier 1 memberships by overrides are more reliable. In consequence, this can enable the RUOM’s Tier 1 growth rate (π) estimate to be similar to that of NOM. This might be the reason why the RUOM gets less bias than the BOM did. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In sum, the bias occurs not equally for both tiers due to the override. Thus, it is hard to trust the evaluations of the RTI effect, without the estimation of overrides in the RTI framework. Nevertheless, the result on the extra Tier 2 growth rate (i.e., a mean-difference parameter) estimates could be different from that of the present study depending on the design. A remedy is that another Tier 1 effect can be additionally estimated, by using control classrooms that do not have an RTI policy. Future studies may be needed to address both a class that does not use RTI to estimate Tier 1 and a class that uses RTI to estimate Tier 2.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Late spring or early summer brings an abrupt onset of a wet season to Peninsular Florida (PF). High daily rain rates are sustained throughout the summer until the demise of the wet season in autumn. Prediction of the Peninsular Florida Wet Season (PFWS) is important for Florida’s agriculture industry, wildfire management, and water resource management. The onset and demise of the PFWS coincide with seasonal changes in the nearby ocean and atmospheric circulations, including the seasonal migration of the North Atlantic subtropical high (NASH). Yet, predictability of summer season precipitation in PF remains low compared to that of the winter season, which has a teleconnection with ENSO. This paper includes a skill assessment of the Community Climate System Model, version 4 (CCSM4) in predicting 1983–2015 summer season precipitation in PF, as well as the dates of onset and demise of the PFWS, using metrics of deterministic and probabilistic skill at hindcast lead times of 0–11 months. In the deterministic skill perspective, CCSM4 shows low skill in predicting the summer season precipitation and the dates of onset and demise of the PFWS, with high error values, low correlation, and high ensemble spread. CCSM4 has a late bias in predicting the onset and demise dates of the PFWS, and the late bias of the onset dates increases with hindcast lead time. For the probabilistic skill assessment, Relative Operating characteristic Curves (ROCs) are employed. The ROC scores indicate that CCSM4 may be skillful in predicting early onsets and late demises of the PFWS at some lead times but show no skill in predicting late onsets or early demises of the PFWS. Hindcasts of total seasonal rainfall amounts are generally unskillful, regardless of how the season is defined. Motivated by the role of the seasonal migration of the NASH in the timing of the onset of the PFWS and the finding of a late bias in the prediction of the onset of the PFWS, this paper also includes an analysis of CCSM4’s ability to resolve the position and strength of the NASH at the time of the onset of the PFWS. CCSM4 strongly underestimates the observed interannual variability in the westward extent of the NASH at the time of the onset of the PFWS. This failure to resolve the position of the NASH at the time of the onset of the PFWS may be a contributing reason for the low predictability of the onset of the PFWS by CCSM4. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>As If We Were Already Free: Unmaking Myths of American Justice is a hybrid-genre lyrical history about the rise of the American prison told in chronological vignettes. These character-driven micro-essays begin in 1492 with scenes of Columbus arriving in Hispaniola with conscripted criminals, then leaving with Native Americans aboard those same ships—prisoners, all—to illustrate the carceral nature of exploration in the “New World.” They tell how the first structure erected by late 18th-century Spanish friars in California was a jail to imprison the Native Tongva.Since it is impossible to examine the state of incarceration in the United States without a discussion of race and its roots in slavery, many 18th- and 19th-century snapshots uncover lesser known stories about often-mythologized figures in government, illustrating how the practice of slavery was America’s first mass incarceration project. They chronicle the Black Codes, which served as a pretext for southern states to arrest and imprison former slaves, and show how the practice of convict leasing was a precursor to the forced labor of inmates that persists today. They show how mid-nineteenth century railroad strikes and riots gave rise to modern policing, legitimizing the need to expand and empower local and federal police forces. I also trace the incarceration of ICE detainees over the past decade back to the jailing of Arab Americans into detention centers after September 11th, as well as the Japanese internment camps established during World War II, the 1891 Immigration Act and detention of immigrants at Ellis Island, and the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. Like the detention of immigrants, the Fugitive Slave Act relied on racial profiling and the presumption of illegality on the part of fugitive slaves.
The latter half of this work will address the 20th-century shift toward mass incarceration, spotlighting the racist arrest and sentencing laws of Nixon and Reagan’s Wars on Drugs. Some 21st-century vignettes are informed by the stories of men and women I’ve met over many years of volunteer work in prisons, or through my research for this project. One of the central aims is to interrogate the common practices of mandatory minimums, life sentences, capital punishment, and racial profiling, as well as the concepts of freedom, autonomy, accountability, victim-centered justice, and redemption. Collectively, the snapshots tell the story of two characters: While they take many names and faces, ultimately this is a narrative of the unfree American and his or her oppressor. 
Other threads that reappear throughout the manuscript include the criminalization and confinement of LGBTQ+ people in and outside of prisons and the treatment of homosexuality as a mental illness; the evolution of capital punishment and solitary confinement; the mutable nature of laws against prostitution; and alternatives to prison through transformative justice practices, which has its precursors in various Native traditions and now exists in the form of drug courts, creative sentencing, and restorative justice models such as the Vera Institute’s process of mutual healing between crime victims and perpetrators. Another thread is the incarceration of mentally ill people, from the gross abuses of patients in mental institutions, to the lobotomies and forced sterilization of women diagnosed with mental illness, and finally, the brutality of prison psychiatric wards—a reason inmates often refuse to seek the mental health care they need. 
Not only do my research interests draw from several disciplines, but my dissertation places them in conversation with one another. The book will contain artifacts from every century—photographs, court transcripts, posters, and newspaper headlines dating back to the seventeenth century. All direct quotes in the manuscript appear in italics, and a works cited is compiled at the end.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>A contest is a process in which agents irrevocably expend effort or other resources to improvethe probability of attaining a valuable prize. Contests are a wide-spread phenomenon in various
domains, including political competition, rent-seeking, lobbying, patent races, labor markets, and
sports. In this dissertation, I investigate the impact that the timing of decisions and interim
information disclosure can have on participants in contests.
Timing advantages can occur naturally in contests. For example, an incumbent politician is
less likely to be challenged in a primary than someone who has not held the office previously. An
incumbent firm performing R&amp;D such as a well-established pharmaceutical company developing
a vaccine or a new drug likely has an advantage over a new entrant. These incumbent actors
may wish to preempt entry and restrict competition by signaling the seriousness of their intent via
large upfront investments. They may also be able to restrict entry institutionally by lobbying for
regulation.
When timing and incumbency advantages are present in a contest, it is an interesting question
how the agents involved adapt their behaviors to this asymmetric incentive structure. Most of
the existing economics literature on contests has studied simultaneous-move contests where these
issues have been ignored. In this dissertation, I study systematically contests where agents move
sequentially, and the investments of earlier movers may be revealed to later movers. My focus is
on several stylized settings where, in theory, earlier movers enjoy a significant advantage. Using
laboratory experiments, I explore how human subjects behave in these environments and respond
to changes in incentives. The empirical findings indicate that early movers attempt to deter later
participants, but generally fail to accomplish their goals. Behavioral influences from outside the
standard forward-looking, rational actor model, such as the joy of winning, give followers additional
benefits to winning that leaders may not fully incorporate into their decision-making.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>As the energy demand rises around the world, the concerns regarding the impact of fossil fuel on the environment become more and more evident. To introduce a cleaner and more sustainable energy solution, the world moving towards integrating more and more renewable energy into the grid. A significant amount of renewable generation are being integrated into the grid, and are known as the distributed energy resources (DERs). Due to the increasing integration of DERs, the notion that power is generated in bulk at a generation plant and then transmitted through the transmission and distribution system to the consumers is no longer true. Distributed generation has made it possible to generate power near the demand location. This has also introduced fast changing distributed generation (DG) and reverse power-flow in the system. Researchers are currently working on finding out proper ways to optimally integrate the DERs and tackle the issues resulting from them. This dissertation is focused on tackling two such topics emerging from the integration of DERs.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The first topic is the topic of optimally using the available energy resources to minimize the cost. With the addition of variable non-dispatchable generations, there has also been a rise in energy storage (ES) integration into the grid. There can also be traditional generation like diesel generators available as DG. Due to smart grid technologies, we also have the availability of present grid data and different forecasts regarding future grid states.How to optimally control all these available energy resources based on the present and forecasted data available is still a topic of research. This dissertation proposes a novel graph search based energy management solution that can optimally manage the energy resources based on current and predicted system status. The energy management solution has been validated using a real-time controller hardware in the loop (CHIL) solution. The validation process shows that the proposed solution is capable of cost optimally managing the available energy resources.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The second topic tackled in this dissertation is the topic of maintaining the distribution system voltage within limits. As the penetration of variable non-dispatchable DGs increase in the system, there is a higher chance of voltage violation. This can also cause the traditional mechanical regulation devices to work more. This can cause wear and tear in the mechanical devices used for regulation, and may introduce an additional operating cost. Also, the theory that the voltage across the line is only dependent on the load and the line impedance is not accurate anymore. Sudden changes in the variable DGs output can introduce over and under voltage in specific portions of the distribution system near them. There are also smart inverters available in the system with the capability of providing reactive power compensation. This dissertation provides a novel solution to coordinate the smart inverters with the traditional regulation devices to regulate the system voltage. The proposed solution has been validated both in offline simulation and in real-time CHIL simulation. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In summary, this dissertation proposes two novel solutions. The first is an energy management solution capable of managing DERs taking into account present and forecasted system status and system constraints. The second is a coordinated voltage control algorithm capable of optimally coordinating the smart inverters with traditional regulation devices. Both of the proposed solutions have been validated in offline and CHIL simulations and are shown to work as expected.</DISS_para>

Generalizing the classical correspondence between isomorphism classes of central extensions of a group $G$ by an abelian group $A$ and homotopy classes of maps $[\overline{W}G, \overline{W}^2A]$. We then prove an analogous theorem for central extensions of presheaves of simplicial groups.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Society today is still very dependent on petroleum, the most complex naturally occurring mixture on the planet. Ultrahigh resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) has been employed to comprehensively characterize petroleum, because of its ability to resolve and identify hundreds of thousands of compounds in complex mixtures. However, despite advances in the chemical knowledge of fossil fuels, many questions remain unanswered regarding their behavior in the environment. Oil spills, such as Deepwater Horizon (DWH) are harmful to coastal and marine ecosystems, as well as public health, however, are inevitable in an oil-dependent world. Therefore, understanding the molecular composition of petroleum and how it transforms in the environment is crucial for the development of better clean-up methodologies. Specifically, photooxidation from sunlight has been indicated as a primary source of weathering of spilled fossil fuels. This process increases the oxygen content of hydrocarbons, which leads to an increase in its interaction with water. This can lead to the formation of emulsions, which were observed in the Gulf of Mexico after DWH and made clean-up more difficult, due to their resistance to dispersants. Extensive photooxidation of petroleum has been shown to cause dissolution in water; the production of water-soluble hydrocarbons can harm ecosystems due to their likely toxicity. Furthermore, asphaltenes, the alkane-insoluble fraction of crude oil, have high oxygen content before photooxidation, and therefore are especially important in the formation of emulsions and water-soluble species through photochemical reactions. Asphaltenes are comprised of highly aromatic structures which can undergo photooxidation and photofragmentation to produce abundant water-soluble compounds; moreover, these compounds make up a large portion of materials extensively used in the built environment, such as road asphalt and roofing tiles.
Chapter 1 provides an introduction to FT-ICR MS and explains why it is crucial for analysis of petroleum. Chapter 2 discusses the identification of ketones as photooxidation products from petroleum in laboratory studies and DWH field samples; aromatic ketones are of interest due to their demonstrated toxicity in animals. In Chapter 3, the effect of sulfur-containing compounds on photochemistry of light and heavy crude oils is compared; sulfur species (e.g. sulfides) are known for their toxicity and are thus important to understanding environmental impacts in spills. Chapter 4 expands studies to determine the role of molecular structure in the formation of oil- and water-soluble photoproducts through the isolation and solar irradiation of compounds with varying numbers of aromatic rings.  
Chapter 5 demonstrates how advanced ion isolation methods coupled with MS/MS can provide structural information about asphaltenes from petroleum and coal, which is central to understanding the role of molecular structure in the production of water-soluble compounds. Thus, Chapter 6 covers the effect of asphaltene structure on the molecular composition of the photooxidation products. Asphaltene samples enriched with different structural motifs, island vs. archipelago, were photoirradiated. The results demonstrate that only archipelago structures contribute to the significant production of water-soluble compounds. The leachable photoproducts formed through solar irradiation of road asphalt are described in Chapter 7. 
Finally, it is important to highlight that petroleum photooxidation increases the concentration of interfacial material (IM). IM consists of highly oxygenated compounds that interact strongly with water and therefore contribute to emulsion formation / stability in the environment as well as refinery processes. Chapter 8 identifies emulsion-promoting compounds and investigates improved methodologies for the isolation of these species from petroleum and field samples.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane enclosed vesicles released from cells that act as mediators of intercellular communication and are involved in normal physiological processes as well as pathological conditions. EVs can transfer functional vesicles which can promote cell growth, migration, differentiation, and regulate immune cell function in the recipient cells. Latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) major oncoprotein has been shown to enhance the secretion EVs from infected cells. LMP1 is an important viral protein that contributes to tumor growth, metastasis and microenvironment remodeling. Transfer of the LMP1-modified EVs can activate MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt signaling functions within neighboring uninfected cells. Currently there is limited understanding of the mechanisms responsible for orchestrating trafficking of LMP1 into EVs and tumor microenvironment remodeling. The following work describe the cellular machineries utilized by LMP1 to secreted in EVs and the effects of the EVs on recipient cells. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Our studies in Chapter 2 focused on determining the LMP1 domains important for EV trafficking. Using various LMP1 constructs with deletion mutations in the C-terminal and transmembrane domains, we showed that the N-terminus and transmembrane region one (TM1) is sufficient to guide efficient sorting into the EV pathway. Additionally, a mutant lacking the N-terminus and transmembrane domains 1 through 4 (TM5-6) that fails to be packaged into EVs displayed an altered endo-lysosomal trafficking being retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and early endosomes. We further showed existence of potential positive and negative regulatory mechanisms of LMP1 secretion. Overall, this study provides a detailed analysis of the roles different LMP1 structural domains play in endosomal sorting and EV packaging. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In chapter 3, we investigated the role of the ESCRT dependent pathway and associated proteins in mediating LMP1 cargo sorting and EV secretion. Our results demonstrated that LMP1 utilizes Hrs, Syntenin-1 and specific components of the ESCRT-III complex (CHMP4B, 5 and 6) for release from the cell and enhancement of EV production. Additionally, our data revealed that efficient secretion of LMP1 modified EVs promotes cell attachment, proliferation, migration and tumor growth. These data suggest that LMP1 interacts with ESCRT machinery components to enter the endocytic route for efficient EV sorting and release to extracellular space.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Finally, to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying LMP1 remodeling of the tumor microenvironment, we hypothesized that LMP1 alters the content and functions of the EVs and the LMP1 modified EVs induce transformation process in the recipient cells. Our findings reveal that LMP1 expression alters the EV protein and microRNA content packaged into EV. The LMP1-modified EVs also enhance recipient cell adhesion, proliferation, migration, invasion concomitant with the activation of ERK, AKT, and NF-κb signaling pathways. The LMP1 modified vesicles induced transcriptome reprogramming by upregulating gene expression in recipient cells. Collectively, our findings begin to demonstrate the mechanisms in which LMP1 modified EVs are secreted from infected cells and establish a tumor-permissive microenvironment by increasing gene expression of ECM interaction proteins. Our findings from these studies contribute to advance the current knowledge on understanding protein trafficking, EV cargo sorting, EV secretion and mechanisms of tumor microenvironment remodeling</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Chapter one examines how weather conditions near a firm’s major institutional investors affect stock market reactions to firms’ earnings announcements. We find that unpleasant weather experienced by institutional investors leads to higher earnings announcement premiums and more delayed market responses to earnings news. We interpret the evidence as weather-induced negative moods increasing required compensation for earnings uncertainty and reducing activity levels of institutional investors. The influence of institutional investors’ weather is stronger than that of New York City or firm headquarters weather. Additional cross-sectional evidence suggests that weather mainly influences the trading behavior of less sophisticated and transient institutional investors.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter two examines the effect of economic policy uncertainty (EPU) on portfolio company (PC) exit outcomes spanning 20 countries from 1997–2012. The data examined indicate that the likelihood of a successful exit, as well as the dollar value outcome of a successful exit, is impacted by the degree of economic policy uncertainty in the year of the exit. Specifically, the evidence is consistent with an increased probability a firm waits to exit or goes defunct and a decreased probability of exiting via an initial public offering (IPO) or merger/acquisition (M&amp;A) when EPU in the domicile country of the PC is high. Subsample analysis on IPOs and M&amp;A shows that dollar outcomes, as measured by proceeds raised or deal value, are significantly lower when an exit occurs during a year in which the PC domicile nation is characterized with high EPU. We identify this phenomenon as the “Uncertainty Effect” and investigate ways to mitigate this negative effect through VC syndicate internationalization. While the effect of an international investor base is positive in general, we find that a geographically diversified syndicate can increase the negative “Uncertainty Effect.” Our results suggest a more nuanced relationship than was previously thought to exist.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Achievement and behavioral problems in childhood have long-term consequences for better health and educational outcomes. Prenatal experiences have been linked with childhood outcomes, although there is some question as to the causative role of prenatal experiences on childhood cognitive and behavioral development and their related outcomes. Specifically, adverse outcomes related to birthweight have been associated with lower achievement outcomes and externalizing behaviors. Using a twin method with a sample of 396 pairs (N = 792), we examined if birthweight had a causal effect on childhood reading comprehension performance and parent-reported behavioral measures of executive function, ADHD, and conduct problems. Applying the co-twin control design within the counterfactual model of causality framework, the multilevel models determined whether causal mechanisms exist under differential exposure within and between twin pair associations Overall non-significant correlations were not found between individual birthweight and reading comprehension and externalizing behavioral outcomes of interest. Furthermore, in multilevel models, the birthweight exposure was not associated with any outcome, meaning it was not possible to evaluate any possible causal role of birthweight to reading or externalizing behavior.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This dissertation provides a comprehensive history of the American collegiate percussion ensemble and assesses how institutional and gendered practices have influenced the size, style, and aesthetic of the genre’s repertoire in educational institutions. It identifies four stylistic periods—1950 to 1980, 1980 to 2000, 2000 to 2015, and 2015 to the present day—and details the efforts of Paul Price, Richard Gipson, Brian West, and Julie Hill, all educational entrepreneurs who implemented changes that affected the collegiate percussion ensemble at different points in its history. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>More specifically, this project encapsulates my investigation of the formation, development, and contemporary status of the percussion orchestra (PO), which I argue is the first commoditized brand within the collegiate percussion ensemble realm. First popularized by Richard Gipson and the University of Oklahoma percussion program in the early 1980s, this tonal, symphonic, and virtuosic approach to percussion ensemble performance has undergone various changes in style and function in the twenty-first century in order to maintain its hegemonic authority within the percussion community and academia. Through a combination of score analysis, archival research, interviews, ethnographic studies, and reflections on my experiences as a trained percussionist and student of Gipson and West, I argue that the percussion orchestra enjoyed significant cultural capital in the early 2010s, as demonstrated by PO works of the period that exhibited a masculine habitus centered on exhibitionism and extreme virtuosic technique. Although the medium’s primary supporters, namely American white men, still wield significant institutional power today, the ethnographic research I have conducted over the last year suggests that collegiate groups are developing a greater interest in the accessibility and marketability of their percussion ensemble programming, allowing a wider range of compositional voices an opportunity to contribute to the genre. Additionally, the broader percussion community is striving to become more diverse and inclusive as evidenced by the Percussive Arts Society’s newfound commitment to committees, competitions, scholarships, and other projects that celebrate the breadth of the global percussive art form. Because the aesthetic of the masculinized percussion orchestra is antithetical to these newly emerging ideologies, I believe that its hegemony within collegiate percussion ensemble practices may be threatened in the coming decades.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Analyzing the utilization of communication network resources is not a straight forward process. Assignals transit between endpoints in a communication network, time is accumulated due to physical
limitations in computational resources and their associated interlinks. Analysis is complicated by
the presence of computational resources whose performance characteristics vary with time. These
variations in computational performance result in non-constant servicing times for inbound jobs,
which makes accurate prediction of communication network resource utilization difficult.
For research test beds consisting of distributed computational resources, insufficient communication network resources can constrain valid experimental configurations. Experiments involving
real-time simulation, such as with controller hardware-in-the-loop, requires signal communication
times that adhere to instantiated deadlines. Meeting experimental deadlines depends on understanding worst-case utilization of communication network resources.
The work presented here outlines a communication network modeling methodology that is employed to predict worst-case utilization of communication network resources in a research test bed,
the Controls Evaluation Framework (CEF). Various configurations of CEF resources are employed
to present how worst-case communication network resource utilization can be predicted. Accuracy
of communication resource predictions are then discussed to outline limitations and how those can
be improved upon.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>It is a solemn obligation to provide high quality healthcare to veterans who sacrificed themselves to protect their country and democratic values. Although the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has conducted numerous highly regarded research on veteran health policy, there is still a great amount of work to be done to provide high quality care to veterans at affordable cost. This dissertation strives to better understand veteran health policy and to provide constructive suggestions for the Veterans Health Administration. The first essay explores the expected effects of the repeal of the individual health insurance mandate on veterans’ access to private and VA insurance by analyzing 52,692 non-elderly veterans in Florida and California from 2008 to 2017. The findings suggest that the repeal will lead to a considerable increase in the number of uninsured veterans and veterans who are unemployed, poor, and suffering disabilities are more likely to sign up for the VA insurance than better off veterans. The second essay evaluates technical efficiency scores of the VA hospitals and investigated the effect of the Veterans Choice Act of 2014 on the VA hospitals’ technical efficiency. The findings show that overall technical efficiency of the VA hospitals decreased after the implementation of the Act which authorized veterans’ use of non-VA hospitals. The magnitude of the decrease was in proportion to the number of veterans using non-VA hospitals under the Act. This suggests that the VHA should evaluate whether current capacity of the VA hospitals is appropriate and try to reduce wasted input resources. The third essay examines how technical efficiency, along with other factors, influences quality of care in VA hospitals. The findings show that high technical efficiency, a low nurse turnover rate, and a low preventable hospitalization rate lead to a decrease of both mortality and readmission. Conversely a high percentage of veterans using the Veterans Choice Programs (VCPs) leads to an increase in the mortality. These findings suggest that the VHA should improve coordination within the VA healthcare system, reduce nurse turnover, construct an integrated patient information exchange system between VA and non-VA hospitals, and increase veterans’ access to primary care. This dissertation is meaningful to existing literature on health policy in that it is the first dissertation that examined veteran health policy from perspectives of access, cost and quality.  In addition, this dissertation suggests several substantial recommendations for practitioners in the VA and the VHA.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Diabetes mellitus type 2 has been described as a global epidemic characterized by the inability of the body to effectively control blood glucose levels. The liver is a central regulator of glucose homeostasis and stores or manufactures glucose according to metabolic demands. Pancreatic beta-cells, located in the islets of Langerhans, secrete insulin in response to elevations in the blood glucose level and the insulin stimulates the liver to store glucose in the form of glycogen. Insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells is pulsatile, and insulin levels in the blood are oscillatory, demonstrating that there must be some mechanism for synchronization of the individual islets. We previously demonstrated that a population of islets can synchronize their oscillations through interactions with a simple liver cell model. Recently we have developed a new mathematical model of glucose uptake and synthesis in liver cells, including pathways of insulin signaling. With the new liver model, we have evaluated the conditions for which islet oscillations can be synchronized. We report on these model predictions, and use the model liver cell to set the glucose level in a microfluidic device containing actual islets. We discuss conditions for synchronization of islet oscillations in this hybrid experimental and mathematical system.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Plunder weaves the voice of the pirate Anne Bonny with that of a contemporary speaker unafraid to question the status quo, resist narrow conventions, and carve out paths that are as bold as they are promising. The oscillation between the two creates an enthralling read where no subject is off limits: root canals, football, Sex and the City, womanhood, marriage, love, death, and a range of imaginative situations that traverse landscapes and time. With long-lined and lyrical poems, Plunder invites readers to “love [the] excess and [the] stillness,” and whether the page jumps from Anne Bonny advising Jane Eyre to the speaker contemplating the women her husband ought to love, the collection does so knowing that a body and mind should never know their place.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study examines the creation, growth, and peak of the mythology surrounding theBattle of the Alamo, a manufactured mythology that has extricated the event and its participants
from the historical context of the Texian Revolution that spanned from the fall of 1835 to the
spring of 1836. In considering five of the mythology’s most essential symbols and their
purposes, this study explores how a multicultural experience became a rallying cry for Anglo
hegemony, and demonstrates how a regional conflict could amass such long-term international
and popular appeal. Chapter 1 of this study examines the historical significance of Tennessean
Congressman David Crockett, whose colorful life and subsequent deification following his death
at the Alamo elevated the battle beyond the confines of the conflict to which it belonged.
Crockett’s life and afterlife, particularly the alleged manner in which Crockett met his fate and
the “witness” who reported its occurring are also examined in order to demonstrate the effects of
the mythology on popular memory. The second symbol that helped define the Alamo’s
mythology has been the oral and written testimony culled from the revolution’s participants -
personal accounts that detailed the subjected hardships and horror of the war with Mexico that
were further shaped, enhanced, and romanticized by journalists and raconteurs. Set against a
tumultuous political and social landscape characterized by ceaseless violence, Chapter 2 argues
that initial authors of the Alamo’s mythology embraced survivors who could testify to their
experiences as living artifacts yet manipulated their memories and cast the struggle with racial
overtones. Reflecting a “heroic” narrative, these memorialists both famed and anonymous,
helped pave the way for a regional story to be embraced by a national audience. Chapter 3
demonstrates how the Daughters of the Republic of Texas, a lineal association dedicated to
perpetuating the memory of the founding families and soldiers of the Republic of Texas inserted
themselves into the Alamo’s mythology during the Progressive Era, and in turn, through their
actions, commodified Texas’s fabled “Shrine of Liberty.” In saving the Alamo mythology’s third
symbol - the remnants of the original mission and battlefield, the Daughters of the Republic of
Texas found success marketing themselves as the gatekeepers of its memory for several decades
by perpetuating a segregated narrative. Chapter 4 examines “The Spirit of Sacrifice,” a cenotaph
commissioned as part of the Texas Centennial and completed in Alamo Plaza in 1940 and its 
vii
symbolic status amidst the site’s mythology that helped spark an acrimonious feud between
sculptor Pompeo Coppini and his fiercest critic, University of Texas professor and folklorist J.
Frank Dobie. Chapter 4 examines the feud that carried on in spite of that momentous occasion
and raised the question of who would have the right, through birth, talent, or vocation, to
commemorate the battle of the Alamo and the experiences of its participants - a conflict that has
further shaped how the mythology of the Alamo is considered. Chapter 5 examines John
Wayne’s motion picture The Alamo, the apotheosis of the mythology created in 1836 and
cultivated by the generations that followed. Released in 1960, The Alamo stands as the largest
physical reincarnation of the perpetuated mythology and elevated its standing beyond the scope
of Texas. In addition to challenging the prejudices of previous accounts and incarnations, Wayne
depicted the struggle for the Alamo as an essentially American experience, yet nevertheless
found his dream project and its worth compromised by his own political views. By addressing
these symbols and their respective creators, this dissertation challenges our understanding of the
evolutionary mythmaking process as well as its effects on the historical record.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Environmental legislation is a relatively new concept in the United States’ regulatory regime.  High profile environmental disasters, including several in other countries, have underscored the challenges of effectively and efficiently responding to an environmental pollution event.  For a thirty year period, beginning in the early 1960s, laws were enacted to address anthropogenic pollution and create response frameworks; some of the laws passed during the latter years pertained to oil pollution, specifically in response to high profile oil spills.  The societal prevalence of oil and the recent expansion of marine oil production platforms into deeper waters have complicated the response efforts under the current legislative structure.  The Gulf of Mexico’s deep-sea drilling platforms and risk of hurricane damage increases the risk of industrial accidents leading to large scale oil spills.  Although the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill in 2010 dominates recent discussion, consideration of a spill that began prior to the DWH, and continues into the present, illustrates a different set of issues.  Persistent oil slicks have been observed less than 20 km offshore Louisiana within Mississippi Canyon lease block 20 (MC20), near the toppled Taylor Energy well jacket, which was destroyed by Hurricane Ivan’s passage through the Gulf of Mexico in 2004.  Immediately after the storm’s final landfall, satellite images detected surface oil slicks at the site.  Acoustic surveys observed prominent plumes of gas and oil rising from near the well jacket to the surface.  The objective of this research was to evaluate these plumes and quantify the density and size frequency of bubbles.  These findings provide a context to analyze the response efforts of the Unified Command (UC) and efficacy of the current environmental legislation.  In the field effort, an oil and gas bubble collecting and imaging device (bubblometer) was constructed.  Its components include a calibrated visualization chamber, transparent collection tube, and four sample cylinders.  The bubblometer was mounted on the lower platform (skid) of a Comanche ROV.  In its retracted position, the lower opening of chamber was closed; a hydraulic actuator extended the bubblometer beyond the skid so that the chamber was open at the bottom.  Location of the plumes was determined by a NOAA acoustician, allowing the ROV operator to navigate to the site and position the bubblometer within the plumes.  Video of bubbles passing through the bubblometer visualization chamber and entering the collection tube was recorded with an HD video camera calibrated to resolve 4 pixels/mm.  Video frames were analyzed with a Matlab based machine learning algorithm to count, classify, and measure gas and oil bubbles to provide an estimate of oil flux at the MC20 site.  A total of 12,139 bubbles were counted (5,881 gas and 6,258 oil) and were typically 5-10 mm or greater.  Gas bubbles contained 35.6% oil by volume.  These results contributed to the refutation of Taylor Energy’s “rum punch” hypothesis that remnant oil in the sediments is the primary source of the surface slick and indicate that at least one well is actively leaking at the site.  Contention within the UC protracted the response efforts and revealed weaknesses within the structure and the legislation under which it was created.  Lessons learned from the Taylor Energy oil spill should lead to the modification of existing environmental legislation to address deep-sea and other unique site conditions encountered during marine oil spills.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Se servant exclusivement des romans de l’écrivain contemporain haïtien Lyonel Trouillot, ce travail présente les bidonvilles en Haïti, caractérisés actuellement par la vulnérabilité aux catastrophes naturelles et des conditions de vie infrahumaines, comme l’évidence des inégalités sociales qui pèsent de tout leur poids sur les misérables des quartiers marginalisés en Haïti. Divisé en cinq chapitres, il étudie principalement les facteurs sociaux qui contribuent à faire de la vie dans les bidonvilles haïtiens une véritable lutte quotidienne désespérante. Le premier chapitre fournit des informations sur l’évolution des bidonvilles en Haïti afin de placer cette problématique dans un cadre mondial ainsi que de situer Trouillot et son œuvre dans leur contexte socio-historique haïtien. Ce chapitre présente aussi les théories majeures dans lesquelles s’inscrit notre analyse et, en même temps, met en évidence l’intérêt de notre travail, ses questions de recherche et sa méthodologie. Le deuxième chapitre se consacre entièrement à la représentation du profil matériel du bidonville haïtien dans les romans de Trouillot. Il lit les particularités stylistiques utilisées par l’auteur pour présenter les bidonvilles haïtiens comme lieux de relégation spatiale. Le troisième chapitre étudie la représentation du profil psychologique de la population bidonvilloise haïtienne chez Trouillot. Il explore essentiellement les murs de la précarité auxquels se heurtent tous les jours les laissés-pour-compte des bidonvilles en Haïti. Le quatrième chapitre examine les facteurs socio-historiques et conjoncturels qui génèrent les conflits de classe remarqués aujourd’hui dans la ville haïtienne. Enfin, dans le dernier chapitre, les informations recueillies sur notre objet d’étude sont analysées pour répondre à nos questions de recherche initiales, et pour aussi ouvrir la voie à des études supplémentaires sur les représentations fictives du bidonville haïtien.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Focusing on the novels of the contemporary Haitian writer Lyonel Trouillot, this paper presents slums in Haiti, currently characterized by vulnerability to natural disasters and subhuman living conditions, as symbols of social inequalities suffered by the poor in marginalized urban neighborhoods in Haiti. Divided into five chapters, it particularly studies the social factors that contribute to making life in Haitian slums a dire struggle every day. The first chapter provides important information on the evolution of slums in Haiti in order to place this problem in a global context, as well as to read Trouillot and his fictional works with respect to their Haitian social and historical context. This introductory chapter also outlines the major theoretical frameworks serving as the basic for our analysis and, at the same time, highlights the purpose of this project, its research questions and its methodology. The second chapter is entirely dedicated to the representation of the physical image of Haitian slums in Trouillot’s novels. It reads stylistic particularities used by the author to present Haitian slums as places of spatial relegation. The third chapter explores the representation of the psychological profile of Haitian slum residents in Trouillot’s novels. It essentially explores the precarious conditions faced everyday by neglected people in these deprived neighborhoods. The fourth chapter examines historical and current factors perpetuating class conflict seen today in Haitian urban areas. Finally, in the last chapter, the data collection used in the research is meticulously analyzed to answer the initial questions of our study, and to pave the way for future research on fictional representations of Haitian slums.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Microfiltration is one of the most efficient filtration techniques used to remove pathogenic protozoa, bacteria, and other colloidal matter from feed water. During the filtration process these pollutants accumulate on the filter surface and clog the membrane pores which results in decline of filtration productivity. One effective method to remove these attachments is a cleaning method called backwashing. While the  backwashing operation clears away substantial amounts of foulant from the membrane surface, there are still residuals that cannot be removed by backwashing. This is known as irreversible attachment due to the presence of a biofilm. In this thesis, our main goal is to determine the backwashing timing to minimize the decline of permeability of the membrane. We validate our model against multiple data sets. First, we start our analysis with a basic point of view by ignoring the irreversible dynamics in our mathematical models in Chapter 3. Then, in Chapter 4 we incorporate biofilm dynamics into our mathematical models. Both in Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 we find optimal solutions and compare these with our data sets. These observations provide insight into the effect of filter age and biological activity on the membrane behavior.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>     School counselors are the first personnel called on in a school to provide daily student mental health support. However, complications such as additional non-counseling duties and high student to counselor ratios exist which limit the time school counselors have available to support student mental health needs. While the number of youths needing mental health support was already on the rise, the global pandemic of COVID-19 has caused this number to increase rapidly. School counselor graduate programs can be clinical or school counseling focused, and the role of the school counselor according to the American School Counseling Association is to provide short-term counseling interventions, and then refer out for long-term, severe mental health issues. Since so many youths need mental health services currently, referrals to community agencies are taking months to be processed. By asking school counselors to assess their own level of preparedness and professional development needs around student mental health support, school counselors can share if their preparation and professional development needs are being met and what additional support, if any, counselors need to be successful in helping students. 	In this exploratory study, ten high school counselors in one medium-sized, partially suburban, partially rural school district in Florida responded to an electronic survey containing questions about their graduate school preparation in mental health and current district professional development needs around mental health. When it came to feelings of preparation, most counselors felt “prepared” or “mostly prepared” to provide support on a list of typical youth mental health topics. When it came to time spent providing mental health support, 56% of counselors reported spending on average 2-3 hours daily providing support for student mental health needs. For professional development needs, school counselors wanted more mental health coursework in graduate school. For their district professional development, counselors wanted to be trained, observed and given feedback from licensed mental health clinicians rather than being trained by district school counseling staff or other school counselors. 
     The findings of this study show that while school counselors are indeed spending large quantities of time providing direct student mental health support and referring students out for clinical mental health support, they are still faced with providing counseling interventions for longer periods of time to more students than normal due to the long wait students have to see a mental health provider and the mental health consequences students are having as a result of living through the COVID-19 pandemic. One main issue the counselors’ responses revealed is that the mental health support school counselors are providing at this moment in time is still largely responsive and at the Tier 3 level supporting individual students rather than preventative and at the Tier 1 and Tier 2 levels for the entire school population, as demonstrated by a higher number of counselors selecting individual counseling and crisis intervention as services they provide and fewer selecting schoolwide mental health awareness activities, classroom guidance lessons, or small group counseling as services they provide. 
     When assessing professional development needs, school counselors do feel that they could use more mental health training to support students. School counselors wanted to be trained more often by licensed mental health professionals as opposed to other school counselors. School counselors also expressed that they would have liked to have more mental health coursework in their graduate program.
     The implications of these findings show that the school counselor role is evolving to include more direct student mental health support than it previously required. Since counselors are spending so much time in mental health support that is responsive and typically supporting one student at a time, it is imperative for school counselors to assess if the interventions they are applying are truly effective, or if a more preventative approach, while hard to transition to initially, would result in a need for less responsive services in the long run. 
     The recommendations from this study are that the role of the counselor should incorporate more mental health training by districts, graduate programs, and mental health counselors. Reducing student to counselor ratios would also help school counselors provide a preventative, comprehensive school counseling program, reducing the volume of responsive mental health services currently provide.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Research has shown that abusive supervisor behavior can have psychological, psychosocial, and behavioral impacts on targeted employees, and the literature has primarily focused on the effects of abusive supervisor behavior on the target of the abuse. Although this literature is important, little attention has been paid to the role engagement in abusive supervisor behavior can demonstrate on abusers, such as supervision affective experiences and their future behaviors toward their subordinates and their families. Drawing from affective events theory, I develop a theoretical model that examines abusive supervisor behavior’s impact on supervisors’ affective experiences. It then examines the impact of these affective experiences on subsequent supervision attitudes, subsequent behaviors toward their subordinates, and the impact on supervisors’ family lives. Because this project draws on affective events theory, I focus on the impact of abusive supervisor behavior on the leader and examine supervisor personality (i.e., psychopathy and empathy) and perceptions that abusive supervisor behavior was warranted as moderators of abusive supervisor behavior, its impact on supervisor affective reactions, and subsequent attitudinal, behavioral, and work-home outcomes. Data were analyzed from 255 supervisors to test a model of supervisor reactions to engaging in abusive supervisor behavior that is rooted in affective events theory. I found mixed support for the proposed affective events theory paths examining the role of engaging in abusive supervisor behavior on workplace outcomes. I found limited support for the moderating role of psychopathy and did not find support for the moderating role of empathy and perceptions abuse was warranted as moderators. I found some support for the mediating role of positive and negative affect after engaging in abusive supervisor behavior on workplace outcomes. I largely found that the proposed total effects models were significant, indicating that abusive supervisor behavior has important effects on a variety of workplace outcomes. Thus, this research provides a test of the main tenets of affective events theory and uses the theory to explain how engagement in abusive supervisor behavior impacts supervisors and the boundary conditions that affect this relationship. I discuss this research’s theoretical and practical contributions and provide an actionable agenda for future research. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The purpose of this treatise is to explore the ways in which John Mayer’s unique perspective as an Indian musician, classically trained Western violinist and composer, and Indo-jazz pioneer influenced his works for clarinet. This is accomplished through a look into Mayer’s life and career, an introduction into the fundamental theories of Indian classical music, a detailed analysis of Raga Music, Sargam, and Dance Suite, and an overview of his other works for clarinet. This treatise aims to promote diversity in classical music, advocating for lesser-known works that are influenced by traditions outside of the Western classical idiom.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Cargo trafficking using vesicles has been studied in eukaryotic cells for more than half a century. Three conventional and evolutionarily archaic pathways have since been identified. These pathways include: Coat Protein II (COPII), Coat Protein I (COPI), and Clathrin-Mediated Endocytosis (CME). In each case, more than a dozen players are involved in a convoluted protein-protein interaction network. These interactions lead to the recruitment of cargo, deformation of the donor membrane, budding of the vesicle, scission of the vesicle, and anchoring to the receiving membrane. Successful implementation of these steps requires temporal and spatial coordination; two aspects of coat assembly that are intertwined. Ideally, with high temporal and spatial resolution, and multiple recording channels for different proteins, an understanding of the exact mechanisms of coat assembly could be delineated. Realistically, researchers have studied the temporal and spatial coordination of coat assembly independently and only recently have they been able to achieve molecular and sub-nanometer resolutions. In this dissertation the spatial organization of COPII and clathrin coats are investigated and the results are presented in chapters 2 (COPII), 3 and 4 (clathrin). Chapters 2 and 3 were published in peer reviewed journals.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The COPII pathway is involved in cargo transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cis-Golgi apparatus. Clathrin is involved in multiple pathways including: endocytosis, trans-Golgi to endosomes, and endosomes to plasma membrane. In both pathways, the resulting coated vesicle has multiple layers of coat protein with the outermost layer resembling a cage which is made of repeating subunits. Cages are dynamic assemblies of Sec13/31 heterotetramer in COPII cages, and clathrin trimer (triskelion) in clathrin cages. These cages can range in diameter between 60-120 nm and can be highly symmetric. In chapter 1, the properties of these coated vesicles and their cages will be introduced along with the principles of electron microscopy which is the technique of choice for studying these ultra-structures.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Sec13/31 heterotetramer is the quaternary structure of the proteins Sec13 and Sec31 in cells. The heterotetramer looks like a dumbbell with WD40 domains at each end and an α-helical central rod. In vitro, the heterotetramer can self-assemble at certain nonphysiological and rather high ionic strengths. Nonetheless, the same cage structures have been observed in situ. By reconstituting Sec13/31 cages in vitro and studying them with cryo-EM, researchers have identified the WD40 domains as sites of protein-protein interaction which, when repeated, assemble the heterotetramers into cages. The size of these cages should fit the size of the cargo they carry, but it is not clear how cage size is regulated by Sec23/24 which recruits cargo and has no direct interaction with the WD40 domains. In chapter 2, the role of the unstructured C-terminal region of Sec31 is investigated in regulating cage size. This region consists of a linear peptide motif that is buried in Sec23 and Sar1 and therefore acts as a mediator between the cage and the cargo-recruiting components. We discovered that this disordered region can play a role in the flexibility of the cages. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Clathrin triskelion is the quaternary structure of the clathrin heavy chain in cells. Like COPII vesicles, clathrin coated vesicles (CCVs) form cages of different sizes in coordination with their cargo size. Similarly, the cargo-recruiting proteins in CCVs, such as adaptor protein 2 (AP2), have no direct influence on the known elements of clathrin cage assembly. In chapter 3, natively assembled CCVs are studied using cryo-EM. An atomic model for clathrin is presented along with clathrin cages of different sizes and a novel cage geometry that was predicted to not exist. The first structural evidence for the interaction of AP2 with the N-terminal domain of clathrin is presented along with the nonrandom distribution of AP2 around CCVs.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In chapter 4, CCVs are studied using cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET). CCVs are inherently heterogeneous and tomography allows for higher resolution reconstructions of heterogeneous structures. A workflow for the reconstruction of the clathrin layer and the adaptor layer is presented. Finally, more venues for studying CCV structures are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Supply chain management plays an important role in ensuring an efficient merchandise trade. Freight transportation is an integral part of supply chain management. A significant part of freight transportation is covered by maritime transportation, as the largest portion of the global merchandise trade, in terms of volume, is carried out by maritime transportation. Liner shipping, which runs on fixed routes and schedules, plays a colossal role for the global seaborne trade. Liner shipping companies deal with three decision levels, namely strategic level, tactical level, and operational level. The strategic-level decisions are taken for more than six months to several years. The tactical-level decisions are effective for three months to six months. Moreover, the operational level decisions are taken for a couple of weeks to less than three months. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation involves the tactical-level decisions in liner shipping, which include: (1) service frequency determination; (2) fleet deployment; (3) sailing speed optimization; and (4) vessel scheduling. The service frequency determination problem deals with determining the time headway between consecutive vessels along a liner shipping route. The fleet deployment problem assigns vessels from the liner shipping company’s fleet (and sometimes, from other liner shipping companies’ fleets) to liner shipping routes. The sailing speed optimization problem deals with selecting sailing speeds along different voyage legs of a given port rotation. The vessel scheduling problem lists the schedules (e.g., arrival time, handling time, departure time) at different ports.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A comprehensive review of the liner shipping literature revealed that the existing literature on the tactical-level decisions focused on these problems individually. Solutions from different solution methodologies for the separate problems may have compatibility problems. Moreover, they are not attractive to the liner shipping companies, who look for integrated solutions. Hence, this research aimed to develop a combined mathematical model that comprises the four tactical-level decisions in liner shipping (i.e., service frequency determination, fleet deployment, sailing speed optimization, and vessel scheduling). This mathematical model is named the Holistic Optimization Model for Tactical-Level Planning in Liner Shipping (HOMTLP). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The objective of the HOMTLP mathematical model is to maximize of the total profit from transport of cargo. The major route service cost components, found from the literature, are covered by the model, which include: (I) total late arrival cost; (II) total port handling cost; (III) total fuel consumption cost; (IV) total vessel operational cost; (V) total vessel chartering cost; (VI) total container inventory cost in sea; (VII) total container inventory cost at ports of call; (VIII) total emission cost in sea; and (IX) total emission cost at ports of call. Along with the integration of all four tactical-level decisions, the mathematical model has a number of key advantages. First, the model provides flexibility to both the liner shipping company and the marine container terminal operators, as it offers multiple time windows and handling rates at each port of call. Second, the payload carried by the vessels is considered while estimating fuel consumption. Third, the preference of customers is reflected by modification of the container demand at different sailing speeds. Fourth, container inventory is accounted for at ports of call and in sea. Fifth, emissions of different harmful substances are captured in order to preserve the environment.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation carried out a set of numerical experiments to test the performance of the HOMTLP model, where BARON was used as the solution approach. It was revealed that when there was an increase in the unit fuel cost, the unit emission cost, vessel availability, the unit late arrival cost, and the unit freight rate, the sailing speed was reduced. On the other hand, when there was an increase in the unit inventory cost, the unit operational cost, as well as the unit chartering cost, the sailing speed was increased. Moreover, the total required number of vessels was increased, when there as an increase in the unit fuel cost, the unit emission cost, vessel availability, the unit late arrival cost, and the unit freight rate. On the contrary, the total required number of vessels was decreased, when there was an increase in the unit inventory cost, the unit operational cost as well as the unit chartering cost. It was also revealed that the total profit was increased, when more choices were available for port arrival time windows and/or container handling rates. The numerical experiments highlighted several other findings. Most importantly, it was found that the HOMTLP model can provide effective tactical-level decisions. Hence, the mathematical model can assist liner shipping companies to take tactical-level decisions, which are effective and profitable.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This project engages Antonin Artaud's highly influential critical volume, The Theater and Its Double, through the dual critical lenses of Psychoanalysis and Deconstruction in order to generate responses to questions posed by Artaud’s hybrid text of philosophy, literary criticism, and theatrical manifestos. In his performative writing, Artaud invites readers to inquire into and engage with what he means by “Theater's Double.” With this inquiry as a foundation, this dissertation engages theories of the self and its narrative-making nature, the self and the instability of memory, and the self in its capacity to express truths through the performance that is writing. Therefore, this project is partly devoted to renewed analyses of Artaudian concepts and images of thought, mapping these analyses onto the work of Modern and late Modern playwrights as it engages conceptual complications of doubles and doubling as they appear as important emblems in Modern and late Modern dramatic works. This dissertation ultimately traces a lineage for understanding conceptions of doubles and doubling through a theoretical engagement with the work of Otto Rank, Sigmund Freud, Jacques Lacan, and their interpreters. In doing so, this project ultimately reconceives binary oppositions between philosophical and literary theoretical writing as itself a kind of double, and so confronts the oppositions between Representation (in the so-called “Psychological Theater”) vs. Manifestation of Affects, or the “Theater Equal to Life” that Herbert Blau describes, as well as the binary opposition between and the doubleness of Violent Spectacle and Cathartic Tragedy. To this end, this dissertation engages and re-assesses classic Psychoanalytic literature on doppelgängers, shadows, effigies, and mirrored, reflected, and photographed images, and extends this field of thought to conceptions of the uncanny as originally conceived by Sigmund Freud. Artaud’s conceptions of cruelty are likewise re-assessed through these conceptions of doubles and doubling, the analysis complicated by locating these conceptions in the dramatic works of Sara Kane, Amiri Baraka, and Samuel Beckett. This research thus renews the importance of Antonin Artaud’s writing for theater and performance studies beyond theatrical-aesthetic precepts and renews the critical importance of Modern psychoanalytical texts and theory, finally suggesting a new confluence of Psychoanalysis and Performance theory that complicates the stability of the self and its narrative-making. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy report changes in behavior commonly referred to as “chemo brain.” It is hypothesized that neuroinflammation contributes to the pathophysiology of “chemo-brain.” I examined the effects of naproxen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), on behavior, hippocampal neuroinflammation, and hippocampal neurogenesis produced by exposure to cyclophosphamide (CP), a widely used chemotherapy agent in a female mouse model. Since chemotherapy can impair estrogen synthesis, I included ovariectomized (OVX) mice in my study to examine if ovarian hormones modified the effects of CP and naproxen.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>An initial study analyzing 50 mg./kg. CP was used (i.p., every third day for five doses) in intact and OVX mice. CP (50 mg./kg.) significantly decreased bodyweight throughout the experimental period. There was no effect of OVX on bodyweight. There was no effect of CP (50 mg./kg.) on anxiety-like behavior, spatial working memory, or object-based attention (OBA). OVX increased the recognition index on the OBA test, likely due to increased exploration with the objects, but had no effect on anxiety-like behavior or spatial working memory.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the following study, the effects of a higher dose of CP (100 mg./kg., i.p., every third day for five doses) and naproxen were examined in intact and OVX mice. Naproxen administration began one week before CP administration and continued throughout the experiment.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>High-dose CP significantly decreased bodyweight. This reduction was significant to OVX mice treated with CP and was not significant in intact mice treated with CP. There was no effect of naproxen on bodyweight. Naproxen exposed mice ate significantly more food per day, compared to vehicle-treated mice. Intact mice ate significantly more food per day, compared to OVX mice. OVX mice exposed only to CP ate significantly less food per day compared to OVX mice exposed to CP and naproxen and OVX mice exposed only to naproxen. This trend was not observed in intact mice.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>All mice in the high-dose CP and naproxen study spent &gt;85% of the time in the closed areas, indicating an anxiety-like behavior phenotype present across all experimental groups. CP significantly decreased protected head dips, a secondary measure of anxiety-like behavior. There were no effects of high-dose CP, naproxen, or OVX on spatial working memory. High-dose CP decreased exploratory behavior in a novel environment. This effect was specific to intact mice treated with high-dose CP and diminished in intact mice treated with both high-dose CP and naproxen. High-dose CP decreased spontaneous locomotor activity. This effect was significant in both intact and OVX mice treated with high-dose CP and diminished in mice exposed to both high-dose CP and naproxen. There was no effect of OVX on exploratory behavior in a novel environment or spontaneous locomotor activity. Lastly, there was a significant interaction between high-dose CP and time spent immobile on the tail suspension test, and between CP and naproxen on latency to immobility, measures of depression-like behavior.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The combination of CP and naproxen increased the acute inflammatory marker, IL-1a, the chronic inflammatory markers, IL-2, IL-3, and IL-12, and the anti-inflammatory marker, IL-10, in the hippocampus. Post hoc comparisons confirmed that elevated inflammatory markers were seen in CP and naproxen treated mice, which may indicate an inflammatory process induced by CP, which was heightened by naproxen, contrary to our hypothesis. OVX mice had decreased levels of acute, chronic, and anti-inflammatory markers in the hippocampus compared to intact mice, regardless of CP or naproxen exposure.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Analysis of neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus using the S-phase marker, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), and the newborn neuronal marker, doublecortin (DCX), was examined using both doses of CP. CP produced significant decreases in BrdU+ cells and BrdU+DCX+ cells at 50 mg./kg. but not at 100 mg./kg. The interaction between CP (50 mg./kg.) and OVX on the number of BrdU+ cells and BrdU+DCX+ cells was significant, suggesting that 50 mg./kg. CP modified the effects of OVX on neurogenesis. A significant interaction between CP (100 mg./kg.) and naproxen on neurons that were “born” over the interval between the first BrdU administration and the time of sacrifice (percent of BrdU+DCX+ cells/total BrdU+ cells) was found, suggesting the neurogenesis was altered by the co-administration of both CP and naproxen.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Collectively, our data show that chemotherapy alone, in the absence of cancer, produces behavioral impairments, which may be mediated by neuroinflammatory changes and changes in hippocampal neurogenesis. Lastly, naproxen may exacerbate cyclophosphamide-induced neuroinflammation and may not be a suitable drug for mitigating cyclophosphamide-induced adverse effects.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This thesis aims to explore the impact that YouTube, as a social media platform, has in facilitating Parasocial Interactions (PSI) and Relationships (PSR) between consumers and YouTubers. This thesis looks at the predictors of PSR, the moderators of PSR and PSI, and the ways these interactions and relationships manifest themselves with YouTubers and their audiences. The interplay between PSI and PSR and their effect on audiences is explored through testing for these phenomena (PSI and PSR) separately and seeing how the resulting perceptions among audience members compare. The purpose of this study is to gauge whether or not a strong parasocial relationship manifests itself as a result of trust and relatability working together, or if one variable is a more significant predictor of PSR formation. Investigations on the measures and the phenomenon of PSI and PSR were also investigated. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles (AV) are rapidly evolving and being introduced to drivers. The usage of these systems stands to provide innumerable safety and convenience benefits to people of all ages. If individuals possessing more positive valuations of technologies are more likely to use them, then it is reasonable to presume that research on how peoples’ attitudes can be influenced will provide valuable insight into how to potentially increase consumer adoption. In that regard we wanted to investigate whether presenting the same information in different ways resulted in different judgments of ADAS and AV, and whether presenting the same information to different types of people also had significant varying results.Based on previous knowledge, we expected age and information valence manipulation to be factors that would influence attitudes. This thesis provided a sample of peoples’ (N = 174) reported attitudes on ADAS and AV, after reading relevant information presented either in a positive, negative, or neutral manner. In an Analysis of Variance assessing ADAS attitudes, there was a significant main effect of age, suggesting that older adults age 50+ reported more positive sentiment toward ADAS compared to younger adults. When analyses further divided age into younger, middle-age, and older adults, results found a significant effect of age for both ADAS and AV, indicating that older adults evaluated ADAS more positively and AV more negatively than younger adults. There was no significant main effect of experimental condition; there was insufficient evidence that manipulating the valence of positive or negative information influenced ADAS and AV attitudes.

            <DISS_para>This study explores the influence of state-level financial aid policy on the college attendance of racially minoritized, specifically Black and Hispanic, students. Informed by student price response theory, this study compares the racial/ethnic composition of enrolled students in a state in the years preceding and following major financial aid policy reform—the primarily need-based Cal Grant in California, and the merit-based Bright Futures in Florida. Using quantitative analysis, multivariate linear regression, the researcher estimated the influence that reform of state-level financial aid policy had on the racial/ethnic composition of student enrollment at public two- and four-year institutions of both California and Florida. The unit of analysis was all public two- and four-year institutions of both states. A series of three models was used to control for other influences on enrollment beyond a change in policy and differences in the influence of each policy reform on sector of attendance was also explored. The results did not produce evidence of policy reform having a statistically significant influence on the racial/ethnic composition of college enrollment in either state. This suggests that factors beyond price may be more influential in the college-going decisions of Black and Hispanic students.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation takes an organological, historical, and ethnographic approach to the study of innovative violin making in the twenty-first century. The violin is a long-established icon as well as a tool for the production of sound, and consequently, attempts to alter its traditional form have been largely dismissed. While many makers have produced innovative violin models, the instrument has retained its basic form since its invention nearly five centuries ago. The search for a modern violin form based in scientific ideals was reignited in the mid-twentieth century, however, as scientists and musicians continued to work toward the construction of modernized forms employing the latest technology and acoustical research. Through interviews with innovative violin and bow makers, and organological studies of their instruments, this study explores the musical, financial, technological, and environmental reasons that these modern luthiers are challenging long-held traditions.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study explores the tensions between historicism and experimentation in a conservative field, raising issues of prestige structures and status symbols, real versus symbolic capital, and the arbitrariness of cultural values. The significance of musical instruments lies not merely in their existence as static artifacts but in the complex relationships that exist among the instruments, musicians, and societies.  In considering both traditional and innovative instruments, an ethnographic study of living luthiers complements the study of the sociohistorical context of past makers and their instruments, allowing for an examination of the continued tensions of traditionalism, innovation, and ecological concerns in violin making across time. Musical instruments are often seen as being ancillary, rather than a crucial component, in the development of musical styles. In acting as an extension of the human performer, however, the instrument can be manipulated to expand and enrich sonic capabilities, thereby participating in the creation of musical culture. While I do not argue that instruments can be active agents in this process, because they require human mediation, they can certainly modify the ways in which one conceptualizes and produces music.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>While most keyboard and wind instruments have undergone significant modifications since their inventions in order to adapt to changing repertoire, new technology, and larger performance spaces, the instruments of the violin family have remained largely unchanged since the transition from the Baroque to the standardized form universally used today, when the neck and fingerboard were slightly elongated and steel strings were introduced. Attempts to improve or alter the structure of the violin have often been rejected by both performers and luthiers, who have long held sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Cremonese instruments as the ideal form. During the Industrial Revolution in the nineteenth century many European luthiers created experimental violin models in attempts to improve the instrument’s acoustics and to employ production methods using newly available technology. While many of these new violins were praised by musicians, composers, and acousticians for their quality of sound, playability, and ease of production, these innovative instruments of the nineteenth century all eventually fell out of use, becoming novelties in museums and auction houses rather than fixtures in concert halls. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this dissertation I explore the mythology surrounding the violin, especially its early history in Cremona, research innovation and experimentation in modern violin making, cover the history of American violin making along with my own experience in the field, and interview American makers who are currently working to innovate and modernize the craft to adapt to the twenty-first century.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Ann Jellicoe’s (1927-2017) career largely parallels the development of postwar British theatre. She entered the London theatre scene after graduating from the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama around 1948, and continued to produce theatre by way of her community plays through the early 1990s. As a practitioner working within the institution of British theatre, Jellicoe witnessed and participated in many of the moments seen by historians as shaping the narratives of postwar British theatre history—the establishment of the Arts Council England in 1946, the creation of the Royal Court Theatre in 1956, the end of censorship by Lord Chamberlain’s office in 1968, the rise of feminist theatre in the 1970s, the explosion of alternative theatre forms during the 1970s through the 1990s, and the crippling impacts of Margaret Thatcher’s funding cuts to the arts in the 1980s. Yet, Jellicoe is largely absent from the narratives of postwar British theatre.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Jellicoe is best known for her plays The Sport of My Mad Mother (1958) and The Knack (1962), both produced at the Royal Court Theatre in London, or for her role in creating large-scale promenade style community plays in the southwest of England during the 1980s. In this context, Jellicoe is seen as having two distinct careers. This project asks, based on the plays she wrote for the Royal Court, how did she come to create the community plays? What are the unifying threads that can be traced throughout her work? Rather than using the limiting label of playwright and/or director to describe her process, is there a more encompassing term to describe her? Finally, how might adding Jellicoe to existing narratives of postwar British theatre expose historiographical gaps? </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the following dissertation, I reexamine Jellicoe’s career and argue that the term artist-theorist more accurately conveys the scope of her work. I used a genealogical approach when analyzing the archival material available on Jellicoe and the community plays, which led me to view her career as consisting of four phases: the Early Years (–1956), the Royal Court (1957-1965), the Rising Generation (1967–1975), and the Community Plays (1978–). Each of these periods contributed to Jellicoe’s evolving theories and art. Furthermore, I assert that reclassifying her as an artist-theorist allows us to fully appreciate her place in postwar British theatre history. It situates her within a constellation of twentieth-century women practitioners who were exploring similar collaborative working methods, such as Hallie Flanagan from the United States, Joan Littlewood from England, and Ariane Mnouchkine from France. Throughout this project I explore how Jellicoe came to establish her community play system, which was the result of a lifetime of theatrical experimentation, and how the community plays highlight her creative ethos and creation methods that are based on collaboration, accessibility, quality, and trust. Ultimately, I endeavor to reposition Jellicoe in theatre history as an artist-theorist who deserves to be recognized for the totality of her career.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The purpose of this master’s thesis was to provide a literature-based summary of premature neonatal physiology and development and its implications for music therapists providing care in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Physiology was outlined for each anatomical system by gestational age and an overview of common diagnoses and procedures for each system was discussed. Additionally, an overview of sensory processing in premature infants was included, with specific emphasis on development of sensory systems and pain in the NICU. Lastly, implications for music therapists were discussed. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation consists of two parts. In the first part we present a quasi-Monte Carlo implementation of the de-biased Monte Carlo estimator in the context of stochastic differential equations. We combine the quasi-Monte Carlo implementation with path generation techniques, and compare the accuracy of the resulting methods with the original de-biased Monte Carlo estimator when they are applied to option pricing problems under the geometric Brownian motion and Cox-Ingersoll-Ross models. In the second part we consider the application of the multilevel Monte Carlo methods to the LIBOR market model framework. The LIBOR market model is a popular interest rate model used for pricing interest rate derivatives like caplets, caps, and swaptions. Recently, long-dated interest rate derivatives have been popular in the interest rate derivative market, and the practitioners typically price them using the standard Monte Carlo method. To achieve real time pricing, practitioners often use very few Monte Carlo samples, typically in the low hundreds. We use multilevel Monte Carlo, low-discrepancy sequences, and path generation techniques to develop fast and accurate algorithms that achieve significant error reduction for small sample sizes, for pricing long-dated interest rate derivatives in the LIBOR market model framework.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This work examines the historical memory of slavery in the tourism industry of the Red Hills and explores the enduring legacy of white northern and midwestern tourists-turned- transplanters after the Civil War and into the twenty-first century. “Transplanting” describes the process in which whiteness transcended region and white tourists inserted themselves into the history of the South. Buying a stake in the Lost Cause narrative through the purchase of plantation lands, transplanters reproduced the Old South during the Gilded Age as they attempted to suppress the Black tenants, sharecroppers, and laborers who lived on the plantation lands.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The search for alternative nuclear fuels, materials suitable for nuclear waste repositories, and new superconducting materials has been underway for decades. We have explored metal flux and mixed-metal flux synthesis and supercritical hydrothermal synthesis to grow bulk crystals of compounds with potential for such applications. Metal and mixed-metal flux synthesis uses an excess of a low-melting metal or metal mixture as a solvent for crystal growth. Reactants are able to dissolve in the flux and create chemical bonds with one another as well as with the flux itself. A new arc melter has been built to premelt some of the starting materials. In this work, six new compounds have been grown from metal fluxes: two borides with Al substitution on the V sites (UV0.43Al0.57B4), and four structurally related stuffed superstructures: U8Al19Si6 (cubic), U8Al19Si6 (tetragonal), Np8Al19Si6 (tetragonal), and Pu8Al19Si6 (tetragonal). Supercritical hydrothermal reactions were carried out in a high pressure/high temperature superalloy autoclave. The supercritical water provides counterpressure on the thermally expanding sealed reaction ampules within. UO2 crystals approaching 2 mm in diameter have been grown from the supercritical reactions. These crystals have been sent to universities and national laboratories for further chemical and physical analyses.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>     In January 1943, following the successful Allied invasion of North Africa, top military and political leaders discussed the best course of action to defeat the Axis powers in Western Europe. President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill agreed the most effective operation for this outcome would be a long-term, strategic bombing campaign against the German war machine. Known as the Combined Bomber Offensive, and conducted from June 1943 to May 1945, its objectives included paving the way for the intervention of Allied armies, diminishing German industry, and helping to disrupt German morale. In order to successfully achieve these goals, American air and ground crews were trained, deployed, and stationed at airfields overseas. While much has been written about pilots and air crews, the ground crew experience has been mostly neglected.      The following dissertation will examine the impact of ground crews on the air campaign in Europe. Beginning with the selection, screening, and training process of ground crew personnel, the focus will then shift to an overview of life in theater, centered on the Eighth Air Force in England. To provide a more expansive understanding of the ground crew experience, the contributions of the Tuskegee airmen and women in the Women’s Army Corps will also be considered. Finally, this study will discuss the effect that airplane nose art had on American air and ground crews, providing a source of camaraderie and a unifying symbol of hope for them.
     The purpose of this dissertation is to fill in some of the gaps in the historical record, focusing predominantly on ground crews. Using primary sources, such as operational diaries, memoirs of air and ground crew personnel, magazines, newspapers, official government publications, films, letters, oral histories, as well as published materials on the topic, this study will show that the monumental Allied victory in the European Theater during World War II would have been impossible without the contributions of American ground crews. Considered to be “unsung heroes,” their stories are frequently in the background. This dissertation brings them to the foreground, demonstrating that the work and dedication of ground crews provided essential support for the overall mission of the bombing campaigns, profoundly aiding in their success.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This work summarizes the development of several novel separation techniques and characterization methods for petroleum products. The first section summarizes the development of a new method for screening petroleum crude oils for the presence of “ARN” tetraprotic acids, based on molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs). MIPs offer a quick and sensitive method to screen crude oils for ARN acid present at low concentrations (sub-ppm). This study also illustrates MIP’s capabilities for isolating members of an entire class of compounds. Next the development of an HPLC platform (termed HPLC-3) is summarized. HPLC-3 combines a complex solvent gradient with two electron acceptor columns to provide aromatic ring class (ARC) separation for heavy oils. The separation yields seven major fractions: saturates, mono-aromatics (1-rings), di-aromatics (2-rings), tri-aromatics (3-rings), tetra-aromatics (4-rings), polyaromatics and polars (5+/polars), and aliphatic sulfides. The final section examines the aggregation behavior of various petroleum products using gel permeation chromatography (GPC). Four fractions that vary in aggregation state were analyzed by positive atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI) 9.4 tesla Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (APPI FT-ICR MS).  Results showed an inverse relationship between fraction aggregate size and monomer ion yield and revealed that aggregation tendency did not correlate with higher polar or aromatic species abundance. A similar study with GPC fractions collected from an asphaltene highlights some of the challenges associated with the analysis of asphaltene fractions by direct infusion. Nanoaggregate size and monomer ion yield were inversely correlated. The extremely low ionization efficiency for the largest aggregate GPC fractions collected from the asphaltenes limited their characterization to only a few of the most abundant heteroatom classes. However, for all the characterizable heteroatom classes, aggregation closely correlated with increased relative abundance of larger, more aliphatic compounds. Finally, the GPC separation was coupled with online detection by positive atmospheric pressure photoionization ((+)APPI) 21 tesla Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (21 T FT-ICR MS) to overcome the limitations encoutered with analysis by direct infusion and reveal that the most abundant species that comprise the largest aggregate segment are indeed the most aliphatic. The ability to characterize difficult-to-analyze samples, like asphaltenes, is the first major advantage of online coupling. Another benefit is the increased chromatographic resolution afforded by online coupling, which enables a finer examination in the most aggregated region and reveals a local trend opposed to the global trend. The very first species to elute in the largest aggregates were more condensed polyaromatic compounds, and the larger, more aliphatic species elute shortly thereafter in much greater relative abundance.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Statistical depth functions have been well studied for multivariate data and functional data but remained under-explored for point process until very recently Liu and Wu made their first attempt. Generally,  neither depth functions for multivariate data nor for functional data are suitable for measuring the center-outward ranks of point process, since those traditional depth functions neglect the fact that point processes data are ordered and existing two types of randomness. To address this problem, we not only generalize a depth framework that includes 1) a probability term on cardinality of point process , 2) a conditional depth function given cardinality fixed and 3) a weight parameter (based on Liu and Wu's previous work), but also introduce two new conditional depth functions defined on inter-arrival times of point processes. Further, we propose five desirable properties for the conditional depth to robustly rank point process given cardinality fixed.  The asymptotic behavior of our proposed depth framework are investigated. Through simulations we demonstrate that our proposed depth framework and conditional depth functions reveals the center-outward ranks of given point process realizations. And through classification performance on real neural spike trains, we illustrate that our framework have the flexibility to address various classification issues.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this study, I investigated the effectiveness of a creativity-support system that I developed in the level editor of a learning game called Physics Playground on improving college students’ creativity. Moreover, I investigated the validity and reliability of an in-game assessment of creativity to measure students’ creativity. Participants (114 college students from Florida State University) were randomly assigned into one of the four conditions: (1) Inspirational receiving inspirational-only supports (i.e., access to a website with thirty example levels, a brainstorming tool, and a remote association activity including three random inter- and intra-domain words); (2) Instructional receiving instructional-only supports (i.e., specific instructions to first design as many levels as possible, then pick four of the levels, and finally enhance those four levels using a tool called SCAMPER); (3) Both receiving both inspirational and instructional supports; and (4) No Supports which did not receive any of the supports mentioned above. Using an Exploratory Factor Analysis, correlational analyses, a reliability analysis, and multiple Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) analyses, I investigated the research questions of this study. Results showed that the in-game measure of creativity is valid (has both construct and convergent validities) and reliable. Moreover, the Both condition showed to be more effective than the other conditions both on the external measure of creativity and on the in-game measure of creativity. Implications of the findings, limitations, and future research are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The United States Census estimated that there are 2.4 million grandparents in the United States who are the custodial caregivers of a grandchild (US Census Bureau, 2017). The grandparent caregiving role can strain finances, increase the risk of chronic illness, and strain systems of social support (Hayslip et al., 2017). These difficulties place custodial grandparent caregivers at risk for worse outcomes financially, socially, physically and emotionally than their peers (Hayslip et al., 2017). However, custodial care of a grandchild also has the potential to enrich the lives of both the child and custodial grandparent. Many custodial grandparents report finding great fulfillment in their role (Taylor et al., 2018). Quantitative studies have largely focused on the detrimental role of custodial caregiving on grandparent well-being, while recent qualitative work has demonstrated positive implications of the role (Hayslip et al., 2017; Taylor et al., 2018). The research gap in the quantitative study of positive implications for well-being has also been noted in the larger body of family caregiving literature (Marino et al., 2017). Researchers has focused on only one aspect of well-being, negative affect, while ignoring other aspects of well-being such as personal growth and life satisfaction. This study aimed to (1) compare the effects of custodial caregiving on grandparent well-being compared to their peers, (2) understand the role of adaptive traits and resources in moderating these effects, and (3) examine trajectories of grandparent caregiver well-being over time. I used secondary data from the 2010, 2012, and 2014 waves of the Health and Retirement study (HRS). The HRS is a longitudinal study of adults 50 and older that includes multiple measures of psychological well-being that evaluate constructs such as positive affect, life satisfaction and purpose in life. I used cross-sectional data from 2014 to compare well-being of grandparent caregivers and their peers. I included community dwelling female participants who completed the leave behind psychosocial survey. Nursing home residents were excluded from the analysis, and men were excluded to ensure only one case per household. Longitudinal data from 2010, 2012, and 2014 were utilized to compare well-being trajectories of grandmother caregivers based on their time in the role. Grandmothers with complete psychosocial data for at least one wave were included in this analysis. 
Custodial grandmothers positive affect and life satisfaction were similar to their peers. Custodial caregiving was associated with decreased physical well-being (OR= .58, p&lt;.01), and purpose in life (b=-.19, p&lt;.05), and increased negative affect (b=.14, p&lt;.05). Perceived support buffered the role of caregiving on negative affect, and grandmother caregivers with high levels of perceived support did not experience more negative affect than their peers. The longitudinal analysis did not reveal differences in well-being based on time in the caregiving role. 
The findings of this study highlight the importance of incorporating positive measures of well-being in the study of custodial caregiving for a more complete understanding of the role of caregiving on well-being. Custodial caregivers’ positive affect and life satisfaction may be an important area of strength and source of resilience that warrants further exploration. Interventions that target social support are likely to improve positive well-being and reduce negative outcomes.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>(im)Balanced is a twenty-minute work for piano, winds and percussion. Though the ensemble is larger than a chamber work, the sparse texture of one instrument on a part creates the intimacy of chamber music while still allowing for large-scale orchestration and color. The piano is the driving force of the piece and serves as the main voice leading through most every movement, though the work is not a piano concerto. 	Inspiration for this piece comes from the principle of balance. In life, it is most helpful to stay balanced. In daily life, this can look like an appropriate amount of time devoted to work, leisure, exercise, sleep, and other important activities. Within one’s mind, however, it is a completely different story. Not allowing one sphere of responsibility to dominate your life is sometimes hard, but keeping a balanced mind can be even harder. Self-doubt, fear, negativity and uncertainty are just a few of the mental enemies of balance. And though these things are common to the human experience, it seems that the easiest way to become unbalanced is simply to focus on the self to the detriment of global perspective. As a pilot must level to the horizon, we must remember to balance our minds with an expanded perspective.
	Musically, the use of palindromes and symmetry balance the piece. Large-scale formal organization, as in the case of movement three “borrow or rob,” is often in arch form, creating a palindromic structure between the sections. Palindromes can also be found at the title of each movement, which read the same forwards or backwards. There are also many instances of register balance, as evidenced in movement one “sagas,” when many high-frequency licks are answered with lower counterparts and vice versa. In fact, the repeated chords in the first movement provide a quasi-shelf, above and below which musical material is developed with a loose idea of symmetry. Even more fundamental, the pitch collections and harmonies employed throughout the work are chosen for their symmetrical nature and lend a sense of balance to the tonal atmosphere of the work.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The assumption that immigrants are overly involved in crime is deeply rooted in American public opinion. Yet, research published in the last two decades refutes this claim and finds that immigrants are less likely than the native-born to engage in criminal behavior and that immigrant concentration is generally associated with lower levels of community crime. Despite this advancement in the literature, prior work is limited in that it often does not examine recidivism as a measure of offending and whether criminal involvement among immigrants varies across groups. Another pertinent issue is that scholars rarely address the intervening mechanisms that explain the immigration-crime link. The current study addresses these gaps in the research by examining whether legal status and nationality impact recidivism and whether social bonds, inmate visitation, and immigrant concentration account for any group differences in propensity to recidivate. Using data from the Florida Department of Corrections (FDOC) and various modeling strategies, the results show that legal status is not a predictor of recidivism, but that there is some variation in post-release offending when immigrants are categorized by nationality. However, almost all immigrant groups identified recidivate at a lower rate than natives. The findings also reveal that education (i.e., social bonds) and visitation partially mediate some group differences in recidivism. Overall, the results lend support for separating the foreign-born into more specific groups in future research on immigration and crime.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation examines the Disney-produced Star Wars films from a Posthumanist lens to determine if Star Wars is an example of a Posthuman popular culture franchise. A multiperspectival research approach to media studies is utilized to answer this question. Political economy of media is used to explore what financial motivations Disney may have for include characters with marginalized identities in the Star Wars films as well as how the inclusion of those characters may have impacted their bottom line. Critical textual analysis is used to examine characters who demonstrate significant otherness in the Sequel Trilogy films (The Force Awakens, The Last Jedi, and The Rise of Skywalker) to survey how the characters are deployed in the narrative and if the franchise has Posthuman potential within the text itself. Lastly, audience reception research is used to determine how audiences interact with marginalized characters, both digitally and in physical Star Wars spaces, and if these characters are welcome in these spaces. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Ultimately, it is determined that, because of the financial interests that Disney holds to its shareholders combined with pressure from a segment of the audience to decrease the amount of diversity in the franchise, the Disney-produced entries into the Star Wars saga are not examples of Posthumanism in a popular culture text. However, many characters in the films do exhibit a Posthuman ethic. Because of this, there is potential for Star Wars in the future to move in a more Posthuman direction.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>New England (NE) Tropical Cyclones (TCs) can produce significant damage, as well as provide increased forecast track and intensity complexity for forecasters. This is the result of the fact that these TCs recurve, often undergo extratropical transition, and are also forced via midlatitude dynamics that can act as a source of simulation track, structural, and intensity uncertainty. Consequently, not only do forecasters still struggle with forecasting NE TCs in real-time, but the region has had few such cases to quantify our ability to predict these storms in an age when they can now be explicitly resolved by Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP). The track predictability of historical landfalling NE TCs was explored in this study through hindcasts of all landfalling NE TCs from 1900-2011. Utilizing version 4.1.1 of the Weather Forecast and Research Model Advanced Research WRF (WRF-ARW) with two outer fixed domains (27 km, 9km), as well as a vortex-following inner domain (3 km), 18 cases were examined beginning 7 days prior landfall. As a result of utilizing relatively coarse ERA-20C analysis as boundary and initial conditions, WRF’s vortex removal and insertion scheme was employed to provide more plausible initial conditions for the hindcasts that can be provided by ERA-20C alone. The resulting total-track, cross-track, and along-track errors were calculated and then compared to various recent model track forecast errors as well as the National Hurricane Center’s (NHC) official track forecast errors. The evolution of the synoptic-scale patterns leading up to the time of landfall for these 18 TCs was then investigated. The distance of the simulated TCs to their surrounding troughs and ridges was also investigated. An objective climatology of the nearby trough, ridge, and jet axis locations was determined and analyzed. This analysis found that the average predictability of the historical NE TCs was low compared to a recent NHC climatology of forecast track errors. Lead times for when landfall projections occurred on long track Main Development Region storms were between 2 and 3 days before landfall. These results argue that the predictability of NE TCs utilizing a state of the art WRF model remains limited, giving inadequate lead time for emergency managers and forecasters.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>In sacrificial dilemmas where causing harm maximizes outcomes, people rate judges who reject outcome-maximizing harm as more trustworthy, warm, and moral—but less competent and leader-like—than judges who endorse such harm. However, laypeople may arrive at different inferences if they incorporate target social identity information (e.g., religious) when forming expectations about moral decisions, especially if a target violates expectations. In the current work, we explored whether people accurately incorporate information about a targets’ religiosity into their expectations regarding that person’s judgments. Moreover, we examined how such expectations influence perceptions of religious judges who do or do not make sacrificial judgments consistent with expectations. In six studies (N = 2,386), participants expected religious targets to reject harm in sacrificial dilemmas more often than neutral or atheistic targets, consistent with how religious people tend to respond to sacrificial dilemmas. This expectation negatively influenced competence perceptions of religious judges who accepted harm in dilemmas: Religious judges who accepted sacrificial harm—be they Christian, Muslim, or of unspecified religious affiliation—did not receive the typical boost to competence, suggesting that violating expectations based on religious values communicates a sort of cluelessness. Moreover, atheist targets who violated expectations did not take hits to either competence or morality, suggesting that the pattern is not simply a general pattern for any expectation-violating target. Together, findings suggest that lay perceivers accurately use social identity information such as religiosity predict others’ moral judgments, and violating these expectations can negatively impact social perceptions of the judge in ways that undercut strategic self-presentation in dilemmas.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation explores the ways in which the thematic content and performance practices of country music have historically implied notions of protection and safety, while paradoxically enabling instances of violence on both individual and cultural levels. I specifically focus on the sociocultural effects of country music in the U.S. and beyond during the two decades since the terrorist attacks of 9/11/2001, employing the argument that both 9/11 and other major sociopolitical events of that period have resulted in a fundamental transformation of the ways in which “safe” individuals, communities, and even musical groupings are and have been represented and perceived. A survey of the history of country music yields numerous instances of both violence and safety encoded in the lyrical content of the music and the identity representations of country musicians and their fans. For decades, the protagonists of country music—whether the artists themselves or the characters they portray through their songs, sounds, imagery, and ideological stances—have occupied a peculiar and paradoxical space, straddling the line between the drifter and the provider while balancing images of safety and protection with rough living and aggression. Recent developments in U.S. politics, however, have raised significant questions regarding historically safe identities. An ongoing outbreak of mass shootings, a new cultural outspokenness regarding gender issues and sexual assault, growing tensions around matters of nationalism and race, and other political and cultural factors continue to change the nation’s idea of what is and is not safe, as well as what types and conditions of safety individuals should expect or deserve.  Both country musicians and fans are now responding to a complex political era in which Americans (i.e., United States-ians) have had to look inward, confronting systems of violence spearheaded by their own citizens. The exponential rise in mass shootings—most frequently committed by white, American men—is just one example of how certain demographic groups, so often displayed as the “protectors” and “providers” in country music, are now, with increasing cultural intensity, being recognized as potential perpetrators of violent action. A central argument of this dissertation is that these changes reflect a particular upending of the “All-American Man” figure—not just within country music, but within American society—and a reconsideration of the fact that this figure, formerly recognized as a marker of protection and security, is now increasingly questioned as a potential perpetrator of violence. Discussions of safety, place, identity, gender, community, and popular music culture all play into this complicated conversation. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>How does country music respond to these changing dynamics of what constitutes safety (or lack thereof) in American society? To address this question, I begin by overviewing the identity systems created by a century of country music and its culture in the 20th century, noting specific identity formations relational to concepts of violence and safety. Following this, I zero in on the specific events and conditions related to these concepts of violence and safety during the first two decades of the 21st century, examining a tumultuous and transformational set of years within country music and its surrounding culture. Specifically, sociopolitical events such as the 9/11 terror attacks, the presidential elections in 2008 and 2016, and increased national awareness of issues such as gun violence, gender equality, and sexual assault provide a critical cultural context to changes in country music, including the rise of “bro country” and “arena country” in the early 21st century, an increasingly prevalent narrative of gender issues in country music lyrics, and a mobilization of identity themes relating both to the validation and questioning of traditionally powerful identity tropes. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>With the advances being made in Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL), research is showing that computers can be an effective tool for the language classroom. However, what is missing seems to be a connection between CALL and Second Language Acquisition (SLA) theories (Parmaxi &amp; Zaphiris, 2017). CALL is not being connected to SLA theories and therefore its impact to the SLA field is limited. Due to this gap, this study seeks to focus on one specific SLA theory, Processing Instruction (VanPatten, 1996), to see if CALL, as a learning tool, can be an effective means for changing how one processes another language.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>     This dissertation will look at two processing strategies: 1) the First Noun and 2) Meaning before Non-meaning. This study will examine the effectiveness of the different aspects of PI, i.e. Referential versus Affective questions, for processing changes of a language when implemented on a computer. Intermediate L2 Spanish learners (N=62) received instruction with either referential only, affective only, or referential and affective questions. A fourth group received no instruction. A pretest, immediate posttest, and delayed posttest experimental design was implemented. An examination of the effectiveness of instruction type on learner’s interpretation of different word order sentences and present and past tense morphological sentences was done. A self-paced reading task was also utilized to see if any gains made in the sentence-level interpretation task could also be seen on a moment-to-moment task. It incorporated a pretest and a delayed posttest design to measure changes in processing language.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>     This research contributes to CALL and how to design activities in a CALL environment to have a greater impact on L2 processing. Ultimately, it seeks to unite the two fields of CALL and SLA together as very little research has been conducted in this area.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Alcohol misuse and overuse has become a critical issue in the United States; however, the majority of intervention work has focused on the individual struggling with the addiction rather than including loved ones and family members in the recovery process. The environment and relationships of the individual struggling with alcohol use are crucial to ultimately helping that person as these factors have been shown to potentially deter or dissuade alcohol use. Therefore, it is important to understand underlying factors that impact alcohol use as well as the potential role that relationships could play in alcohol use. Associations have been found between trait mindfulness, relationship quality, and alcohol use separately but these variables have not been studied in a single model. Additionally, these variables have mostly been studied in an individual context even though all of these variables have been shown to have a dyadic impact. This study sought to explore the interpersonal and intrapersonal associations between trait mindfulness, relationship quality, and alcohol use.  120 heterosexual couples completed self-report measures that studied levels of trait mindfulness, relationship quality, and alcohol use. This study determined that there were both individual and dyadic impacts of trait mindfulness on relationship quality, as well as relationship quality being associated with alcohol use. Specifically, the results of this study showed positive links from female positive relationship quality to female alcohol use, as well as male trait mindfulness had a negative link to male alcohol use. Additionally, male negative relationship quality was positively linked to male alcohol use, and male trait mindfulness was positively linked to female positive relationship quality, negatively linked to male negative relationship quality, and finally positively related to female negative relationship quality. These findings provide initial support that trait mindfulness may be one way to target alcohol use and relationship quality. This study also provides support for the continued study of the dyadic impacts on alcohol use, and continued study of underlying factors that could influence that relationship. Future research could include a larger and more diverse sample to better understand the generalizability of these interactions.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>For thirty years the Mickee Faust Academy for the REALLY Dramatic Art, an award-winning feminist/lesbian/disability theatre company, has brought vaudevillian performance and quick witted political satire to the Tallahassee community. This dissertation is the first scholarly account of the unique politics and poetics established by this eccentric collective since its inception. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>I follow the experiences of Faust co-founders, Donna Marie Nudd and Terry Galloway through a backdrop of a Dyke-filled New York City, a vibrant queer Austin, a disabiliy led sub-group of the United Kingdom, ending in colorful warehouse in Railroad Square Art Park in Tallhassee, Florida; home to the Mickee Faust Club. The productions of Murderous Moveable Macbeth, Faust Cabarets and key Faust films serve as a site of analysis to investigae the distinct elements integral to Faust’ process of community led theatre making. Moreover, through the analysis of a good bad joke and Faust relationship to camp, I identify four Faustian aesthetics fuled by desire.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Using their archives, participating in their practical work, as well as interviewing their members, I employ a mixed ethnography-based approach to provide a comprehensive understanding of how this company has sustained its operation, established its community, and developed unique theatrical practices and aesthetics rooted in feminist and lesbian movement.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Numerous identified factors are associated with suicide cross-sectionally and across long follow-up periods, but methodological limitations have hindered examination of these constructs as short-term predictors of suicide risk. The use of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is an ideal avenue through which to examine whether these risk factors are associated with concurrent, or predict subsequent, suicidal ideation, intent, and behavior, in real time. This study aimed to investigate factors that have been identified at the retrospective and cross-sectional level—repetitive negative thinking, thwarted interpersonal needs, hopelessness, agitation, irritability, sleep disturbances, and negative life events—as correlates and predictors of changes in suicidal ideation, intent, and behavior in the short term utilizing EMA methodology. A sample of 237 community-based adults (61.6% female), aged 18 to 55 years (M = 27.12, SD = 8.60), who reported significant suicidal ideation on a screening survey completed two weeks of EMA monitoring, six times per day, during which they provided information on their current cognitive, interpersonal, affective/physiological, and situational symptoms, including suicide-related outcomes. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to disaggregate between-person and within-person effects and examine whether (1) each factor was a correlate of concurrent suicidal ideation and intent; and whether (2) each factor predicted changes in subsequent time-point suicidal ideation and intent, controlling for current time-point suicidal ideation and intent. Results indicated that the majority of factors were correlates and predictors of suicidal ideation and intent in separate models. In joint predictor models, rumination, suicide-specific rumination, and hopelessness emerged as the most consistent correlates and predictors of suicidal ideation and intent. These findings provide insight on the temporal nature of commonly identified risk factors for suicide-related outcomes, and highlight potential avenues for intervention.</DISS_para>

In particular, our interest lies in the Kolyma River (KR) as it is the largest Arctic watershed entirely lined below with continuous organic-rich permafrost and is equally subject to shrubification. On one hand, it appears that permafrost is predicted to thaw with the potential to release large quantities of ancient organic carbon. On the other hand, nutrient liberation, increased moisture, and warming allow vegetation to colonize more effectively increasing modern sources of organic carbon. The decomposition of permafrost soil organic matter has been postulated to release permafrost-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) into stream and riverine networks that is exceptionally old and aliphatic in nature. We aimed to improve the evaluation of permafrost dissolved organic carbon (DOC) inputs and fate by implementing ramped pyrolysis oxidation (RPO) and isotopic analysis coupled with ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry. Bioincubation analyses were fundamental in replicating the transformations that occur to DOM during riverine transport. We found that highly aliphatic molecular formulae identified in undegraded permafrost DOM contrasts with the comparatively aliphatic-poor composition of KR DOM, suggesting that limited quantities of undegraded permafrost DOM are present in the KR. RPO radiocarbon analysis of KR DOC fractions exhibited no “hidden” aged component indicative of permafrost influence. Consistent with radiocarbon results, thermostability analysis indicated limited biodegraded permafrost DOC in the KR. A mixing model allowed us to estimate permafrost inputs to the KR DOC. Ultimately, our findings highlight that export of modern terrestrial DOM is currently overwhelming any permafrost DOM signature in the KR. This emphasizes the important ramifications of vegetation changes on the composition and biolability of transported DOM in this region with increasing shrubs dominance over herbaceous vegetation and bare ground. To investigate this, we subjected leachates of representative vegetation and soils both to biodegradation incubations and analysis using ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry. Biolability was seen to primarily be driven by lower relative abundances of highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds and higher relative abundances of aliphatic compounds and an overall low nominal oxidation state of carbon. In particular, DOC derived from shrubs has a lower biolability when compared to non-woody vegetation, containing on average nearly half as much %BDOC. This indicates that this DOC may persist in the water column which may have large implications as we continue attempts to quantify a permafrost DOC flux. It may be that studies will need to appraise the role vegetation cover plays in altering the age and composition of DOM of a region before investigating inputs of aged sources.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Families in the rural town of Immokalee, Florida are faced with the problem of finding a high-quality place to care for their infants and toddlers while they work, due to a lack of space in child development centers that accept infants and toddlers. One such center is the Guadalupe Center, a child development center which currently has a waitlist of over 400 families. This dissertation in practice uses qualitative methods to interview and explore the stories of eleven families who have been on the center’s waitlist for over one year, examining what they are doing for childcare in the meantime and how satisfied they are with the current childcare they are using. Families told about what things their children did during the day, what they would change about their child’s current care situation, and why they chose the Guadalupe Center as the place where they most wanted their child to be. Recommendations include dissemination of the information to local, state, and national organizations, as well as to the local stakeholders of the Guadalupe Center. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>High spatial variability has been observed in simple fuelbeds (Keane et al.2012, Hiers et al. 2009) which accentuates the need to describe the actual fuel arrangement and composition of fuels in a prescribed or wildfire operation setting as opposed to abstract representations, regardless of model application and domain size. Working with high resolution 3D datasets, I will apply TLS scan information of highly instrumented burn plots in Pebble Hill and Eglin Air Force Base to create voxelized data arrays containing bulk density and fuel height for surface fuels &lt;1m on a horizontal resolution of 0.5 m2. This will be coupled with a common method to populate the environment with trees described in Linn et al. (2005), where fuel is assigned to voxels depending on tree inputs including tree location, height, height to live crown, crown radius, and crown concavity. Starting at the resolution of the fire grid on QUIC-Fire (2m), fuels will be aggregated, and characteristics will be calculated with resolutions of 2, 4, 6, 8, 16, and 32 m, as well as using a single fuel characteristic for the entire plot. I will then use QUIC-Fire under a full range of wind and dead fuel moisture conditions common to prescribed and wildland fires to represent potential ranges of fire intensity, since it is possible that fuel resolution is only relevant for fire intensities under a particular threshold of wind speed, moisture content, or some combination of each. These thresholds will be investigated using a suite of different metrics that have been developed to fully describe the fire environment. Some of these include the bulk rate of spread (analogous to perimeter growth rate), the reduced area, and the normalized canopy consumption, as well as more traditional metrics such as surface fuel consumption and max downwind spread rate. Using QUIC-Fire in an ensemble fashion will allow us to calculate a margin of error that’s considered acceptable for every run, and sensitivity to the fuel heterogeneity can then be tested</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>As the push for autonomous systems gains momentum, there has been a shift from automated to semi-autonomous systems, and current and future applications of artificial intelligence will revolve around the development of autonomous systems. At present, research is being performed to enable autonomous systems in trading, transportation, weapons, aircrafts, homes,  drones, robots, and diagnostic imaging. Several companies such as Apple, Google, Microsoft and Tesla as well as NASA, the US Navy and the US military are investing in research on autonomous systems. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Autonomous systems may involve the use of a large number of hardware and software components. While sensors are responsible for collecting data about the surroundings, machine learning and algorithms are used to generate useful information from available data and determine the action that should be taken. For most automatic and autonomous systems, it is important for the system to have the capability to detect hazardous situations and provide precise details, enabling either a human to take over or allowing the system itself to handle the situation. While an autonomous system must have sufficient knowledge or training to be able to achieve its ultimate goal, it must be capable of dynamically modifying the path to the goal based on the information obtained by fusing data from various sources or sensors. Besides, several autonomous systems, such as autonomous vehicles or autonomous trading, need fast real-time data processing in order to act accurately in real-time. Finally, the goal of all autonomous systems is to minimize human intervention.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation contributes to the development of autonomous systems through applications that target different aspects of complex autonomous systems and belong to three distinct domains. It includes automatic segmentation of brain tumors, which is a step towards autonomous diagnostic imaging as well as an example of detection and exact identification of a hazardous condition. The automatic generation of high-resolution undistorted MRIs from distorted low-resolution MRIs reduces the amount of human intervention and develops a system that generates usable information from available data. On the other hand, drone self-localization, road segmentation, and extraction of road network graphs involve fusion of data from various types of sensors. Road graph extraction and drone self-localization play an import role in routing, and is crucial in the ability of an unmanned vehicle to reach its final goal. Besides, in the field of autonomous trading, we explore the use of time-series data to predict stock prices and make decisions about real-time stock transactions.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study of the nuclear structure of $^{24}$Na, $^{35}$S, $^{41}$K, and $^{41}$Ca has been carried out at Florida State University's (FSU) John D. Fox Superconducting Linear Accelerator Laboratory. These experiments were performed using $\gamma$-spectroscopy from the augmented FSU high-resolution high-purity germanium (HPGe) array to determine where newly observed decays belong in the level schemes of these nuclei as well as suggest spin and parity for the newly observed states.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The experiments that were conducted to observe these nuclei are: $^{12}$C($^{14}$C,pn$\gamma$)$^{24}$Na carried out in March 2016; $^{14}$C($^{26}$Mg,$\alpha$n)$^{35}$S in July 2018; $^{26}$Mg($^{18}$O,3n)$^{41}$Ca and $^{26}$Mg($^{18}$O,p2n)$^{41}$K in May 2017 and repeated in August 2019 for more statistics. An attempt was made to narrow down possibilities for spins and parities of these new states using Directional Correlations de-exciting Oriented states (DCO) ratios and polarization data.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The main goal was to paint a picture of the shell structure evolution moving from the $sd$ shell to the $fp$ shell. Beginning with $^{24}$Na, Z = 11 and N = 13, and $^{35}$S, Z = 16 and N = 19, with the valence nucleons in the dominant ground state configuration contained in the $sd$ shell. The former has valence nucleons in the $0d_{5/2}$ orbital at the bottom of the $sd$ shell and the latter has protons filling the $1s_{1/2}$ orbital and neutrons (with one hole) in the $0d_{3/2}$ orbital. Moving up from there to $^{41}$Ca, Z = 20 and N = 21, and $^{41}$K, Z = 19 and N = 22, brings the valence neutrons into the $fp$ shell. In the dominant ground state configuration, $^{41}$Ca consists of a full $sd$ shell and one neutron in the $0f_{7/2}$ orbital and $^{41}$K has one proton hole in $0d_{3/2}$ and two neutrons in $0f_{7/2}$. These nuclei illustrate a nice progression from low down in the $sd$ shell up to the the $0f_{7/2}$ orbital. In addition, $^{41}$Ca and $^{41}$K lie near the doubly-magic $^{40}$Ca nucleus and provide useful information on this elusive region of the table of isotopes.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Afterwards, the results were compared to shell model calculations in an attempt to determine which interaction showed the best agreement. During my time at FSU, an additional FSU shell model interaction was developed with the aid of several colleagues and I was able to test them and those results will be shown here as well. Several comparisons with other shell model interactions are given in this work.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Repertoire is the foundation of any music class. Many directors use as series of filters in place to sort repertoire through a list of material and philosophical criteria. Most directors look for guidance by experts, including state associations and the repertoire lists they prescribe. An analysis of 12 state associations prescribed repertoire lists (N = 15,381) in six regions of the United States showed that directors may have a hard time developing a quality program that meets the needs of their students as well as advocates or supports female composers. A total of 359 compositions by women were identified (2.3%) by the 50 female composers that were represented in this project. The average ratio of women composers represented in a region was 2.26%. The aim of this study is to bring awareness to the lack of compositions by women in state prescribed repertoire lists as well as provide a reference for state associations and directors to look to discover quality music by female composers. Other resources such as free online sources and a list of women who were not advocated for on the state prescribed lists were also provided.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Computer vision principles enable the analysis of fire, wind, and plume behavior from visual and infrared (IR) video as opposed to sparse measurements obtained with expensive instrumentation. Data that quantifies the transport of heat and fire spread, turbulent statistical information, and plume structure can be obtained from either visual or IR images and contribute to our evolving understanding of fire behavior. Unfortunately, black-box computer vision programs are not suitable due to the visually unique environment of fires and complex turbulent nature of their dynamics. I describe modifications of classical computer vision algorithms with adapted graph theory techniques that are applied to diverse instances of this environment and use them to extract data from prescribed fire videos. These data extraction experiments improve our understanding of the dynamics in complex environments and can validate fire spread models.</DISS_para>

      <DISS_content>
         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>I have noticed a disturbing trend among many people that I know, ranging from acquaintances to dear friends, and spread across political, cultural, and social spectra. This trend is towards the demonization of people with opposing viewpoints, an attitude of righteous anger, and a desire to punish (or see punished) those with whom we disagree. I see this manifested among people with whom I personally share many things and beliefs in common and among those with whom I share very little and disagree profoundly. I have seen many interactions in which vicious language, brimming with hatred, is meted out by people who I would never have thought capable of such enmity, people I respect and admire. In these incidents both parties believe that their position is just and right. Each seems to believe that relationship is impossible because the disagreement exists, and the person on the other side of the issue is despicable, wicked, morally bankrupt, or evil.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This piece is not intended as a political commentary but is borne out of concern for the hearts and minds of all those people mentioned above. In a 1957 sermon delivered at Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, Martin Luther King Jr. said, “…hate distorts the personality of the hater. We usually think of what hate does for the individual hated or the individuals hated or the groups hated. But it is even more tragic, it is even more ruinous and injurious to the individual who hates. You just begin hating somebody, and you will begin to do irrational things. You can’t see straight when you hate. You can’t walk straight when you hate. You can’t stand upright. Your vision is distorted. There is nothing more tragic than to see an individual whose heart is filled with hate.” </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Dr. King was speaking to his followers in the Civil Rights movement, warning against allowing themselves to begin hating those who opposed them. He is primarily concerned that, while pursuing what may be a just and righteous goal, his followers not lose themselves in the process.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Requiem for Lost Soul is meant to help the listener assume a stance of mourning, rather than anger. Unlike Dan Forrest’s excellent Requiem for the Living, which seeks to comfort its audience, this piece invites its listeners to embark on a difficult, uncomfortable, and sometimes disturbing emotional journey. It takes fragments of the Latin Requiem mass as the foundation of three main movements, with interludes between each featuring quotations by Dr. King and Buddhist monk and peace activist Thich Nhat Hanh. The spirit of the requiem mass, a mass of mourning for someone who has died, is used in this context to mourn someone we perceive as spiritually or morally dead.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The first movement, Requiem Aeternam is built on a diatonic cloud, freely employing almost all pitches in a G natural minor collection. The text is taken from the gradual of a Requiem mass, usually found in early chanted Requiems.  It is presented in fragments, alluding to the traditional text but unable to bring itself to fully embrace or complete any of the fragments. This first movement is hesitant and somewhat halting, reflecting the difficulty of the task ahead (as Dr. King said, “[loving your enemies] was painfully hard, pressingly hard.”). The first interlude is taken from a letter written by Thich Nhat Hanh to George W. Bush imploring him to halt the war in Iraq. Hanh urges us to think of those who oppose us as “brothers … they may not see us as brothers because of their anger, their misunderstanding, and their discrimination. But with some awakening, we can see things in a different way, and this will allow us to respond differently to the situation.” </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This interlude gives way to the dark atonal landscape of the second movement, Quid Sum Miser. The text in this movement is from the dies irae portion of the mass and asks us to look at ourselves as broken and undeserving, a position from which it is impossible to judge our fellows. I believe this text is important to include in this work, because in the process of avoiding self-righteous anger, we may stray too far in the opposite direction and begin to look down on others due to our superior capacity for forgiveness. I have seen this self-righteous attitude too many times to believe it is an acceptable alternative to anger. The antidote to both states is humility. A person who is honest with themselves about their faults, shortcomings, and flaws cannot honestly sit in judgement on anyone. The second interlude is synthesized from several quotes in Dr. King’s sermon. The quote “hate cannot drive out hate” is often misused, sometimes even cited to mean that you shouldn’t stand up to something you believe is wrong. Far from it, Dr. King clearly believed that it was imperative to stand up and speak out, to fight against injustice and inequality. But Dr. King also believed that to speak and act in hate would be for the cure to be worse than the disease, and that speaking and acting in love was the only way forward. No less vital, no less imperative, and in today’s world no less radical.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The third and final movement, Hostias et Preces Tibi, again employs a pan-diatonic palate, but now an E major collection. The text is a prayer that the fallen soul transition from death into life. This is the culmination of the piece, the arrival at the state of love. This is what breaks down all barriers and accomplishes real change. According to Dr. King,</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>"That’s it. There is a power in love that our world has not discovered yet. Jesus discovered it centuries ago. Mahatma Gandhi of India discovered it a few years ago, but most men and most women never discover it. For they believe in hitting for hitting; they believe in an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth; they believe in hating for hating; but Jesus comes to us and says, “This isn’t the way.”</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>And oh this morning, as I think of the fact that our world is in transition now. Our whole world is facing a revolution. Our nation is facing a revolution, our nation. One of the things that concerns me most is that in the midst of the revolution of the world and the midst of the revolution of this nation, that we will discover the meaning of Jesus’ words. … So this morning, as I look into your eyes, and into the eyes of all of my brothers in Alabama and all over America and over the world, I say to you, “I love you. I would rather die than hate you.” And I’m foolish enough to believe that through the power of this love somewhere, men of the most recalcitrant bent will be transformed. And then we will be in God’s kingdom."</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Teacher learning has become a topic of increasing interest in the field of second language teacher education, while the development of L2 teacher identity has been viewed as a central process and practice in language teachers’ professional growth. However, much remains underexplored within the relationship between L2 teacher identity development and teacher learning. In this study, I aim to investigate this issue by exploring questions of what an English language teacher identity is described by pre-service L2 teachers and their teacher educator respectively and how pre-service L2 teachers’ experiences of teacher learning influences their language teacher identity formation. Drawing upon data collected from questionnaires, interviews, and reflective journals, findings of this study demonstrate that there are overlaps between the English language teacher identity described by pre-service teachers and their teacher educator, while differences also exist in terms of the particular aspects in English teacher identity emphasized in their descriptions. Moreover, pre-service teachers’ teacher learning practices reveal the diverse avenues and objectives in their construction of individual English teacher identities. Based on these findings, I discuss English language teacher identity as a construct and how individual pre-service teachers’ teacher learning and identity formation inform the field’s understanding of L2 teaches’ construction of language teacher identity.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In the current study, I intended to simulate single case research design (SCRD) data to investigate the impact of the presence of autocorrelation on analysis of SCRD for Bayesian method under a variety of simulation conditions. The purpose of this study is to analyze the results of data obtained in the context of an individual single-case study, for a variety of simulation conditions such as varying sample sizes, varying numbers of measurement observations, and the presence of varied levels of autocorrelation. Then I compared performance of both methods using Bias, Percentage Bias (PB), Mean Square Error (MSE), Power, and DIC statistics. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was implemented to analyze the summary statistics and compare performance of both approaches. Another goal of this study was to develop and fit several Bayesian models from simple model to a complex model to evaluate the significance of the model parameters in a SCRD in the presence of autocorrelation. Also, the effect of using a scaled-inverse Wishart distribution over parameter estimation as a prior distribution for covariance matrix of parameters was explored.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>It was found that the performance of the Bayesian models in this study was satisfactory, except that of the Scaled inverse-Wishart distribution with autocorrelated error (Model 3B). It produced extremely large biased estimates, percentage bias (PB), standardized bias (SB) and mean square error (MSE) for most of the simulation conditions. On the other hand, the Scaled-inverse Wishart distribution performed well if serial dependency was not taken into account across simulation conditions. Also, the SB was around 5%, bias still had an adverse effect on the coverage rates of the models. A poor convergence rate was observed for SIW regardless of modeling autocorrelation and convergence was not reached for Random Slopes Model (RSM) for some of the simulation conditions when autocorrelation was considered.  Although mean standardized biases of the models were around 5%, it is likely that having larger standard error for the models had effects on the power and the coverage rates of the models. In most cases, coverage rate under 95% were observed, which means under-coverage and indicates higher Type- I error rate should be expected.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Over 200,000 women were incarcerated in 2015, constituting approximately 9% of the U.S. prison population (Kaeble &amp; Glaze, 2016).  Best practices call for individualized services upon release in hopes of successful reentry into society (Freudenberg, 2006).  Much funding and effort has been put into researching factors associated with recidivism and reentry programming, however recidivism rates persist at rates exceeding 77% (females and males collectively; Durose, Cooper, &amp; Snyder, 2014).  Why does recidivism continue despite focused prevention efforts?</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>One reason recidivism persists might be due to most research being on male inmates.  Male inmates outnumber female inmates 5:1 (Kaeble &amp; Glaze, 2016), so on the surface it can appear that more efforts should be focused on men being released from prison.  However, as high as 80% of women in prison were primary custodians of minor children at the time of their arrest (Straussner &amp; Fewell, 2011).  The impact of incarceration of women, including recidivism, is great considering the transgenerational reach.  Research on gender differences and the impact of trauma, the use and reliance on social support, and reentry needs has found significant gender differences (James &amp; Glaze, 2006; Ullman &amp; Filipas, 2005; Van Voorhis, 2012).  However more research is needed to pinpoint risk- and protective-factors as well as to identify critical windows for intervention.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Another reason recidivism persists might be due to the lack of comprehensiveness of traditional models used to test reentry efficacy.  In addition to risk factors included in traditional models (e.g. mental illness and substance abuse), research has found significant relationships between childhood abuse and social support and between social support and recidivism (Brennan, Breitenbach, Dieterich, Salisbury, &amp; Van Voorhis, 2012; James &amp; Glaze, 2006; Van Voorhis, 2012).  Research has also found that childhood abuse, mental illness, and substance abuse are strongly correlated, as are mental illness and substance abuse strongly correlated to recidivism (Carson &amp; Anderson, 2016; Huebner, DeJong, &amp; Cobinna, 2010; Kennedy, Tripodi, &amp; Pettus-Davis, 2013; Kennedy, Tripodi, Pettus-Davis, &amp; Ayers, 2015).  However, research has yet to look specifically at the relationships between these variables (childhood abuse, mental illness, substance abuse, social support, and recidivism) within one comprehensive model.  Additionally, most research on recidivism is with male inmates.  Given the findings that women are much more likely than men to report trauma histories, females differ significantly from males in their response to trauma, and there seems to be gender-specific reentry needs, more research on this special population is needed (Brennan, Breitenbach, Dieterich, Salisbury, &amp; Van Voorhis, 2012; James &amp; Glaze, 2006; Van Voorhis, 2012.)  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The current study addresses several gaps in the literature: gender differences, the impact of childhood abuse, and the protective strength of social supports among a sample of women in prison.  Cox proportional hazards model was used to answer, “What is the relationship between childhood abuse, substance abuse, mental illness, and social support on recidivism?”  Combining childhood abuse, substance abuse, mental illness, and social support into one model looking at impact on recidivism is unique to this study. Four hypotheses were tested: 1) participants with histories of childhood abuse recidivate more quickly than those without, 2) participants with histories of substance abuse recidivate more quickly than those without, 3) participants with mental illness (PTSD, depression, mania, anxiety, psychosis, and ASPD) recidivate more quickly than those without, and 4) participants with lower anticipated social support post-release recidivate more quickly than those with higher anticipated social support.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Anxiety is a naturally occurring adaptive response to potential threat, and inappropriate overrepresentation of the anxiety response can classify an anxiety disorder. Women are likelier than men to be diagnosed with anxiety disorders, yet possible neural correlates to sex differences in threat processing remain underexplored. Within the brain, regions that comprise the corticolimbic system are believed to serve functions necessary to survival, such as evaluating potential threats in the environment and signaling appropriate behavioral responses to downstream nuclei. The ventral hippocampus (vHPC), an essential component of the corticolimbic system, contains populations of pyramidal neurons in both hemispheres that monosynaptically project to subregions of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) ipsilaterally in rodents. Effective electrical signaling between brain regions (including the HPC and the mPFC) is crucial to the regions’ communications. One means by which interconnected neuron populations are hypothesized to communicate across longer spatial distances in the brain is by temporarily synchronizing their units’ firing, as deduced by measuring time-locked changes in their extracellular local field potentials (LFPs). Synchronized oscillations within the theta frequency band (~8 Hz) between the vHPC and mPFC underlie innate avoidance behaviors in male rodents. This vHPC-mPFC theta-based endophenotype has been proposed as a potential biomarker for studying neural circuits supporting anxiety in animal models. However, theta-band synchrony between the vHPC and mPFC remains unexplored in female rodents. Additionally, neurons in the vHPC anatomically project to both the prelimbic (PrL) and infralimbic (IL) subregions of the mPFC, yet research about their intrinsic electrical connectivity is sparse in males and absent in females. The dorsal hippocampus (dHPC) is also an essential component of the corticolimbic system, and, unlike the vHPC, connects polysynaptically to subregions of the mPFC. Synchronized neural oscillations between the dHPC and mPFC have been hypothesized to play important roles in several cognitive-behavioral processes necessary for survival. There is limited research detailing electrical signaling within these regions in females, and a gap in the literature examining their LFP interactions. In females, natural cycling of gonadal hormones including estradiol and progesterone dynamically modifies the expression of innate avoidance behavior in rodents, electrical excitability of hippocampal (HPC) and mPFC neurons, and HPC-mPFC functional connectivity in women. This suggests a potential role for the hormonal milieu to act on synchronized neural oscillations within the vHPC-mPFC circuit. Here, in-vivo HPC-mPFC LFP circuit dynamics from male and female rats are examined during active exploration of a familiar arena. LFP dynamics are compared across a range of frequencies between brain regions and between hippocampal-prefrontal circuits. Theta band synchrony between hippocampal-prefrontal circuits are examined by measures of power and phase. Male and female data are contrasted, then female estrous stage is assessed as a potential factor contributing to variance in HPC-mPFC oscillatory signaling. Results suggest that synchronized theta band communications are strongest in vHPC-PrL and dHPC-IL circuits in terms of power and phase. In male rats, vHPC-mPFC theta signaling was more synchronized than dHPC-mPFC signaling, whereas the opposite trend was observed in female brains. Finally, significant changes in HPC-mPFC theta signaling were observed across the female estrous stage, suggesting a role for the activational effects of gonadal hormones on HPC-mPFC LFP signaling. These findings establish novel research avenues in the fields of sex as a biological variable and the effects of endogenous hormone status in HPC-mPFC network activity.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The advancement of numerical weather prediction (NWP) has hastened the effort to understand how moist processes -- many of which are parameterized in NWP models -- influence cyclone structure and intensity. Despite this effort, there still remain many open questions about the actual mechanisms by which moist physical processes modify a baroclinic wave and where those mechanisms are active. Recent investigations have focused on the roles of microphysics, convection, radiation, and horizontal potential vorticity (PV) dipoles in the modification of PV in the warm conveyor belt of an extratropical cyclone. These previous studies were designed to identify localized anomalies in PV and to determine how those anomalies were generated, either through use of Lagrangian trajectories or passive tracers. While these studies have provided a detailed description of the sub-synoptic scale modification of a cyclone due to diabatic processes, they have not clarified what is the overall impact of diabatic processes on the system-wide structure and evolution of the cyclone. The purpose of this study is to determine the systematic impact of parameterized process and resolution changes on the entirety of the cyclone. To accomplish this goal, an ensemble of simulations is conducted using various parametrization and resolution configurations. Through analysis of the ensemble of simulations, the complete effects of radiation, convection, and cloud microphysics on cyclone evolution are diagnosed.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Analysis of vertical profiles of PV averaged over the effective cyclone area (ECA) demonstrate that the baroclinic wave evolution is dominated by three processes: dry dynamics, microphysics, and radiation. Including cloud microphysics without radiation results in a cyclone that grows rapidly, reaching its peak intensity the earliest before cutting off and weakening. Despite rapid deepening, these “microphysics-only” simulations produce less precipitation and latent heating over the entire lifecycle when compared to the simulations that included radiation. The simulations with radiation deepen more slowly and cut off at a later time. Despite the slower evolution of the cyclone in the simulations with radiation, all simulations with radiation result in higher eddy kinetic energy and eddy available potential energy by the end of the simulation. While the tendencies contributed directly from the radiation scheme are relatively small, the inclusion of radiation also indirectly enhances the PV anomaly from the microphysics scheme.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>While diabatic heating and DPV generation from radiation are small in comparison to the microphysics scheme, the nonlinear effects of radiation on the cyclone as a whole are significant. It is concluded that radiation plays a more important role in extratropical cyclone dynamics than originally thought and that diagnosing the effects of radiation in isolation from other physical process can lead to misleading results. Finally, it is shown that the system-scale structure and evolution of the cyclone is largely insensitive to grid resolution or the partitioning of precipitation between convective and large-scale contributions.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The ice shelves in the Western Antarctic have seen an increase in melt over the past decade, mainly due to basal melting induced by underlying warm, salty Circumpolar Deep Water. Seal data in the Bellingshausen Sea provides extensive hydrographic coverage, allowing insight into a westward flowing coastal current that acts to transport the meltwater. The observed coastal current enters the eastern Bellingshausen Sea from the Western Antarctic Peninsula, flowing westward along the coast to the Abbot Ice Shelf, where the fate of the current is unknown. The temperature and salinity profiles show that this coastal current has a baroclinic structure, that increases from east to west. While in the Bellingshausen Sea, the coastal current entrains meltwater from the ice shelves in the region, which increases the density grandient, increasing the westward transport of the current. The current acts as a mechanism to transport meltwater out of the Bellingshausen Sea and into the Amundsen Sea and Ross Sea, where it could impact the local melt rates and water mass formation.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>International development advocates often argue that policy initiatives in spheres like conservation should perform better when they are more participatory. Yet, previous research struggles to identify the circumstances in which this claim is true. This dissertation grapples with that problem. My first substantive chapter uses game theory to explore how a strategic, cost-sensitive development agency will use activities like local participation to strengthen the effectiveness of a payment-based development project (wherein payments are used to encourage local cooperation). My analysis highlights the importance of accountability mechanisms that ensure development agencies are sufficiently concerned about project effectiveness. I also show that agencies can often have incentive to use local participation while electing to not offer payments, which is detrimental to project effectiveness. My second substantive chapter evaluates the overall effects of participation on environmental performance using a sample of projects (associated with a UN initiative called REDD+) attempting to fight forest clearing in the Brazilian Amazon. In doing so, I propose a more nuanced approach to measuring participation in sustainable development efforts than other scholars have considered. In brief, I find that the most participatory efforts in this sample do not perform substantially better or worse than others. Finally, I explore evidence for an argument that participatory initiatives are more effective when they are a response to local policy demands. I provide evidence that this is true by comparing the effectiveness of top-down and bottom-up sustainable use conservation areas across Brazil, all of which are governed through the same participatory decision-making structure. In summary, I show that participation itself does not always have a strong net impact on a project’s environmental performance. The mixed effectiveness of participatory development projects in the past is likely due to (1) a limited ability of participation to establish local support where it does not already exist, and (2) other detrimental changes to project design (motivated by a desire to cut costs) that may accompany the adoption of participatory design components</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Synoptic scale drivers, mainly extra-tropical cyclones, account for a majority of the day to day temperature variability in the mid-latitudes. This variability is at its greatest in the Northern Hemisphere in Boreal winter when the surface meridional temperature gradient is strong. Global warming has led to a reduction of the surface meridional temperature gradient due to the phenomenon of Arctic Amplification, where the Arctic has been warming at a faster rate than the mid-latitudes or tropics. Changes to the surface meridional temperature gradient will likely alter the baroclinicity of the mid-latitudes and thus extra-tropical cyclones. Understanding how extra-tropical cyclones and their associated temperature variability change in the presence of warming is vital to mitigating the potential outcomes such as an increased chance of heatwaves in regions with reduced variability or an increased chance of cold snaps that could negatively impact farmers in regions of increased variability. Using complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) to isolate the synoptic component of daily mean surface temperature, the evolution of the trend in synoptic temperature variability is analyzed. There has been a spatial in-homogeneity of synoptic temperature variability change ranging from -36.5% to 39.2% from 1948-2018 over the continental United States, Northern Mexico, and surrounding oceans. This variability is also temporally non-uniform. The first three decades experienced relatively large decadal rates of change, followed by a two-decade lull, where large regions experienced a reversal in the direction of synoptic temperature variability change. The last two decades have maintained the spatial structure observed in 1998 with the regions expanding in size and changing more quickly with time. Higher altitudes and surrounding regions generally see an increase in variability while elsewhere over land a reduction is observed. This creates a three-band structure over the continental United States. Averaged over the entire domain, an increase in variability in excess of 6% is observed below 30°N while a reduction of 4.25% is observed above 30°N.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this dissertation, it is proposed that presence is a mechanism overlooked by previous work on video games and guilt. Presence is a multidimensional construct which broadly reflects the feeling of “being there” in a mediated space. One dimension of particular concern for the current study is social presence, which leads individuals to experience mediated characters as though they are real social actors and not simulated (Lee 2004). Guilt has been defined as “the dysphoric feeling associated with the recognition that one has violated a personally relevant moral or social standard” (Kugler &amp; Jones, 1992). Numerous studies concerning guilt have found that video games are capable of eliciting guilt from players (Hartmann &amp; Vorderer 2010; Hartmann et al., 2010; Grizzard et al., 2014; Grizzard et al., 2017). Virtual reality (VR) technology allows users to feel presence in higher levels than other mediums (Fox, Arena, &amp; Bailenson 2009; Kalyanaraman &amp; Bailenson, 2020; Possler, Klimmt, Raney, Steger, Landmann, &amp; Seibert, 2019; Seibert &amp; Shafer 2018). Control naturalness (Skalski, Tamborini, Shelton, Buncher &amp;Lindmark 2011) has also been found to be closely tied to a user’s experience of presence while playing video games (Seibert &amp; Shafer, 2018). As such, an experiment (N = 140) was conducted to explore differences in guilt found between participants committing violent acts in three video game conditions, which varied by display and control type and were intended to elicit varying levels of presence. The results indicated that there was no difference found in guilt across the three conditions. Results also indicated the primary differences in presence dimensions and control naturalness found among the three conditions were between the standard television display and the two VR conditions. Potential explanations for the findings and possible avenues for future research are offered.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Personal virtual assistants (PVAs) allow users to place phone calls, start timers, play media, and order pizza all with just the call of their voice and the popularity of this technology is growing rapidly. However, little academic research, qualitative or quantitative, exists detailing how this technology is being used. The uses and gratifications approach has long been utilized in communication research to help describe what audience members were gaining by viewing a program or using a technology and an updated version of it, UGT 2.0, is employed here to begin to describe how this new communication technology is being used as well as to predict future usage. Two studies were utilized here to provide qualitative and quantitative data as it relates to how PVAs are being used by consumers, to describe what users are getting out of those interactions, and to apply UGT 2.0 in a new communication context. Based on the extant literature, perceived privacy risks, social presence, and social attraction were also part of the statistical analysis. The first study consisted of three focus groups and provided first-of-its-kind qualitative data about PVA usage. Study 1 found that users most often use their assistants at home because it is convenient and to do so aids in their productivity. Further, participants in the focus groups expressed dissenting views on whether or not they were concerned about the security of the information they provide to PVAs. The second study provided further descriptive data while deploying UGT 2.0 to both describe usage as well as predict intention to continue to use this technology. Study 2 found that Google was the most popular PVA, users interacted with a PVA most often via their smartphone for tasks related to entertainment, and, similar to the focus groups, they used the assistant most often at home. Two multiple linear regression models were performed. The four modalities of UGT 2.0 (Modality, Agency, Interactivity, and Navigability) were tested as predictors of the dependent variable in two separate multiple regression models. In both models, Modality and Agency ran counter to their respective hypotheses and were found to negatively predict intention to continue to use a PVA whereas as Interactivity and Navigability were found to positively influence intention to continue to use the technology. Possible explanations for these results are explored. In the second multiple linear regression, additional important variables from the literature were added to the regression model and perceived privacy risks was found to negatively and significantly influence intention to continue to use. In the second multiple linear regression, social presence and social attractiveness were not found to positively predict intention to continue to use PVAs. This paper provides qualitative data, detailed usage data, and applies UGT 2.0 in a novel communication context. Implications of these findings, as well as possibilities for future research with the technology and the theory, are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In the genetic study, the advance of high-through technology allowed scientists to collect data on a larger scale and with more complexity. Thus, it is common that the collected data is high-dimension and heterogenous, i.e. the number of features is greater than that of observations. For example, in the study of liver cancer, the number of genes is more than 25000 while the sample size in only around hundreds.  However, a common fact is that not all variables are useful in solving a problem, only a small proportion should be used. Hence selecting a useful subset of variables based on clinical information receives a lot of attention. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Since supervised learning and unsupervised learning are two major problems of statistical learning. Supervised learning is given a labeled training set with variables and responses, then fit a model to predict the response for new test data. When the response is continuous, it’s often known as regression. If the response is categorical, then it’s a classification problem. While sometimes responses are not available, then this turns to be an unsupervised learning problem. For unsupervised learning, first, we need to recover the responses from the input variables. This is often referred to as a clustering problem. When the data is of high dimension both supervised and unsupervised problems will confront statistical and computational challenges.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Therefore, there are three problems we mainly focused on. Firstly, many gene expression data are not along with a response. Thus, we need to cluster patients based on input variables to transfer the unsupervised learning into a supervised learning problem. Secondly, although many studies of high-dimension data were proposed, they are not suitable for heterogenous gene expression data. Moreover, an efficient method to select a subset of variables to discern different groups grow more and more attention. Thirdly, it is important to find a suitable model to predict new data labels based on the selected variables and recovered labels.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In real data analysis, we mainly studied on identifying biomarkers and personalized treatments based on their gene expression data. For the supervised learning problem in which the label information is available, we proposed a framework of identifying biomarkers, containing three steps: differential gene expression analysis based on the labels, pathway analysis and random forest with 10 folds cross-validation. This framework provides the subset of useful genes and identifies the biomarkers based on the votes of random forest. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	For unsupervised learning problem, we proposed the framework of clustering cancer patients for treatments, to sequential biclustering patients and assign the different treatments. Sequential biclustering is a novel biclustering method that only allows overlapping genes for different groups. This framework returns labels for patients which leads to the next step of identifying biomarkers and assign suitable treatments for different clustered patients.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Moreover, based on the studies of real data, we consider the clustering problem on high dimension and heterogeneous data, we proposed a more efficient procedure based on marginal screening for a mixture regression model. This algorithm takes advantage of heterogeneity of the data to filter out variables which leads to lower storage costs and higher computation speed. The performance of our method is more stable and with higher accuracy compared with the existing method.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the end, we discuss some future works, including real data applications and extension of generalizing linear models.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The rising trend of end-users to bypass the central IT system at the workplace using technologies often unsanctioned by the organizational network policy has challenged the authority to control IT use. This study examines the risks associated with an unauthorized IT Use by employees, integrating opportunity-based constructs of routine activity theory. It attempts to explain why and whether risky activities such as an unauthorized IT (i.e., cloud services, self-made solutions, self -installed devices, and self-acquired personal devices) most commonly referred to as Shadow-IT usage by employees at workplace may actually increase the occurrence of detrimental security behaviors. It primarily assumes that, in current IT-enabled domain, when an employee bypasses IT norms and injunctions in IT usage and possesses IT tools outside the management control, they are more likely to threaten an organization with malicious activity such as insider fraud in the presence of certain situational stimuli.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A multi-model analysis in this study suggests that the usage of informal-IT tools heightens the risk of insider fraud, especially when a shadow employee has privileged access to a valued target in the absence of a capable guardian. An internet survey design is adopted to collect empirical data. Quantitative statistical analysis has generated key insights in examining relationships between a shadow employees’ motivation and various situational factors that may allow them an opportunity to commit insider fraud. The statistical findings suggest that latent variable “Value” is not the strong predictor of dependent variable (likelihood of committing insider fraud) while other variables/factors are held constant. The high Value of personal information assets (such as PII) may contribute to target suitability but is NOT associated with the likelihood of Shadow-IT employee to commit Insider Fraud. Shadow-IT employees may not be likely to commit insider fraud when the value of the personally identifiable information “alone” is high. However, he may likely to do so when other variables/factors combine such as access and absence of guardianship. Situational factors such as access and absence of both offline and online guardianship (supervising) may motivate Shadow-IT employees to commit insider fraud. In supplement to the statistical findings, qualitative interpretation of open-ended survey items supported the survey findings. Also, the thematic analysis revealed that personal traits also play a role in motivating an employee to bypass the IT management policy in using IT tools, later contributing in the end motivation to commit insider fraud when and if given access to the information assets.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>We consider change-point detection and estimation in two different settings.  The objective is to halt a process when the process generating observations deviates from a specified in control standard, in which case the process is referred to as out of control. We propose a Bayesian sequential monitoring methodology in two different settings- functional profile monitoring and density estimation. The goal is to halt a process when the process generating these observations- functional profiles or density estimates- deviates from a specified in control standard. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In functional sequential process monitoring, a process is characterized by sequences of observations called profiles which are monitored over time for stability.  We propose a Bayesian sequential process control (SPC) methodology which uses wavelets to monitor the functional responses and detect out of control profiles. Our contribution is to propose a solution to the growing computational cost by constructing an efficient and accurate approximation to the posterior distribution of the wavelet coefficients, without recourse to Markov chain Monte Carlo.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In sequential density estimation monitoring, a process is characterized by data from which a density estimate is developed and updated when new data arrives. We propose a methodology that sequentially estimates the density of univariate data. We utilize Polya trees to again develop a Bayesian SPC methodology.  Our proposed methodology monitors the distribution of observed data and detects when the generating density differs from the in-control standard. We also propose an approximation that merges the probability mass of multiple data points being a change point in the proposed methodology to curb computational complexity while maintaining accuracy in detecting a change point. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In the United States (US), farm-raised shrimp accounts for ~80% of the total shrimp market share. Farmed shrimp are cultivated as monoculture and are susceptible to infections. The aquaculture industry is dependent on the application of antibiotics for disease prevention, resulting in the selection of antibiotic-resistant (ABR) bacteria. We aimed to characterize the prevalence of ABR bacteria and gut microbiome communities in commercially available shrimp. Thirty-one raw and cooked shrimp samples were purchased from supermarkets in Florida and Georgia (US). The samples were processed for the isolation of ABR bacteria and isolates were characterized using an array of molecular and antibiotic susceptibility tests. Aerobic plate counts of the cooked samples (n=13) varied from 3 log CFU/g to 6.4 log CFU/g. The 110 isolates obtained in this study were spread across 18 bacterial genera, comprising of coliforms and opportunistic pathogens. Interestingly, isolates from cooked shrimp showed higher resistance towards chloramphenicol (18.6%) and tetracycline (20%) while those from raw shrimp exhibited low levels of resistance towards nalidixic acid (10%) and tetracycline (8.2%). Compared to wild-caught shrimp, the imported farm-raised shrimp harbored distinct gut microbiota communities. The presence of ABR strains in cooked shrimps calls for change in processing specifications for their mitigation.Penaeidae shrimp species are known to share morphology characteristics and identification based on morphological appearance becomes more challenging when shrimp is processed into cooked products. Misrepresentation of shrimp is common in commercially available shrimp. The objective of the study was to develop a high-resolution melting (HRM) RT PCR assay targeting the 16S rRNA gene fragment for specific identification of the top five penaeid species, Litopenaeus vannamei, Penaeus duorarum, Penaeus monodon, Litopenaeus setiferus, and Pleoticus muelleri. The applicability of assay was evaluated using two DNA extraction kits and two RT PCR master mixes. The HRM assay was evaluated using 43 shrimp samples using sequence known positive control, and results were validated by sequencing shrimp 16S rRNA gene fragment. Assay standardized in this study formed a distinct melt curve profile for each species in the normalized and differential melt curve plots. The assay using Apex qPCR 2× GREEN master mix showed 100% sensitivity and specificity. Further, species identification results obtained by HRM assay were in complete agreement with identification achieved by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The HRM assay developed in this study can be used as a rapid, low-cost, and reliable method for the identification of the abovementioned shrimp species.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>A holistic behavior change (BC) program comprised of both exercise and emotional support (EES; n = 4) for stress reduction and enhanced psychological well-being was designed. The purpose of the study was to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of the EES BC program with a BC program that focused exclusively on exercise training (ET; n = 3). To attain this goal, a mixed-method pilot case study was adopted, comprising of a quantitative component (i.e., self-report inventories) and a qualitative component (i.e., semi-structured interviews). While the quantitative data yielded almost no significant condition differences (most likely due to low statistical power), an examination of the participants’ raw data and qualitative data indicated that, overall, in line with our hypothesis, participants in both conditions experienced reduced levels of stress and improved well-being following their participation in their prospected BC program. Under both conditions, participants reported a higher level of exercise engagement and more positive lifestyle habits after the program than at the outset. The positive effects sustained, among most of the participants, 6-week following the program. Furthermore, the in-depth qualitative data pointed to specific underlying emotional, motivational, and mental mechanisms of these effects. It also emphasized the unique value of social-emotional support during exercise for personal self-growth, enhanced meta-cognition, and exercise adherence. Nevertheless, the findings reported herein are described with sincere precaution due to several changes the study undertook following COVID-19’s research restrictions. Further empirical work must be conducted to elucidate the potential identified effects of holistic exercise training combined with emotional support.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Chondrules are silicate spherules in chondritic meteorites thought to have formed as free-floating melt droplets created by a transient heat source in the early solar system. Due to their ubiquity in asteroids, determining the origin of chondrules is key to understanding the conditions and processes occurring within the early protoplanetary disk. Recent models for chondrule formation involve the formation of chondrules by nebular shock waves or by protoplanetary impacts. Here, elemental abundances in 153 chondrules from four unequilibrated ordinary chondrites (UOCs) were analyzed by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) to test these models. Chondrules in UOCs are mixtures of mineral phases within a glassy mesostasis. Obtaining a representative bulk chondrule elemental composition by a microanalytical technique is challenging since chondrules are mineralogically heterogeneous at the scale of an analyzed spot. This study, therefore, placed reliance on inter-element ratios of incompatible elements (elements concentrated into the melt phase) that would be representative of the bulk chondrule composition. Most chondrules exhibit both positive and negative Ce and Eu anomalies, and some chondrules even display resolvable negative Yb anomalies, indicating a chondrule forming process that occurred within a chemical microenvironment of varying oxygen fugacity (fO2). The modeled effects of planetesimal collisions within the early solar nebula create rapidly varying fO2 microenvironments in impact vapor plumes that begin oxidized but end reduced. Such models are necessary to explain the observed Ce-Eu-Yb anomalies. Aluminum-rich chondrules contain Nb depletions that indicate inheritance from distinct precursors to ferromagnesian chondrules, possibly containing refractory inclusions. Only a few chondrules exhibit significant fractionations in incompatible refractory element ratios distinctive of differentiated precursors (Zr/Th, Zr/Hf, Nb/Ta), indicating that most UOC chondrule precursors were derived from undifferentiated sources. The anomalies in Ce and Eu and the presence of a significant fraction of chondrules implying involvement of a differentiated precursor provide compelling evidence that chondrules from UOCs formed as a byproduct of planetesimal collisions between differentiated and undifferentiated bodies before nebular hydrogen dissipated. Models of chondrule formation that involved nebular shockwaves or planetesimal collisions after dissipation of nebular gas could not account for the Ce-Eu-Yb anomalies observed in UOC chondrules. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Ideas from the algebraic topology of studying object data are used to introduce a framework for using persistence landscapes to vectorized objects. These methods are applied to analyze data from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA), using a technique developed earlier for regular digital images. Our study aims at tumor differentiation from medical images, including brain images from CPTAC Glioblastoma patients. The result shows that persistence landscapes that capture topological features are distinguishing on average between tumor and normal brains. Besides topological object data analysis, asymptotics of sample means on stratified spaces are also introduced and developed in this dissertation. A stratified space is a metric space that admits a filtration by closed subspaces, such that the difference between the d-th indexed subspace and the (d-1) indexed subspace is empty or is a d-dimensional manifold, called the d-th stratum. Examples of stratified sample spaces, which are not themselves manifolds, include similarity shape spaces, affine shape spaces, projective shape spaces, phylogenetic tree spaces, and graphs. The behavior of the Fr\'echet sample means is different around the singular Frechet mean points in some cases of stratified spaces, such as on open books. The asymptotic results for the Frechet sample mean are extended from data on spiders, which are open books, to a more general class of stratified spaces that are not open books. Phylogenetic tree spaces are typically stratified spaces, including genetic information from nucleotide data, such as DNA, RNA data. Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The raw RNA sequences from SARS-CoV-2 are studied. The ideas from the phylogenetic tree and statistical analysis on stratified spaces are applied to study distributions on phylogenetic tree spaces. A framework is also presented for computing mean and applying Central Limit Theorem(CLT), to provide statistical inference on data. We apply these methods to analyze RNA sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from multiple sources. By building sample trees and applying the ensuing statistical analysis, we could compare evolutionary results for SARS-CoV-2 vs other coronaviruses.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The revolution in next-generation DNA sequencing technologies is leading to explosive data growth in genomics, posing a significant challenge to the computing infrastructure and software algorithms for genomics analysis. Various big data and machine learning technologies have been explored  to mine the complex large-scale genomics data. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this dissertation, we first survey some of the existing scalable approaches for genomic analysis and identify the limitations of these solutions. We then investigate the still-unsolved challenges faced by computational biologists in large-scale genomic analysis. Specifically, in terms of using MapReduce-based bioinformatics analysis tools, Hadoop has a large number of parameters  to control the behavior of a MapReduce job. The unique characteristics of MapReduce-based bioinformatics  tools makes all the existing guidelines inapplicable; In Metagenomics, the intrinsic complexity and massive quantity of metagenomic data create tremendous challenges for microbial genomes recovery;</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>When we applying NLP technologies to genome analysis, the enormous k-mer size and the low-frequency k-mers caused by the sequencing errors post significant challenges for k-mer embedding.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To overcome the aforementioned problems, this dissertation introduces three countermeasures. First, we extract the key parameters from the large space of MapReduce parameters and present an exemplary case for tuning MapReduce-based bioinformatics analysis tools based on their unique characteristics. Second, we design and implement SpaRC, a scalable sequence clustering tool built on Apache Spark, to partition reads based on their molecules of origin to enable downstream assembly optimization in Metagenomics. SpaRC achieves high clustering accuracy, with the capability of scaling near linearly with the data size and the number of computing nodes. Lastly, we leverage Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to overcome the two challenges faced by $k$-mer embedding and design LSHvec. With LSHvec, a DNA sequence can be represented as a dense low-dimensional vector.  The trained sequence vectors are capable of capturing the rich characteristics of DNA sequences and  can be fed to machine learning models for a wide variety of applications in genomics analysis. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We compare our approaches with existing solutions. The experiments  demonstrate  our approaches achieve the state-of-the-art results. We open source our implementation of SpaRC and LSHvec to facilitate comparison of future work and inspire future research  in genomic analysis.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Different phases of precipitation would bring different hydrological impacts. For example, rainfall would become streamflow and increase surface runoffs, while snow would accumulate and increase surface albedo, acting as a crucial driver in the climate system. Therefore, understanding whether precipitation would fall in solid or liquid phase is fundamental to hydrological modeling and forecasting. The precipitation phase is also a critical factor for the surface precipitation retrieval by satellite-based radars, since solid and liquid particles feature different scattering properties and correspond to different relationships between the radar reflectivity and the precipitation rate. With surface temperature warming over the past century, the precipitation phase is expected to shift from solid to liquid, but a global view of the trends has not been established. Moreover, in order to obtain an improved phase classification scheme for satellite snowfall retrieval, it is crucial to investigate the factors that impact the phase transition process and understand the underlying physics.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this thesis, we first investigated the global means and trends of annual precipitation frequency and the ratio of snow events to precipitation events (SE/PE ratio) using land station and shipboard synoptic present weather reports from 1973 to 2019. Results show that when averaged over all qualified land stations, the annual rain frequency and annual snow frequency both have an increasing trend. When averaged over the shipboard reports, the annual rain frequency increases while the annual snow frequency decreases over the 47 years.  Over both land and ocean, the averaged SE/PE ratio has a significant decreasing trend. Moreover, the trend of SE/PE ratio shows a strong latitudinal dependence. At the mid and low latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, the snow frequency increases slower than the rain frequency, and the SE/PE ratio has a decreasing trend. In contrast, at high latitudes, the snow frequency increases faster than the rain frequency, and the SE/PE ratio has an increasing trend. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Then, we focused on the physics of the phase transition process. Since the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) uses ECMWF Reanalysis Version 5 (ERA5) for their snowfall retrieval, we combined ERA5 with surface observations to investigate the performance of reanalysis dataset in determining precipitation phase. Results based on the station and ship observations were also presented for understanding the physics. The impact of temperature and wet-bulb temperature on the precipitation phase was first examined. On average, the temperature threshold, defined as the conditional probability of snow at 50%, is 1.36°C for land and 1.61°C for ocean based on the ERA5 reanalysis, both around 0.3°C colder than the thresholds derived from observations. The wet-bulb temperature thresholds for land and ocean are 0.72°C and 0.14°C based on the reanalysis, and 0.73°C and 0.83°C for the observations. Using wet-bulb temperature, which incorporates moisture in the calculation, reduces uncertainties in the phase classification. The spatial pattern of the wet-bulb temperature thresholds is also established. Over most of the regions, the wet-bulb temperature threshold falls between 0°C and 1°C. However, this threshold has considerable variations over the globe; derivations from global mean value are particularly large over mountainous areas, coastal regions, and warm ocean currents. Over land, colder wet-bulb temperature thresholds are observed in most high-elevated regions except for the Midwestern U.S., where the thresholds are generally warmer than 2°C. Over ocean, the wet-bulb temperature threshold is colder where there is a warm current, and is warmer at very high latitudes. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The influence of different geophysical variables on the precipitation phase was examined. Lapse rate is found to impact the snow conditional probability significantly. At a given wet-bulb temperature, a larger lapse rate leads to a larger conditional probability of snow. In the Midwestern U.S., a smaller pressure would lead to larger snow conditional probability since hydrometeors fall faster in thin air, but this pressure dependence is not evident outside the U.S. For the skin temperature and the difference between the near-surface temperature and skin temperature, there are discrepancies between results based on reanalysis and that based on observations. Further investigation into this issue is expected in the future, in order to develop an improved phase classification scheme based on the reanalysis data.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Atlantic Bluefin tuna (ABFT) (Thunnus thynnus) spawn in the warm oligotrophic regions of the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) where zooplankton biomass is on average low and highly variable. Consequently, their larvae are thought to be highly susceptible to starvation. Mortality during the larval stage of marine fish is considered a key source of variability in recruitment and thus is important to quantify for sustainable fisheries management. However, estimating larval mortality in the field is a major challenge because of the ocean’s moving reference frame. In this work I develop a three-dimensional physical-biogeochemical model (PBM) to estimate prey (zooplankton) biomass for larval ABFT and couple this model with a Lagrangian, individual based, bioenergetics model to evaluate growth and mortality rates of larval ABFT in the GoM during the spawning periods from 1993-2012. Based on mesozooplankton diet estimated by the PBM, microbial and protistan food webs are deemed important for sustaining mesozooplankton biomass in the GoM, which serves as the primary food source for larval tuna. Starvation was found to be the main source of larval mortality during annual spawning periods for ABFT. However, predation was ultimately found to limit survival of older larvae and hence may explain why adults choose to spawn in the open-ocean GoM despite the poor feeding conditions for first feeding larvae. In addition, entrainment of shelf water into the open-ocean GoM by mesoscale eddies is shown to be important for supporting first feeding larvae and may further explain why spawning occurs in the open ocean GoM and not in other regions with similar temperature and zooplankton biomass. Finally, the impact of projected future warming was assessed using downscaled climate simulations for the late 21st century. It is shown that survival is likely to decrease in future climate scenarios, primarily as a result of higher rates of starvation for first feeding larvae, even though growth of older larvae was found to be substantially higher. In addition to studying larval ecology, ocean modeling tools like the ones integrated in this research provide a useful framework for including ecosystem based management into management of important fisheries like ABFT.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation provides a model for examining instances of disease in literature. Based upon David Michell and Sharon Snyder’s theoretical framwork of narrative prosthesis introduced in the early 2000s, I propose that the use of ill bodies in storytelling acts as a virus. In cases when a single narrative has been re-told throughout history, the image of ailing bodies will spread to future versions. Like a real-life illness, these depictions can be traced through various points of contact that texts retain from one another: through modes such as shared printing and naming other authors within the work. Most importantly, they maintain a focus on disease. They may also mutate in the sense that they do not depict the same illness. The theme of ailing bodies remains, nevertheless.Taking the story of the fall of Troy for a case study, I demonstrate tracking illness in a method I call narrative contact tracing. I begin by identifying Shakespeare’s Troilus and Cressida as depicting a case of venereal syphilis and trace the origin of the imagery to it source. Pandarus’ syphilis in Shakespeare’s play retains contact with the leprosy in Robert Henryson’s Testament of Cresseid.  The Scottish poem is connected to lovesickness depicted in Chaucer’s Troilus and Criseyde by means of their long-shared print history. Finally, I identify Homer’s Iliad as the likely source, a patient zero from which other versions of the story are infected. Throughout my investigation, I also adapt the social model of disability from disability studies. Such a framework allows not only for the sources of a narrative to be traced, but also its treatment of its various ill patients and the effect that their race, class, or gender has on their depiction of illness.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Public-school choice programs have multiplied over the past decades. Previous researchers have analyzed the significant roles that parents play when deciding what they think is best for their children’s futures. Though research has shown the roles and factors over parents’ educational choices for their student, there are limited studies on student perceptions. This exploratory study hypothesized that high school students influenced where they went to school, considering various factors when they decided with their families on what public-choice educational institution they would attend. By surveying ninth-grade students at three different schools (magnet, charter, and traditional), this study focused on three research questions to provide insights about the important perspective of students. The study analyzed how informed students were about public-choice schools, what factors within schools were the most important to them, and how large of an influence they had in the negotiation process with parents when determining which high school to attend. The findings indicate that students receive the most information from their parents and peers, are most concerned about a school’s academic reputation, and play a role in discussing where they should attend school with their parents. Overall, the study shows the importance of including student perspectives within academic research, indicating the need for future research.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Severe weather indices are empirical tools developed by meteorologists to assist in predicting severe weather. The Storm Prediction Center’s (SPC) Mesoanalysis website lists 23 composite indices. All of the listed composite indices are similar in that they calculate differences between parameters or combine parameters multiplicatively to assess the severe environment. Most of these indices prioritize a specific weather hazard type or storm convective mode. There is no severe weather index that covers multiple hazards at all severity levels. Lead forecaster Don Van Dyke at the National Weather Service (NWS) Weather Forecast Office (WFO) in Tallahassee aimed to remedy the lack of a holistic index by developing a severe weather index that would encompass three hazards (wind, hail, and tornadoes) of any severity. Van Dyke’s index (DVDI) also is unique as a severe weather index in that it adds its component parameters in the calculations, rather than multiplying them. However, no statistically robust analysis has been conducted on DVDI to show how it performs as a forecasting tool. This research quantitatively evaluates the performance of DVDI, assesses the relative importance of the parameters used in it, determines the atmospheric conditions in which the index succeeds and fails, and offers suggestions for improvement with the aim of giving forecasters a new, robust forecasting tool that gauges the overall severe weather environment.
Results show DVDI is able to predict multi-hazard severe weather with an overall CSI (Critical Success Index) of only 0.14. It predicts each of the three included hazards with a POD (Probability of Detection) of 0.73-0.76. DVDI has the potential to differentiate between days with severe weather and days without severe weather. Additionally, DVDI has some ability to distinguish tornado intensity since higher values of DVDI tended to be associated with stronger tornado reports. Major weaknesses of DVDI include a high False Alarm Rate (FAR) of 0.80 – 0.90, virtually no skill differentiating hail size, poor performance in the western and northeastern CONUS, and less skill during the fall season. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In the late-eighteenth century, during the Spanish control of colonial Louisiana, Maroon settlements surrounding New Orleans reached its pinnacle in terms of expanse, population, and permanence. According to historic governmental letters and legal records, Maroons were part of an extensive communication network, spanning at least 100 km from the German Coast (around Lac des Allemands) to Bas du Fleuve (east of Lake Borgne). Despite this evidence, no one has attempted to locate these settlements archaeologically since one of the largest issues within Maroon archaeology is that Maroon sites are difficult to locate. This thesis evaluates the role of least-cost networks (LCNs) in locating Maroon archaeological sites around the Bas du Fleuve region.In part, this thesis argues that, by considering attractiveness of the landscape as a “cost” instead of time or energy expenditure, least-cost analyses can inherently incorporate more culturally determined travel factors as the costs associated with each are dependent on cultural priorities. Considering travel factors such as waterbodies, water depth, slope, soil type, and visibility, I converted the resulting least-cost network into an archaeological potential model (APM) to highlight popular areas of travel and, therefore, areas that may yield Maroon archaeological remains. When compared to Louisiana cultural resources, the APM was successful in locating two suspected Maroon archaeological sites, but more research into addressing environmental changes in modern datasets, what defines a Maroon archaeological site, and general LCN construction is required. Overall, this thesis indirectly works to broaden the geographic and historical scope of Maroon archaeology and adds to the more holistic account of the African diasporic experience that is developing within African diaspora archaeology. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Children from low-income backgrounds face multiple obstacles throughout their life including inadequate nutrition, exposure to environmental toxins, and homelessness (Brooks-Gunn &amp; Duncan, 1997). Exposure to these stressors can affect a child’s behavior (Needleman, 1992), their cognitive abilities (Farah, Noble, &amp; Norman, 2005), and their academic performance (Ford, 2016).  As children of low-income struggle to compete with their non-low-income peers, some issues in the educational system come to light, such as school funding (Baker, Farrie, &amp; Sciarra, 2018; EdBuild, 2019) and residential segregation based on income (Duncan &amp; Murnane, 2014). Low-income students are more likely to attend low-income schools (National Research Council, 1993) characterized by lower quality teachers, less rigorous curriculum, and a higher student-teacher ratio (Lee, Byrk, &amp; Smith, 1993). These factors can make it difficult to reach the state mandated academic standard. However, it is not only low-income students that are affected by these issues. When a school reaches a 25% poverty rate, academic achievement for the entire student body decreases (Bainbridge &amp; Lassley, 2002). </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Interior design might be able to able to intervene. Through the modernization of school infrastructure (Caufield, 2018; Chmielewski, Herber, Jauregui, O’Donnel, &amp; Silsby, 2017), dynamic space planning (Chmielewski, Herber, Jauregui, O’Donnel, &amp; Silsby, 2017; Herr, 2018) and meaningful decoration (Fisher, Godwin, &amp; Seltman, 2014), design can be used to enhance the educational experience of low-income students and promote academic achievement. Another design feature focuses on user health and well-being. The WELL Building Standard has created a set of guidelines that the built environment may follow to promote health and well-being. Some spaces include restorative spaces which aim to provide users a place to take a break and mentally recharge (International WELL Building Institute, 2019). The presence of a designated break time and the space to do so reduces stress and mental fatigue, promotes a healthy work-life, or school-life balance (International WELL Building Institute, 2019), increases attentional capacity (Larson, et al., 1998), and hopefully improve academic performance.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Problematic anger is a phenomenon that is highly relevant to a number of psychological disorders and health outcomes yet remains under-studied and is often misunderstood. Although the field has largely rejected the value of cathartic anger expression as therapeutic method to reduce anger and aggression, beliefs about the value of venting and expressing anger outwardly persist. Current conceptual models of problematic anger do not adequately address the role of anger expression in the maintenance and exacerbation of problematic anger. The present study seeks to examine the effects of anger expression behavior fading on anger symptoms and reactive aggression. The proposed project represents the first experimental study, to my knowledge, to examine the isolated effects of reducing anger expression on subsequent anger symptoms. Eighty undergraduate participants were recruited based on elevated trait anger as measured by the state-trait anger expression inventory subscale (STAXI-trait; Spielberger, 1999, trait ≥ 22). Eligible participants were randomly assigned to a two-week manipulation in which they were instructed to either: (1) fade anger expression behaviors, or (2) fade media-related behaviors (e.g., browsing social media feeds, view streaming video). Contrary to predictions, there were no effects of condition on mood, anger symptoms, or reactive aggression. Further, among individuals with greater depressive symptoms at baseline, the media behavior fading condition led to lower depressive symptoms at post compared to the anger behavior fading condition. Limitations and future directions are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Gulf is one part ode and one part elegy to Smith’s Louisiana. It is a book that, all at once, questions, praises, and eulogizes its muse. Smith’s poetry works to elevate people, places, and things that are often looked over as unpoetic. Trailers, pickups, catfish, menial labor thread through Gulf. But ultimately, the book revolves around family and home. It moves back and forth between innocence and experience, the idyllic and tragic. In Gulf, the past shapes the poet, yet the poet, through so much that has been lost, has little else to access a past other than memory. Ultimately, Gulf becomes a reckoning with memory. These poems are the work of a poet leaving and losing his home, his family, his way of life. But they are not merely past-centric. Loss is a centrifugal force, an inciting incident that leads to the question, what is on the other side? What is left of a state that every year falls farther into the Gulf of Mexico? What is left when the poet moves three thousand miles away? What is it like to come home? Can the poet come home? What remains when the poet leaves? What is he able to bring with him? Though Smith’s relationship to his home is not simple, his first urge is to praise; however, when home is a trailer on wheels in a state that continues to fall down farther into water, Gulf is a book of poems unable to escape the elegiac.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Adolescent literacy is an important topic from a national research, policy, and practice perspective, as public schools and school districts across the United States frequently find difficulties in preparing students to meet the literacy demands of postsecondary education and careers. This qualitative implementation study discovered how educators in three large and diverse high schools are implementing and supporting content area reading (CAR) strategy instruction in a large Florida public school district. This district implemented CAR with teachers trained in the 90-hour content area reading–professional development (CAR–PD) course as a way to increase student literacy rates. I selected three high schools within the district that are currently implementing CAR and serve large populations of students in need of literacy support.Administrators at each school recruited various combinations of English, science, and social studies teachers for CAR–PD training through an unofficial requirement or by finding coalitions of willing teachers. I found through interview data that student placement in CAR classes is mostly consistent across the three schools, and it focuses on serving students just below and above literacy proficiency on the state outcome measure. Survey and interview data from participants across the three schools indicated implementation of most CAR literacy strategies at least monthly, with many practices implemented weekly. Previous research has found that these literacy strategies benefit student performance. At each school, participants noted that they perceived CAR literacy strategy instruction as beneficial for students. Even teachers who had not completed CAR–PD training found ways to implement the strategies to increase student literacy. Participants noted that CAR instruction seemed more beneficial for students than pull-out reading courses.
Significant challenges varied across the schools from teacher information overload to student placement processes. Participants reported mixed support from district and school administrators and literacy coaches. English teachers reported the most support. Participants noted a need for increased support for CAR instruction from the district school, and additional training of teachers for sustainability. This was particularly important for teachers of specific social studies and science courses.
These findings suggest that school reforms such as CAR literacy strategy instruction may help students who are close to proficiency to get on track for literacy success. Researchers, policy makers, and practitioners in the adolescent literacy field may use these study results to inform policy to ensure that students are leaving high schools with the skills to be successful for postsecondary options and careers.

            <DISS_para>BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The study of orchestral excerpts is an important component in the undergraduate musician’s education. Excerpts create an efficient path into the evaluation of a student’s fundamental abilities, making them ideal assessment tools for auditions. Professional orchestras will use the performance of orchestral excerpts as the majority of a player’s assessment. Non-performance students are often placed into academic ensembles based on similar criteria. These excerpts allow for practical adjudication of objective musical standards, such as technical facility, intonation, dynamic range, and articulation.
Students often approach excerpts early in their undergraduate education, well before they are fundamentally capable of performing them at a professional level. This often leads to the development of inefficient and unproductive playing habits, which become psychologically and physically ingrained into the student’s performance of the excerpt. Even with proper development of fundamental habits away from the study of a specific orchestral excerpt, a student may retain inefficient habits. This will ultimately inhibit a student’s progress. 
There are several composers who seek to solve this issue by writing etudes or exercises that incorporate musical material from orchestral excerpts. These types of etudes are effective at introducing a student to excerpts in a familiar, yet unintimidating context. These etudes are often in the same key as the original excerpts, and will often begin as identical to the excerpt itself before metamorphosing into new compositional material. These etudes have pedagogical value, but don’t specifically address any individual underlying fundamental that is required to perform an excerpt. For example, Ben McMillan’s 15 Orchestral Etudes for Contrabass Tuba uses the key of B major in his excerpt for Ride of the Valkyries. Playing in the key of B major is one challenge of that excerpt, but the difficulty obfuscates the ability of the player to address rhythm more directly. Tim Olt’s book Preparatory Studies for Orchestral Excerpts is an excellent resource in that excerpts are reduced to fundamental fragments. These fragments are simplified and often re-written to be more difficult than the excerpt itself. For example, in the series of exercises written for Berlioz’s Hungarian March, the exercises that follow are arpeggiated studies that progress through all of the twelve key centers. Later exercises begin to resemble the excerpt, but do not create the necessary musical environment for the proper habit to become ingrained in the student’s behavior. These are excellent materials, but they lack the musical impetus needed to engage a student’s interest long enough to correctly address fundamental deficiencies.
There is currently no formal etude-based curriculum in the tuba pedagogy for helping a student in the preparation of orchestral excerpts. Despite this, the breadth of published etudes that exist is sufficient to provide a baseline of material that will effectively address objective fundamentals in each excerpt. Etudes offer students musical environments where they can experiment with their own fundamental problems within the context of a larger musical idea. If a student can address the requisite fundamental challenges of excerpt playing through etudes, they should have more success when finally introduced to the excerpts.  I believe there is a need for an etude-based curriculum that focuses on the study of orchestral excerpts, and I hope it will serve as a resource for teachers and students alike. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>PURPOSE</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this research is to create a curriculum that is capable of guiding an undergraduate tuba student through the specific fundamental requirements of the ten most popular excerpts without direct exposure to the written part. The fundamentals of each excerpt will be categorized into challenges or fundamentals that the student will have to master to play the excerpt competently. Such skills could include the following categories: articulation, range, intonation, style, sound, and so on. Each of these fundamental categories will be aligned with an etude that best addresses that particular fundamental challenge within the student’s playing. There may be additional recommendations such as octave displacement, rhythmic alterations, or stylistic alterations of an etude to further address the fundamental; this will only occur in situations where a minor alteration will dramatically improve the etude’s ability to address an  underlying fundamental or challenge of the excerpt.	My goal is to eventually publish a formal curriculum that can aid teachers and better prepare their students for orchestral excerpt performance and study. The study of etudes is mainstream in the world of tuba pedagogy, and this curriculum can serve to categorize lesser known etudes as effective tools for fundamental improvement. The study of etudes is often done within the context of smaller collections of books, with the teacher using etudes familiar to them to address the student’s fundamental abilities. This curriculum will help to identify lesser known etudes that offer a new perspectives to the experienced teacher or developing student.  
	 </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>SURVEY OF LITERATURE
There are a number of standard etude books that are almost universally employed in studios around the country. These etude books include composers such as: Tyrell, Blahzevich, Bordogni, Grigoriev, Snedecor, Concone, Kopprasch, and so on. Beyond this, there are less frequently used books by composers such as: Paudert, Vasiliev, Beauregard, Bitsch, and so on. The literature will not be categorically limited in any way, with the only requirement being that the etude book has been professionally published. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>METHOD
My research method will consist of identifying the specific fundamental components in each of the listed excerpts. After that, I will look through the existing tuba etude literature in search of etudes that represent targeted fundamental challenges in those specific components. My goal is to use a wide spectrum of etude books that include both traditional and contemporary sources. I will then connect each of the fundamentals addressed in the excerpt to an etude that directly addresses this facet of playing. 
	In some cases, it may be necessary to make minor alterations to produce maximum benefit. In the case of insufficient material, extra demands may be placed on the etude to make the connection. However, the primary goal is to find existing etude material that meets the requirement.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>LIMITS	This curriculum is not going to address fundamental challenges that can be solved with tools like the metronome or drone. The use of these tools is assumed, but may not always be referenced or suggested in the pedagogical contents of individual excerpts. Similarly, the study of musical scores or referencing of musical recordings is an assumed part of a student’s study of orchestral excerpts, even if it is omitted from the pedagogical content of individual excerpts. The challenges presented are chosen from my own pedagogical and performance experience, and are certainly not the only challenges to be found within the excerpts. Each of the fundamentals challenges listed have several etudes that could be used to address the playing skill of a student. This pedagogical content uses one etude to address the fundamental skill as a matter of concision. Finally, this curriculum is intended to for the purpose of supplementing a daily fundamentals routine, and assumes as much in its construction.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The presence of the trombone in sacred music can be traced back to the early 17th century where it was used in connection to the voice. As orchestral music progressed so did the way composers began to write for the trombone. This included utilizing the instrument in solo passages, as well as moments that showcase the instrument’s delicate and technical capabilities. This new form of trombone writing began to influence how the instrument was utilized in requiem masses; however, in addition to these newly-developed uses of the trombone, composers continued to remain true to the instrument’s historical roots. The result was parts written for the trombone in requiem masses that included brass fanfares, moments independent from the voice, chorale passages in support of the chorus or soloist, and moments where the trombones doubled or supported the voice. 	The purpose of this document is to explore the requiem masses written by some of the 19th century’s most prolific composers. It will highlight how they utilized the trombones specifically and as part of the low brass section in these works. Each work is examined through the lens of who the composer was, what occurred in their lives around the time of composition and what led to, or inspired, each respective requiem. Additionally, the writing for the trombone has been extracted to highlight its various functions as well as provide pedagogical commentary and preparation tips to aid in the performance of these works.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Nature exposure has been found to alleviate mental fatigue and increase performance on tasks requiring focused attention and working memory. Performance in various sports is impacted by mental fatigue and degree of focused attention. While nature-based interventions have been tested on cognitive-performance outcomes and have been utilized in the general population, a link has not been investigated in relation to the potential benefits on athletic performance—particularly when being in a state of mental fatigue. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a nature-based intervention on cognitive-perceptual-motor performance more relevant to athletic performance, in an experimental study with three measurement-time points. Specifically, it was hypothesized that a brief exposure to virtual nature following a mentally-fatiguing task would lead to an improvement in cognitive-perceptual-motor performance. This would be measurable through faster response time, higher response accuracy (both perceptual-motor tasks), and higher backward digit-span score (cognitive task), compared to a brief exposure to virtual urban environments. Participants were 81 undergraduate and graduate students. Results from a series of mixed ANOVAs showed no significant differences in actual performance improvements between the two groups, and no differences in self-reported mental effort and fatigue, although the nature group indicated feeling more mentally restored and rejuvenated following the intervention. Findings are discussed in light of benefits of nature to human performance, and more specifically, in light of this particular experimental design.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The Ten Thousand Islands (TTI) region of Southwest Florida is marked by shell middens and shell mound sites. Prehistoric populations created these sites through intentionality, and/or refuse deposition. The creation of mounds and middens was made possible by the abundance of fish and shellfish that were fostered by the rich estuary system of the TTI. Pumpkin Key (8CR25) lies within the TTI region. Its location is inside an estuary and on the east bank of a modern river. The shellworks site has likely seen many different depositional events. It was the intent of this study to use both grain size distributions and ostracod presence to elucidate what kinds of environmental deposition occurred at the site, and when they may have occurred. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The grain size distribution results of this study indicate that the shell works experienced at least two different depositional environments, and the land across the modern river also experienced at least three different events, separate and later in time than that of the Pumpkin Key shell works. Ostracod research added to the depositional history. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Both cores indicate an environment that experienced a change in depositional processes over time. This could be due to sea level rise which eventually turned the river from a stream channel into a tidal estuary. Core VC190502-2 (Riverside Core) deposits occurred after Core VC190501-3 (Northern Depression Core), meaning the changes are not contemporaneous. Medium sand and fine sand dominate the deepest parts of the Northern Depression Core, while fine sand and very fine sand make up most of the lowest portion of the Riverside Core. The Northern Depression Core experiences less sediment accretion after shell deposits form, while the Riverside Core has a coarsening upward sequence. This means that the energy across the modern river at the Riverside Core was greater than the energy found at the Northern Depression Core within the shell bearing structure, and that the shell likely blocked much of the future accretion events. People at Pumpkin Key (8CR25) would have contended with environmental changes at the site. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Precipitation from atmospheric fronts accounts for a significant portion of the total precipitation in the mid-latitudes, with some locations receiving the majority of their precipitation from atmospheric fronts. In addition, a significant proportion of extreme precipitation events coincide with a frontal passage in the mid-latitudes, and some of these events lead to extreme flooding which can have important and costly socio-economic consequences. Climatological studies regarding both atmospheric fronts and precipitation frequently use global reanalysis datasets due to their cohesive record of many atmospheric variables over a temporal range of generally 40 years or longer. Differences among these reanalyses regarding observations assimilated, atmospheric model used, and grid size contribute to differences in regional precipitation accumulations and the structure and frequency of identified atmospheric fronts. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>It is therefore important to understand how frontal precipitation is represented in global reanalysis datasets. As much of the literature on atmospheric fronts and frontal precipitation is limited to the use of a single global reanalysis or regional model, this thesis seeks to investigate the consistency among frontal identification and frontal precipitation within multiple reanalyses. The following reanalyses were used based on data availability, spatial and temporal resolution, and use within the literature: ERA-20C, ERA-40, ERA-Interim, ERA5, JRA-55, MERRA-2, NCEP-CFSR, and NOAA20C V2C. Two satellite precipitation products, CMORPH and TRMM, were also used for comparison of frontal precipitation with ERA5. There are numerous methods to identify atmospheric fronts that rely on different parameters involving temperature and/or wind. While different front diagnostics give similar results geographically in terms of frequency and structure, each diagnostic has its own strengths and weaknesses. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>As the choice of front diagnostic has been shown to result in differences in frontal frequency when using the same reanalysis, two different front diagnostics are used. Results show that reanalyses with a finer grid spacing (i.e. less than 0.5o x 0.5o) contain a 200% increase in globally averaged total mean frontal frequency for one diagnostic and a 450% increase in globally averaged total mean frontal frequency for the other diagnostic compared to reanalyses with coarse grid spacing (i.e. 2.0o x 2.0o). Results also show that reanalyses with a finer grid spacing see a 150% increase in globally averaged total mean frontal precipitation proportion for one diagnostic and a 460% increase in globally averaged total mean frontal precipitation proportion compared to coarser grid-spaced reanalyses. The largest differences between reanalyses in both frontal frequency and frontal precipitation proportion exist in the tropics for both diagnostics, a region which is typically considered to have few fronts. Differences among reanalyses regarding both frontal frequency and frontal precipitation proportion are indicated to be strongly related to the differing grid spacings of each reanalysis. To account for differing grid spacings, the reanalyses and satellite precipitation products are regridded to the same coarser grid spacing. Then both diagnostics and their frontal precipitation are recalculated on this common grid to attribute differences in both frontal frequency and frontal precipitation to either differing grid spacings between reanalyses or differences inherent to reanalyses. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The regridded reanalyses have much more consistency regarding both frontal frequency and frontal precipitation proportion. Globally, 30% of the difference in the means of total mean frontal frequency of all eight reanalyses is attributed to grid size for one diagnostic, while 59% of the difference is attributed to grid size for the other diagnostic. Allocation of frontal precipitation closely follows the frequency of identified fronts. Globally, 28% of the difference in the means of total mean frontal precipitation proportion of all eight reanalyses is attributed to grid size for one diagnostic while 61% of the difference is attributed to grid size for the other diagnostic. Both diagnostics show that the percent difference in frontal frequency and frontal precipitation proportion is highly dependent on geographical area. Objective frontal identification and frontal precipitation proportion is highly dependent on the choice of diagnostic, the region under consideration, the grid spacing of the reanalysis, and the reanalysis or reanalyses used. These results strongly suggest that research regarding both frontal identification and frontal precipitation should use more than one reanalysis and diagnostic.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This paper considers a few problems in the area of bioinformatics. First the problem of comparing</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>distributions of chromosomal shapes estimated from wild type and gene knock-out Hi-C data. For</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>each contact data matrix, we estimate multiple conformations using SIMBA3D and treat them</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>as random samples from their respective populations. We apply two-sample tests for comparing</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>populations at two levels: (1) Coarse shape analysis, where one studies shapes of large portions</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>of chromosomes and compares them across populations, and (2) Fine shape analysis, where chromosomes</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>are segmented into TAD-based curvelets and the corresponding curvelets are compared</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>across populations. The actual comparisons are based on elastic shape analysis of 3D curves developed</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>previously in the literature. The results show that the two samples { WT and KO { in our</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>experiments have statistically different shapes, both at the coarse and fine levels. Furthermore, it</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>highlights regions where the differences are statistically more prominent.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The next problem is of creating representative substructures, which we refer to as shape letters,</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>of the aforementioned chromosome curvelets. These substructures are pooled together and their</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>pairwise similarity is measured using a modified version of elastic shape analysis techniques. We</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>then cluster the substructures using hierarchical clustering and create shape letters, each letter</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>being a representative shape from a cluster, using the Karcher median, an intrinsic measure of</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>center. We refer to the set of shape letters as a shape alphabet and validate it by creating a</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>chromosomal structure by carefully adjoining shape letters.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Lastly we consider the boundary points of a protein as a parameterized surface. Getting to the</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>point of having a parameterized surface is a challenge in and of itself but necessary for the mathematical</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>framework. With these surfaces we tackle problems such as classification and computing</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>representative shapes of protein classes.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This treatise focuses on the teaching of clarinetist Dr. Eric Mandat. Dr. Mandat began his university teaching career in 1983 and retired from full time teaching in 2015. Over those 32 years Mandat developed unique approaches to traditional teaching concepts as well as many new concepts arrived at through his explorations in extended techniques for the clarinet. This work discusses his history as a student, his values as a musician and pedagogue, specific teaching techniques both for traditional and extended techniques, and several examples of how his compositions are in themselves teaching tools.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Although most researchers agree that memory is made up of separable components, there are a number of conflicting theoretical models of memory. Specifically, there remains debate as to whether working memory resources are best described by domain-general or domain-specific processes. Given that working memory and short-term memory are associated with distinct cortical regions (Nee et al., 2013; Wagner &amp; Smith, 2003) and cognitive processes (Alloway et al., 2006), and are differentially related to developmental outcomes (e.g., Rapport et al., 2013), clarifying the factor structure of memory and isolating the working component of memory from that of short-term memory is crucial. The primary purpose of this study was to a) examine the factor structure of memory and determine whether working memory and short-term memory are best characterized by domain-specific or domain-general models and b) determine whether the working component of memory can be isolated from that of the short-term storage component in early elementary school-age children. In the current study, 158 children in the second (n=84) or third grade (n=74) were administered a series of working memory and short-term memory measures. Findings from this study indicated that a general-specific model with Phonological working memory, Phonological short-term memory, and Visuospatial Memory factors provided the best fit to the data. Implications of findings and future directions are discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Empirical research suggests that our moral behaviors, judgments, and intuitions have been evolutionarily selected for because they provide strategic solutions to the problems we face as social animals. Nonetheless, a great deal of moral philosophy relies on employing our moral judgments and intuitive moral concepts to guide our understanding of morality and justifications for moral actions. Moral argumentation is commonly guided by thought experiments, counterexamples, attractive principles, as well as concepts like justice and desert. While our moral intuitions and judgments might be helpful in pursuing moral understanding, using these judgments without also appreciating the natural facts about morality will inevitably lead to failures. In this dissertation, I focus on a subset of morality, moral responsibility, and show that certain intuitive views regarding moral responsibility are inherently problematic in light of the empirical explanation of our moral judgments and behaviors. I start by discussing punishment. Punishment has been a topic of great interest to biologists and behavioral economists because of how difficult it is to explain. If morality and moral behavior are adaptive, punishment seems to provide a counterexample; it is not obvious how punishment could straightforwardly benefit the punisher and it certainly does not seem to benefit the one who is punished. I argue that the logic of punishment constrains what sorts of punishment behavior can be adaptive and that our current punishment behaviors and judgments conform to this logic. Thus, I offer an explanation for many of our prevalent and firmly held intuitive judgments and behaviors about punishment. I argue that this explanation illuminates problematic aspects for certain philosophical views and arguments surrounding punishment, as well as moral responsibility more generally. 
For instance, I argue that this evolutionary explanation poses a problem for anyone who attempts to justify treating people in ways they deserve to be treated because they deserve to be treated that way. More specifically, I argue that desert-based justifications for treatment face a dilemma. Either there is some relationship between justifications for our practices of treating people in ways they deserve to be treated and the evolutionary selective forces that determine what sorts of desert judgments we make or there is no such relationship. If there is no relationship, then we cannot rely on desert judgments to inform us about justifiably deserved treatment. If there is a relationship, then desert-based justifications are at odds with the scientific understanding of our moral judgments. 
Desert-based justifications for treatment face this dilemma because they both appeal to intuitive judgments about deserved treatment and also require an assumption that is at odds with the evolutionary explanation of our desert intuitions. The problematic assumption stems from the backward-looking nature of desert justifications for treatment. Desert-based justifications do not take any future or forward-looking considerations to be relevant to the justification for such treatment. The concept of desert itself is also thought to be backward-looking, in that the basis of desert is independent of forward-looking considerations. That is, it is normally assumed that if we judge that a person deserves something, it is in virtue of something that person did or some character trait they have that they deserve this, and never because of some fact about the future. Given that desert is central to most understandings of moral responsibility, I investigated whether our everyday concepts of desert and moral responsibility are in fact entirely backward-looking. My results suggest that this is not the case. Therefore, if appealing to intuitions is a valid method of discovering the nature of moral responsibility and desert, it seems either desert is not entirely backward-looking or moral responsibility is not exclusively desert-based. These experimental results also suggest that consequentialist accounts of moral responsibility, which have largely been abandoned due to their counterintuitive nature, are perhaps not so counterintuitive after all. In sum, I argue that progress in understanding morality, and moral responsibility specifically, requires empirical clarity.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Each year in the United States, over 44,000 individuals die by suicide, and approximately half of these deaths occur from intentional, self-inflicted gunshot wounds. A crucial component of the clinical management of suicide risk is to ask about firearm ownership/access and to provide lethal means counseling on firearm safety. However, few data exist to inform lethal means safety counseling sessions. To address this gap, we randomly assigned 96 young adults to one of four lethal means safety counseling groups that varied on two dimensions demonstrated by past research to potentially influence health behavior change (i.e., fear appeals, emphasis on temporariness). Lethal means safety counseling groups included: (1) low-fear/low-temporary; (2) low-fear/high-temporary; (3) high-fear/low-temporary; and (4) high-fear/high-temporary. All participants reported a lifetime history of suicidal ideation and either owning a firearm, having access to a firearm, and/or a desire/intention to obtain a firearm in the future. We hypothesized that, by one-month follow-up, individuals randomly assigned to the low-fear/high-temporary group compared to the other three groups would (1) report greater intentions to adhere to clinician recommendations to limit access to firearms for safety purposes; (2) report greater intentions to encourage a loved one to adhere to clinician recommendations to limit access to firearms for safety purposes; (3) report greater increases in engagement in firearm safety thoughts/behaviors; and (4) rate the intervention as more acceptable. Results revealed that individuals randomized to the low-fear/high-temporary group reported significantly greater intentions to adhere to clinician recommendations to limit their access to firearms for safety purposes compared to individuals randomized to the other groups. Of note, this effect size was medium in magnitude, highlighting clinical significance. There were no significant intervention group differences regarding encouraging a loved one to adhere to clinician recommendations. Across groups, 35.4% of participants reported an increase in engagement in firearm safety thoughts/behaviors from pre-intervention to one-month follow-up; however, there were no significant group differences. All intervention groups were rated as similarly highly acceptable. Findings underscore the importance of deemphasizing fear and emphasizing temporariness in lethal means counseling for firearm safety. Findings have the potential to inform clinical and public health approaches to limit at-risk individuals’ access to firearms for safety purposes.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Approximately 12% of adults in the United States will experience social anxiety disorder  (SAD) at some point in their lifetime.  Individuals with SAD commonly engage in safety behaviors (SBs), which are behavioral and cognitive strategies used in an effort to avoid or decrease the likelihood of the feared threat outcome and decrease their anxiety in social situations. These behaviors are thought to be dysfunctional and play a key role in contemporary models of the disorder. The current study sought to expand upon existing research by experimentally examining the role of SBs in social anxiety and social performance deficits, specifically self-disclosure. Participants with social anxiety (N = 132) were randomized to two weeks of SB fading or a no-instructions control.  Both conditions completed measures of interest (e.g. social anxiety symptoms, emotional disclosure symptoms) at baseline and post-manipulation, and they also completed a speech task at post.  Consistent with hypotheses, results revealed that the safety behavior fading condition reported lower safety behaviors, social anxiety symptoms, depression symptoms, and trait anxiety relative to the control condition. Additionally, the SB fading condition reported greater questionnaire-assessed disclosure of thoughts, habits and emotions compared to the no-instructions control. Contrary to predictions, no effects of condition were found on fear reactivity or emotional disclosure in the context of the in vivo speech task.  The present study provides further evidence for the importance of SBs in social anxiety and suggests SB fading may lead to greater comfort with self-disclosure. More direct intervention (e.g., social skills training) may be required to influence actual self-disclosure in this population. Limitations and directions for future research are discussed. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Perfectionism is typically defined as an orientation towards setting stringently high standards for oneself alongside incessant self-criticism and evaluative concerns over not meeting such standards (Frost et al., 1990; Hamachek, 1978; Hewitt &amp; Flett, 1991; Limburg et al., 2017). Researchers have found the need to explore new ideas about perfectionism in sport after three decades of mixed findings on how perfectionism affects relevant sport-related processes and outcomes, including exploring ideas about perfectionism that may be unique to the sport domain (Flett &amp; Hewitt, 2019; Hill et al., 2020). Seven current Division I and III coaches participated across golf, swimming, triathlon, and diving. The participants answered questions about their conceptualization of perfectionism, the general and situational consequences that they observe in their athletes, the domain-specificity of perfectionism in athletes, and offered practical suggestions. Many coaches conveyed that perfectionists experience pronounced emotional difficulties, disappointment, and maladaptive reactions to mistakes consistent with the constructs Sport-MPS-2 and the MIP-S (Gotwals et al., 2010; Stoeber et al., 2006). Throughout the whole sample of coaches at-large, they conveyed adaptive and maladaptive consequences of perfectionism on performance and well-being. Also of note, five out of seven coaches believed that perfectionists take a similar approach in other domains. The coaches suggested certain behaviors, attitudes, and feedback to buffer against the detrimental effects of perfectionism. Such suggestions are discussed in light of current models for conceptualizing and intervening with athletes and teams that display perfectionism.  Limitations and future research based on attributes of perfectionism in sport that coaches conveyed that are not widely researched empirically or qualitatively also discussed.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Classically the problem of free will has consisted in whether free will is compatible with determinism. More recently, two other problems for free will have become prominent. One is whether free will is incompatible with indeterminism. The other problem is whether free will can exist given our ever-increasing knowledge of how the brain functions. Even if free will is compatible with determinism and indeterminism, it may turn out that humans are not the kind of beings that are able to exercise free will due to the types of brains we have. I address each of the aforementioned problems in my dissertation. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In Chapter One I define key terms and provide a brief introduction to the aspects of the free will debate I will focus on. In Chapter Two I push back against recent arguments that Frankfurt-style cases succumb to the flicker defense, and I construct a Frankfurt-style case that overcomes the problems posed by this defense. In Chapter Three I discuss a version of the problem of luck for the libertarian, and I argue that an alleged solution to the problem fails to resolve the problem. In Chapter Four I argue that Libet-style experiments, in as much as they cannot establish epiphenomenalism, cannot be used to show that free will does not exist. In the final chapter I summarize my findings.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a chronic relapsing brain disease characterized by compulsive drinking despite negative consequences. While a majority of the world’s population consumes alcohol in a controlled manner, there is a subset of individuals that are susceptible to pathological drinking patterns symptomatic of AUD. Relapse rates within this subset are staggeringly high, suggesting a need for improved treatment options. Additionally, there are differences in how men and women consume and relapse to alcohol and, therefore, sex should be considered as a factor when examining potential treatments for AUD. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Over the last couple of decades, ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, has gained popularity as a therapeutic agent after clinical studies revealed that a single, intravenous infusion can alleviate depressive symptoms in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) within two hours and have long-lasting effects for up to two weeks. More recently, it has shown promising therapeutic value for the treatment of AUD in both clinical and preclinical studies. While ketamine has shown great promise for TRD, it is a commonly abused club drug and has addictive potential itself. This is potentially problematic when considering it as an AUD treatment option given that the maintenance of sobriety will ultimately require repeated infusions, which may lead to abuse potential and may hinder its therapeutic benefits. Therefore, it is crucial to assess the effects of repeated treatments with ketamine on alcohol intake.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Accordingly, we aimed to examine in rats of both sexes how individual differences in alcohol intake alter ketamine self-administration and how ketamine self-administration will alter subsequent alcohol-drinking behaviors. To do this, male and female rats intermittently drank alcohol or water under a 2-bottle choice paradigm for 10-weeks and were divided into high- or low-alcohol intake groups prior to ketamine self-administration. Rats were then given access to intravenously (i.v.) self-administer 0.5 mg/kg/infusion of ketamine under a fixed ratio 1 (FR1) schedule of reinforcement and were later tested for their motivation to self-administer ketamine under a progressive ratio (PR) schedule of reinforcement. These self-administration sessions were nested from weeks 4 to 7 during the 10-week alcohol-drinking period and during the final three weeks, rats were tested for incubated ketamine craving during a period of forced abstinence. High-alcohol intake in male rats attenuated ketamine self-administration whereas in female rats, high-alcohol intake enhanced motivation to self-administer ketamine. Ketamine reduced alcohol intake in high-alcohol male rats but increased it in low-alcohol female rats, and incubated ketamine craving developed in all groups except low-alcohol females. We then investigated structural plasticity by examining dendritic spine morphology in a brain region considered the hub of reward circuitry, the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Total and thin spines were positively correlated with alcohol percent preference in both sexes. Three weeks of abstinence from ketamine was associated with increased mushroom spines in all groups except the high-alcohol male group. Overall, these data suggested that ketamine as a treatment for AUD may benefit male subjects, but not female subjects, and further investigation is warranted before use as a therapeutic agent.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To address neuroadaptations that may have contributed to the sex differences in the addictive interaction between alcohol intake and ketamine self-administration, we aimed to determine whether the neural mechanisms within the NAc controlling alcohol intake in male and female rats was different. Within the NAc, there are two main subtypes of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) that are classified by their enrichment of either dopamine 1 or 2 receptors (D1R vs D2R). These MSN subtypes have functionally opposing roles, and previous reports indicate that alcohol intake increases excitatory neurotransmission exclusively on D1R-containing NAc MSNs to promote addictive-like behaviors in male rats. However, this remains unknown in females. Therefore, we aimed to determine the role of NAc D1R- versus D2R-containing MSNs in mediating alcohol’s addictive properties in both sexes. Using Drd1a-iCre and Drd2-iCre transgenic rats, cre-dependent viral constructs of either stimulatory (hM3D(Gq)) or inhibitory (hM4D(Gi)) designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) were infused to selectively manipulate D1R- or D2R-containing NAc MSNs. Rats intermittently drank 20% alcohol or water under a 2-bottle choice paradigm for 8-weeks and received intra-NAc DREADDs infusions in week 4. In week 8, rats were administered clozapine-N-oxide (CNO; 3 mg/mL) and alcohol intake was measured 1-, 4- and 24-hours after the start of drinking. Our results showed that selective manipulation of D1R-containing MSNs bidirectionally controlled alcohol intake and inhibition of D2R-containing MSNs enhanced alcohol intake in both sexes, with prolonged effects in females. These findings suggest opposing roles for how D1R- and D2R-containing NAc MSNs modulate alcohol intake in rats of both sexes.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Taken together, this work demonstrates that the interaction between alcohol and ketamine is different in male versus female rats, and that NAc D1R- versus D2R-containing MSNs control alcohol intake differently between the sexes. Indeed, D1R- and D2R-containing NAc MSNs may respond to alcohol at different thresholds between male and female rats given the prolonged effects observed in females, and it is possible that this may have some physiological significance for how these neurons would respond to ketamine. In order to understand whether sex differences in neural mechanisms underlying alcohol intake contribute to differences in how high-alcohol intake male versus female rats self-administer ketamine, future studies should expand upon what produces the prolonged changes in alcohol intake in females after selective manipulation of NAc MSNs. It is possible that differences in intracellular signaling pathways that may be responsible for the behavioral differences observed in self-administration mentioned above. Alternatively, it is possible that the sex differences observed in the interaction between alcohol and ketamine was driven by how male and female rats respond to ketamine rather than alcohol. Therefore, more work is also necessary to try to understand neuroadaptations mediating ketamine’s addictive properties in both male and female subjects to better understand the safety of repeated ketamine infusions as a therapeutic agent for AUD.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The shape analysis of curves and surfaces has caught more and more attention in recent years. For curves in Euclidean space, the SRVF framework allows us to define and efficiently compute a distance on the shape space of curves. In this dissertation we give a generalization of the SRVF to curves with values in a homogeneous space and show that,  under mild conditions, there always exist optimal reparametrizations realizing the quotient distance on the space of shapes. We give concrete examples to demonstrate the efficiency of our framework. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Next, we introduce a diffeomorphism-invariant Riemannian metric on the space of vector valued one-forms. The metric is motivated by applications in the field of shape analysis and by connections to the Ebin metric on the space of all Riemannian metrics. We calculate the geodesic equations and obtain explicit solutions for the corresponding initial value problem. Using this, we study the geodesic and metric incompleteness of the space of one-forms and exhibit some totally geodesic subspaces. We also calculate its sectional curvature and observe that, depending on the dimensions of the base manifold and the ambient Euclidean space, it either has a semidefinite sign or admits both signs.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>After that, we give two data-driven frameworks for analyzing shapes of immersed surfaces in $\RR^3$. In the first framework, we introduce a 4-parameter family of elastic metrics on the space of surfaces as a pullback of a family of metrics on the space of vector-valued one-forms. This 4-parameter family of elastic metrics is invariant under rigid motions and reparametrizations. It generalizes a previously studied 3-parameter family of elastic metrics called the general elastic metric, and in particular the Square Root Normal Field (SRNF) metric, which has proved to be successful in various applications. In the second framework, we define a new representation for surfaces in $\RR^3$ by combining the induced surface metric and the SRNF of each surface. Using the DeWitt metric on the space of metrics and the $L^2$ metric on the space of SRNFs, we obtain a 3-parameter family of elastic metrics on surfaces, which forms an open subset of the general elastic metric. The new representation avoids the degeneracy of the SRNF representation, while it still results in an explicit extrinsic distance function on the space of surfaces and thus makes the framework computationally efficient. For both of these two frameworks we provide numerical algorithms and show several examples to validate the frameworks. The second framework, although it does not give a computation of geodesics, provides fast and accurate registration of surfaces.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Finally we conclude with a summary of this dissertation and a discussion of possible future work.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Individual differences factors (IDs) play significant roles in second language (L2) learning. Compared to the general field of SLA, however, little is known in the L2 writing domain regarding the influence of learner factors in L2 writing achievement. Therefore, in this study, I aimed to extend the IDs research in L2 writing by closely examining the interaction between students’ cognitive abilities, motivational levels, and emotional experiences on one hand and their L2 writing achievement on the other. To that end, I drew on the latest theoretical developments in the field of SLA to conceptualize students’ motivational orientations and emotional experiences during L2 writing and explore how those affective variables as well as their L2 learning abilities contribute to their success in L2 writing. A total of 85 university students learning English as a Foreign Language (EFL) at a private university participated in the study by filling out several questionnaires and taking a language aptitude test. The students were also asked to write an essay about a specific topic. Factor analytic results substantiated the construct validity of the L2 writing selves scales. In addition, reliability analyses confirmed the internal consistency of all the motivational, emotional, and cognitive measures. Two raters also graded the students’ essays both holistically and analytically in terms of complexity, accuracy, and fluency. To answer the research questions, a series of multiple regression were conducted. The results showed that the ideal L2 writing self positively predicted L2 writing joy, motivation, and achievement, whereas ought L2 writing self positively predicted L2 writing anxiety and motivation. Although both L2 writing enjoyment and anxiety predicted L2 writing motivation positively, L2 writing anxiety predicted L2 writing course grade negatively. Aptitude was also found as a positive predictor of L2 writing achievement. Considering the CAF measures, only ideal L2 writing self predicted the fluency. Overall, the findings provided a clear picture on the role of IDs in the development of L2 writing.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>  non-stationary point processes where the pair correlation function</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>  depends on the value of covariates.  The traditional pair</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>  correlation function is free of covariates and depends only on the</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Several philosophers have appealed to social scientific evidence in support of the view that most people fail to act on the basis of reasons far more often than is ordinarily recognized. According to the so-called “situationist” research program in social psychology, a wealth of empirical evidence suggests that, with respect to human action, various ethically and rationally arbitrary features of our situations are often pulling the strings, rather than the reasons we have when acting. The reported findings indicate that most people are less likely to exhibit moral conduct if they are surrounded by passive bystanders, abusive authority figures, ambient noises, and other rationally arbitrary situational influences. The situationist evidence appears to sit uneasily with accounts of moral agency that emphasize rational control while neglecting the power of arbitrary features of situations. Aristotelian virtue ethics describes persons as possessing character traits that are largely insensitive to ethically trivial situational influences. Reasons-Responsiveness accounts of moral responsibility describe moral agents as having the capacity to exhibit a suitable pattern of recognizing and reacting to moral reasons across situations with varying arbitrary influences. To the extent that many ordinary people do not satisfy the rational and behavioral requirements of these philosophical accounts of moral agency, we presumably may not avail ourselves of their explanatory, descriptive, and evaluative resources. Furthermore, these accounts may even entail skepticism about moral character and responsibility to the extent that we accept their standards for exercising moral agency in light of the psychological evidence. 
This dissertation argues that interpretations of both the situationist empirical record as well as philosophical theories of moral agency have been exaggerated to create the illusion of incompatibility. A wealth of previously neglected psychological research on self-efficacy, expertise, mental contrasting, moral practice, and other factors suggest that ethically and rationally arbitrary features of situations may not be the primary drivers of human decision-making and behavior. Moreover, philosophical accounts that emphasize acting on the basis of reasons do not require the level of rational control that is threatened by the evidence in social psychology. Hence, philosophical theories of human agency have not been deprived of their descriptive, explanatory, and evaluative resources nor does their acceptance entail skepticism about moral agency.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This collection of short stories is set in Cabo Verde, California, New York, Massachusetts, and Missouri. It tells the stories of, among other people, a young woman disillusioned with her boyfriend’s struggle to live a moral life, and a college senior coming to terms with his love for, as well as his impending separation from, his best friend. The stories are, on their face, disparate tales. But they are unified by characters who, despite considering themselves enlightened, reflective intellectuals, remain blind to some crucial aspect of themselves. In the course of these stories, characters seek self-knowledge, or, alternatively, they encounter it rudely and unexpectedly. By the end of each story, the protagonist has arrived at a greater understanding of their flaws, in which understanding, however painful it may be, lies the potential to lead a better life.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Itinerant magnetism occurs in materials that exhibit a spontaneous polarization of the electronic structure due to the destabilization effect of a large peak in the Density of States at the Fermi level. This itinerancy is difficult to comprehensively characterize, but its roots in the electronic structure allow us to perform perturbations (such as electron-doping, hole-doping, or applying external pressure) to modify the material’s magnetic behavior in a more predictable manner.In Chapter One, we address background information and predicate our research hypotheses using prior literature. Understanding the available resources allows educated decisions on target systems that may exhibit controllable changes to their electronic and crystal structure under certain stimuli. In Chapter Two, we discuss the synthesis method of the chosen materials, briefly address the applied perturbation for each system, and introduce the characterization methods used to study the resulting behavior.
In Chapter Three, we begin a study of transition-metal germanides, starting with an in-depth look at the CuFe2-xCoxGe2 system and attempting to correlate the chemical bonding in the material to its magnetic properties. CuFe2Ge2 has features in its electronic structure reminiscent of the Fe-based superconductors, but, on its own, this material exhibits several competing magnetic ground states. The substitution of Co for Fe perturbs this system through electron doping. We show by a combination of diverse characterization methods and theoretical analysis how this substitution affects the chemical bonding and, by proxy, the itinerant magnetism.
In Chapter Four, we continue to the related Cu0.6Mn2.4Ge2 system, a ferromagnetic material with a complex crystal structure disorder model that includes mixing of transition metal atoms and vacancies in the same crystallographic sites. We characterize the crystal and magnetic structures using models developed by X-ray and neutron diffraction, magnetic measurements, and theoretical calculations.
In Chapter Five, we turn to the EuMn2Pn2 (Pn = P, As) materials with the CaAl2Si2 structure type. We address their similarities to the ubiquitous ThCr2Si2 structure type and study how the electronic and crystal structure of the system respond to applied pressure.
In each case, we utilize a chemical and physical control over the electronic and crystal structures that expand our understanding of itinerant magnetism in ternary and pseudo-ternary metallic systems. The knowledge established in this thesis further crystallizes the utility of electronic structure calculations as a roadmap toward understanding and predicting itinerant magnetic systems, and ultimately moves the field closer to comprehension of more complex and exotic behavior that can be observed in these systems.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Symmetry is a property commonly observed in nature and is closer to the rule than the exception in the proteome; with a vast majority of proteins inherently displaying symmetry. Many protein architectures exhibit evidence of internal rotational symmetry postulated to be the result of gene duplication and fusion events involving a primordial polypeptide motif. Additionally, these gene duplication and fusion processes can also potentially yield regions of repetitive primary structure. Repetitive primary structure offers the potential for alternative definitions of critical regions, such as the folding nucleus (FN). The FN is a cryptic, and non-obvious region of a protein that adopts the first native like contacts and acts as the initiating step in protein folding. In principle, more than one instance of the FN potentially enables the availability of alternative folding pathways in the face of a subsequent deleterious mutation. Symmetric protein architectures are hypothesized to be uniquely primed to accommodate structural insults due to potential availability of multiple FN. This thesis seeks to understand how repetitive symmetry generated through gene duplication and fusion events can enable FN plasticity in the face of gross structural destabilization (including mutation, insertion, and functionalization). By using de novo designed symmetric proteins (that adopt the β-trefoil fold) with known FN locales to imitate known destabilizing evolutionary events, the exploration of alternative folding pathways in the β-trefoil fold is possible.

            <DISS_para>In this paper I explore the possibilities of community through sport in the context of soccer in Kansas City.  Drawing from the conceptualizations of community in Esposito’s oeuvre and utilizing the ontological framework of Deleuze and Guattari (1980/1987), I explore the rise of the professional soccer club Sporting KC and its entanglements within the politics of Kansas City and beyond.  This dissertation begins with a discussion on the philosophical origins of community and locate Esposito and Deleuze’s work within this discourse as well as elaborate how their ontological work translates into research into the possibilities of community for this paper.  I then present four separate chapters each organized on exploring the different aspects of the empirical material encountered during this research project, and I discuss how discourse on these topics might further our understanding of what is possible in considering the relationship between sport and community in Kansas City.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The product distribution strategy deployed in a given supply chain is highly important for the proper operations of that supply chain. A number of supply chain problems are associated with the mismanagement of supply chain operations (for example, the decay of products that are perishable in nature). Many supply chain problems eventually result in monetary losses. The cross-docking strategy (i.e., use of cross-docking terminals (CDTs)) has been found to improve product distribution in many supply chains. The cross-docking strategy refers to the logistics process, which consists of the reception of inbound products that have been transported by trucks/trailers, unloading and transferring the products across the dock to outbound doors (with or without temporary storage), where the outbound trucks/trailers are docked to pick up the consolidated products, which are ready to be shipped out. This process enhances the efficiency of the supply chain operations, reduces handling times and operational costs using various handling equipment types (such as sorters, combiners, conveyor belts, and others).A detailed survey of previous studies on CDTs showed that cross-docking is gaining attention increasingly over the years. Several supply chains have also adopted the cross-docking strategy in their distribution chains. Specifically, in practice, the CDT strategy is found suitable for product distribution in cold supply chains. Most of the surveyed studies focused on the CDT operations without considering the possibility of the perishable products decaying during the handling process. Other studies were also reviewed which considered the decay of products during various supply chain processes but not within the context of cross-docking operations. Therefore, there are no studies conducted to date that explicitly capture the perishable products decay within the context of supply chains and explicitly model the cross-docking strategy.
This dissertation focuses on the scheduling of trucks (both in- and outbound trucks) at a CDT, where some of the delivered products are perishable in nature. The short lifespan of perishable products (i.e., foods and drugs) poses critical challenges to the CDT operations management. Perishable goods are time-sensitive products that require minimal handling time to preserve their quality and profitability. Cross-docking is expected to facilitate the distribution of perishable products within supply chains. There are many challenges involved in the management of the cross-docking terminals with perishable products, including determination of the service order of the trucks (inbound and outbound) carrying perishable products, selection of preemption strategies for certain trucks (i.e., a given truck can leave the door, so another truck can be docked for service), allocation of suitable temporary storage space for products, quality loss due to late delivery or errors in temperature control.
This dissertation aims to develop a mathematical model for scheduling the arriving trucks at a cross-dock terminal, taking product decay into consideration throughout the handling process. The objective of the mathematical model minimizes the total truck service cost, which includes (1) waiting cost; (2) service cost; (3) cost of product storage; (4) cost of delay in truck departure; and (5) the cost associated with the decay of products that are perishable in nature. A number of linearization techniques are discussed in order to linearize the original nonlinear mathematical model (where the nonlinearity is caused by the adopted product decay function). The complexity of the linearized model is evaluated in this dissertation. Moreover, the candidate solution approaches for the proposed mathematical model are described.
The developed model was solved using the exact optimization technique. In particular, the model was solved to optimality using CPLEX. However, it was observed that the computational time increased as the problem size increased due to the model complexity. Four alternative solution approaches namely: (1) Evolutionary Algorithm (EA); (2) Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS); (3) Tabu Search (TS); and (4) Simulated Annealing (SA), which are common metaheuristic algorithms, were developed and compared with CPLEX using small-size problem instances. These metaheuristics were able to achieve optimal solutions for the small-size problem instances and required relatively low computational times. The metaheuristic algorithms were further compared, and EA was found to outperform the others (VNS, TS, and SA) based on the balance between the objective function and computational time values. A set of analyses were carried out using EA, and managerial insights that could be of interest to supply chain stakeholders were drawn. The proposed mathematical model, the developed EA, and the managerial insights could assist the CDT manager in making efficient and timely truck scheduling decisions in any planning horizon.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Mental health courts are a type of treatment court that utilize the principles of therapeutic jurisprudence to provide a treatment-oriented approach rather than the traditional adversarial approach. This study sought to explore mental health court administration through the experiences and perceptions of the court administrators. The available literature demonstrates positive results from these programs, but many aspects of their functioning and what makes them function well remain unknown. Mental health court administrators were surveyed using an electronic questionnaire. The questionnaire asked questions about administrator demographics, educational background, and work history. Administrators were asked to describe their programs and answer a variety of questions about administrator discretion, program success, level of support, funding, technology use, professional organization, program changes, data collection, and evaluation. The questionnaire was followed by an interview with select administrators to further explore funding, challenges, effects of COVID, technology use, job preparation, and administrator characteristics. Results related to program success and level of support were compared to results of a similar study conducted with drug court administrators.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this dissertation is to ascertain, explore, and document how music and dance have been used as a means and method of healing, survival, and celebration in Native American communities. This work does not focus solely upon one Nation or tribe of Native American peoples but instead incorporates participants’ voices from a Pan-Native population. Drawing from my analysis of the historical legacy of U.S.-supported and funded American Indian boarding schools, ethnographic interviews, participation in collaborative ethnography, and audiovisual documentation of performances and conversations, I examine how Native American musicians, dancers, and healers define and re-define their identities to both their local Indigenous communities and an expanding worldwide audience. Furthermore, I discuss how Native American communities affected by the legacies of traumas have, in turn, created hidden cultural and personal transcripts that shape how they conceive and perceive their voice and place amidst the dominant society. I explore how musics, songs, and dances have opened a pathway for reconnection to  ̶  and a redefinition of  ̶  core cultural and spiritual beliefs that have been forgotten or withheld by choice or force due to social policies or historical constructs of control. This research thus investigates how musics, songs, and dances have played and continue to play a role in re-awakening Native American identity by giving sovereignty of voice to those who, for generations, have experienced oppression as the underlying foundation of their daily existence. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This work contains three audio music examples. “Where Eagles Fly” is an unpublished, self-recorded song by Suze Vander Laan Bone shared with the author during online interview discussions with the musician/artist. The song was intended to be used in conjunction with Vander Laan Bone’s currently unpublished screenplay Detours. “Toosh toosh” is a healing song shared with the author during an interview session with Donald White that he used to sing to calm those suffering from anxiety and sadness. “Losh’ga” is a song shared with the author during an interview session with Dr. Nicky Michael that she used to sing to her brother when he was hospitalized.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Ronald J Staheli’s contributions to choral music spanned forty years between Wichita State University (1975-1978) and Brigham Young University (1978-2015). Staheli’s desire to create beauty and the finest choral music experience for his students guided his work at BYU. In 1984, Staheli founded the Brigham Young University Singers, a choral ensemble that has been invited to perform for national conferences of NCCO, ACDA, NAfME, and the World Symposium on Choral Music. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	This study documents Staheli’s musical upbringing in southern Utah, his education at BYU and the University of Southern California, and initial years teaching at WSU and BYU prior to the creation of BYU Singers. The study documents the formation of BYU Singers and Staheli’s vision for that ensemble, exploring the BYU Singers’ 1) Psyche as defined by Staheli, 2) mission and goals, 3) unified artistry, tone, and diction, 4) tours to twenty-nine countries and thirty-two US states over a thirty-one year period, 5) repertoire, 6) and discography. Finally, the study offers an in-depth look into Staheli’s musical philosophies, his motivation, his service, his approach to conducting, his rehearsals, and his thirty published arrangements and compositions.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Monte Carlo methods are often used to efficiently estimate partial differential equations. In this document, I will look at a few methods that have been developed into the backbone of the algorithm for estimating the electrostatic free energy of a biomolecule in a solution. Then, I will examine a problem found in the Walk-on-Subdomains (WOSD) portion of this algorithm. In some cases, walkers get stuck oscillating between two atoms, which can cause the run to take an incredibly long time to complete. I will also present a potential solution to this problem, using a sharp restart condition. Using some ideas from research into First Passage Time (FPT) algorithms, this method could both solve the problem of walker entrapment and perhaps improve overall run time even when significant entrapment has not occurred. I will examine some experimental results for both improved run time and potential bias in the final results. Finally, I test two automated methods for determining an appropriate sharp restart condition and evaluate whether automating the restart appears appropriate for use in arbitrary molecules.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para> Before entering American university graduate programs, many international students must attend Intensive English Programs (IEPs) to improve their English proficiency (Redden, 2018). Their English proficiency is tested via the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). Once they pass the TOEFL and are admitted into a graduate program, IEP students will also often obtain graduate teaching positions as International Teaching Assistants (ITAs), where speaking and pronunciation skills will be a vital part of their success. Given a lack of focus on pronunciation within the TOEFL exam (Educational Testing Services, 2019) and a lack of explicit pronunciation instruction in IEP curriculum, how might these factors influence IEP students’ language and pronunciation goals that lead to pronunciation outcomes? Through a mixed methods design, I used quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews to explore students’ goals for their English pronunciation, specifically the influence of second language testing, IEP students’ future goals, and IEP students’ knowledge and beliefs about pronunciation. First, findings revealed that the speaking-specific requirements of the TOEFL did not directly influence IEP students’ specific second-language pronunciation goals. Instead, participants had a pronunciation goal of general ‘intelligibility’ with respect to passing the TOEFL. Second, participants described both integrative goals (e.g., desire to integrate into the L2 community) and instrumental goals (e.g., understanding L2 proficiency would help achieve a larger goal) for learning a second language. Results suggest that their pronunciation goals were similar to their language goals (e.g., language goal: join L2 society; pronunciation goal: be intelligible). Third, findings revealed that participants had both fixed and growth capability beliefs about English-language pronunciation and that their capability beliefs influenced their pronunciation goals. Grounded theory analysis brought to light additional factors that influenced IEP students’ L2 pronunciation goals. Internal factors that influenced participants’ pronunciation goals included their value of effort and time for improving pronunciation, potential methods of improvement, and their value or usefulness of the L2 for their future goals,. External factors that influenced participants’ pronunciation goals included expectations/societal pressures to reach native-English pronunciation within their primary culture or their future career.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>This thesis observes and analyzes embodied student activism as it is preserved across seven processed and unprocessed collections in Florida State University’s Heritage and University Archives. The analysis is framed by Peg Syverson’s application of complex adaptive systems (110), and occurs through a two-step process: First, I categorize artifacts based on their connection to four social movements. Second, I categorize artifacts based on the exhibited performance of embodied activism falls into one of the four embodiment categories (1) held artifacts; (2) group formation; (3) apparel; and (4) physical gesture. I focus my analysis on the role of embodiment in meaning making because the archive is a site of public memory where meaning is constructed through the presence of marked identities and the influence of patriotism and lived experience on student activism. Ultimately, I identify an interconnected network of relationships between activists, their institution, and larger social collectives, so as to consider how those relationships—when read as "embodiment"—can inform our abilities to historically read student life.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This study contributes further understanding of the way sports consumers respond to negative communication. For the sport of professional football and the National Football League (NFL), Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) being linked to the game’s repeated head trauma is a contentious and enduring issue threatening the sport. Medical experts, past players, and parents have called into question the continuation of the sport and the actions of the NFL in response to CTE (Semuels, 2019)—it is an issue that the NFL cannot ignore, and fans are forced to negotiate. In this study a quasi-experiment was used to examine the way in which consumers responded to negative communication about CTE and professional football. In examining motivated reasoning and biased processing within this context, key antecedents and mechanisms were explored. The key theoretical constructs underpinning this study are the Psychological Continuum Model (PCM), involvement, and identity.The study addressed the following research questions:  (1) Do people utilize motivated reasoning and biased processing when exposed to negative information about CTE in professional football?; (2) Does motivated reasoning and biased processing vary, based on strength of psychological connection, when people are exposed to negative information about CTE in professional football?; (3) What strategies are utilized by fans in response to negative information about CTE that enables them to continue to support professional football and the NFL? (e.g., counterargument, denying message validity, discrediting the source, distorting arguments).
The final study sample included 151 undergraduate students. Two message formats were utilized, a televisual and text format. Responses to the CTE information were compared among individuals at different stages of the Psychological Continuum Model (PCM, Funk &amp; James, 2001; 2006). A series of hypotheses were testing using ANOVA statistical analysis. The results provide preliminary empirical support for the relationship between strength of psychological connection and biased processing (Funk &amp; James, 2001; 2006; Wann &amp; James, 2018). The Allegiance group was distinct from the other three stages in demonstrating biased processing—findings that are consistent with early theoretical expectations of the PCM (e.g., Beaton &amp; Funk, 2008; Funk &amp; James, 2006). 
Individuals in the Allegiance stage demonstrated more message elaborations, more negative thoughts, more counterargument, and less favorable attitudes towards mitigating actions in response to the CTE message stimuli. There was general agreement across all participants regarding the severity of CTE, but respondents differed in their attitudes towards suggested responses to CTE. The appraisal of the proposed mitigating action, rather than the appraisal of the health threat, appeared to have elicited cognitive dissonance amongst individuals with high psychological connection. Thought-listing responses provided information about the nature of the counterarguments utilized by respondents, and in turn the strategies that enable them to justify the unaltered continuation of professional football. Collectively, the results provide a conceptual model for future testing and for adaptation to other contexts.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>	Spin crossover (SCO) is a physical phenomenon where certain transition metal ions exhibit a change in their electronic configuration and magnetic state under the influence of external stimuli such as temperature, pressure, or light. SCO is commonly observed in complexes of the Fe(II) cation when a ligand field of intermediate strength is achieved, most commonly with six coordinating nitrogen atoms. This thesis explores two important ways of utilizing the SCO phenomenon. Firstly, SCO can be combined with electrical conductivity to produce multifunctional molecular materials. Secondly, Fe(II) SCO complexes can be designed in novel coordination environments, in addition to the typical N6 coordination.	In Chapter 1, we present the fundamentals of SCO and organic conductors along with a brief overview of relevant literature. The understanding of these fundamentals allows us to design the desired SCO materials. In Chapter 2, we explain different synthetic methods, including various crystal growth techniques, to obtain fractional charge on TCNQ radical anions co-crystallized with SCO Fe(II) cationic complexes. We provide information on magnetic and photomagnetic measurements and special sample preparation requirements. Information on supplementary characterization methods is also presented.
	In Chapter 3, we show an effective way to incorporate TCNQ●– organic radicals into paramagnetic transition metal complexes. In such complexes, TCNQ●– radical anions (0 &lt;  &lt; 1) are arranged in stacks that provide conducting pathways. In Chapter 4, we expand this approach to using SCO moieties instead of simple paramagnetic cations. Our studies reveal that stacking distances of TCNQ●– can be affected by structural changes induced by the varying electronic configuration at the Fe(II) center. This coupling results in a synergy between SCO and electrical transport.
	In order to expand the design possibilities of SCO complexes, it is important to find alternative coordination environments that can provide the appropriate ligand field strength necessary for SCO. In Chapter 5, we demonstrate various heteroleptic Fe(II) complexes containing one N2 donating ligand and one tetradentate “capping” ligand for achieving SCO behavior. The tetradentate capping ligands include N4-donating ligands, leading to the typical N6 coordination environments, and N2S2-donating ligands, leading to N4S2 coordination. 
	The combination of experimental design and investigations into hybrid Fe(II) SCO complexes with TCNQ radical anions, as presented in this thesis, advances the knowledge of spin-state switching in transition metal complexes and inches towards more applied studies of functionalized molecular materials. Designing SCO complexes with new coordination environments is appealing due to the possibility of discovering new families of compounds that might exhibit SCO, thus expanding the possibilities for the discovery of such complexes.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The world is not static - economic agents make decision in dynamic environments all the time. This dissertation focuses on the behavior of individuals and firms in such environments. In particular, we consider three settings, and for each of them we construct theoretical models, which allow us to analyze the dynamic aspect of the behavior. Furthermore, we design and conduct laboratory experiments to test the hypotheses of our models.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In chapter 2 we investigate the winner-take-all contest framework, in which players compete for a single prize over the duration of the contest. In chapter 3 we study a dynamic development process using a model with multiple locations and heterogeneous agents. In chapter 4 we analyze the dynamics within a crowdfunding process, in which producers of goods can design campaigns to attract more consumers.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Overall, our theoretical results show that in all settings economic agents adjust their behavior to changing conditions. In particular, we use backward induction to analyze how random processes or actions of other players affect optimal decision-making of economic agents in dynamic environments. Results of the experiments tend to be consistent with theoretical predictions, and our global behavioral result is that learning plays an important role in dynamic environments - over time subjects are inclined to make choices leading to better outcomes.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The neurophysiological foundation and anatomical basis of circuits necessary for adult behaviors are established early in development. Numerous perinatal and postnatal variables affect circuit trajectory during developmental sensitive periods. Therefore, to understand adult behaviors, a consideration of the developmental origins of the behavior are important. The infant must attend to relevant sensory stimuli and environmental input predominantly from the caregiver during sensitive periods in development. The caregiver can orient, enhance, and highlight relevant stimuli to the infant. Early postnatal events such as parental care and environmental stimuli are critical factors that influence the oxytocin (OXT) and OXT receptor (OXTR) system. As an effector, OXT can facilitate the acquisition of sensory experiences in a social context and as a target, OXT and OXTR expression can be altered by early life experiences. OXT/OXTR manipulations in newborns have some potent acute and long-term effects. OXTRs are widely expressed in the brain and peripheral tissues both before birth and after birth in mice. Chapter 1 of this dissertation is a review of the dynamic expression patterns of OXTR and the effects of OXT at different developmental stages and across-species. During postnatal development, through activation of OXTR, OXT can shape the maturation of its own system, and other neurotransmitter systems.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Chapter 2 describes the effects of congenital loss of OXTR on Oxt gene expression in the hypothalamus across development, and discusses the role of OXTR as potential mediators of sensory experience. These effects may be clinically relevant. Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetic disorder with severe hypothalamic dysfunction including impaired OXT system (decreased OXT immunoreactivity in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) and reduced Oxtr gene expression the frontal cortex in postmortem tissue). Further, PWS  phenotypes have origins in sensorimotor deficits at infancy with promising therapeutic effects of OXT. Chapter 3 describes a series of experiments conducted to assess the role of peripheral OXTR in PWS, and identifies critical anatomical regions in the periphery where OXT/OXTR can interact with genes in the PWS imprinted domain. Because the production of mature OXT in the neonatal mouse is low and maternal production of OXT is high, the earliest OXT signaling events in the developing mammal may be from maternal sources of OXT and can act on peripheral OXTR in neonatal mice. Chapter 4 describes where the effector sites are located in the periphery, what type of sensory signals they might regulate, the brainstem projections of neurons expressing Oxtr, and describes a useful mouse-line using a Cre-Lox P approach for a further understanding of OXTR in peripheral sensory ganglia. To summarize, as presented in Chapter 5, these data suggest that OXTR is an important candidate to mediate sensory experience and perhaps attune the infant brain to attend to sensory stimuli in a social context. In this way, OXT/OXTR in peripheral sensorimotor systems may set-up a mechanism by which environmental stimuli programs neuropeptide synthesis and release in the brain, and establishes the foundation for neurotypical hypothalamic circuits.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Research indicates that there is a disconnect between public perception of the interior design profession and the actualities of the profession. This disconnect has influenced, and is influenced by, the two predominate factors. The first of these factors is a phenomenon called occupational stereotyping, and according to Bellamy, Lipton, O'Connor, and Terry (1991) is " a preconceived attitude about a particular occupation, about people who are employed in that occupation, and about one's own suitability for that occupation'' (p. 129). The second, and perhaps most pervasive factor, is an overabundance of inaccurate media portrayals which fundamentally mislead the public as to the responsibility of interior design within the construction of the built environment (Chaney, 2007; Waxman &amp; Clemons, 2007; White, 2009). These factors encourage biased lobbying and legislation that aims to threaten the professional jurisdiction of interior design, (Carpenter, 2007; Ginthner, Guerin &amp; Martin, 2000) as well as inadvertently jeopardize the health, safety and welfare of the general public (Waxman &amp; Clemons, 2007).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	For decades the interior design profession has fought to eliminate these threats but have found only partial success with varied mitigation results (Clemons &amp; Waxman, 2007). The general publics’ constant exposure to television, social media and print publications has only exacerbated this situation and rendered any elimination efforts futile. Rather than attempting to dismantle the source of these inaccuracies, the profession must leverage them to their advantage starting with the most prevalent, social media. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Current research indicates that social media use is excessive and steadily increasing, with usage peaking in individuals under the age of 35. One demographic in particular has been recognized for their excessive, virtually compulsory use of social media, the Millennial Generation (Anderson &amp; Smith, 2018). The Millennials, individuals born between the years of 1982 and 1996 (Newman, Roberts, &amp; Schwartzstein, 2012), are credited with permanently altering the social and economic constructs of society through their social media obsession (Adams &amp; Pate, 2013). They are also recognized for sharing a strong collective identity which has been shaped by a collective set of values. This value set, a standard by which all is measured, influences almost all aspects of Millennial life (Nermoe, 2018). According to Curtis (2018), Millennials are willing to pursue and pay more for goods and services they feel align with such values as sustainability, global connectivity, authenticity, wellbeing and socially responsible product sourcing (Schwabel, 2015). They commonly and consistently demonstrate sponsorship for their chosen selections via their inherent social media capabilities and have been credited with the ability to substantially influence the popularity and success anything within their realm of support (Sabrina, 2018).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Many of these Millennial values are in alignment with standard interior design practices such as sustainable design, designing for human wellbeing, authenticity and global influence of design content (Chaney, 2007; International WELL Building Institute, n.d.; Schwabel, 2015). This thesis posits that a demonstration of this alignment would foster Millennial support for the profession of interior design. If the profession can successfully communicate the aforementioned value alignment as well as its professional relevancy to the Millennials, they will undoubtedly help disseminate the actualities of the profession which will aid in efforts to correct inaccurate public perceptions. The Millennial and their innate social media abilities could become an invaluable marketing tool. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	The solution to this problem posed through this thesis was the hypothetical design of an interactive, educational, museum-style experience that communicates the social, cultural and economic contributions of the interior design profession. A detailed survey was created to ascertain specific existing Millennial perceptions and opinions of the interior design profession as it relates to allied professions. The survey, in conjuncture with established Millennial and museum research, informed the design of the aforementioned educational, museum-style space. All design programming considered the collective values, as well as the learning preferences of the Millennial Generation. The objective of this thesis was to aid in the collective effort to correctly inform the public of the professional relevancy of the profession of interior design by adding to the existing body of knowledge held by the profession.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation analyzes Quality Enhancement Plans (QEPs) focused on improving writing. The study’s first research question asks how the construct of writing is defined, and what is described as valuable about writing, in the language of QEP documents. Its second research question asks how institutions refer and connect writing to their unique contexts in the language of QEPs. To answer these research questions, I analyzed two sets of documents: executive summaries for 142 writing-focused QEPs submitted to the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools from 2007 to 2017, and 5 full QEP proposals. I used an inductive coding method to analyze these documents. The results of this analysis indicated that QEPs contain narrow definitions of the writing construct, consisting primarily of logic, rhetoric, disciplinary, and mechanics-focused language. The analysis also indicated that institutions refer to writing as a means of supporting institutional goals such, as career preparation. The dissertation explores five themes emerging from these results, and suggests directions for future research based on my findings.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Ego-involved climates are often unavoidable in most sport settings, but there are negative psychological effects that tend to coincide with them. As such, research investigating the effects of motivational climate are increasingly relevant to team and group settings. Researchers have previously demonstrated task-involved climates to be associated with various adaptive psychological variables such as increased enjoyment and self-efficacy and decreased stress, shame, and self-consciousness. However, three primary gaps and limitations exist within the literature: 1) few studies have utilized behavioral measures of performance; 2) few studies have utilized an experimental design; and 3) the lasting effects of motivational climate have not yet been established. The purpose of this study was to identify whether a task- or ego-involved motivational climate is more effective for skill acquisition and retention, while also examining the effects of motivational climate on various psychological variables. It was hypothesized that a task-involved climate would lead to better problem-solving task learning as well as greater task enjoyment, greater task self-efficacy, and less task stress, shame, and self-consciousness. Undergraduate students (n = 176) from accredited institutions across the Southeastern United States completed an online survey at two time points including a demographics questionnaire, four problem-solving tasks, and measures of task self-efficacy, enjoyment, stress, shame, and self, consciousness. A multivariate analysis of variance was conducted to assess the effectiveness of the manipulation. Results revealed a significant group difference in perceptions of motivational climate. Repeated measures analyses of variance were conducted to assess group differences in each of the variables in question. Results revealed no signficiant group differences in any of the variables, but time emerged as a significant main effect. Accordingly, researchers should continue to explore the role of timing as well as the potential enduring effects of motivational climate.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Seagrasses meadows are extremely productive ecosystems that serve as habitats for a wide variety of species. These foundation species also perform important ecosystem services such as nutrient cycling, stabilizing sediments, and carbon sequestration. While these valuable species are themselves well studied, very little is known about the microbial communities on their blade surfaces, also known as the phyllosphere, and how these phyllosphere communities relate back to the seagrass host. This research combines field and experimental studies to address this gap in knowledge of seagrass ecology using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. An initial study documented the microbial communities associated with the tropical seagrass Thalassia testudinum at five sites along an offshore transect in the northern Gulf of Mexico. The phyllosphere was found to host rich and diverse microbial communities that were distinct from the communities of the surrounding water column. These communities were highly variable over relatively small spatial and temporal scales. Phyllosphere microbial community composition also correlated with environmental conditions, including water depth and temperature, and host characteristics, including above-ground growth rates and blade nutrient composition, indicating both may be potential drivers of microbial community structure. Building upon these results, a novel reciprocal transplant study conducted in the Indian River Lagoon showed that surrounding environmental conditions have a large influence on phyllosphere microbial communities, as community composition showed significant effects of transplant site despite the source of the shoots. Results from this study also showed that these communities have the ability to respond relatively quickly (30 days) to changes in environmental conditions. Lastly, an aquaria experiment showed that both increased water temperatures and decreased light availability have significant effects on seagrass phyllosphere community composition and that these changes were associated with specific microbial groups, especially at higher taxonomic levels. This study is the first to link environmental stressors for the seagrass host with phyllosphere microbial community composition in an experimental setting. This research provides new insights and understanding of the processes that influence the structure of seagrass phyllosphere communities and serves as a foundation for further studies to investigate how these microbial communities relate back to their seagrass host, and their role as a part of the seagrass holobiont. This research can help our understanding of processes that many control seagrass health during a time of global decline in seagrass coverage caused by rising anthropogenic influence.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to investigate the use of songs in Spanish by music therapists according to song suggestions within music therapy Facebook groups. A content analysis of 84 posts and 487 comments from two music therapy Facebook groups was completed. A total of 304 songs in Spanish, 75 artists, 23 genres, and 32 resources were identified. Suggestions were aimed at a variety of age groups, and for hospital, hospice, and unspecified settings. Music therapy professionals are using and looking for suggestions of music in Spanish to use with their Spanish-speaking clients. Further research is needed to develop repertoire lists aimed at Spanish-speaking clients to assist music therapy professionals and students working with these populations, as well as music therapists’  use of social media platforms for collaboration and sharing of information.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to explore gesture’s role in the perception of technique and expressivity in vocal music performance by both performers and evaluators. Specific questions addressed were: 1) Does the use of spontaneous co-temporal gesture affect performers’ perceptions of technique and expressivity in solo vocal performance? 2) Does the use of spontaneous co-temporal gesture affect evaluators’ perceptions of technique and expressivity in solo vocal performance? 3) Does presentation mode (audio vs. audiovisual) affect evaluators’ perceptions of technique and expressivity in solo vocal performance? </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Stimulus recordings were created that featured participant singers (N = 8) performing a short musical excerpt a cappella in two conditions: one with spontaneous, co-temporal hand and body gestures and another with no movement. Participant singers responded to a self-assessment inventory measuring their perceptions of technique and expressivity in both conditions. Singer participants also completed an open-ended survey that addressed their perceptions of how gesture impacts their singing, both in general and in reference to the research task.  Outside evaluators (N = 82) rated either audio-only (n = 40) or audiovisual (n = 42) stimuli taken from the first phase of the study based on their perceptions of technique and expressivity. Evaluators were purposefully not directed to attend to gesture or movement. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Statistical analysis revealed significant differences in perceptions of expressivity and technique for both participant singers and evaluators. Participant singers rated their gestured performances higher for both technique and expressivity.  Comments taken from the open-ended interview questions indicated performers felt that gesture assisted with phrase shape, articulation, dynamics, technical vocal faults, and alleviated some cognitive load during performance. Evaluators rated gestured performances as more expressive in both audio-only and audiovisual presentation modes (p &lt; .001), and although the mean score for technique was higher for the gestured condition, the difference was not statistically significant. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	While no significant main effect was found for presentation mode in the analyses of technique and expressivity, several interactions occurred. In the analysis of expressivity, performances with gestured were rated higher in the audiovisual presentation mode than audio-only performances.  Conversely, ungestured audiovisual performances had a lower mean rating than when in the audio-only mode. Also, while all performers were rated higher for technique in the gestured condition of audiovisual presentations, audio-only scores for the soprano and bass were higher for the ungestured condition. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Findings from the present study suggest that spontaneous, co-temporal hand gestures appear to have a positive impact on perceptions of expressivity in solo vocal performance by performers and observers. Future research might investigate whether spontaneous, co-temporal gestures positively impact perceptions of expressivity with singers of different ability levels, singers in small and large ensembles, and whether gesture may positively impact music performance with added cognitive load.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Nature has long been a container for the desires of humankind and the stories we tell about nature are stories that render it transparent and passive. In his book, We Are the Weather Jonathan Safran Foer’s examines how eating meat is destroying the planet. Although, Foer places the impetus for saving the planet largely on individuals with only surface level interrogations of the capitalistic machine driving our destruction, his claim that the stories we tell about climate change and ecological destruction matter is important. For too long we have told stories of a nature over there in the distance and outside of the human sphere. These stories give way to versions of nature that are transparent—easy to define—translatable, but this nature is nothing more than a fantasy propelled by the same ideologies that have structured a world based on varying forms of oppression and injustice including but not limited to gender, race, and class. This research focuses on the connections between nature fantasies and the idealization of nature in order to argue that the stories we tell about nature can no longer depend on notions of transparency. Using the theoretical works of Edouard Glissant, Timothy Morton, and Donna Haraway among others, I argue for a reorientation of ecocritical discussions in which issues of race, class, and gender are always a part of any critical engagement with the idea of nature. Using texts from authors like Nathaniel Hawthorne, Toni Morrison, and Jean Toomer, I trace connections between nature fantasies and transparency so as to emphasize that nature is always opaque. As such nature is enmeshed with material histories making transparent translations unattainable. These texts illustrate how opaquenatures reject the container that has been traditionally used to confine nature and instead, situate nature as part of the larger ecological thought which includes critical engagement with race, class, and gender. Turning toward popular culture texts like the music video “Bonfire” (2011) and the film Get Out (2017), I aim to show the terror that is a part of monolithic fantasies of nature. Transparency is a destructive agent and if the stories we tell matter, then the stories we tell about the natural must be opaque.

            <DISS_para>Students with multiple disabilities are taught in music classrooms throughout the United States, but many music educators have limited training in working with and assessing these students. The research showed that there is not a unified assessment tool in music therapy for this population. The purpose of this project was to develop an accessible online assessment for use by classroom music teachers and music therapists to assess students with multiple disabilities and their music development. An online assessment was developed using the GoogleForms platform that was formatted to display one question at a time and skip questions that surpass a students’ developmental level. The online assessment was created using research to assess the musical development of students with multiple disabilities. The assessment provides feedback that includes appropriate activities for each developmental level.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The legacy storage data path is largely structured in black-box layers and has four major limitations:  (1) functional redundancies across layers, (2) poor cross-layer coordination and data tracking, (3) presupposition of high-latency storage devices, and (4) poor support for new storage data models. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>We introduce Tags, a unifying primitive that can be used throughout the storage data path.  This white-box approach enables all storage layers to coordinate and track data using shared data structures that are constructed through the Tags API.  Our case studies show that by eliminating redundant services, our Tags-based key-value store can outperform LevelDB by 10-220% when inserting and deleting 100-byte key-value pairs.  We also built a Tags-based file system (TagFS) and differentiated storage services to demonstrate the usability, extensibility, and robustness of Tags.  In addition, we build per-file secure deletion via TagFS to show data-path-wide coordination and data tracking.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Project 1: ProDCoNN: Protein Design using a Convolutional Neural Network. Designing protein sequences that fold to a given three-dimensional (3D) structure has long been a challenging problem in computational structural biology with significant theoretical and practical implications. In this study, we first formulated this problem as predicting the residue type given the 3D structural environment around the C$_\alpha$ atom of a residue, which is repeated for each residue of a protein. We designed a nine-layer 3D  deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that takes as input a gridded box with the atomic coordinates and types around a residue. Several CNN layers were designed to capture structure information at different scales, such as bond lengths, bond angles, torsion angles, and secondary structures. Trained on a very large number of protein structures, the method, called ProDCoNN (Protein Design with Convolutional Neural Network), achieved state-of-the-art performance when tested on large numbers of test proteins and benchmark datasets. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Project 2: Protein-Ligand Docking using Reinforcement Learning. Protein-ligand docking is an important part of molecular docking, which aims to find the conformations and orientations within a given protein structure. This field has been extensively investigated, which resulted in successful applications in medicine designs. In this study, we propose a supervised learning algorithm based on a reinforcement learning method called Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic to address the protein-ligand docking problem. A three-dimensional gridded box, which contains protein environment, docking site and ligand, will be used as the training input. We design different convolutional neural networks for simulation studies, and then adopt these models to real experimental data.  With a large amount of proteins in training, the proposed model can reasonably search for the true docking site in the gridded box using only protein environment and ligand location.

The notion of statistical depth has been extensively studied in multivariate and functional data over the past few decades. In contrast, the depth on temporal point process is still under-explored. The problem is challenging because a point process has two types of randomness: 1) the number of events in a process, and 2) the distribution of these events given the number is known. Recent studies proposed depths in a weighted product of two terms, describing the above two types of randomness, respectively. In this project, we propose to unify these two randomnesses under one framework by a smoothing procedure. Basically, we transform the point process observations into functions using conventional kernel smoothing methods, and then adopt the well-known functional $h$-depth and its modified, center-based, version to describe the center-outward rank in the original data.  To do so, we define a proper metric on the point processes with smoothed functions.  We then propose an efficient algorithm to estimated the defined ``center''. We further explore the mathematical properties of the newly defined depths and study asymptotics. Simulation results show that the proposed depths can properly rank the point process observations. Finally, we demonstrate the new method in a classification task using a real neuronal spike train dataset.  </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Filter or screening methods are often used as a preprocessing step for reducing the number of variables used by a learning algorithm in obtaining a classification or regression model.While there are many such filter methods, there is a need for an objective evaluation of these methods. Such an evaluation is needed to compare them with each other and also to answer whether they are at all useful, or a  learning algorithm could do a better job without them.
For this purpose, many popular screening methods are partnered in this thesis with three regression learners and five classification learners and evaluated on ten real datasets to obtain accuracy criteria such as R-square and area under the ROC curve (AUC). 
The obtained results are compared through curve plots and comparison tables in order to find out whether screening methods help improve the performance of learning algorithms and how they fare with each other. 
Our findings revealed that the screening methods were useful in improving the prediction of the best learner on two regression and two classification datasets out of the ten datasets evaluated.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In present days, datasets not only have higher dimension and larger sample size, but also have some unique characteristics that need to be taken into consideration. Signal data of different types, website information data, and others only exist for a short period of time and methods that only focus on dealing with high dimension and large sample size are not adequate to handle this type of data. Therefore a considerable amount online feature selection methods were introduced to handle these kind of problems in recent years. Online screening methods are one of the categories of online feature selection methods. They are used to preprocess data that is too large for batch screening methods to handle or to handle data that comes in sequential order and disappears soon after being processed. Furthermore due to the useful properties of the criteria of some screening methods such as mutual information and Gini index, some online screening methods are often integrated into online learning algorithms. Most online screening methods are concentrated on classification problem. Our research study focuses on classification as well. Researches are conducted to investigate whether online screening methods can obtain identical results as their offline version or not. Several online screening methods were compared with their batch counterparts. Experiments were conducted on classification datasets with binary labels. Results are summarized in different comparison tables to confirm whether online methods can give the exact or very close feature scores as offline methods.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Shotcrete refers to the construction technique that concrete or mortar is conveyed through a hose and pneumatically projected onto substrate surfaces. Shotcrete is broadly used in civil engineering for rehabilitation of existing structures as well as new construction. However, shotcrete construction often suffers from inevitable rebound of aggregates and other placement problems, which may lead to low efficiency, material waste, poor construction quality, and work environment hazard. These placement problems are directly associated with the spray behavior of shotcrete, which are governed by the material properties, such the flowability and viscosity of the shotcrete mixture. The current research aims at fundamentally understanding the placement mechanism of wet-shotcrete, and the influence of various materials parameters on the placement and hardened properties of shotcrete by directly characterizing the spray behavior and correlating that to the final material placement.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In this study, a series of wet-mix shotcrete experiments is conducted. The full spray behavior of wet-mix shotcrete is characterized using a high-speed camera and image analysis technique. The placement and rebound, and qualitative hardened properties of shotcrete are also experimentally determined. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A correlation between the spray behavior and the placement and hardened properties of the shotcrete is then established. For the mortar droplet with larger size and higher velocity, it tends to be more easily deposited on the receiving surface, causes a higher placement and build-up thickness, less rebound and better compaction. With the material flowability increases, smaller droplets with lower velocities are generated during the spray process, correspondingly results in less in-place materials and higher rebound with lower build-up thickness and larger porosity. Similarly, while the material viscosity increases, larger droplets are produced, which leads to higher placement, less rebound and larger build-up thickness with smaller porosity. </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The therapeutic properties offered by venom-derived toxins have led to the development of many life-saving medications. As this medicinal library continues to grow, so does the need to fully understand these toxins and their potential targets, many of which remain unknown. Venom target identification hypotheses have previously been derived from trial-and-error methods based on known toxin families and symptoms exhibited by affected animals, and have generally been limited to single toxin-target pairs. Although honing in on toxin-target pairing is ultimately necessary in the venom-to-drug pipeline, current approaches have neglected the evolutionarily favored complex venom phenotype, leaving many potential targets undiscovered. The advantages of Drosophila genetics enable the identification of genetic (allele frequency) changes resulting from evolved resistance in comparison to a control population, narrowing down potential targets to a set of candidate genes that have responded to the strong selective pressure of venom. Partnered with the complete venom characterization of the giant Florida blue centipede, Scolopendra viridis, our experimental evolution approach to venom target identification brings molecular evolution and therapeutic discovery together to identify candidate toxin targets which can then be used in downstream analyses, leading to both drug development and a greater understanding of the coevolutionary dynamics of predator and prey. In Chapter 1, we performed a complete venom characterization of two individual S. viridis from North Florida using high-throughput transcriptomic and proteomic approaches. Because venom is known to be variable within and among species, and centipede speciation is largely based on morphology, we then compared our results to a previously published venom characterization of S. viridis from Mexico. In this comparison we found evidence of local adaptation, or possibly speciation, as the venoms from the two regions were distinct to each population. Because selection, and therefore evolution, requires trait variation to act, in Chapter 2, we first established variation in the trait of venom resistance by scoring 89 inbred lines of Drosophila melanogaster for this trait. We then experimentally evolved venom resistance to S. viridis venom in multiple replicates of a genetically mixed D. melanogaster population. After 18 months of selection, we sequenced all experimentally evolved (venom-injected) and control (both PBS-injected and non-injected) replicates, and compared allele frequency differences between the two groups at two time points (middle and end) throughout selection. Using this data, we were able to identify genes of interest by their significance in two independent tests for allele frequency differences, partnered with their presence among genes with significantly enriched protein domains. However, results of experimental evolution studies are often noisy, and it can be difficult to distinguish true positives (i.e. alleles that have changed in frequency as a result of selection) from false positives (i.e. alleles that have changed in frequency as a result of drift or other environmental selection pressures), despite imposing stringent criteria. To assist in validation of true positives, in Chapter 3, we performed a full genome wide association study (GWAS) by scoring 192 inbred fly lines for the trait of venom resistance and used quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping to identify genomic regions associated with venom resistance. Genomic regions identified in both experimental evolution and GWAS data sets will have a higher probability of being true positives and therefore genes located within these regions are more likely to be venom targets. Additionally, in both Chapter 2 and Chapter 3, we identified human disease-associated orthologs of our candidate genes to illustrate their potential as therapeutic targets of venom-derived drugs. Among the candidate genes identified using our experimental evolution and GWAS approaches, we found several that would be expected based on the known toxins within the venom. We also found several unexpected targets implicated in a range of human diseases including neurological disorders such as autism and Alzheimer's disease, multiple cancer types, and diseases of sensory systems including vision and auditory. Our results provide strong evidence that, as predicted, our current toxin-target identification methods have limited our ability in exploiting the full therapeutic potential of venoms and more robust methods using whole-venom, whole-animal systems should be considered.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of post-performance conductor behaviors (excellent versus poor) on perceived ensemble performance quality and conductor competence. This study also examined the extent to which the effects of post-performance stage behaviors were consistent among male and female conductors. Additionally, the researcher investigated what participants noticed about the ensemble performances and conductor performances, as well as the justifications participants used when assigning their ratings. The participants for this study were collegiate musicians (N = 202). All participants watched two videos, one with excellent post-performance conductor behaviors and one with poor post-performance conductor behaviors. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two conductor gender groups. In the first group, participants viewed a male conductor in the two videos, whereas in the second group, there was a female conductor in both videos. Participants in both groups were randomly assigned to one of two presentation orders. 
	Although the visual aspects of each video were different, all videos had the same audio—the last 30 seconds of the third movement (Rondo) from Robert Jager’s Third Suite performed by a high school concert band. In each video, the participants saw each conductor conduct the last 30 seconds of the piece and demonstrate either poor or excellent post-performance stage behaviors. After watching both videos, participants were asked to rate different aspects of the ensemble’s performance quality (i.e., accuracy, expressivity, and overall music performance), rate the conductor’s competence, and answer free response questions regarding their justifications for assigning ratings and what they observed in the performance.
	The post-performance conductor behaviors displayed in the videos had a significant effect on participants’ ratings of music performance quality, Pillai’s trace = .118, F(3, 196) = 8.741, p &lt; .001, η2p = .118, and there was also a significant interaction between post-performance conductor behavior and order, Pillai’s trace = .180, F(3, 196) = 14.387, p &lt; .001, η2p = .180. To further examine how post-performance conductor behaviors influenced listeners’ perceptions, participants were asked which recording they believed had better performance quality. Results of a chi-square test revealed a significant difference between their preferences, χ2(2, N = 202) = 38.327, p &lt; .001, Cramér’s V = .308, with participants preferring the video in which the conductor displayed excellent post-performance behaviors. 
	Additionally, post-performance conductor behaviors also affected participants’ ratings of conductor competence, F(1, 198) = 223.322 , p &lt; .001, η2p = .530. Conductors with excellent post-performance stage behaviors were rated as being significantly more competent than directors who exhibited poor post-performance behaviors. Again, a chi-square test was conducted to determine which video participants thought the conductor seemed most competent. The results of the chi-square test revealed a significant difference, χ2(2, N = 202) = 208.198, p &lt; .001, Cramér’s V = .717, with participants preferring the video where the conductor displayed excellent post-performance stage behaviors.
	No significant differences in participants’ ratings of ensemble performance quality or conductor competence were found as a function of conductor gender. The finding that there were no significant differences in the performance ratings of male and female conductors is encouraging for the field of music. However, participants’ open-ended responses regarding the poor post-performance conductor behaviors were different for each conductor. Although some of the comments about the male conductor included degrading vocabulary, the most denigrating comments about the female conductor were her being called “rude” and “unprofessional” in response to the poor post-performance behaviors. It is important for researchers to continue to examine how male and female conductors may be judged differently on various aspects (e.g., leadership, conducting, and teaching effectiveness) on the basis of gender. Implications for music educators and suggestions for future research are discussed.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The pressure behavior of the actinides, like the rest of the chemistry of the actinides, is not well studied or understood. Chapter 1 gives a brief description of the prior work that has gone into studying the pressure behavior of the actinides.  A short description of the much more expansive research into the pressure behavior of the lanthanides is also given as a comparison to the work on the actinides.  Chapter 2 is unique in that no lanthanides are involved, and instead focuses on the specific case of Cs2UO2Cl4 and how the uranyl bond is affected by pressure.  A previous computational prediction of the pressure behavior is contradicted by the experimental evidence.  Chapters 3, 4, and 5 discuss the impact of two different ligand systems on the trivalent actinide series: a soft dithiocarbamate ligand and a hard mellitate ligand.  Through examining the UV Vis NIR absorption and luminescence spectra the role of the 4f orbitals of the lanthanides and the 5f of the actinides in bonding is probed under pressure.  Both the softness of the ligand and metal are shown to be important in the type and magnitude of effects seen.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>	Chapter 6 analyses three lanthanide compounds under pressure crystallographically and spectroscopically lays the groundwork for analysis of the actinides in the same system.  The 2,2 dihydroxymesoxalate ligand is used for its uniform crystallization across the trivalent lanthanides and the trivalent actinides that have been produced, as well as its high symmetry to assist in high pressure crystallography.  Chapter 7 is also a structural analysis using Raman spectroscopy on several lanthanides with the thiocyanate ligand, as well as the curium thiocyanate.  The C=N stretching frequency is examined as a function of pressure, revealing the extent of backbonding in these systems.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Fused deposition modeling (FDM) is a cost-effective way of flexibly producing a high variety of 3D structures. However, the deposition non-uniformity or variation in the FDM process leads to dimensional errors and quality problems such as infill defects and non-uniform material distribution. It is essential to calibrate a printer, aiming to adjust its printing setup such as G-code that controls extruders’ kinematics to compensate for the errors due to deposition non-uniformity. Such a calibration process requires extensive experiments to collect data and thereby estimate the relationship between the printers’ setup and printing quality. This thesis research explores the use of multiple inter-connected printers that can exchange and share quality data to co-learn quality problems to expedite the printer calibration process and reduce ramp-up time. State-of-the-art research focuses on shape error compensation and between-printer transfer learning to leverage knowledge from data-rich printer to data-lacking printer. Very limited research has been developed to address the multi-printer co-learning problem that concerns with fusing the information from many data-lacking printers for in-process quality control. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The proposed work in this thesis includes (1) validation of between-printer similarity patterns to justify the multi-printer co-learning, (2) estimation of non-uniformity of material deposition induced by extruders’ kinematics to capture the between-printer relatedness for co-learning, (3) development of the co-learning of material deposition quality for a pair of data-lacking printers and study the applicability conditions, and (4) extension of the co-learning algorithms to multiple data-lacking printers for improved prediction printing errors. The success of this research establishes the theoretical grounds to support reconfigurable additive manufacturing systems and cost-effective mass personalization deployed on a cloud platform that can responsively cope with high product variety. In addition, the broader impact of the study can also be expected to lower the entry barrier for new manufacturers by leveraging online data.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Inconsistent evidence suggests that pediatric ADHD may be associated with impairments in the ability to use context clues to infer the emotion states of others. However, the evidence base for these impairments is comprised of data from laboratory-based tests of emotion processing that may be confounded by demands on non-affective cognitive processes that have been linked with ADHD. The current study addressed this limitation and also investigated a potential mechanism underlying children’s ability to infer emotion state from context clues using a fully-crossed, counterbalanced experimental design that systematically manipulated emotion processing and working memory demands in 77 carefully-phenotyped children ages 8-13 (Mage=10.46, SD=1.54; 66% Caucasian/Non-Hispanic; 42% female) with ADHD (n=42) and without ADHD (n=35). Results of Bayesian mixed-model ANOVAs indicated that using context clues to infer the emotion state of others competed for neurocognitive resources with the processes involved in rehearsing/maintaining information within working memory (BF10=1.57x1019, d=0.72). Importantly, there was significant evidence against the critical group x condition interaction for response times (BF01 = 4.93), and no significant evidence for this interaction for accuracy (BF01 = 2.40). In other words, children with ADHD do not infer emotions more slowly than children without ADHD (d=0.13), and their small magnitude impairment in accuracy (d=0.30) was attributable to their generally less accurate performance on choice-response tasks (i.e., across both emotion and control conditions). Taken together, the evidence indicates that emotion processing abilities are likely unimpaired in pediatric ADHD and that working memory is implicated in the ability to infer emotion from context for all children – not just children with ADHD.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Research on leadership pedagogy has predominately presented the how in the practice of teaching, focused on the application of leadership theories without regard for social location, power, or considerations to disrupt the status quo.  This can result in leadership educators ignoring the pervasive whiteness in leadership education that reinforces imbalanced social systems and stifles individual and collective agency.  Minimal studies capture the perpetuation or disruption of whiteness in leadership education, contributing to the on-going racist ideologies present in leadership learning programs.  By engaging in the analysis of whiteness and white supremacy, leadership educators can disrupt the assumptions that exist, identify how racism operates in this context, and raise new questions for their practices in teaching.  Utilizing critical race theory, this critical discourse analysis study examined the ways whiteness dominates the discourse in leadership learning to advance liberatory pedagogy.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Many ecosystems depend on fire to maintain appropriate habitats and to trigger important life history events, such as flowering or seed germination. Historically, fires were often patchy, but due to fire suppression and other human actions, burns have become more homogenous. However, heterogeneity in fire may be important for both plant reproduction and pollinators. We created small protected patches within prescribed fires in a longleaf pine savanna and then measured co-flowering community and floral abundance in both burned and protected plots. Co-flowering community and floral abundance were both significantly different between treatments, with significantly more flowers blooming in burned plots. Flowering phenology also showed marginally non-significant differences between treatments, with phenological events occurring slightly later in burned plots. Fire appears to be important for stimulating flowering and increases the amount of floral resources available to pollinators. However, unburned patches might help extend the flowering season, and could provide other benefits for the animals that rely on floral and seed resources.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The purpose of this study was to investigate the extent to which articles in four music therapy journals with more than 30 volumes published discussed the use of trauma- focused music therapy with trauma survivors. A content analysis of 16 articles was completed. Topics explored were (a) music therapy interventions used, (b) the number of clients in each group, (c) the types of trauma clients had experienced, and (d) which articles defined trauma and how. Of the 16 articles published, 8 were case studies or anecdotal case reports. Scholars most frequently published about trauma experienced in childhood (n=9), and that a combination of multiple music therapy interventions was most often used with clients, improvisation being the most common intervention cited. Further research is needed on trauma- focused music therapy interventions as there is limited research on this topic.   </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>For the last 50 years, scholars have studied and contested the definitions and impacts of gentrification and displacement and its relation to individual, market, and government interventions. Central to these debates are questions of who bears the cost and who reaps the benefits of neighborhood change and the differential impacts on long-term and new residents. Although displacement is a central concern of gentrification, it is not a phenomenon that is distinct to gentrification. According to Peter Marcuse, there are four forms of displacement. For this dissertation, we will focus on the pressure of displacement, which is the combination of subjective fear of the possibility of displacement and what is occurring in the neighborhood (e.g., increases in rent and property taxes). As municipalities move towards redevelopment projects that center urban greening, it is important we examine the impact of this strategy with an equity lens on the pressure of displacement. The introduction of green spaces, such as parks and trails, is often discussed within the context of its benefits for the ecosystem and public health, but redevelopment centered on producing new environmental amenities such as green space, parks, trails, and alternative modes of transportation can also inflate the desirability of previously disinvested neighborhoods. Earlier studies have made significant contributions to our understanding of how economically disadvantaged neighborhoods are associated with poorer sleep quality. However, none of these studies considered how neighborhood improvement efforts could also have an impact on sleep.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation used a structural racism lens to develop a displacement risk index that reflects the sociopolitical and historical factors that impact residential displacement. The displacement risk index identified neighborhoods that have a concentration of residents who are most susceptible to residential displacement, measures demographic and housing market changes over time, and classifies the neighborhood’s risk from low to high risk of displacement by combining two indexes: vulnerability index and housing market index. I used these results to identify a set of control census block groups similar to the census block groups characterized as high risk of displacement in all aspects other than the Atlanta BeltLine. I employed robust regression models on survey data to investigate the effects of social and environmental stressors associated (i.e., everyday discrimination, heightened vigilance, housing inaffordability, and financial strain) with green redevelopment on sleep quality among African-American adults. I performed direct and conventional content analysis on interview data to explore participants’ perceptions. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>My regression models revealed that the independent effect of everyday discrimination, heightened vigilance, housing inaffordability on subjective sleep quality is the same for cases and controls, controlling for other factors. The effect of financial strain on subjective sleep quality is different for cases and controls with cases having a poorer sleep quality, controlling for other factors. The combined effect of these social and environmental stressors showed that everyday discrimination and financial strain on subjective sleep quality persists. When case and control participants were prompted with interview questions on their perceptions of their neighborhood, its changes, and the impacts of these changes, there were three major themes that emerged: (1) neighborhood history and sense of community are important to case participants, (2) neighborhood changes are not benefiting people of color, and (3) white and black vigilance, financial strain, and housing inaffordability are factors influencing the pressure of displacement. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The findings of this dissertation improve our understanding of the factors contributing to the susceptibility of current residents to residential displacement and the impact of social and environmental stressors on sleep quality among African-American adults. Planners can use the displacement risk index, in combination with their tools, to better understand the vulnerability of populations to displacement in an effort to provide policy and plan recommendations that may limit residential displacement. Employing a structural approach to social justice and equity, could assist us in understanding the impacts of green redevelopment projects that are using federal and local policies and economic development tools to protect white privilege. In this area of research, it would be important to carry out prospective studies that can examine the temporal order of neighborhood changes, social and environmental stressors, sleep quality, and other chronic health outcomes. A greater understanding of the temporal ordering of these associations will have implications for city planning and public health strategies that are focused on creating healthier and more equitable communities.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This dissertation project, “Museums of the Mind: The Ekphrastic Imagination in the African American Literary Tradition,” at its core is a project of redress and reclamation that seeks to uncover the connection between the non-inclusive spaces of museums, galleries, lyceums, menageries, and exhibition halls in which black artists find themselves working and the creativity with which writers sympathetic to the difficulties encountered by visual artists confront this reality in their ekphrastic work.  It explores the relationship between early antebellum moments of cognitive estrangement, wonder, and jubilation when black subjects are confronted with pictorial and other plastic arts in the Americas and the development of a painterly ekphrastic aesthetic in literature, which exists in a loving antagonism with traditional museum culture and emerging media technologies.  This dissertation project argues that African American writers revise and extend traditional ekphrasis in order to create spectral art spaces to hang their imagined artworks. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>	The first chapter serves as an introduction to nuclear science.  Nuclear weapons are briefly discussed, but more focus is given to the intricacies of fission and traditional nuclear reactors. In order to better understand nuclear waste, a comprehensive guide to radioactive decay is presented.  During this section, there is an emphasis on how each decay mode interacts and affects matter. This is especially important for anyone handling radioactive material so that the related dangers and principles of shielding can be better understood.  Additionally, a short introduction to nuclear waste is presented, leading into the focus of Chapter 2.	The second chapter follows research into whether the complexation between radionuclides and methylene diphosphonic acid (MDPA) can serve as a reliable nuclear waste form.  In this section, nuclear waste repositories are discussed in more detail.  Some common ways to simulate radiation damage in materials is covered; however, almost all of this subsection focuses on doping experiments.  Monazite is briefly discussed, due to its similarity with MDPA and its favorable properties for radiation stability.  Additionally, hydrothermal techniques are described, as they are the primary synthesis technique used with this research.
	Over the span of 281 days, powder x-ray patterns were collected for the 239PuMDPA complex (t1/2: 24,110 yr) in order to track crystallinity and any phase transitions.  During this period, no clear decline was seen in the crystallinity, indicating the complex’s durability over time in the presence of low-level alpha decay.  The emergence and disappearance of intense x-ray diffraction peaks could indicate the formation of crystal defects and subsequent α-annealing. The stability of the crystals under extreme pressures was studied using a diamond anvil cell.  Up to pressures of 4.48 GPa, the crystals remain completely stable, indicating that in a geologic repository, this waste form should remain stable due to the pressures present.  Beyond 6.19 GPa, a phase transition within the crystal structure might occur.  Future experiments using Raman spectroscopy should be performed to verify the presence of a phase transition.  It was found that thermal annealing of the 239PuMDPA samples led to a loss of long-range order; however, the MDPA ligand remains undamaged.  While the sample remains crystalline, its ability to immobilize radionuclides could be diminished.  </DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Introduction:  Heat stress is responsible for increases in all-cause mortality and results in thousands of deaths globally each year.  These deaths occur both through active means (e.g. exertional heat stroke) and passive means (e.g. heat waves causing regional draughts and famines, or individuals experiencing dehydration and the inability to cool themselves).  One such nutritional strategy for the management of heat stress, which has been demonstrated to be effective in cell culture and animal models, is the consumption of betaine. Betaine is an amino acid derivative found naturally in the food supply, primarily in wheat products, spinach, and shrimp.  However, these foods are typically consumed in an insufficient dose to result in improved heat tolerance.  Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of preloaded betaine on fluid balance and heat tolerance in recreationally active young men.   Methodology:  In a crossover design, betaine (50 mg·kg-1, twice daily) or a rice flour placebo (50 mg·kg-1, twice daily) was consumed for 7 days. On day 7, each participant completed 60 min of  passive heat stress (sitting at 40 °C, 60% RH), followed by 30 min of passive recovery in a thermoneutral room (sitting at 22 °C, 52% RH).  Markers of hydration (i.e., intracellular fluid (ICF), extracellular fluid (ECF), total body water (TBW), plasma osmolality, and plasma volume) and heat tolerance (core and skin temperatures, metabolic heat production, thermal sensation, sweat rate, heat shock protein (HSP) 70 concentration, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) concentration) were the primary outcome variables.  Results: After 7 days of loading, betaine supplementation did not result in significantly greater volumes of ICF (p=0.385), ECF (p=0.493), or TBW (p=0.626).  Further, plasma volume (p=0.590) and sweat rate (p=0.742) in the heat were not significantly different than placebo.  Likewise, core temperature (p=0.618), skin temperature (p=0.664), metabolic heat production (p=0.800), plasma LPS (p=0.383), and serum HSP70 (p=0.103) were not significantly different than placebo.  However, when measured on a visual analog scale, participants supplementing with the placebo experienced a significant increase in perceived measures of thirst pre- and post- heat exposure (PRE: 21.41 ± 14.85 mm, POST: 34.36 ± 18.49 mm; p=0.019), whereas participants supplementing with betaine were able to maintain lower, pre-heat levels of thirst (PRE: 19.36 ± 18.75 mm, POST: 25.73 ± 18.53 mm; p=0.079).    Discussion:  In the present study, using passive heat stress, betaine failed to improve many physiological markers of hydration status or heat tolerance.  As such, there is insufficient evidence to date, to recommend supplementing with betaine as a means of improving hydration status or heat tolerance for those suffering from heat stress.  This study was supported by a grant from NOW Foods, Inc.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Extant research suggests that safety behaviors (SBs) may be relevant to the development and maintenance of anxiety and obsessive-compulsive psychopathology; yet, their contribution to other forms of psychopathology, such as disorders of body image and appearance, has been relatively understudied. The proposed project aimed to extend upon previous research efforts by exploring the experimental effects of reducing the use of appearance-related SBs on subsequent appearance concerns and related symptoms. Specifically, this study examined the effects of SB fading over a two-week manipulation period in undergraduate female students with elevated appearance concerns (64.0% of whom met criteria for a psychiatric disorder involving social evaluative concerns relevant to appearance). Study variables of interest (e.g., body dysmorphic disorder [BDD] symptoms, social anxiety symptoms, body dissatisfaction) were assessed at the baseline, mid-manipulation, post-manipulation, and 2-week follow-up assessments. Compared to a no instructions control group, the SB fading group exhibited significantly lower BDD symptoms, social anxiety symptoms, body dissatisfaction, and maladaptive cognitions beliefs about appearance at the post and follow-up assessments. They also showed less reactivity to an in vivo appearance-related stressor.  Exploratory analyses revealed that beliefs about appearance and SB use at the post-assessment each mediated the effects of condition on BDD symptoms at post. Furthermore, baseline BDD and social anxiety symptom severity separately moderated the relationship between condition and respective post-assessment symptom severity, such that SB fading had stronger effects on BDD and social anxiety symptoms among those high in baseline BDD and social anxiety symptoms, respectively. This study betters our understanding the role of SBs in BDD and other disorders characterized by body image disturbances and provides preliminary evidence for the potential clinical utility of decreasing appearance-related SBs.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Engineered waste containment facilities like municipal solid waste (MSW) and hazardous waste landfills employ a liner system consisting of materials with low hydraulic conductivity to mitigate the seepage of toxic contaminants into the underlying groundwater. Geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) are factory-manufactured clay products consisting of a thin layer of granular or powdered sodium bentonite glued to a geomembrane or sandwiched between two geotextiles. GCLs are widely used as hydraulic barriers mainly because they are easy to install. In the absence of a geomembrane, the hydraulic performance of conventional GCLs is primarily controlled by swelling of the bentonite. However, leachates from containment facilities like municipal solid waste incineration (MSW-I) ash landfills, coal ash, and mine tailing impoundments usually contain elevated concentrations of inorganic salts and polyvalent cations which are detrimental to the performance of conventional GCLs as effective hydraulic barrier.To expand the use of GCLs for aggressive leachate applications, manufacturers have developed polymer-modified bentonite (PMB) GCLs containing bentonite dry blended or treated with proprietary polymer(s). To date, only a limited number of studies have been performed on PMB GCLs. The focused of these studies have been on the compatibility of PMB GCLs with coal combustion product leachates, mining waste leachates, and low-level radioactive waste leachates However, limited data exists on the compatibility of PMB GCLs with MSW-I ash leachates, and the mechanism controlling the hydraulic performance of PMB GCL is also not well understood. Furthermore, traditional methods and criteria for assessing the hydraulic performance of conventional GCLs cannot be directly applied to PMB GCLs. Hence, the primary goal of this dissertation was to mechanistically understand how aggressive leachates like MSW-I ash leachates affect the hydraulic performance of PMB GCLs and develop alternative methods and criteria to adequately assess and predict their long-term performance.
To achieve this goal, eight PMB GCLs were collected from two major manufacturers. The PMB GCLs contained a dry blend of granular bentonite and proprietary polymer(s) capsulated between two geotextiles with needle-punched fibers. Though the specific polymer(s) used in the PMB GCL was (were) not disclosed by the manufacturers, the polymers were broadly characterized as either linear polymer or crosslinked polymer based on the distinct swelling characteristics of specimens extracted from the GCLs. Linear polymers are water-soluble and have a unique ability to disperse and swell in water to form a viscous polymer gel. In contrast, crosslinked polymers are not soluble in water but are capable of imbibing large amount of water to form discrete polymer hydrogels. Consequently, bentonite extracted from the PMB GCLs containing linear polymer (LPB GCLs) formed a viscous polymer-bentonite gel when hydrated, whereas bentonite from the PMB GCLs containing crosslinked polymer (CPB GCLs) formed a non-viscous bentonite gel with randomly distributed discrete polymer hydrogels. The initial polymer loading (content) of each PMB GCL was estimated using the average mass loss on ignition (at 550 ⁰C) of multiple specimens extracted from the GCL and ranged from 0.5% – 5.5%. As a control, two conventional bentonite (CB) GCLs (one from each manufacturer) were also collected from the manufacturers. The CB GCLs contained the same untreated bentonite as the bentonite used to manufacture the PMB GCLs. Five synthetic leachates representative of leachates from landfills where MSW-I ash is either disposed alone or co-disposed with regular MSW were created. The synthetic MSW-I ash leachates with ionic strength (I) ranging from 174 mM to 1978 mM. A series of hydraulic conductivity and index tests were then conducted on the PMB and CB GCLs using the synthetic MSW-I ash leachates and DI water as reference solution. The hydraulic conductivity tests were performed with an average effective stress of 27 – 39 kPa.
The results of the study showed that PMB GCLs have improved hydraulic performance as compared to CB GCLs when permeated with the MSW-I ash leachates. For instance, the PMB GCLs had hydraulic conductivity &lt; 1.0 × 10-10 m/s when permeated with the MSW-I ash leachate with ionic strength of 174 mM, whereas the CB GCLs had hydraulic conductivity &gt; 5.0 × 10-8 m/s when permeated with the same leachate. However, the PMB GCLs had high hydraulic conductivity &gt; 3.0 × 10-10 m/s when permeated with MSW-I ash leachate with ionic strength &gt; 600 mM. Regardless of the polymer type, PMB GCLs with higher polymer loading had a relatively lower hydraulic conductivity when permeated with the same. However, at similar polymer loading, the LPB GCLs had lower hydraulic conductivity than the CPB GCLs when permeated with the same MSW-I ash leachate.
Swell index (SI) tests were also performed on bentonite extracted from the GCLs to qualitatively assess the effect of polymer additives on the chemical resistance and swelling of bentonite. Results of SI tests indicated that polymer additives improved the chemical resistance and swelling of bentonite in MSW-I ash leachate. The swell indices of the PMB GCLs with higher polymer loading were consistently higher than those of the PMB GCLs with lower polymer loading regardless of the polymer type. Contrary to previous observations made on the relationship between swell index (SI) and hydraulic conductivity of PMB GCLs, a stronger correlation was found between SI and hydraulic conductivity of PMB GCLs when the PMB specimens used for the SI tests were not subjected to any form of crushing and sieving. This is because polymer is separated from the composite material when bentonite-polymer composites are crushed and sieved following the specifications in the ASTM D5890. For the PMB GCLs used in this study, SI &gt; 20 mL/2 g corresponded to hydraulic conductivity &lt; 1.0 × 10-10 m/s, whereas SI &lt; 14 mL/2 g corresponded to hydraulic conductivity &gt; 1.0 × 10-10 m/s. 
When CPB GCLs are hydrated and permeated with MSW-I leachate, the crosslinked polymers swell into discrete granules of hydrogels that physically clogs the pore spaces between the bentonite granules in the GCL which would otherwise be responsible for conducting flow and cause high hydraulic conductivity in CB GCLs. This intergranular pore blockage by the crosslinked polymer hydrogels results in a relatively lower hydraulic conductivity than CB GCLs. However, the improved hydraulic conductivity of LPB GCLs cannot be attributed to polymer blockage mechanism because, unlike crosslinked polymers, linear polymers are water-soluble, therefore, they can easily migrate with the leachate during permeation. 
The mass of polymer that eluted from the LPB GCLs was estimated using the total carbon concentration (TOC) in the effluents collected during permeation. The results of TOC analysis indicated that, linear polymer elutes from the LPB GCLs during permeation, regardless of the chemistry of the permeant solution (i.e. whether permeated with DI water or MSW-I ash leachate).  However, the rate at which polymer elutes and the effect polymer elution has on the final hydraulic conductivity of LPB GCLs depends on the concentration and valence of the dominant cation in permeant solution. The rate at which polymer elutes increases with the cation valance and concentration of the dominant cation in the permeant solution. There was no correlation between the final hydraulic conductivity of LPB GCLs and the mass of polymer retained in the GCL. Hence, the same LPB GCL can have different hydraulic conductivities even when the same amount of polymer is retained in the GCL.
Free swell tests coupled with chemical analysis suggest that, the improved chemical compatibility of LPB GCLs can be attributed to the ability of linear polymers to scavenge cations from the solution which allows the bentonite to undergo osmotic swelling during the initial hydration period. Analogous to the mechanism that controls the hydraulic conductivity of CB GCLs prehydrated with water, the dispersed structure of the bentonite fabric and water molecules adsorbed on the bentonite particles during osmotic swelling controls the long-term hydraulic conductivity of LPB GCLs (even after the polymer is eluted).
Results of this study also indicate that, due to the mobility the linear polymer gel, hydraulic conductivity testing of a PMB GCL should not be terminated until the ratio of effluent and influent TOC concentration is at least 1.25 or lower (i.e. TOCout/TOCin ≤ 1.25) in addition to the termination criteria specified by the current ASTM D6766, in order to adequately assess the long-term hydraulic performance of the PMB GCL. The time required to achieve this new TOC criterion varies depends on the chemistry of the permeant solution. The results of duplicate hydraulic conductivity tests show that high hydraulic gradient (&gt;500) can be used to shorten the test duration. Hydraulic gradient only increases the rate at which polymer elutes but does not have any impact of final hydraulic conductivity of PMB GCLs.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>	The error-related negativity (ERN) is an event-related potential component related to risk for anxious and obsessive-compulsive pathologies. Self-reported clinical perfectionism and the ERN may represent multimodal indices of an underlying transdiagnostic mechanism related to risk for psychopathology. The current study sought to investigate whether a novel, web-based intervention (Treating the ERN; TERN) that targets excessive concern over mistakes using a cognitive-behavioral therapy framework leads to reductions in ERN amplitude that can be maintained over the course of one week, and whether these reductions are associated with decreases in self-reported perfectionism. The sample consisted of 15 undergraduate students selected for reporting high levels of perfectionism on the Fear of Mistakes subscale of the Frost Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (FMPS-FM). Participants were randomized to either the active condition (TERN) or a matched control condition (PHET). Participants completed an arrowhead version of the Flankers task to elicit the ERN and completed the FMPS-FM at baseline, post-intervention, and one-week follow-up timepoints. Consistent with study hypotheses, TERN seemed to reduce symptoms of perfectionism relative to the control condition. Contrary to hypotheses, baseline perfectionism scores were not significantly correlated with the ERN, TERN did not significantly impact the ERN either immediately post-intervention or at the one-week follow-up, and changes in perfectionism were negatively correlated with changes in the ERN. However, baseline levels of ERN seemed to impact these relationships such that ERN was correlated with perfectionism scores at higher levels of baseline ERN, and TERN reduced the ERN in participants with high levels of baseline ERN relative to participants in the control condition. Due to the limited sample size, all findings should be interpreted with caution and future studies should seek to replicate and extend these effects.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>A medium voltage DC (MVDC) shipboard power system (SPS) architecture is a notional candidate design for future “all-electric” ships, as it is expected to increase power density and distribution efficiency. However, the lack of experience in proven MVDC technology has inherent risks of substantial delays during the development process of controllers is larger than the risk with AC system designs. Model based system engineering methods, specifically controller hardware in the loop simulations, provide powerful means to lower the risk of a control development cycle. The ability to incrementally increase the fidelity of the model during the development and integration of a controller towards a more accurate representations of the power system network in question is expected to reduce the frequency and severity of potential problems.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the early stages of the control development, a control developer’s main concern is to verify that algorithm implementation meets the functional requirements to satisfy the shipboard power system’s needs. Performance of the implementation is at this stage is of less concern. There may also be limited knowledge about the specific power system that eventually will communicate with the controller. Hence, initially a reduced fidelity model may suffice. As the development process progresses, the model fidelity will evolve to ever increasing fidelity and accuracy. Eventually, the model will have to include all the relevant details and execute in real time in order to test the controller’s real time performance before field deployment.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>A low-fidelity discrete event simulation first provides insight into the confidence of the algorithm’s ability to satisfy its functions by leveraging its faster than real time nature to perform more experiments than possible in real-time. Subsequently, using a low-fidelity real-time simulation, the developer could capture the elapsed time of characteristic events performed by the controller, characterizing both the algorithm’s functionality and performance with respect to wall-clock time. A first-order dynamic simulation contains a subset of the transient information in a real power system, where a developer can again test both functional and performance requirements in a more relevant environment. Finally, a high-fidelity real-time simulation is the closest model to the real world, permitting a developer to vet their implementation on the most relevant environment that is not a real power system. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In order to facilitate such progressive increase in fidelity and real-time capability, an adaptable signal interface between controller and model has been developed and tested. In particular, this thesis presents design criteria and requirements for such an interface focusing on the development of a fault management approach for a breakerless (unit based) MVDC system. Each model must capture the power system characteristics such as network connectivity, power flows, generator outputs, load demands, and electrical switch states, in a monotonic fashion. That is information gradually progresses from the low-fidelity discrete event simulation to the high-fidelity real-time simulation. Each power system model can be on a different operational hardware or run with a different software, requiring an adaptable signal interface to manage the flow of information from simulation environment to the controls. Such an interface must adapt to changing communication behaviors, signal descriptions, and simulator and controller endpoints. Experimental results validate the interface design and control development process. The thesis concludes that the proposed approach is feasible while acknowledging the additional work required to continually refine the process for a more generic use in the future.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Metal halide perovskites have received significant attention in the past decade as a promising class of material for energy harvesting, light emission and detection as well as various other solid-state devices. The easy solution processability, high defect tolerance, abundance of raw materials and exceptional optoelectronic properties have warranted intense investigation into their fundamental material physics and their device integration. Particularly, metal halide perovskite light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are thought to hold promise for next generation displays due to their narrow and tunable emission, high radiative efficiency and easy processability. For instance, red and green perovskite LEDs have now achieved the high external quantum efficiency required for commercial applications, on par with more mature lighting technologies such as organic LEDs and quantum dot LEDs. However, there are still several roadblocks that need to be overcome before perovskite LEDs can be considered a commercially viable technology. These challenges include, device stability, material toxicity, mass-production and development of efficient blue LEDs. The development of efficient blue LEDs is a major milestone in any display technology as it allows the production of multi-color images by combining the three primary colors red, green and blue (RGB). Similarly, the development of efficient white LEDs with excellent white light quality displaying high color rendering indices is also as important for solid-state lighting applications. In this dissertation, we explore two major themes related to the use of perovskites and perovskite related metal halide hybrids in light-emitting applications. The first and the broader work involves the study of various strategies to enable the realization of efficient blue perovskite LEDs. Three of the main challenges in obtaining efficient blue perovskite LEDs have been identified as band gap and emission tuning, poor radiative efficiency of perovskite blue emitters and charge carrier imbalance that results in suboptimal device performance. These issues are addressed in the first theme of this dissertation by introducing effective band gap and emission tuning strategies, improving radiative efficiency of blue perovskite emitters through trap passivation and engineering the energy band edges of perovskite thin films to obtain favorable band alignment and enhanced charge balance.
In this theme, two methods are presented in chapter 2 and 3 to achieve band gap and emission control while ensuring spectral stability. These include the synthesis of perovskite hollow nanocrystals and phase control of perovskite multiple quantum well thin films. Perovskite hollow nanocrystals are shown to enable band gap and emission tuning through the formation of a hollow 3D crystal structure and quantum confinement. Reduced grain boundaries and passivation of surface trap sites in these nanocrystalline thin films are also shown to result in high radiative efficiencies. Although the formation of perovskite quantum wells has been shown to be an effective strategy to control the band gap and emission, the crystallization of multiple quantum well phases during thin film formation and fast energy funneling across phases has limited the application of perovskite quantum wells in color tunable and blue LEDs. In chapter 3, we show the addition of diammonium salts enables phase control in perovskite multiple quantum well thin films, resulting in color tunable emission. The presence of diammonium salts was also found to increase radiative efficiency enabling the fabrication of pure blue perovskite LEDs with good efficiency. Finally, energy band edge control of quasi-2D perovskites is also presented as a viable solution to charge injection barriers that appear due to unfavorable band alignment in blue perovskite LEDs. By modifying the dipole moment of organic spacer cations in quasi-2D perovskites through the addition of electron donating or withdrawing substituent groups, rational band edge control is achieved which enables improved blue LED performance due to enhanced charge balance. 
In the second theme of this dissertation, the use of low-dimensional metal halide hybrids in broadband white LEDs for high color quality applications is shown. The broadband emission spectra of low-dimensional metal halide hybrids are shown to be ideal for white light applications that require full spectrum coverage and high color rendering. The dissertation concludes by presenting a few exciting routes that could be explored to further improve the performance of blue and white LEDs based on perovskites and perovskite related materials. The work presented in this dissertation contributes to the field of perovskite LEDs by exploring the structure-processing-property-performance phase space and providing alternative routes to obtain spectrally stable and efficient blue perovskite LEDs as well as excellent light quality white LEDs, which could help transition perovskite LEDs to commercial viability.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This qualitative study provided a compilation of Latinx student stories and experiences at a medium-sized community college located on the west coast of Central Florida to further understand student challenges with persisting to degree or certificate of completion and motivational factors contributing to re-enrollment after a stop out period. Increasing post-secondary institutional knowledge on how to support and respond to the needs of the youngest and fastest growing minority group in the United States will help Latinx students accomplish their academic goals, increase workforce and citizenship, and strengthen the U.S. economy. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Retention theories were evaluated to explore how specific programs and environments shape the experiences of Latinx students and intersect with Latin culture. Bean and Metzner’s (1985) nontraditional undergraduate student attrition model was used to guide the questions employed in the research. Qualitative data was obtained through a collection of seven interviews that provided narratives to inform the research questions from the students’ perspectives on persistence. Students identified problems in persistence related to family income, challenges with language, employment challenges, and more. Recommendations for future directions are offered.</DISS_para>

gradients in micellar extensions on flow past a falling sphere; effects of shear thickening on flow of
a model shear shear-thickening micellar fluid past a falling sphere; effects of moving contact-line on
filament pinch-off dynamics of wormlike micelles; effects of micellar structure on sphere sedimentation dynamics in wormlike micelles; effects of geometry of an active swimmer in a viscoelastic
polymeric fluid. First, we showed that dynamics of sphere sedimentation in wormlike micelles is
significantly affected by micelles relaxation spectrum in that for micellar solutions with multi-mode
relaxation dynamics, the flow around the falling sphere never becomes unstable. We rationalized
this result by using a dimensionless damping factor, and showed below a certain damping factor
the flow never becomes unstable in agreement with previous studies.
Next we presented quantitative measurements of the flow of a dilute shear-thickening rod-like
micellar solution past a falling sphere. A significant drag reduction and an unusually extended wake
in the rear of the falling sphere, which spans over a long distance were observed. We hypothesize
that strong shear and/or extensional flows around the falling sphere could trigger aggregation of
rod-like micelles into giant wormlike structures, and that gives rise to significant drag reduction.
Additionally, we investigated the effect of the spreading dynamics of the micellar fluid contactline on the pinch-off dynamics of the micellar fluid filament in extensional rheological measurements.
Our analysis showed that spreading of the wormlike micelles can also be described by Tanner’s law
(a well-known law for spreading of Newtonian fluid on solid substrates). We proposed a scaling
analysis based on a combination of wetting forces and viscous dissipation that can successfully
explain the effects of wetting on filament pinch-off dynamics. For the effects of micellar structure
on flow past a falling sphere, we studied the dynamics of sphere sedimentation in a linear and a
branched micellar solution. We showed that not only the drag coefficient, but also the detailed
form of flow structure and birefringence are affected by the micellar structure.
Finally, we studied the motion of a helical swimmer in a viscoelastic polymeric fluid. We found
the normalized velocity of a swimmer can be enhanced or reduced depending on the shape of the
swimmer. While our observations on the effects of tail pitch angle are consistent with the existing
predictions, our results on the effects of swimmer tail thickness are in contrast to the existing
predictions of the viscoelastic models.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>The shift from the traditional self-contained classroom to the departmentalized classroom structure in upper-elementary classrooms is increasing as the stakes are higher than ever for public schools. Teachers prefer departmentalization but findings as to its benefits for students are mixed. I consider the relationship between classroom structure and student achievement and whether the relationship varies by the subgroup, including race, sex, socio-economic status (SES), student with disability (SWD) status, English language learner (ELL) status, or Gifted High Achieving (GHA) status. Using fourth and fifth grade data from one school district in Florida, I use OLS and logistic regression to examine the relationship between departmentalization and three measures of student achievement based on the Florida Standards Assessment. I find an overall negative relationship between student achievement and classroom structure in fourth-grade, with some variation by student subgroup. The fifth-grade data is not significant and does not indicate that there is a relationship between student achievement and classroom structure. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Carbon fiber is an very important engineering material with excellent mechanical properties and low density. It usually combines with various polymers and forms carbon fiber reinforcement polymer composites, which have wide applications in aerospace, automotive, civil engineering and sports goods. The carbon fiber composites are light weight but five-times stronger than steel and twice as stiff, which makes carbon fibers great substitute materials for heavy metals, like steel and aluminum in the realm of construction, automotive industry, and aerospace. The demand of carbon fibers is increasing every year. However, the high cost of carbon fibers limits its large-scale application in many fields. Thus, it is imperative to put forward solutions to reduce the manufacturing cost of carbon fibers.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Nearly 90 % of commercial carbon fibers are produced from polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fiber because PAN-based carbon fibers are stronger than carbon fibers produced from other precursors. To convert PAN fiber into carbon fiber, one of the essential steps is carbonization which take 25% amount of total cost of carbon fiber. This step are traditionally conducted in extensive furnace, where the fibers are heated up. The process is energy and time consuming. Here, in this thesis, we propose a novel way to carbonize the stabilized PAN fiber by using laser targeted irradiation. Two-step scans is involved to guarantee the solid fiber structure. FTIR and Raman were used to confirm the formation of ordered graphite structure. By delicately controlling the laser parameters and experimental spatial conditions, we can not only realize carbonization of the stabilized PAN fiber, but also are able to engineer the inner microstructure of the fiber. The porous structures inside the carbon fiber could enable the applications in electro-chemistry, gas filters, electromagnetic wave shielding, etc. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This laser-assisted new method could largely reduce the cost for fiber carbonization heat treatment. Moreover, laser irradiation could directly introduce porous structures inside polymer fiber due to gas expansion. The laser induced high temperature simultaneously eliminates the non-carbon elements and helps the growth of ordered graphite structure. The laser-assisted carbonization process focuses energy onto targeted fiber and decrease energy dissipation to ambient environment, thus saving energy input and reduce the cost. It also simplifies the traditional way to fabricate the porous carbon fibers by combining pore creation and carbonization together. The laser method is a simple, energy-saving and promising way to renovate the traditional carbonization process and pore-creation process.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>In this paper we consider the same problem as the one in \cite{F-H-2016} in continuous time. That is a Monge-Kantorovich like problem under some portfolio constraints but the set of transport plans does not have to be the martingale measures. Instead, we consider the set of semi-martingale measures with a marginal distribution at terminal time $T=1$. Since we only assume the distribution of the underlying asset at the terminal time and we do not know any information prior to terminal time, so we exert extra assumptions on the set of semi-martingale measures. The main difficulty comes from proving the lower semi-continuity of the expectation of penalty term $A_1(\Q)$. We use continuous selection theory to extend the penalty term under the weak $S$ topology on Skorohod space, introduced by Kiiski in \cite{Kiiski2008a}, \cite{Kiiski2008b}. The $S$ topology introduced by Jakubowski \cite{jakubowski} is Hausdorff but the regularity of Skorohod space under the $S$ topology is not clear and the continuous selection theory may fail under such topology. The weak $S$ topology has almost all the properties of $S$ topology and the Skorohod space under weak $S$ topology is Hausdorff perfectly normal. So we can then apply the continuous selection theory. Another benefit from the weak $S$ topology is the limit measure $\Q$ preserves the properties of a convergent sequence of semi-martingale measures. Under the weak $S$ topology and the assumptions on payoff function and portfolio constraints we showed upper semi-continuity of the primal problem $P(\mu)=\sup_{\Q\in\cQ(\mu)}\E^\Q[G-A_1(\Q)]$. From there we extend the first duality in \cite{G-T-T-2017} and use the discretization procedure in \cite{Dolinsky2} to proved the super-hedging duality under portfolio constraints in continuous time.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>1,4-Dioxane, a likely human carcinogen, has recently been detected in surface and groundwaters throughout the United States. As a contaminant of emerging concern, 1,4-dioxane has not yet been regulated by federal drinking water standards. The future regulatory limit for 1,4-dioxane is likely to be strict with federal maximum contaminant level lower than 1 µg/L. Therefore, 1,4-dioxane has stimulated great research interests. Conventional treatment processes including air stripping and carbon adsorption are not effective in removing 1,4-dioxane. Many advanced oxidation processes have demonstrated effectiveness at the expense of high energy and chemical costs. Biodegradation of 1,4-dioxane is an attractive alternative. However, 1,4-dioxane is generally recalcitrant to biodegradation, meaning that the growth rate of 1,4-dioxane degrading bacteria and the biodegradation rate of 1,4-dioxane is often slow. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To promote the biodegradation of 1,4-dioxane, two approaches were investigated. In the first approach, a water film non-thermal plasma reactor and an aerobic biological reactor was combined to treat water contaminated by 1,4-dioxane.  The plasma reactor converted 1,4-dioxane to organic products including ethylene glycol, ethylene glycol monoformate, ethylene glycol diformate, 1,4-dioxan-2-one, 1,4-dioxan-2-ol, and formic, oxalic, glycolic, and methoxyacetic acids.  The concentration and composition of the organic products exiting the plasma reactor varied with hydraulic retention time (HRT) and affected the following biological treatment time.  At the optimum HRT for the plasma reactor (i.e., 1 second), ~25% of 1,4-dioxane was mineralized to CO2, and ~75% was converted to organic products, which were further degraded in the following biological reactor.   </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In the second approach, biodegradation of 1,4-dioxane with the addition of primary substrates was studied. Seven aqueous amendments (i.e., tetrahydrofuran, butanone, acetone, 1-butanol, 2-butanol, phenol and acetate) and five gaseous amendments (i.e., C1-C4 alkanes and ethylene) were evaluated as the primary substrates for dioxane degradation by mixed microbial consortia.  The aqueous amendments were tested in microcosm bottles and the gaseous amendments were tested in a continuous-flow membrane biofilm reactor with hollow fibers pressurized by the gaseous amendments.  Ethane was found to be the most effective gaseous substrate and tetrahydrofuran (THF) was the only aqueous substrate that promoted dioxane degradation.  </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>To understand the mechanisms by which THF affects dioxane biodegradation, changes in microbial community structure in microcosm experiments with synthetic media and landfill leachate were examined over time.  The data revealed that in experiments with synthetic media, the addition of THF significantly increased the abundance of Pseudonocardia, a genus with several representatives that can grow on both dioxane and THF, and Rhodococus ruber, a species that can use THF as the primary growth substrate while co-metabolizing dioxane.  However, in similar experiments with landfill leachate, only Rhodococcus ruber was significantly enriched.  When the THF concentration was higher than the dioxane concentration, THF competitively inhibited dioxane degradation since dioxane degradation was negligible while the dioxane-degrading bacteria and the corresponding THF/dioxane monooxygenase gene copies increased by a few orders of magnitude.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The effects of THF on 1,4-dioxane degradation was further investigated using two biological activated carbon reactors.  The first reactor (denoted by Reactor H) treated dioxane at 500 μg/L, a typical concentration in groundwater close to the contamination source.  The second reactor (denoted by Reactor L) treated dioxane at 25 μg/L at a comparable surface loading rate. The addition of THF promoted the dioxane degradation with an optimum THF: dioxane ratio of 3:1 in both reactors. In the reactor H, the relative abundance of Rhodococcus ruber increased from from 0.1% to 43.6% when the THF: dioxane ratio increased from 0:1 to 3:1, and decreased to 5.2% when the ratio further increased to 7:1.  The influent dioxane concentration significantly affected the microbial community since Rhodococcus ruber was not enriched in the reactor L, and  Mycobacterium was likely the microbe mainly responsible for dioxane degradation.  The influent dioxane concentration also affected the mechanisms of dioxane degradation because the dioxane-monooxygenase and gene copies increased by 3 folds in the reactor H, but not in the reactor L.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The term \textit{compactness} refers to the notion of joint localization used to describe a signal that is simultaneously efficient in the time and frequency domains. Traditional methods based on the Heisenberg-Weyl measure only quantify the compactness for continuous-time signals but fail to work well with discrete-time signals, since it is hard to define a translation-invariance concept of energy (variance) in the discrete domain. This limitation inherent in the Heisenberg-Weyl measure motivates us to consider another method based on the Hirschman uncertainty principle ($H_p$) to quantify the compactness for the discrete-time signal. Parameter $p$ allows a trade-off between concentrations in the time and frequency domains. Smaller $H_p$ means the signal is more compact. The $H_p$ has a lower limit of $\frac{1}{2}\ln(N)$ given $p=\frac{1}{2}$ where $N$ is the signal length. The unique orthogonal set of basis that minimizes $H_p$ is named the Hirschman Optimal Transform (HOT). The HOT is the most compact basis in the discrete-time and discrete-frequency domains, and it has been mathematically proven to be superior to the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) in high-resolution and computational complexity. The Discrete Hirschman Transform (DHT) is a generalization of the HOT with increased flexibility in hardware implementations. In this dissertation, we benefit from the attractive property of the Hirschman transforms to further develop fast algorithms, implement efficient convolution filters, and improve hardware performance. 		
Fast algorithms for computing the Hirschman transform efficiently will improve the Hirschman-based applications in digital signal processing. We develop three fast DHT algorithms (radix-2 DHT, radix-4 DHT and split-radix DHT) with detailed decomposition and structures for implementations. Generally, the proposed DHT algorithms require fewer nontrivial real computations than the direct DHT and classical Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs). 
		
Creating effective linear convolution algorithms still remains an active area. Conventional convolution algorithms based on the FFT and its derivations have multiple drawbacks involving a restriction to the convolution size and an expensive computational load. There is a developed HOT-based convolution algorithm that is more computationally attractive than the FFT-based convolution algorithm, but it is restricted to the convolution size that must be perfectly square. We extend this HOT-based algorithm functionally to propose a DHT-based convolution algorithm with more flexibility in implementations. The DHT-based convolution algorithm has many configurations depending on its parameter choices. We conjecture there is an optimal case to save real computations. An approach of how to determine the optimal value of parameter for the largest reduction in computations is recommended. The reduction in clock cycles with different input lengths or filter sizes is evaluated for Digital Signal Processor (DSP), the TMS320C5545.
		
A FIR linear convolution filter using the DHT-based convolution algorithm can be implemented in hardware, for example a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). We start with a regular DHT-based convolution filter that is composed of signal permutation, butterfly structures and multiplier network for large convolutions. With the assistance of some FPGA techniques, like Distributed Arithmetic (DA), we constitute a component for the HOT computation with savings in multiplications at the expense of hardware resource. It is further developed functionally to serve as the core component of a DHT-based convolution filter using the DA technique. Performance in terms of computational complexity, hardware resources, accuracy and clock cycles is discussed for theses Hirschman-based implementations.
		
The potential reduction in computational complexity and latency through the whole filtering process is explored for the proposed DHT-based convolution filter. Real computations are counted and compared with that of the FFT-based convolution filter. Our results show that the DHT-based filter could yield reduction in computations with a slightly larger convolution output size. Furthermore, we compute the clock cycles and combine it with the clock frequency from FPGA simulations to estimate the latency required by the filter. Observation indicates that the DHT-based convolution filter could reduce latency conditionally, but this reduction regresses and will be reversed by the FFT-based filter. It is feasible to improve the performance by considering other configurations (parameter choices). Modified DHT-based convolution filters using FPGA techniques are also included to the discussion.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The statistical relationship between Rossby-wave breaking and extreme cold air outbreaks (CAO) is investigated for East Asia. Two typical life cycles of upper-level Rossby waves during these CAOs are identified. The extreme CAOs are selected using a quantitative CAO index, which is defined by the integral of equatorward cold air mass flux below 280K isentropic surfaces. Rossby-wave breaking events are identified as anticyclonic and cyclonic according to the orientation of breaking. The breaking extent is calculated as the ratio of longitudes with breaking to the whole longitude range in each of four different regions. The composite analysis shows a significant increase in anticyclonic breaking extent upstream and cyclonic breaking extent downstream during western CAOs, and a decrease in cyclonic breaking extent midstream during eastern CAOs, respectively. During the demise days of extreme CAOs, the breaking extent returns to the level before onset. On the other hand, the average eastern and western CAO indices are notably higher during the days of cyclonic breaking. For the days of anticyclonic breaking, both CAOs tend to have higher indices when the breaking is upstream and lower indices when the breaking is downstream. Chi-Square tests of independence reveal that extreme western and eastern CAOs have prominent dependent relation with Rossby-wave breaking. The former synchronizes well with anticyclonic breaking upstream and cyclonic breaking downstream, while the latter lags the cyclonic breaking in the midstream for about three days. The composited potential vorticity fields during East Asia extreme CAOs illustrates two archetypes of wave life cycles. One is the anticyclonic wave breaking upstream of the CAOs and jet core; the other is the cyclonic wave breaking downstream of the jet and CAOs.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Shocking advertising strategies are used by for-profit and nonprofit organizations to catch consumers’ attention, yet the literature has not reached a consensus on its effectiveness in terms of intention to behave. In addition, there is a lack of research in consumers’ emotional and cognitive reactions to shocking ads while taking the sponsored organization, gender, and age into account. The main purpose of this study is to explore the effectiveness of shocking advertising when applied by a nonprofit versus a profit organization. Particularly, this study aims at comparing the appropriateness of shocking advertising in terms of emotion, attitude toward the ad (Aad), attitude toward the brand (Ab), and intention to behave. At the same time, this investigation proposes a validation of the conceptualization of shocking advertising as proposed in Dahl’s framework (Dahl et al., 2003). Lastly, the role age and gender are explored while evaluating the effectiveness of shocking advertising. The results indicated shocking ads in general elicited more negative emotion, more negative Aad, more negative Ab, and resulted in lower behavioral intention. Specifically, when shocking ads were used by nonprofit organizations, it produced less negative emotion, more positive Ab, and higher intention to behave, in comparison to for-profit shocking advertising. Next, no difference was found between nonprofit shocking messages and for-profit shocking messages on Aad. In terms of the effect of shocking advertising among different age groups, the results showed younger consumers held more positive Aad and Ab when exposed to the shocking messages than older consumers. In relation to gender differences, the findings indicate females developed lower intention to behave than males after viewing shocking ads.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Understanding the impact of affective information on cognitive processing is relevant to conceptualizations of fearful traits and clinical problems (e.g. anxiety disorders). Previous work has shown that threat cueing reliably activates the defensive motivational system, and that this activation alters cognitive processing related to achieving task-specific goals. Furthermore, the degree to which this effect occurs is moderated by an individual’s self-reported sensitivity to threat. However, it is unclear how threat cueing and threat sensitivity impact specific attentional sub-processes that have been identified through extensive work in basic cognitive science. The proposed study addressed this gap in the literature through use of a modified version of the Attention Network Test (ANT), under threatening and non-threatening conditions. Participants (78 undergraduates) performed the ANT during trial blocks in which they could receive shocks at any time, and during non-shock (safe) blocks. Effects of threat on efficiency of specific attentional networks (alerting, orienting, and executive control) were examined using electrophysiological (brain-ERP) as well as task-behavioral (accuracy, reaction time) measures. Individual differences in self-report threated sensitivity and on-line defensive reactivity (startle potentiation) were examined as potential moderators of the effects of threat on attentional networks. Findings support the utility of the threat-cueing ANT procedure as an experimental paradigm for investigating the impact of threat on attentional networks vital to achieving goals in everyday life.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Many popular global model-data fit indices (GFIs), such as Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI), Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), and Standardized Root Mean Square Residuals (SRMSR) are proposed and widely used in the context of structural equation modeling (SEM) with continuous data. The proposed cutoffs of those indices are for continuous data, which are not directly applicable to categorical data (Xu et al., 2017; Xia, 2016; Maydeu-Olivares &amp; Joe, 2014; Yu, 2002). Furthermore, the existing GFIs are developed and have been used with a limited information estimation approach, while a full information estimation approach is the most widely used estimation method in item response theory (IRT). Not many GFIs are available for categorical data when the full information IRT estimation is conducted (Maydeu-Olivares &amp; Joe, 2014). When there is an effect of guessing, as far as previous literature was searched, there is no GFI that demonstrates good performance in detecting the model-data fit for the comparative evaluation of the two-parameter logistic (2PL) and the three-parameter logistic (3PL) models. In addition, there is a lack of studies that conduct a systematic full evaluation of those popular GFIs in the unidimensional IRT (UIRT) and multidimensional IRT (MIRT) modeling (Maydeu-Olivares &amp; Joe, 2014; Xu et al., 2017).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study proposes descriptive GFIs using squared or absolute (raw or standardized) item response residuals from the whole item response data when an IRT model is estimated with the full information estimation. This study also compares the performances of the newly proposed GFIs with the existing GFIs in UIRT and MIRT modeling, especially the sensitivity of the indices in detecting the 2PL and the 3PL model fitting when data are contaminated with examinee guessing. As a secondary interest, Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and M2 test are also included in the comparisons. The newly proposed RI.R2s, residual variation reduction index based on the absolute residual summary for standardized residuals, showed the best performance in distinguishing the 3PL and the 2PL model fitting in unidimensional and multidimensional data, which contained test-taker guessing.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>For almost all climate variables, the annual cycle of a climate variable is often the most dominant component of that variable. Although such annual cycle is suggested to tie with the annual changes of the solar irradiance arriving at the top of atmosphere, the detailed physical mechanisms causing the annual cycle remain to be worked out. In this study, we make effort to understand the physical mechanisms behind the observed temporally asymmetric annual cycle of surface air temperature (SAT) over various regions of the Earth. Since the dominant component of the Fourier decompo- sition of SAT that causes the temporal asymmetry of SAT is its semiannual component, we seek to understand the origins of the semiannual component. We found that, in midlatitudes where the semiannual component of the solar irradiance approaches to zero, the semiannual component of SAT is not directly solar irradiance forced; but rather, it is caused by the annual changes of the heat capacity of the effective surface layer in response to the annual cycle of solar irradiance. We also assess the relative roles of direct forcing and indirect response in generating temporal asymmetry of annual cycle over different regions of the globe.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>As the number of international college students has increased dramatically since the 2000s (U.S. Mission Nigeria, 2018), depressive symptoms among this group have become a crucial issue in the United States. Notably, it is widely accepted that international college students are more vulnerable to depressive symptoms than their domestic peers (Krämer et al., 2004; Mori, 2000; Yeh &amp; Inose, 2003). A number of researchers suggest that acculturative stress is one of the most influential factors of this phenomenon (Constantine, Okazaki, &amp; Utsey, 2004; Hamamura &amp; Laird, 2014; Rice et al., 2012; Wei et al., 2007; Wilton &amp; Constantine, 2003; Ying &amp; Han, 2006; Zhang, 2012; Zhang &amp; Goodson, 2011). Acculturative stress is a unique stress caused by the adaptation process of immigrants, such as homesickness or perceived discrimination (Berry, 1997). Acculturative stress buffers the adaptation of international students, leading to a variety of concerns and causes mental problems such as interpersonal problems (Nicholson, 1997), perceived discrimination (Aroian et al., 1998), and feelings of marginalization and depressive symptoms (Hwang &amp; Ting, 2008).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Previous researchers have examined international students' financial (Kono et al., 2015; Meghani &amp; Harvey, 2016), sociocultural (Cruwys et al., 2013), and linguistic barriers (Belizaire &amp; Fuertes, 2011; Mori, 2000; Yeh and Inose, 2003) that can cause acculturative stress, resulting in a higher level of depressive symptoms. Physical activity has been regarded to be one of the best options as a means to reduce stress derived from such challenges (Carek, Laibstain, &amp; Carek, 2011; Dunn, Trivedi, &amp; Kampert, 2005; Dunn, Trivedi, &amp; O’Neal, 2001; Lawlor &amp; Hopker, 2001; Sale, Guppy, &amp; El-Sayed, 2000). Despite the distinctive social nature of sport to promote the adaptation of immigrants in the new society (Lee &amp; Funk, 2010; Lee et al., 2019; Stodolska &amp; Alexandris, 2004), many scholars defined and measured sport participation in the same manner as unorganized exercise or leisure.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Considering not only the physical (Herring, 2010; Lee et al., 2012) and psychological (Carek, Laibstain, &amp; Carek, 2011; Dunn, Trivedi, &amp; Kampert, 2005; Dunn, Trivedi, &amp; O’Neal, 2001) benefits but also the unique social nature (Krouwel et al., 2006; Miller &amp; Hoffman, 2009) of sport participation, I examined sport participation as a means to alleviate acculturative stress and depressive symptoms among international college students based on the theoretical framework of the Integrative Model of Acculturation and Salutogenesis. To achieve the research purpose, I investigated a total of 203 international college students in the United States. Participants completed a questionnaire distributed via the crowdsourcing platform - Prolific.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The following steps were included in the data analysis: (1) assessing the correlation between sport participation, acculturative stress, and depressive symptoms; and (2) measuring the indirect effect of sport participation on depressive symptoms through acculturative stress by conducting a regression analysis using PROCESS macro (Model 4) developed by Preacher and Hayes (2008).</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The results provided evidence that sport participation was significantly and negatively associated with depressive symptoms. Also, acculturative stress was significantly and positively associated with depressive symptoms. On the other hand, sport participation was not significantly associated with acculturative stress. Finally, acculturative stress did not mediate the relationship between sport participation and depressive symptoms.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>This study is significant both at the university and society levels. At the university level, findings from this research should provide practical implications to further strategic plans to address one of the fastest-growing phenomena in the United States. Specifically, based on the findings of the current study, universities may be able to create an agenda regarding the promotion and implementation of appropriate sport delivery systems which can enhance their international students’ mental wellbeing. At a society level, the findings of this research could be extended to positively impact the general immigrant population in the United States, which represents 28% of the total U.S. population. Considering an international student is one type of immigrant, the current study will be a stepping stone to promote public health by encouraging a healthy lifestyle among diverse members of society through sport involvement.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>After Chun and Rainey's seminal study in 2005, goal ambiguity is widely accepted as "the extent to which an organizational goal or set of goals allow leeway for interpretation." (Chun and Rainey 2005a; b). The mainstream discussion so far has treated it as an objective characteristic of an organization's goals by using a positivistic deductive approach. However, such a conceptualization pays insufficient attention to the fact that goal ambiguity can be highly subjective. Thus, this study takes an inductive approach and uses grounded theory to analyze interview data from Florida's state employees. This study demonstrates the meanings, types, sources, and consequences of goal ambiguity based on the stories of 32 state employees in Florida. This study reports how practitioners make sense of and cope with goal ambiguity. It develops four types of goal ambiguity grounded in practitioners experiences: (1) ambiguity of where to go (direction), (2) ambiguity of where are now (reality), (3) ambiguity how to get there (methods), and (4) ambiguity of how to know we are there (evaluation). These types are distinctive from each other but are coupled in an organization. 
This study also reports practitioners’ perceived sources and consequences of goal ambiguity. Not only external environments that support the traditional stance that goal ambiguity is given, but also internal environments (i.e., bureaucratic, managerial and cultural issues, leadership, and individual characteristics) play a significant role in forming goal ambiguity in the organization. Practitioners see that goal ambiguity has consequences in their individual motivation, job attitude, and organizational production. This study also finds the positive consequences of goal ambiguity, an aspect which hasn't gotten much attention in the literature.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Catheter-based surgical procedures provide minimally invasive means to correct structural heartdisease (SHD). Endovascular procedures may require the use of two or more independently catheter-ized  devices,  such  as  an  intracardiac  echocardiography  (ICE)  catheter  and  transseptal  puncture(TSP)  device.   The  alignment  of  these  devices  fluctuates  due  to  environmental  effects,  such  aspulmonary contraction and respiration, and can complicate the puncture of the fossa ovalis (FO).We proposed that the accuracy of this process can be improved by rigidly coupling the two devicesfor the duration of the TSP. This thesis explores the design constraints and performance metricsfor a magnet-based coupling mechanism based upon surgeons feedback.  Passively-coupled deviceswere developed by utilizing permanent magnets embedded within conformal interfaces.  Couplercross-sections were limited to 20 Fr (6.7 mm), and the resulting coupler designs achieved diametersranging from 16.2 Fr to 18.2 Fr (5.4 mm to 6.1 mm).  Prototypes were realized and integrated intoexisting  percutaneous  sheaths  for  a  preclinical  study  into  the  efficacy  of  endovascularly  coupledsheaths.   The  surgeon  performed  anin  vitroassessment  of  the  prototypes  using  a  purpose-builtanalog test apparatus that represented the inferior vena cava, right atrium, and FO. Endovascularde/coupling was achieved, and successful tenting of the mock FO was demonstrated.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Supplemental files are provided to demonstrate the coupler functionality.  A step-by-step demonstration is performed in "Coupling Demonstration within Analog RA.mp4" using the analog right atrium test apparatus to demonstrate coupling within the cardiovascular structures.  "Demonstration of Coupler Functionality in Water.gif" demonstrates coupling within a liquid medium followed by advancement, rotation, and retraction of tools within the coupler sheaths.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Despite their value as sources attesting to the reception of Buddhism by Chinese laypeople, miracle tale literature has escaped the attention of all but a few scholars of Chinese Buddhism. These scholars have tended to discuss this literature in general terms, seeking to understand this body of literature as a whole either by comparing different texts or by focusing on texts thought to be representative of the genre. This thesis consists of a detailed study and translation of a single miracle tale text, Collected Anomalies of the Diamond Sūtra, and seeks to understand the text within the historical-cultural context of the community which produced the tales and the author who compiled them.In so doing, I hope to reveal certain aspects of this literature which have previously gone unnoticed. Specifically, this thesis explores the role of numinous efficacy in the cult of the Diamond Sūtra as exemplified in these tales. It also highlights the role of sūtra-focused piety in addressing certain common anxieties, especially those centered on death, fate, and the threat of injustice. It is my hope that this study contributes to the growing body of literature on miracle tales and helps to shape the way we approach these texts as this field expands.</DISS_para>

      <DISS_content>
         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This composition is written for a sinfonietta-type ensemble (flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, horn, violin, viola, cello, bass, and percussion), taking into consideration performance limitations caused by the pandemic. It commemorates the victims of the deadly COVID-19 virus in the form of a multi-movement composition, each movement of which resembles a certain ritual from Korean spiritual practices. The first movement depicts a scene from Korean funeral tradition, in which people repeatedly exclaim the word of lament “Haigo.” This example is an audio excerpt taken from a Korean traditional funeral: https://terms.naver.com/entry.naver?docId=2406203&amp;cid=51704&amp;categoryId =51711  . In addition, in the middle of this movement, one can recognize fragments of the hymn “Amazing Grace.” To me, as I have been living in the U.S. for last ten years, this tune provokes empathy and compassion for the wider range of people. Thus, in my perception, "Haigo" represents lament on a more personal level, whereas "Amazing Grace" on a more universal one. Putting together these two examples, my goal was to emphasize the globality of the feeling of the situation.
The second movement resembles a Korean traditional shamanistic ceremony called Gout. While there are various types of Gout, this movement specifically refers to Cheon-do Gout, the performance of which guides the soul of the dead to heaven. The following video example includes the staged performance of Cheon-do Gout performed by a shaman and a small music ensemble: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rxQ1aSgwU4&amp;ab_channel=%ED%95%9C%EA%B5%AD%EB%AC%B8%ED%99%94%EC%9E%AC%EC%9E%AC%EB%8B%A8 . Consequently, much of the musical material of the second movement demonstrates what one would experience during the performance of Cheon-do Gout: shaman’s dance, singing, and narration. 
The third movement is inspired by a traditional dance called Salpuri. In Salpuri, a dancer acts to expel the disease with serene music and dance. This video demonstrates the performance of Salpuri in a style of Han Yeong Sook in the form of group dance: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zj VjAhQwXL8&amp;ab_channel=%EA%B5%AD%EB%A6%BD%EA%B5%AD%EC%95%85%EC%9B%90%5BNationalGugakCenter%5D  .
The last movement is rooted in Seong-ju Gout, a ritual performed to wish for peace and good health. This video example includes an excerpt of a staged performance of Seong-ju Gout performed by a shaman and a small music ensemble: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v= NVHG gkX3dF4&amp;ab_channel=ArtsKoreaTV.com  . Compared to the second movement, the music of this movement features a lighter mood, with a cheerful tune and rhythms.

            <DISS_para>Cashews are the number one produced tree nut worldwide and the U.S. is the top importer. Despite their popularity and economic importance, cashews are frequently implicated in IgE-mediated food allergy. Food allergy is an increasingly recognized global health issue and currently there is no available cure. The U.S. is the country with the most reported cashew allergies and cashews rank second among individual tree nuts in terms of U.S. prevalence. Three allergenic proteins in cashew have been identified: Ana o 1, Ana o 2, and Ana o 3. Ana o 1 was recently reported to be a glycoprotein, however the role of glycosylation in allergenic behavior of the protein has yet to be investigated and was the focus of this dissertation. 	Native Ana o 1 was purified from cashew seeds using a combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation, ultrafiltration, and fast protein liquid chromatography. Ammonium sulfate and ultrafiltration were used as crude purification and preconcentration steps prior to loading the sample on the columns. Two different chromatographic separation methods were tested separately- affinity and size exclusion. Ana o 1 eluted as a single peak off both types of columns, however higher recovery was achieved using size exclusion.  The binding of Ana o 1 to a Con A affinity column as well as glycoprotein staining, confirmed glycosylation.
	PNGase F was used to cleave N-glycans from purified Ana o 1. Deglycosylation was confirmed using SDS-PAGE with CBBR and glycoprotein staining. Western and dot blot immunoassays were used to compare immunoreactivity between deglycosylated and glycosylated Ana o 1 using pooled plasma from five cashew-allergic individuals. Immunoassays indicated that deglycosylation increased IgE-recognition of Ana o 1, suggesting that removal of N-glycans may have exposed previously masked Ana o 1 epitopes.  
Further, immunoreactivity of purified Ana o 1 after exposure to in vitro pepsin digestion was assessed using both the glycosylated and deglycosylated protein. Purified proteins were incubated with a fixed amount of pepsin at 37 C for 120 min at pH 3.0 with constant shaking to simulate gastric digestion. SDS-PAGE with CBBR staining was used to visualize proteolysis and Western blotting with pooled human plasma from five cashew-allergic individuals was used to assess subsequent immunoreactivity. Deglycosylation appeared to slightly increase susceptibility of Ana o 1 to proteolysis, likely by increasing exposure of pepsin cleavage sites on the protein. Despite this observation, both glycosylated and deglycosylated Ana o 1 were detected by human IgE following 120 min of digestion under the tested conditions.   
Overall, this report suggests that glycosylation may play a role in allergenicity of Ana o 1.

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>The pandemic of COVID-19 has been devastating around the world, especially in the US. Despite that wearing a face mask has been proven to be effective at preventing the coronavirus, there are still a large amount of people who would not wear masks in the U.S. This study examines different motivators that determine people’s mask wearing behavior, including collectivism, masculinity, indulgence, power distance, uncertainty avoidance, long term orientation, partisanship, perceived behavioral control, perceived risks, and attitudes toward mask wearing. An online survey using a convenience sample frame of college students was used. A total sample of 188 comprised the sample used to test the hypotheses. Results indicated that masculinity and power distance are significantly negatively correlated to mask wearing behavior. Whereas collectivism was found to be positively correlated to mask wearing behavior. Further, perceived risk of COVID-19 is found to be positively correlated to mask wearing, while perceived control is negatively correlated to mask wearing. As expected, attitude toward face masks predicts mask wearing behavior. Next, it was also found that Democrats are more likely to wear masks than Republicans. Among all the ethnicities tested, Non-Hispanic White significantly differ from Hispanics in that Hispanics are more likely to wear masks than non-Hispanic whites. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This thesis introduces in detail how we apply deep neural networks to solve several natural language processing problems, including Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD), word representation and knowledge-base completion. We apply Bidirectional Long-short Term Memory networks and self-attention models on the MSH WSD dataset, which is related to medical WSD. Experiments show that our models provide the state-of-the-art performance on the MSH WSD dataset. In addition, we provide a comprehensive mathematical analysis on the learning rules of word2vec, the first continuous word representation model. We indicate that the learning rules of the word2vec model have deep connections with competitive learning. Finally, we apply novel algorithms to generate low dimensional synset embeddings preserving the semantic relationships in WordNet, one of the most popular linguistic knowledge-bases of English. Our synset embedding system is the first one that can explicitly and completely preserve the hypernym tree structure in WordNet.</DISS_para>

            <DISS_para>Wide bandgap (WBG) semiconductors such as silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) devices have received increasing attention over the past two decades due to their better electric and thermal performance. Compared with Si devices, WBG devices have low on-resistance, fast switching speed and high junction temperature capability. These characteristics are beneficial for the efficiency, power density and reliability of power electronics converters. SiC devices mainly target high voltage high power applications (600 V, kilowatts or above). The lower switching loss and higher temperature operation characteristics enable the SiC converter to operate at much higher switching frequency with lower cooling demands. Therefore, the size and weight of the components can be significantly reduced, especially for the power inductors and capacitors. 
However, the higher switching frequency also makes the electromagnetic interference (EMI) issue more challenging. The electromagnetic noise tends to concentrate in the high frequency range, which overlaps with the EMI frequency (150 kHz to 30 MHz). Thus, higher attenuation is required for the EMI filter design, resulting in larger EMI filter size. Another issue is the high dv/dt associated with WBG devices. In motor drive applications, the high dv/dt will aggravate reflected wave phenomenon, which results in the load voltage being twice of the input voltage, increasing the chance of winding damage. Thus, dv/dt filters are required to reduce the overvoltage at the load terminal. These two issues will offset the benefit of the SiC devices.
To reduce the EMI filter size, many methods have been proposed. Compared to the traditional Si inverter, the EMI filter design for SiC inverters has some specific considerations, especially for PV inverters without power inductor. Two approaches are proposed here to reduce the EMI filter size. For DM filter, a notch branch is adopted to reduce the filter size, while the unbalanced Wheatstone bridge is applied to optimize the CM filter design.
An active reflected wave canceller (ARWC) is proposed to reduce the overvoltage caused by the reflected wave phenomenon in motor drive application. Compared to other dv/dt filters, this ARWC doesn’t change the dv/dt. A small pulse voltage is inserted into the circuit at each rising / falling edge which breaks the rising / falling edge into two steps. The reflected load voltage caused by each step compensates with each other. Thus, no overvoltage appears at the load terminal. Since the pulse width generated by the canceller is very narrow, which is related to the cable length, the power loss is much smaller compared to passive dv/dt filter. With this principle, an ARWC is designed for two-level inverters in low voltage application. A single phase inverter is built to verify its effectiveness. 
With the same principle, the ARWC is extended to three-level inverter in Medium Voltage (MV) application. Three different topologies are proposed for the ARWC design. The experiment of the proposed ARWC with a single phase three level inverter is conducted to verify its effectiveness.
Finally, conclusions are given and the scope of future work is discussed.

            <DISS_para>Discretion and its uses have been a central part of scholarly concern in public administration. Important as it is, however, it remains an unresolved issue. Scholars debate about how much discretion political principals should give to their bureaucratic agents. What factors shape political principals’ discretion-granting decisions? Furthermore, how does discretion affect policy outcomes? Despite extensive empirical studies, the concept has not been clearly defined in the literature, hampering meaningful discussion and integration of the discretion research. This dissertation makes a small but meaningful step towards theoretically and empirically understanding the conceptualization, antecedents, and consequences of administrative discretion. First, I empirically examined how council capacity and bureaucratic reputation interact to shape principals’ discretion decisions. I conducted a randomized survey experiment on city mayors in the U.S. and found that elected officials become more willing to grant discretion to bureaucrats when they sense that the bureaucrats have high reputation. More importantly, formal control can substitute the effect of bureaucratic reputation, but not the other way around. Second, I distinguished two different types of discretion, i.e., fiscal and statutory, and examined how they moderate the relationship between local government characteristics (fiscal slack and learning) and sustainability innovation adoption. I used a difference-in-difference-in-difference (DDD) approach to analyze a longitudinal data set of 238 U.S. cities and found that fiscal discretion strengths the positive effect of fiscal slack, and statutory discretion enhances the positive effects of learning. Third, based on an in-depth analysis of 121 original definitions of discretion, I developed a spectrum of conceptual views of administrative discretion, including technical discretion, tactical discretion, space, negotiated discretion, and agent dominance. These five dimensions differ in terms of principal-agent interaction patterns, ends, and the extent to which agents can change principals’ preferences and goals. Based on the conceptual model, I discussed theoretical and practical implications and proposed future research directions. Overall, by empirically examining the conceptual core, antecedents, and consequences of discretion, this dissertation advances the theory of administrative discretion and offers implications for public management and policy. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Dependence is one of the most important concepts in probability and statistics. To detect and measure dependency between response variables and predictors, various models have been constructed, from simple models like least square regressions to complex ones like deep neural networks. However, less literature focuses on detecting the dependency structures among responses and incorporating this structure information to facilitate other analyses. Dependency among responses can appear when the responses are multivariate or the data are observed as groups. Markov Random Field (MRF) and Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) are proposed to detecting the dependency structures and improve the efficiency of analysis of mean effect under these circumstances. However, these methods may not perform well when data is complex, such as non-Gaussian, heavy-tailed or skewed. In Chapter 1, we consider a generalized indirect learning with dependency (GIDL) framework to detect and apply the dependent structure between responses in both multivariate and grouped dependencies, when data are non-Gaussian, heavy-tailed or skewed. We focus on statistical analysis that covers asymptotic distribution and signal selection of dependency structures and asymptotic distribution of the coefficients of predictors with the assistant of structure information.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In Chapter 2, we develop a slack empirical likelihood (SEL) inference framework that can handle non-Gaussian, heavy-tailed or skewed types of data. Empirical likelihood is powerful because an inference problem is transformed into an optimization one. Besides, fewer distributional assumptions are required than traditional likelihood-based inference methods. Modern statistical models often implicitly put nonsmooth constraints through regularizations on the possible solutions for parameter estimations, like the restricted cone induced by `1 penalized regressions. Traditional empirical likelihood can not handle such nonsmooth constraints induced by regularizations when the solutions could appear at the boundary of constrained regions because the estimating equation is not sample additive. By carefully examining the directional derivatives at the nonsmooth region and introducing slack variables such that the modified estimating equations are sample additive, we extend the empirical likelihood framework such that the nonsmooth constraints can be handled by a joint optimization on parameters and the slack variable. We show some examples that our framework works for some traditional constrained empirical likelihood problems such that the correct asymptotic distribution can be derived. Besides, some explorations on modern statistical problems including high dimensional regression with regularizations are provided.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Although a number of studies have been conducted to explore how various individual difference (ID) factors such as aptitude, motivation, and anxiety contributing to L2 learners' speech performance over a period of time of L2 learning, only a few examined the effect of the three ID factors on learners' L2 speech performances based on classroom language learning setting in a longitudinal study (e.g., Kermad, 2018; Saito et al., 2018; 2019). There are no existent studies that have examined the concurrent influence of aptitude, motivation, and anxiety on L2 speech development with the same group of adult EFL learners as participants in one single longitudinal research project, while all the three ID factors have been demonstrated to be significantly correlated with L2 speaking acquisition (Li, 2016; Matsuda &amp; Gobel, 2004). For filling such research gap, the current study examined a group of Chinese EFL college-level learners' (N = 83) L2 speech development and how different learners' individual difference (ID) factors (i.e., aptitude, motivation, and anxiety) playing a role in determining their L2 speech learning outcomes after they experience one academic semester's L2 speaking classroom-based training. Specifically, the study measured the learners' L2 speech performances at two separate times over one academic semester: before students started to take the first lesson (Time 1); after they finished taking the last lesson of the enrolled English-speaking course (Time 2). The study adopted a sentence reading task and a pair of picture description tasks for examining participants' L2 speech proficiency at a controlled and spontaneous state, respectively. Several types of L2 speech constructs were examined in the study, including speech comprehensibility, accentedness, accuracy, fluency, complexity (CAF), and overall speaking proficiency. The participants' oral performance of accentedness, comprehensibility, and overall speaking proficiency shown in the sentence-reading and picture description tasks were rated by four listeners who were currently-enrolled graduate native English speakers. Additionally, the participants' audio recordings of picture description were transcribed in a verbatim manner, and the indexes of CAF were calculated and coded by the researcher. In terms of the instruments used for examining learners' aptitude, motivation, and anxiety levels, the study adopted L2 Self Guides (Papi et al., 2019), an adapted L2 speech learning anxiety scale (Cheng., 2017; Woodrow, 2003), and LLAMA test (Meara, 2005) to respectively measure learners' motivation, anxiety and different types of aptitude level. After the data were collected, paired-samples t-tests and a set of multiple regression analyses were conducted to respectively examine the learners' L2 speech gains and the predictive power of aptitude, motivation, and anxiety on their longitudinal development of English speech proficiency. The results indicated that after one semester's English-speaking training, the EFL learners in the study achieved significant gains in L2 speech proficiency in terms of accentedness, comprehensibility, accuracy, fluency, and overall L2 speaking proficiency. On the other hand, several ID factors were demonstrated to be associated with different aspects of L2 speech outcome. Mainly, implicit aptitude had a positive effect on speech comprehensibility, accuracy, and overall speaking proficiency. Besides, Ideal L2 Self Own, Ought-to L2 Self Own, and Ideal L2 Self Other appeared to be the most prominent motivation factors that had a positive effect on learners L2 speech gains in different aspects (i.e., comprehensibility, accentedness, accuracy, and overall speaking). On the contrary, anxiety overall exerted a negative effect on L2 speech performances. The study shows its uniqueness, which has separately explored how each of the ID factors (i.e., aptitude, motivation, and anxiety) influences L2 speech development and considered how these cognitive-psychological factors are macro factors associated with and interpreting learners’ L2 speech development. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Previous research suggests that the intensity of student engagement in the learning process is a consistent predictor of language achievement (Gardner, 2010; Masgoret &amp; Gardner, 2003). Research from educational psychology indicates that learners are more engaged in learning when their teachers’ autonomy-supportive motivating practice supports their basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness (e.g., Haerens et al., 2015; Jang et al., 2016). The present study investigated this relationship within a Self-Determination Theory (SDT) perspective in language learning classrooms in an underexplored research context—China.	In addition to the above one-way relationship (i.e., from teachers’ motivating practice to student classroom engagement) that has been well explored, the reciprocal effect of student classroom engagement on teachers’ teaching practice is a new trend in educational research. The present study also examined these bilateral relationships in language learning classrooms as well. In addition, this study adopts the perspective that viewing classroom functioning as two correlated but independent processes, that is, conceptualized brighter side and darker sides of the classroom in a dual-process model. The findings of the study validated this claim and provided more empirical evidence in this regard.
	Resonating with the recent calls to view language learning as a complex dynamic system from the complex dynamic system theory (CDST) view (Larsen-Freeman &amp; Cameron 2008a), the design of this study followed “the dynamic ensemble” (Hiver &amp; Al-Hoorie, 2016) grounded in most CDST empirical studies. By collecting data via survey from 1742 participants from universities in China at three time points, the present study used multi-level modeling, two growth curve models, and a cross-lagged panel model to investigate the dynamic, situated, complex relationships between learning environment (i.e., teachers’ teaching practice), students’ motivational resources (i.e., need satisfaction and need frustration), and students’ classroom functioning (i.e., engagement or disengagement) among Chinese undergraduate English learners. Findings of this study substantiated these features in a dual-process, reciprocal effects motivation mediation model. </DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>This treatise discusses Bright Sheng’s four vocal chamber works: Three Chinese Poems, Two Poems from the Sung Dynasty, Three Chinese Love Songs, and may i feel said he. It will provide an interpretation of the texts and traditional Chinese literary concepts embodied in them, followed by stylistic analyses of Sheng’s musical settings. Sheng’s interest in using music to bridge cultural gaps and connect audiences with diverse backgrounds will be highlights in this document. </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Bright Sheng’s vocal chamber works demonstrate his embrace of cultural elements from both Eastern and Western traditions. His distinctive musical language mixes the Chinese culture with which he grew up and the American culture he has known since moving to the United States. As Sheng explains, “Why shouldn’t my music reflect that [mixture]? People acknowledge ‘artistic license’; I embrace ‘cultural license’—the right to reflect my appreciation and understanding of both cultures in my work.” </DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>The first chapter is an introduction to Bright Sheng and his compositional approach. The subsequent chapters present analyses of the selected works, interpreting the texts as well as how Sheng’s musical settings reflect significant cultural elements and text meanings.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>With the popularity of microprocessors and scale-out system architectures, many large-scale high-performance computing (HPC) systems are built from a collection of compute servers, with an identical set of resources such as CPU, memory, and storage. A variety of applications have been leveraging the tremendous computation capacity on these large-scale HPC systems. Scientific applications and deep learning (DL) training are two of the popular workloads on HPC systems. However, with the rapid growth of the computation power, it has also become increasingly important to fill in the computation and I/O performance gap for these applications and workloads on HPC systems.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In recent years, many research efforts have been made to explore user-level file systems on HPC systems for various workloads due to the flexibility of implementation and maintenance in user space. In particular, scientific applications which have two typical I/O patterns (checkpoint/restart and multi-dimensional I/O) have been able to utilize different specialized user-level file systems in a single job. However, non-trivial overheads can be introduced in such a method. We need to carefully review the overheads in order to mit- igate the performance degradation. In addition, the existing methods of using user-level file systems are not sufficient to meet the fundamental I/O needs of large-scale DL training on HPC systems. Firstly, in DL training, random samples are organized into batches to update model parameters in iterations. This is to avoid the model being biased by the input sequences’ noise, which allows faster convergence speed and reduces memory consumption during the training computation. This results in massive random reads for data shuffling across the entire datasets on storage systems. Such a random read I/O pattern is significantly different from the traditional scientific workloads. Moreover, leadership HPC systems are often equipped with a large pool of burst buffers in the form of flash or non-volatile memory (NVM) devices. DL applica- tions running on these systems face the resource underutilization problem. This is because NVM devices’ performance with respect to low latency and high bandwidth can be severely underutilized under heavy CPU and memory workloads. In this environment, the flash or NVMe storage devices are capable of low-latency and high-bandwidth I/O services, but the complex software stack significantly hampers such capabilities for I/O processing in the kernel. Also, due to DL training accuracy and performance concerns, the storage capacity and the performance of on-node storage devices on the nodes allocated to the training job are not sufficient to store an entire dataset and match the training speed, respectively.This dissertation focus on applying user-level file systems on HPC systems. Our overarching goal is to accelerate the I/O supports on HPC systems through specialized user-level file systems for popular workloads. In specific, we want to bring lightweight user-level file systems as efficient intermediates to reduce the performance overhead and ease the use of multiple FUSE file systems in a single job, orchestrate the data movement between storage tiers and DL applications, and improve the storage resource utilization for a pool of NVMe SSDs in DL training. Based on these design goals, we investigate the issues and challenges when applying existing user-level file systems to the popular workloads, then propose three strategies to meet our goals.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>Firstly, we have studied the problem of excessive cost in crossing the user-kernel boundary when using multiple traditional user-level file systems, and we design Direct-FUSE to support multiple FUSE file sys- tems as well as other, custom user-level file systems in user space without the need to cross the user/kernel boundary into the FUSE kernel module. All layers of Direct-FUSE are in user space, and applications can directly use pre-defined unified file system calls to interact with different user-defined file systems. Our performance results show that Direct-FUSE can outperform some native FUSE file systems and does not add significant overhead over backend file systems. Secondly, we examine the I/O patterns of deep neural networks and study the performance overheads when loading samples from some popular DL applications. Then, we introduce an entropy-aware I/O framework called DeepIO for large-scale deep learning on HPC systems. It coordinates the use of memory, communication, and I/O resources for efficient training of datasets. DeepIO features an I/O pipeline that utilizes several novel optimizations: RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access)-assisted in-situ shuffling, input pipelining, and entropy-aware opportunistic ordering. It outperforms the state-of-the-art persistent memory based distributed file systems for efficient sample load- ing during DL training. Thirdly, besides examining the I/O patterns of deep neural networks, we also reveal a critical need of loading many small samples randomly and the issues of storage resources underutilization for successful training. Based on these understandings, we design a specialized Deep Learning File System (DLFS) with an in-memory tree-based sample directory for metadata management and user-level storage disaggregation through the SPDK protocol. Our experimental results show that DLFS can dramatically improve the throughput of training for deep neural networks when compared with the kernel-based local Ext4 file system. Furthermore, DLFS demonstrates its capability of achieving efficient user-level storage disaggregation with very little CPU utilization.</DISS_para>
            <DISS_para>In conclusion, the first branch concentrates on enriching the functionality and enhancing the performance of the Direct-FUSE framework; the second and third branches focus on wisely storing and prefetching datasets with the coordination of hierarchical storage tiers and fast interconnect, respectively. By exploring these three branches, we can further accelerate the specialized user-level file systems for popular workloads on HPC systems.</DISS_para>

         <DISS_abstract>
            <DISS_para>Experimental studies on the flow over an aligned cylinder with a slanted afterbody were conducted in this work for several Reynolds numbers and slant angles. Two different flow topologies, formerly only conjectured in the literature, were observed and thoroughly documented as a function of both slant angle and Reynolds number. The flow topology studies conducted herein with three-dimensional flow reconstruction through Stacked Stereoscopic Particle Image Velocimetry (S-SPIV) allowed for a comprehensive examination of the flow structures that comprise the flow fields in both regimes. The 3D flow fields obtained in the experiments are published as open-access data sets and can serve as a benchmark for validation of computational studies. Most of the focus in this work is geared towards the characterization of the ``Vortex Regime'', which displays the formation of a horseshoe vortex in the near wake and whose understanding immediately applies to military cargo aircraft fuselage shapes. The dynamical behavior of these vortices is analyzed with Time-Resolved Particle Image Velocimetry and the flow appears to have fundamental frequencies with a potential relationship to the dynamics of the shear layer produced at the sides of the cylinder and the vortex pair. Finally, an innovative, optimization-based approach is proposed to find the most effective pattern of actuators for active flow control of this wake through microjet disturbances, with very encouraging results that outperform a well-informed researcher and can provide not only engineering answers, but further physical insight on other complex flows.</DISS_para>
