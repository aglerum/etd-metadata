         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This study provides, to our knowledge, the first detailed analysis of how oil changes
            air-sea interaction in a two-way coupled model (COAWST), and how the modified surface
            stress and surface Ekman current change the transport of the oil. Our results highlight
            the substantial influences of oil-related changes in surface roughness, surface wind,
            surface and near surface temperature differences, boundary-layer stability, and corresponding
            changes in surface stress and oil transport. These results are dependent on the effectiveness
            of our tuning of the modeled oil concentration on the surface. These considerations
            are examined in part by running twin coupled modeling simulations with and without
            the influences of oil. Subsequently, we compare the results by using a flux model
            with parameterizations selected to match those selected in COAWST adapted to either
            ignore or account for different atmospheric/oceanic processes in calculating surface
            stress. This approach investigates the effects of oil separately on boundary-layer
            stability, surface wind, and surface roughness and how those conditions impact surface
            stress. The model results find that surface stress changes due to oil-related damping
            of surface roughness are always negative in the absence of changes to model input
            parameters (i.e., wind speed and boundary-layer stability). However, oil-related changes
            to 10 m wind speed appear to play a much dominant role than oil-related changes in
            roughness in the changes in stress. The wind speed changes due to reduced surface
            friction (which increase stress) and due to changes in stability (which increase or
            decrease stress). We find that oil-related changes in boundary-layer stability play
            a dominant role in the changes in stress. This finding indicates that the vast majority
            of the changes in modeled stress are due to the changes in modeled stability and wind.
            This finding is contrary to the assumption by an idealized study where the changes
            in scatterometer observed roughness were assumed to be entirely due to damping of
            the roughness by oil. Finally, the results indicate that the oil-related changes in
            surface roughness, surface wind, and boundary-layer stability combined to result in
            surface stress changes are not large enough to cause a major impact on the surface
            current and oil transport. The results from this study indicate that the feedbacks
            from the surface oil presence to the oil movement itself are minor for forecasting
            the transportation of the oil due to the small impact on surface stress unless the
            fractional oil coverage is much greater than found in this study.</p>
