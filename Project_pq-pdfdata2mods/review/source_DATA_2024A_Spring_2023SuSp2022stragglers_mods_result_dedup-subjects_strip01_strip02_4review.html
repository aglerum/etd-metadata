         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>In the past century, the concept of resilience has emerged as a critical element in
            sustaining the performance of critical infrastructure systems amidst various challenges.
            Traditionally, resilience has been practiced through a risk-based utility maximization
            approach, where strategies and investments for resilience are evaluated against the
            likelihood and intensity of potential threats. This approach, while effective in certain
            contexts, has recently come under scrutiny due to the rapidly evolving frequencies
            and intensities of threats. These developments have prompted the scientific community
            to reevaluate the effectiveness of the conventional resilience approach in safeguarding
            critical infrastructure systems. In the past decade, a novel school of thought emerged,
            advocating for the concept of adaptation as the foundation of resilience management
            efforts within critical infrastructure systems. Proponents of this paradigm distinguish
            between adaptive resilience and traditional practices by designating the latter as
            embodying the principles of reliability and risk management. The advocates of the
            adaptive resilience school emphasize the necessity of adaptation in the face of complex,
            unpredictable challenges (of which deep uncertainties and surprise shocks are the
            focus of this work). These recent developments have led to a variety of pathways in
            resilient practice, precipitating an already existing divergence in the conceptualization
            of the resilience of complex systems. Moreover, a notable gap exists in the literature
            regarding how these pathways can be effectively organized to optimize resilience outcomes,
            particularly in situations where knowledge is limited. This dissertation investigates
            multiple resilience management pathways to understand the role of adaptation in the
            management of critical civil infrastructure systems. The dissertation is guided by
            the question: How can adaptive resilience be applied to macro-level complex infrastructure
            systems to facilitate the decision-making and planning of infrastructure assets and
            ensure the provision of sustainable and resilient systems? This work employed a set
            of qualitative and quantitative research methods to achieve the following: (1) define
            what adaptive resilience is, categorize existing planning efforts, and develop a framework
            that facilitates future efforts in the field of adaptive resilience research, (2)
            investigate the emerging challenges that require adaptive resilience measures, and
            the implications that hinder the adaptation of these measures, (3) analyze current
            trends in adaptive resilience practice, and investigate the gap between the acknowledged
            need for adaptive resilience and the practical adoption of such practices, (4) investigate
            the implications emerging challenges have on the current practices and the risks associated
            with neglecting such challenges, (5) determine the capacities of adaptive resilience,
            and (6) provide a future direction for efforts directed towards fostering an adaptive
            resilience culture within organizations committed to the resilience of critical infrastructure
            systems. This research expands the existing infrastructure resilience theory by investigating
            its limitations and redefining a number of critical concepts that -in our view- facilitate
            resilience efforts within these complex systems. The work provides a framework for
            agencies invested in resilience development to enhance their efforts, and provide
            a clarification about various misconceptions which result in efforts that may be counterproductive
            to the objectives that motivate them. Overall, the resilience research of critical
            infrastructure systems is at a developmental stage where agreements on foundational
            concepts that guide a unified commitment for resilience are required to advance this
            important field of study, and create efforts that are not outpaced by the intensities
            and frequencies threats that motivate them.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>At the center of this project is the question of origin and citizenship in the geographical,
            emotional, and spiritual sense. A subterranean pursuit of the idea of home through
            a series of questions. If home, "the measurement of rootedness is typically expressed
            in harmonious stability rather than dynamic progress" as argued by Frank McAndrew
            in the Journal of Environmental Psychology, what kind of home can possibly be available
            to someone, like myself, no longer rooted in the geographical enclave of my ancestors,
            but living instead in a liminal in-between, in a caesura between borders and countries,
            oceans and continents, airport terminals and foreign cities, memory and exile, language
            and prayers. If as the poet Safia Elhillo argued, "All our dead in the ground makes
            this land ours" what kind of home then can possibly be available to someone who dwells
            across the ocean away from where all his forebears—including his father— are buried.
            Are journeys a form of betrayal, a flight away from the zone of origin? Is return
            promised? Are farewells eternal? Is departure a simulacrum of death, a degree of dying?
            Is journey a category of death? Is death itself a crossing of borders?</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Terrain is one of the most important parameters affecting wind loads on buildings.
            Current building codes such as ASCE 7-16 consider uniform upwind exposure to estimate
            the wind loads and recommend wind tunnel testing for complex upwind terrain. There
            is a need to understand the distribution of pressure on the buildings facing a nonuniform
            upwind terrain. This study aims to investigate the effect of heterogeneous simulation
            of terrain on wind characteristics and pressure in wind tunnel testing. The knowledge
            gap in our research, includes a) a limited number of tests of heterogeneous terrain,
            b) a limited number of tests on mid-rise models, c) dealing with the simulation of
            heterogeneous terrain in the wind tunnel tests, and also d) difficulties in producing
            the dataset for heterogeneous terrain will be addressed. In the first task we validated
            the wind tunnel testing. We also prepared a dataset of heterogeneous terrain using
            a deep neural network (task 2). In task 3, first, we investigated terrains with simple
            transitions and small openings. Then, using the results of the previous step and the
            heterogeneous terrain database, we performed a series of wind tunnel testing on the
            generic heterogeneous terrain. Analytical and computational models will also be developed
            to explain the observed terrain effects in task 4. In order to simulate the heterogeneous
            terrain, a staggered array of 1116 individually controlled roughness elements called
            Terraformer in the Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel Experimental Facility at the University
            of Florida was used. In this study, we proposed a Convolutional Neural Network that
            can classify images in a way it can be used in wind tunnel testing. Landsat-8 images
            and National Land Cover Database were introduced to the neural network as an unlabeled
            and labeled dataset, respectively. Unsupervised machine learning algorithms will be
            used to find representative images among all images in the dataset. Before testing
            the generic heterogeneous terrain configurations modeled after real terrain, we tested
            simple heterogeneous terrains. A series of testing has been performed in the wind
            tunnel to investigate the effect of simple nonuniform terrains such as smooth to rough
            change, rough to smooth change, and small opening fetch. In this testing, two different
            building models (low-rise and mid-rise) were located at the center of the turntable.
            The wind pressure was measured on the walls and the roof of the models using pressure
            taps connected to the Scanivalve ZOC33 pressure scanning system mounted under the
            turntable. The three wind speed components were also collected using Turbulent Flow
            Instrumentation Cobra Probes. The wind speed profile over simple nonuniform terrains
            was compared with known theories. Then, using the results of the previous testing,
            and the heterogeneous terrain database in task 2, we performed a series of wind tunnel
            testing on the generic heterogeneous terrain. The results of wind speed profiles and
            pressure coefficient distribution in the wind tunnel tests were analyzed and compared
            for the nonuniform and uniform upwind terrain cases.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Situated in the growing body of task-based language teaching research, this quasi-experimental
            study explored whether different types of written corrective feedback and task planning
            jointly influence 115 English as a foreign language learners' development in target
            structure accuracy and linguistic performance in L2 writing. In response to the increased
            need to examine the roles of learners' individual differences in second language acquisition
            research, the study further investigated how multiple individual characteristics variables—executive
            working memory, phonological short-term memory, L2 writing anxiety, and L2 writing
            self-efficacy—moderated the effectiveness of written corrective feedback and task
            planning. Additionally, the variation in learners' task-specific anxiety and self-efficacy
            across time points and treatment conditions was explored. The participants were from
            six intact classes in a public high school in South Korea, and they were assigned
            into six experimental groups. The groups were first divided into two feedback groups:
            Direct Correction (DC) and Metalinguistic Explanation (ME). The two feedback groups
            further diverged into three planning groups: Pre-task Planning (PTP), Within-task
            Planning (WTP), and No Planning (NP). During the treatment sessions, the participants
            received and studied different types of corrective feedback on their essays from a
            preceding session and subsequently engaged in a picture-based narrative writing task
            under the various planning conditions. The feedback targeted two linguistic structures:
            English articles and past tense. In the testing sessions (pretest, immediate posttest,
            and delayed posttest), all students were given the same picture prompt and asked to
            write a narrative essay describing what happened in the picture strip. The essays
            collected from the testing sessions were assessed in terms of their accuracy in target
            structures and linguistic performance (complexity, accuracy, and fluency; CAF). The
            students were also asked to respond to general L2 writing anxiety and L2 writing self-efficacy
            questionnaires (at the onset of the study) as well as task-specific anxiety and self-efficacy
            questionnaires (after finishing each writing test). Learners' executive working memory
            was measured by an Operation Span test, while the phonological short-term memory was
            assessed via a Digit Span test. The study aimed to answer three research questions:
            i) What are the main and interaction effects of written corrective feedback and task
            planning on EFL learners' development in target structure accuracy and linguistic
            performance of CAF?, ii) What is the role of learners' individual differences in executive
            working memory, phonological short-term memory, L2 writing anxiety, and L2 writing
            self-efficacy in predicting the development of target structure accuracy and linguistic
            performance of CAF under various task conditions?, and iii) How do learners' task-specific
            L2 writing anxiety and L2 writing self-efficacy vary from their initial writing experience
            to the final experience in different task conditions? Regarding the effects of feedback
            and planning, two-way ANCOVA revealed that Metalinguistic Explanation was slightly
            more effective than Direct Correction for the immediate past tense accuracy, but only
            when the learners engaged in Within-task Planning. The development of English articles,
            which was one of the targeted structures, was not influenced by the treatments. Regarding
            the performance of CAF, Pre-task Planning served as a playing field discerning the
            superior effects of Direct Correction over Metalinguistic Explanation on immediate
            and delayed syntactic complexity. Under the No Planning environment, the learners
            exhibited higher immediate lexical complexity when they were treated with Direct Correction,
            while they demonstrated enhanced general morphosyntactic and lexical accuracy upon
            receiving Metalinguistic Explanation. When it came to L2 writing fluency, Within-task
            Planning notably decreased writing speed in the immediate posttest, especially when
            compared to Pre-task Planning. Moreover, Direct Correction was found to be less disruptive
            than Metalinguistic Explanation. In examining the impact of the individual difference
            variables on the development of the diverse outcome measures across task conditions,
            two-way ANCOVA was employed, with interaction terms between treatments and individual
            difference factors. It was found that the impact of executive working memory on immediate
            outcome measures was observed across several domains, including the accuracy of articles
            and past tense, syntactic complexity, and overall morphosyntactic accuracy. Furthermore,
            this cognitive device exhibited varying influences across different treatment conditions.
            On the other hand, L2 writing self-efficacy emerged as a significant predictor of
            immediate past tense accuracy across all treatment conditions (without interaction
            with feedback or planning types). Other individual difference factors, namely phonological
            short-term memory and L2 writing anxiety, were not shown to play significant roles.
            It is important to highlight that the notable findings regarding the role of executive
            working memory and L2 writing self-efficacy were limited to the immediate posttest
            performance, suggesting the transient nature of individual difference factors' effects.
            With regard to the changes in task-specific anxiety and self-efficacy, the mixed design
            repeated measures ANOVA showed that learners' anxiety level toward the given writing
            task generally decreased from the pretest (Time 1) to the delayed posttest (Time 3),
            while their self-efficacy increased over time. In relation to the impact of different
            interventions, the combination of Direct Correction and Pre-task Planning proved beneficial
            in enhancing task self-efficacy during the L2 writing task performance.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>In the modern information era, graphs have been ubiquitous in numerous high-impact
            areas, including social media, bioinformatics, artificial intelligence, and critical
            infrastructures. The sets of nodes and edges within graphs can effectively represent
            and preserve information of entities and the sophisticated relationships among them.
            With the prevading and increasing trends of graph data, numerous graph-related tasks
            and techniques have been proposed and deeply studied. For example, graph representation
            learning extracts graph information into vectors for downstream tasks; graph similarity
            computation task quantifies the distances between two graphs, which is utilized in
            pattern recognition and drug creation; graph summarization task compress the sizes
            for representing large-scale graphs to assist more efficient graph storage. Due to
            the unique structures and increasing scales of graphs, graph-related tasks and algorithms
            still face many challenges from both effectiveness and efficiency aspects, especially
            when the scales of graph data (either the sheer size of a single graph or the number
            of data graphs in a graph database) explode. Meanwhile, nowadays we have witnessed
            the prosperity and advantages of deep learning models in many applications. With its
            unprecedented inference ability, it is intuitive to consider applying deep learning
            methods for dealing with graph-related tasks and also enhance the performance of existing
            graph computational methods.In this dissertation, I summarize three representative
            topics of my research works throughout the Ph.D. study that emphasize the problems
            mentioned above. The first topic is graph representation learning with graph neural
            networks (GNNs) on large-scale graphs. As the graph's scale increases and higher-order
            neighbors are considered, the recursive neighborhood aggregation within GNNs can cause
            the number of neighbors to explode when computing node representations. We name this
            problem as neighbors explosion. Besides, graphs have the characteristics of node dependence,
            which means neighboring nodes affect each other in the learning process. When GNNs
            go deeper and learn on the full graph, it is unavoidable for the problem of oversmoothing
            that node representations from different clusters mix up. The problems of neighbors
            explosion, node dependence, and oversmoothing hinder the effectiveness and even feasibility
            of GNNs. In the dissertation, I introduce a subgraph- based GNN training framework
            that lowers the space complexity during the running process and also addresses the
            above problems on large graphs. The second topic in the dissertation is deep learning-based
            graph similarity computation. Existing graph similarity computation methods suffer
            from severe performance issues due to the NP-hardness of exact computation of the
            graph edit distance (GED) metric. Graph edit distance (GED) is defined as a minimum
            number of graph edit operations between a pair of graphs, and it has by far been the
            most well-studied graph similarity metric. There are four types of graph edit operations
            for labeled graphs: Node-relabeling (NR) that changes the label of one node; Node-insertion/deletion
            (NID) that inserts or deletes one isolated node; Edge-relabeling (ER) that changes
            the label of one edge; Edge-insertion/deletion (EID) that inserts or deletes one edge.
            Inspired by the success of deep learning techniques, we propose a type-aware graph
            similarity learning and computation framework that estimates GED in a fine-grained
            approach w.r.t. different graph edit types. The third topic is learning policy-based
            lossless graph summarization to generate more concise graph storage formats. The lossless
            graph summarization aims to identify a compact representation of a large graph consisting
            of a summary graph and an edge correction set. We reformulate the problem of graph
            summarization as a policy learning and optimization problem, where summarizing a graph
            can be considered as making a sequence of supernode selection and merging decisions
            under the guidance of an optimized supernode selection policy. The contents of this
            dissertation are organized as follows: In Chapter 1 I introduce the preliminary concepts
            of graphs and existing solutions for graph representation learning, graph similarity
            computation, and graph summarization problems. In Chapter 2 I list the core definitions
            and related works for graphs and graph neural networks. In Chapter 3, I introduce
            the subgraph-based GNN training framework. In Chapter 4, I introduce the type-aware
            graph similarity learning and computation algorithm. In Chapter 5, I introduce the
            framework of graph summarization solutions, then propose a learning-enhanced graph
            summarization approach that can achieve cost-effective graph storage. In Chapter 6
            I list the potential research extensions based on the my existing projects and the
            upcoming research plan, and conclude the dissertation and my research works during
            my Ph.D. study in Chapter 7.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) has risen to alarming levels such that
            in 2020 CVD accounted for over 19 million deaths. Risk factors for CVD are advanced
            age, excess body mass and adipose tissue, and the frequent consumption of high carbohydrate
            (HC) meals that induce hyperglycemia. One of the key contributing mechanisms to the
            development of CVD is the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are highly
            unstable molecules that when in excess, overpower the body's natural antioxidant defense
            system and induce a state of oxidative stress. A prominent source of ROS generation
            in the vasculature is derived from the enzymatic activity of nicotinamide adenine
            dinucleotide phosphate oxidases (NOX), a group of multi-subunit transmembrane proteins.
            Furthermore, with rates of CVD so high it is crucial to find novel interventions to
            reduce the risk of CVD. Creatine monohydrate (CM), a popular performance supplement,
            has shown promise in reducing ROS concentrations and enhancing blood flow. Therefore,
            the aim of the dissertation is twofold, first to determine the impact of NOX produced
            ROS on skeletal muscle microvascular blood flow (SMBF) in older individuals with overweight/obesity.
            Second, to determine the effect of five days of CM supplementation on ROS concentrations
            and SMBF at rest and in response to a HC meal in individuals with overweight/obesity.
            Nine individuals had two microdialysis probes placed (control (CON) and apocynin (APO):
            NOX inhibitor) in skeletal muscle to measure in vivo ROS (Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2))
            concentrations and SMBF (ethanol outflow/inflow ratio, inversely related to blood
            flow) at rest and four hours post-meal consumption. Procedures were performed both
            before (PRE) and after (POST) five days of CM supplementation and PL supplementation
            (20 g/day). APO perfusion locally into skeletal muscle via microdialysis served as
            a potent suppressant of NOX-produced H2O2 concentrations following the consumption
            of a HC meal. However, this did not affect SMBF, dialysate glucose, lactate, or glycerol
            concentrations at rest or following the consumption of a HC meal. Furthermore, five
            days of CM supplementation had no effect on in vivo H2O2 concentrations or SMBF. Five
            days of CM supplementation did not lower skeletal muscle dialysate lactate concentrations
            at rest or following the administration of a HC meal. These data suggest that CM supplementation
            may not act as an antioxidant, elicit changes to SMBF, or improve metabolism via lactate
            reductions at rest or following the consumption of a HC meal in older adults with
            overweight/obesity. However, longer clinical trials are warranted to fully assess
            the effect of NOX and CM supplementation and on oxidative stress, vascular health,
            and metabolism in older adults with overweight/obesity.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This dissertation is comprised of three related projects, each of which explore the
            difficulties associated with information problems and imperfectly aligned incentives
            in dynamic organizational settings. The first chapter, co-authored with Luke Boosey,
            investigates coordination between parties who lack a common language through which
            to communicate their specialized procedures and, consequently, understand how to coordinate.
            We introduce a model of dynamic coordination with costly switching, where two players
            are in search of compatible platforms. In the efficient symmetric equilibrium, players
            remain on their current platforms with certainty if their common belief about compatibility
            lies above a cutoff belief (that depends on the switching cost) and otherwise mix
            between switching platforms and remaining on their current platforms. In the presence
            of switching costs, the equilibrium switching probability increases as the common
            belief converges toward zero, but remains below 0.5 for all beliefs. We conduct an
            experiment to test whether behavior supports the equilibrium predictions of the model,
            varying (i) whether success occurs deterministically or stochastically when players
            are on compatible platforms and (ii) the cost of switching platforms. Behavior is
            mostly in line with comparative statics predictions, especially for the Deterministic
            treatments, although subjects display a tendency to switch less (more) often than
            optimal when their common belief is low (high). Next, the second chapter examines
            how a decision maker optimally uses temporary and permanent disciplinary instruments
            to influence the quality of advice she receives from an adviser over time. I consider
            an infinite-horizon, repeated advice environment, where an adviser of privately known
            expertise, either competent or incompetent, recommends one of two options to a decision
            maker in each period. The decision maker chooses whether to "check" the adviser's
            recommendation prior to implementation in every period and then, following the public
            outcome, either continues or terminates the relationship. When checking is too costly,
            termination is the only instrument used in equilibrium, resulting in inefficient termination
            of competent advisers. When checking is sufficiently cheap, the decision maker never
            terminates the relationship, but frequent (costly) checking may occur. If competent
            advisers receive fully informative signals, an efficient, cooperative equilibrium
            can be supported through the use of continual checking (for low checking costs) or
            termination (for high checking costs), but this is no longer possible under a partially
            informative signal structure. In this case, the welfare of both competent advisers
            and decision makers can be improved when checking is cheaper, as this enables the
            use of probation periods following bad outcomes. Finally, the third chapter, co-authored
            with Luke Boosey, explores how the potential for misunderstanding between parties
            in a repeated interaction affects the informal relationships that evolve over time.
            We develop and analyze a principal-agent model with perfectly observed (but unenforceable)
            actions. In each period, the principal chooses a wage to advance to the agent, who
            then chooses to exert either high effort or low effort. Although high effort is more
            costly to the agent, it also increases the probability that the principal obtains
            a high project payoff. In this environment, we consider three types of unexpected
            shocks, with each shock increasing the expected total surplus in a high-effort equilibrium.
            The occurrence of such a shock raises the question of how an increase in surplus should
            be divided between the parties. Assuming the parties are only concerned with their
            own material payoffs, unexpected shocks that favor (or harm) one of the parties have
            no impact on the equilibrium constraint of the other party. Yet, considerations of
            fairness, equality, envy, or guilt may influence the way in which the parties adapt
            the terms of an established relational contract after an unexpected shock. To accommodate
            these kinds of considerations, we propose a model that uses a variation of the inequity-averse
            preferences of Fehr and Schmidt (1999) and show that, in the presence of inequity
            aversion, a high-effort equilibrium can be supported for a wide range of discount
            factors, provided that the equilibrium wage is sufficiently high. Moreover, the equilibrium
            wage range increases as the players become less patient and the principal becomes
            more sensitive to guilt.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Recent advancements in the field of deep learning have dramatically improved the performance
            of machine learning models in a variety of applications, including computer vision,
            text mining, speech processing and fraud detection among others.Deep learning algorithms
            automatically learn a set of informative features from a given dataset and have depicted
            commendable performance on a variety of computer vision applications. However, efficient
            training of deep learning architectures with a large number of hidden layers is mostly
            dependent on high-end GPUs and distributed computing infrastructures. Training a deep
            neural network often involves significant computational overhead. Some applications
            (such as those running on mobile platforms) are severely limited in terms of memory
            and computational resources. They have limited access to computational resources and
            face a fundamental challenge in handling large-scale training data. Cloud services
            can be leveraged for training but involve challenges with data privacy and cost. Such
            applications necessitate a subset selection algorithm to identify the informative
            samples from a large amount of training data, so that the deep network can be trained
            using only the selected subset. In the 2nd chapter we describe a novel subset selection
            algorithm, DeepSub, to address this practical challenge. Our framework is computationally
            efficient, easy to implement and also enjoys nice theoretical properties. Our extensive
            empirical studies on three challenging computer vision applications (face, handwritten
            digits and object recognition), using three popular deep learning architectures (AlexNet,
            GoogleNet and ResNet) corroborate the potential of DeepSub over competing baselines.
            We propose two novel frameworks to address this important and practical challenge
            in a slightly different configuration. We pose a budgeted subset selection problem
            as an NP-hard integer quadratic programming (IQP) problem and derive two convex relaxations
            to solve the same. Our extensive empirical studies on two challenging vision datasets,
            using four common deep learning models corroborate the potential of our framework
            for real-world, resource-constrained applications. Mini-batch gradient descent is
            the standard algorithm to train deep models, where mini-batches of a fixed size are
            sampled randomly from the training data and passed through the network sequentially.
            In the 3rd chapter, we present a novel algorithm to generate a deterministic sequence
            of minibatches to train a deep neural network (rather than a random sequence). Our
            rationale is to select a mini-batch by minimizing the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD)
            between the already selected mini-batches and the unselected training samples. We
            pose the mini-batch selection as a constrained optimization problem and derive a linear
            programming relaxation to determine the sequence of mini-batches. To the best of our
            knowledge, this is the first research effort that uses the MMD criterion to determine
            a sequence of mini-batches to train a deep neural network. The proposed mini-batch
            sequencing strategy is deterministic and independent of the underlying network architecture
            and prediction task. Our extensive empirical analyses on three challenging datasets
            corroborate the merit of our framework over competing baselines. We further study
            the performance of our framework on two other applications besides classification
            (regression and semantic segmentation) to validate its generalizability. In the 4th
            chapter we discusss a subset selection framework to determine the best testing subset
            when the training domain may or may not be same with the testing domain. We exploit
            the geometry of the unlabeled data to identify a batch of representative samples which
            can reconstruct the target data with minimal error. We pose the sample selection as
            an NP-hard optimization problem and solve it efficiently using an iterative algorithm,
            with global convergence. Our extensive empirical results on three benchmark image
            datasets, with several pre-trained deep neural networks, corroborate the promise and
            potential of our method for real-world applications.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Dimensions and measurements other than the viola's size are not generally discussed
            among viola players, even though they significantly impact playability and comfort.
            The dimensions and measurements of the string length, upper shoulders shape, middle
            bouts, lower bouts, neck thickness, fingerboard curvature, rib and arching height,
            and the instrument's weight are crucial in determining if an instrument is comfortable
            and will ergonomically suit the violist. The issue also is that the majority of viola
            players prioritize the instrument's tone when searching for a new viola, overlooking
            many dimensions and measurements that can substantially affect playability and, consequently,
            the player's performance and health. Moreover, the notion that "the bigger, the better"
            still permeates the minds of some viola players and luthiers alike, and it is commonly
            associated with the outdated concept that the viola should have the largest possible
            acoustic box to produce a darker and deeper sound.Part of the problem relies on the
            viola never being standardized, primarily because the viola was designed not as one
            instrument but as two different ones: a smaller alto, and a larger tenor. Moreover,
            the music of the middle 1500s, for which the violin-family instruments were designed,
            was quite simple. However, after centuries, the repertoire is now far more complex,
            and playing standards have evolved considerably, requiring the contemporary violist
            to have an instrument that would meet their needs in terms of sound but, equally importantly,
            playability. Fortunately, contemporary makers are becoming increasingly aware of the
            viola's dimensions versus playability and have been successfully finding solutions
            for this issue. Nevertheless, viola players still have limited information about the
            interaction of instrument and player, and generally rely on subjective perspectives
            when shopping for or commissioning a viola. This study aims to explore the dilemma
            of viola size versus playability and objectively discuss how specific viola dimensions
            and measurements directly impact playability, technique, and comfort. Another goal
            of this study is to guide the advanced viola player by establishing criteria for what
            could be considered an ideal viola. This involves examining the relationship between
            the performer's physical characteristics and the instrument itself in order to formulate
            parameters that will determine which specific measurements and dimensions of the non-standard
            viola impact playability. Such discussion can be particularly relevant since finding
            a professional-level instrument can be challenging, time-consuming, and financially
            risky.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x (Bi-2212) is a promising candidate for ultra-high field magnets (&gt;25
            T) because of its round wire geometry, twisted multifilamentary architecture, and
            macroscopically isotropic electromagnetic properties. However, in composite superconductors,
            the local critical current may vary due to variable vortex pinning interactions and
            variations in filament connectivity arising from filament shape variation and grain-to-grain
            connectivity variations, particularly in high-temperature superconductors. The critical
            current density (Jc) in Bi-2212 round wires is high [Jc (30 T, 4.2 K) = 4600 A/mm2],
            but can fluctuate by 30–40% between wires, due to a complex interplay of powder quality,
            filament uniformity, and the conditions of overpressure heat treatment (OP-HT), especially
            the highest temperature of the OP-HT. We here report on an extensive study of the
            critical current distributions in ~1.5 m long samples of wire manufactured in km lengths
            by Bruker-Oxford Superconducting Technology (Bruker-OST) using d2V/dI2 analyses of
            the V-I curves measured on ITER-like barrels. The transitions are well-fitted by Gaussian
            distributions characterized by their relative standard deviations (σ/μ). This dissertation
            details experiments characterizing the influence of OP-HT parameters, filament separation,
            powder quality, and oxygen doping on the supercurrent path connectivity. We show that
            the highest Jc values occur for minimum time-in-the-melt (tmelt) and lower maximum
            temperature (Tmax) during OP-HT and they also correspond to significantly lower σ/μ
            values. We attribute the degradation of properties that occurs with higher Tmax to
            decreasing filament connectivity associated with deteriorating texture due to filament
            merging during the melt step of the OP-HT. Having obtained systematic results on the
            variation of σ/μ as a function of heat treatment conditions, we then applied this
            analysis to short sections cut from both ends of test magnets wound with about 200
            m of wire, to understand the extent of systematic variations in the ~1 km length wires
            being delivered by Bruker-OST. We found that recent Engi-Mat fine-particle powder
            wires have significantly higher Jc and significantly lower σ/μ than found in earlier
            Bruker-OST wires made with milled Nexans granulate powder. We find it interesting
            that (i) there are clear trends that Jc rises as σ/μ declines and (ii) that the σ/μ
            values are only about twice as high as fully optimized Nb-47 wt.%Ti wires, which unlike
            Bi-2212 are isotropic, fully connected and with only one single value of irreversibility
            field (Hirr). Furthermore, our investigation into the long-length uniformity of a
            10 Kg Bi-2212 billet reveals that a kilometer-length conductor is macroscopically
            uniform with a σ/μ ratio almost independent of position along the ~1.2 km conductor.
            We attribute this to good fabrication practice by Bruker-OST and by the averaging
            effects of ~1000 filaments that render the complex critical current path functionally
            uniform along the wire length, in spite of many local percolation paths within each
            filament. Finally, we report on the nature of the current path after deoxygenation
            of an initially overdoped wire in its highest Jc state. We find that the current path
            did not change significantly by deoxygenation, at least at the relatively high and
            broad range of electric field (E) accessed by d2V/dI2. However, gradual deoxygenation
            reveals two separate current paths that become evident in transition temperature (Tc)
            measurements. We attribute these two transitions either to dissipation due to flux
            flow within the ab-planes and also to flux flow at grain boundaries. Within a model
            that ascribes high Jc in polycrystalline Bi-2212 to its strong biaxial texture, we
            see the current-limiting obstacles as either occurring at grain boundaries obstructing
            ab-plane supercurrent or to the c-axis current flow required to transfer supercurrent
            from grain to grain when the ab-plane paths are blocked. The very special microstructure
            of Bi-2212 in which long [100]-oriented grains stack with other well-oriented [100]
            grains confers a large grain boundary (GB) area for c-axis current flow. A plausible
            interpretation of our deoxygenation experiments is that this c-axis transport is markedly
            degraded by underdoping that drives the c-axis from the SNS or even SS'S state when
            overdoped into a strongly Josephson-coupled SIS state, with degraded c-axis Ic. These
            experiments show that much can be learned about current flow in complex Bi-2212 wires
            even though we believe that many independent characteristics control the current flow.
            We are hopeful that having such analytical tools for identifying the distribution
            of critical currents and the way that the dominant dissipation mechanisms change with
            doping will enable further Jc enhancement in what are already very high Jc conductors.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The expansion and development of extended techniques for horn have greatly increased
            since its invention. Many composers today continually push the advancement of these
            techniques through modern music. It is in these advancements that the physical capabilities
            of hornists and their instruments have been forgotten, as much of new music today
            is impractical for the instrument. Composers must study the instrument, its limitations,
            and the limitations of performers to better understand best practices to push the
            advancement of extended techniques. Through surveying several works by composers such
            as Gustav Mahler, Richard Strauss, and others, modern day composers will have a better
            understanding of the physical limitations of the instrument and how to compose in
            a practical manner for its performers. This treatise will provide important information
            regarding these techniques, examples of the ideal and unideal musical lines demonstrating
            these techniques, and interviews with several composers who both play and write well
            for the modern horn.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Vally Weigl was an Austrian-American composer who lived from 1894-1982. She and her
            husband Karl Weigl, also a composer, fled Vienna in 1938 after the Nazi annexation
            of Austria due to their Jewish heritage. The Weigls were aided as refugees by the
            Quakers; upon arriving in America, the Weigls converted to the Quaker faith, and Vally
            in particular spent the rest of her life working tirelessly towards the Quaker goals
            of peace, equality, and tolerance. Vally believed in the power of music to make the
            world a better place and lived out this value in her work as a music therapist, political
            activist, and composer of pacifist music. This treatise seeks to introduce Vally's
            music to a wider audience as she remains widely unknown to twenty-first century musicians.
            A comprehensive biography shows how Vally overcame numerous challenges, often by turning
            to music and its healing, communicative, and professional facilities. A literature
            review explains how the author found primary and secondary source information on a
            composer about whom little has been written or published. The pacifist views Vally
            embraced in the later part of her life became central to her musical work as a concert
            organizer, composer, and performer. This treatise examines a number of Vally's politically
            involved compositions she wrote for choir or vocal chamber ensemble as well as Vally's
            other activist work with various Quaker and pacifist organizations.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>With just 43% of community college students graduating within six years (Causey et
            al., 2022b), low graduation rates have been the defining, animating issue for community
            colleges for over a decade (Cutler &amp; White, 2022). Concurrently, high-impact practices
            (HIPs) have proven enormously successful in improving student outcomes at higher education
            institutions throughout the country (Hu et al., 2008; Kilgo et al., 2015; McDaniel
            &amp; Van Jura, 2022). Undergraduate research (UR) is an especially impactful HIP, with
            prior studies showing increases in academic performance, retention, graduation rates,
            and self-efficacy (Crews, 2013; Henkel, 2006; Linn et al., 2015). More importantly,
            UR has shown promise in improving outcomes for traditionally underrepresented minority
            students, who make up much of community college enrollment nationwide (Awong-Taylor
            et al., 2016; Milem, 2005; Santos &amp; Reigadas, 2004). Yet in spite of these impressive
            outcomes, UR remains rare at community colleges. A small number of institutions, however,
            have implemented UR successfully (Awong-Taylor et al., 2016; Hensel, 2021; Nerio et
            al., 2019), but few studies have examined how and why these programs have grown to
            become so successful within the unique context of the American community college.
            This qualitative multiple case study sought to fill that gap, exploring the implementation
            processes of highly successful UR programs at three geographically diverse community
            colleges, one located in a large city in the Northeast, one in a suburban community
            in the Pacific Northwest, and one in a rural community in the Great Lakes region.
            Data were drawn from interviews with faculty and administrators involved in the implementation
            of each institution's UR program, as well as from analysis of program documents, such
            as internal reports, labor contracts, and marketing materials. Findings indicated
            that national organizations provided critical support to these three community colleges
            as they implemented UR. Additionally, it was found that two UR models, course-based
            undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) and community-based undergraduate research
            (CBUR) dominated all three institutions' UR implementations. And findings indicated
            that these three institutions sustained their UR programs through a combination of
            faculty-led administration of the programs, support from system-level administrators,
            and strategies aimed at managing the costs of UR in the specific context of the community
            college.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Interpersonal conflict is inevitable as college students live together in residence
            halls with new and different people (Bresnahan et al., 2009; Ferguson &amp; Lareau, 2021;
            Fosnacht et al., 2020; Harwood et al., 2012; Morgan et al., 2019; Shook &amp; Fazio, 2008).
            Whether the conflict stems from small miscommunications to mismatched value systems,
            microaggressions, or bias, unresolved conflict can result in loss of sleep, lack of
            focus, a decreased sense of belonging, as well as lower retention and graduation rates
            (Acquah, 2016; Ferguson &amp; Lareau, 2021; Fosnacht et al., 2020; Hawken et al., 1991;
            McClain &amp; Perry, 2017; Morales, 2021; Sanchez et al., 2018). Traditional modes of
            conflict resolution prioritize White, middle-class norms and can impact first-generation
            and students of color more negatively at Historically White Institutions (HWIs) (Bresnahan
            et al., 2009; Chua &amp; Gudykunst, 1987; Ferguson &amp; Lareau, 2021; Hammer, 2005; Harwood
            et al., 2012; Wing &amp; Marya, 2013). The goal of this exploratory critical narrative
            inquiry (Merriam &amp; Tisdell, 2016) was to understand how first-generation, Pell-eligible,
            and students of color experience and manage interpersonal conflict in the residence
            halls at an HWI. Using participatory action research methods during a scaffolded,
            interactive focus group, the study's participants engaged in counterstorytelling,
            identified themes, and generated solutions to help students navigate future conflict
            more effectively (Baum et al., 2006; Delgado &amp; Stefancic, 2017; Fine et al., 2021;
            Martinez, 2020; Rutledge et al., 2021; Seaman, 2008). In this study, participants
            experienced interpersonal conflict and felt disrespected when others crossed cultural
            boundaries related to communication and community living. Only half of the participants
            communicated directly regarding the conflict, even fewer reached out for help, and
            only 25% of students were able to effectively resolve the conflict. Instead, participants
            utilized coping skills that prioritized relationships, as well as avoiding or deescalating
            the conflict. Participants desired deeper relationships with the students around them
            and intentional university strategies to build their confidence, communication, and
            relationship building skills. Additional recommendations included enhancing culturally
            responsive conflict resolution education for students and Resident Assistants, improving
            the roommate assignment and agreement processes, and utilizing personal outreach measures
            to boost the use of campus resources.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The study of symphonic excerpts plays a pivotal role in the education and development
            of brass players, offering valuable musical contexts for refinement of essential skills.
            For tuba players, mastering excerpts is crucial for showcasing proficiency and readiness
            in audition settings, particularly for premier military bands. However, while extensive
            resources exist for orchestral excerpt preparation, there is a notable gap in guidance
            tailored specifically to military band audition excerpts. This treatise aims to address
            this disparity by investigating effective preparation strategies for premier military
            band audition excerpts, comparing them to the more widely studied orchestral tuba
            excerpts. Through interviews with six current premier military band tubists, technical
            challenges and common audition pitfalls specific to military band excerpts are identified.
            Prescriptive practice approaches are then delineated, targeting fundamental issues
            while emphasizing their application to the execution of each excerpt. By bridging
            the knowledge gap between orchestral and military band audition excerpts, this study
            provides tuba players with a comprehensive framework for effective preparation. Through
            systematic practice and informed strategies, aspiring tubists can enhance their readiness
            and proficiency in premier military band auditions, ultimately fostering greater success
            and confidence in their musical endeavors.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>An examination of the world through the eyes of a cinephile, Splice is a collection
            of lyrical and intertextual poems that meditate on identity, artistic inspiration,
            the evocative power of the visual image, and the paradox of living in a body that
            is both confining and liberating. Expanding on the ekphrastic tradition, these poems
            translate the silver screen to the poetic line, using linebreaks, formal topography,
            and musicality to analogize cinematic elements and celebrate the lasting influence
            of Hollywood icons like Alfred Hitchcock, Terry Gilliam, Martin Scorsese, Frances
            McDormand, Tilda Swinton, and Bill Murray. At the same time, they narrate the poet's
            personal journey as he navigates the physical and mental effects of a rare neurological
            condition called Chiari Malformation. Bringing attention to this overlooked condition
            and likening the space of the poem to both the cinematic and surgical theater, Splice
            celebrates the transformative power of poetry and its penchant for provocative recombinations.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The marketing literature on consumer responses to environmentally friendly programs,
            products, and communications (together referred to as "green initiatives") is widely
            diverse in operationalizations and definitions, varied in outcomes and moderators,
            and limited in comparable characteristics. The three essays proposed for this dissertation
            offer a reconciliation of this broad literature stream and empirically test a new
            conceptualization of green perceptions, developed with a grounded theory approach.
            This dissertation offers three contributions to the literature. First, a comprehensive
            model based on a systematic review of the existing literature is offered. Second,
            a new conceptualization of green perceptions, the first to be multidimensional, is
            developed and tested. Third, this new conceptualization is nomologically validated
            across different types of green initiatives.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The transition to college represents a pivotal period in the lives of young adults,
            marked by the promise of growth and new opportunities. However, it is also a time
            when students commonly experience mental health challenges. This dissertation explores
            the intricate dynamics of Florida State University faculty members' knowledge, attitudes,
            and willingness to support students confronting mental health issues. The study is
            anchored in the recognition that faculty members play a critical role in students'
            academic and personal development. This research explored the relationships between
            FSU faculty's knowledge, attitudes, and willingness to support students dealing with
            mental health concerns. Employing a quantitative approach, the study gathers data
            to illuminate faculty experiences and perceptions. Key findings indicate that most
            faculty members at FSU engage in frequent face-to-face interactions with students,
            highlighting their pivotal roles in academic instruction and overall student support.
            A notable 98% of participants reported having taught a student with mental health
            concerns, underscoring the prevalence of these issues within classrooms. While the
            study reveals high scores in faculty knowledge, positive attitudes, and willingness
            to support students, opportunities for continuous professional development persist.
            The recommendations from this research advocate for ongoing investments in faculty
            training and preparedness, emphasizing the importance of collaboration between faculty
            and student support services. The study concludes by acknowledging FSU's commendable
            efforts and offering concrete recommendations for further improvement. By implementing
            these recommendations, FSU can create a more supportive and informed faculty better
            equipped to meet the diverse needs of students experiencing mental health concerns.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The Six Sonatas for Solo Violin, Op. 27, are the most successful and widely performed
            compositions of Belgian violinist and composer, Eugène-Auguste Ysaÿe (1858–1931).
            Not only did Ysaÿe use highly innovative techniques and revolutionize the way of writing
            for the instrument, but he did so with exceptional artistic and conceptual creativity.
            Ysaÿe dedicated each sonata to a prominent violinist of his era: Joseph Szigeti, Jacques
            Thibaud, George Enescu, Fritz Kreisler, Mathieu Crickboom, and Manuel Quiroga. The
            dedications serve not only as a testament to the composer's admiration for these musicians
            but also play a crucial role in shaping the composition of the set. This treatise
            seeks to highlight the creative process that brought this innovative set of sonatas
            to light. It is widely acknowledged that each sonata is intended to suit the performing
            and compositional style of its dedicatee. However, very little has been written about
            how such a process is carried out or in what aspects it manifests itself. Neither
            Ysaÿe nor his family, friends, and biographers revealed sufficient information in
            regard to this compositional process. For this reason, each sonata will be systematically
            analyzed with the intent of uncovering the most significant connections between them
            and their dedicatees. Other analytical elements that do not serve this particular
            purpose will not be included or will not be examined in detail for the sake of clarity.
            These analyses will prove that Ysaÿe's approach to each sonata differs significantly
            based on the characteristics of the dedicatees, their artistic predispositions and
            predilections, and the type and nature of their relationship with Ysaÿe himself. When
            the dedicatee is also a composer, as seen in the case of Enescu and Kreisler, Ysaÿe
            adjusts his approach accordingly, considering their compositional style and even specific
            works with which he was familiar. The first and third chapters of this treatise will
            also delve into the matter of organicity and structural coherence, providing reasons
            to support Ysaÿe's ability to impart an overall sense of unity to the set despite
            its inherent eclectic and stylistically diverse nature.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This dissertation traces the history of the Confederate Episcopal Church and its subsequent
            historiography to untangle the relationship between the Episcopal Church, white supremacy,
            and the Lost Cause. I begin in the 1850s and work to track the history and historiography
            of this short-lived denomination through to 1915. The Confederate Episcopal Church
            only existed from 1861 until 1865 but counted many Confederate leaders among its ranks
            and had Confederate general as one of its bishops. The bishops argued that its creation
            was due to political necessity, but that argument ignores the personal economic investment
            many in the denomination had in the protection of slavery. I employ a large source
            base of letters, journals, manuscripts, institutional records, and sermons to track
            how the Confederate bishops understood their relationship to slavery publicly and
            privately. I then follow how those bishops obscured those views during the Civil War
            and early Reconstruction. After, I investigate how later historians and biographers
            contributed to a Lost Cause view of this denomination through hagiographic writing
            and intentional editing of sources. This dissertation contends that white supremacy
            has always been a part of the Episcopal Church in the American South, but that it
            went unremarked within church histories due to a lack of critical engagement by scholars.
            This is a history that draws on the insights of Civil War scholarship, slavery studies,
            Black feminist thought, histories of Southern religion, and church history. I offer
            it both as a corrective to the history of the Episcopal Church in the nineteenth century
            American South and a case study for how church history might confront the underlying
            white supremacy within our scholarly roots.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The field of speech language pathology has made continuous efforts to center cultural
            responsivity in clinical practice in order to adhere to systematic shifts aimed at
            centering equity for all individuals. However, it is necessary to examine how speech-language
            pathologists (SLPs) manage the demands of culturally responsive practice when assessing
            writing quality for students with diverse linguistic profiles; especially given the
            general requirements for written works to use "standard" English. As such, the present
            study sought to examine how narratives written by Black second grade students are
            rated by Black and White SLPs. Forty-two SLPs were presented with a total of four
            narratives written by two Black students in the second grade. One of the students
            had a linguistic profile more consistent with African American English dialect (Student
            A) and the other student had a linguistic profile more consistent with General American
            English (Student B). SLPs were provided with the Common Core writing standards for
            second grade and rated a personal and fictional narrative written by each of the students
            using a seven-point rating scale. SLPs also completed a demographic questionnaire
            to provide more information about their clinical background and previous experiences.
            Results found that Student B's fictional narrative was rated the highest, whereas
            Student A's personal narrative was rated the lowest. Comparative analyses were conducted
            to examine group differences based on SLPs' previous training experience, previous
            experience working with written language, years of experience and by the dialect the
            SLPs' reported speaking. None of the group differences yielded statistically significant
            results, except for SLPs who reported being bidialectal favoring Student B's personal
            narrative. Results from a two-level mixed effects model also found that the child's
            linguistic profile and the type of narrative told had a significant influence on the
            ratings, however, SLP race did not. Implications of these findings suggest the presence
            of a pervasive language ideology that upholds the notion of language standardization
            in writing. Continued work is needed to promote equitable practices that would address
            the presence of this ideology in writing, and to redefine ideals of "quality" so that
            they include speakers with diverse linguistic repertoires.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This case study explored the stories and lived experiences of BIPOC choral music faculty.
            Eight participants took part in the study. Four participants were assistant rank professors,
            four participants were associate rank professors, four identified as Black, three
            as Asian, and one as Latinx. Three participants identified as male, four as female,
            and one as gender fluid. A case study design helped highlight individual experiences
            while finding commonalities within participant stories. I selected Critical Race Theory
            (CRT) and the Fanonian theory of 'safety' as the conceptual framework for this study.
            Three themes emerged from the data: (1) Engaging in (un)safe spaces, (2) Diversity
            tax, and (3) Identity intersectionality. The theme Engaging in (un)safe spaces described
            frustration participants felt towards perfunctory DEI initiatives. Participants described
            invisible labor and psychical violence that resulted from BIPOC individuals' diversity
            tax. Lastly, identity intersectionality played an integral role in the participants'
            lived experiences because participant identities were influenced by notions of tokenism,
            authenticity, and impostor phenomenon. The findings of this study can provide music
            units with the knowledge needed to surpass perfunctory diversity initiatives and truly
            honor the lived experiences of BIPOC individuals.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This dissertation contends that scholars should incorporate a concern for the suffering
            of those most vulnerable as a criterion for evaluating the merits of works of theological
            ethics. It does so by considering four case studies in which works of Christian theology
            and ethics are evaluated using this criterion within their sociohistorical, traditional,
            and philosophical contexts. It contends that each of these four positions possess
            lacunae that could have been avoided by a closer attention to the lived experiences
            of vulnerable people, especially the poor, women, BIPOC individuals, and LGBTQ+ individuals.
            This dissertation serves as a work of liberation theology that asks ethicists, scholars
            of religion, and theologians alike to attend to the material impacts of their work
            upon vulnerable communities and to treat these communities, ultimately, as theologically
            innovative and as sources for theological and moral reflection.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Religion and spirituality are associated with many positive outcomes for partners
            in committed relationships. Couples with a greater religiosity and spirituality have
            better relationship quality and greater relationship stability. However, research
            highlights a paradox in which these findings do not translate the same for African
            American couples in that though they report greater importance and prevalence of religion
            and spirituality, these couples have poorer relationship outcomes, particularly related
            to marriage. Scholars have found that consequences of historic and present-day racism
            and discrimination create unique challenges for African American couples in the formation
            and maintenance of committed relationships. This is of significance because partnership,
            especially marriage, offers individual and systemic benefits to those within it. Spirituality
            consistently appears as a significant factor for this population and an increasing
            number of studies have found it to be associated with positive relationship outcomes
            for African American couples. Hope is related to spirituality and has been found to
            be protective against the negative effects of racism and discrimination for African
            American individuals. This study sought to investigate how hope moderates the relationship
            between spirituality and relationship outcomes and qualitatively explored African
            American couples' views of the impact of spirituality and religion on their relationship
            satisfaction. The Relational Spirituality Framework was used as a guide to discuss
            how the interplay of spirituality and relationship outcomes operates for African American
            couples.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Concerto for Piano and Strings presented herein is a single-movement opus for piano
            and string orchestra that delves deep into the labyrinth of human emotion. Drawing
            inspiration from a diverse array of sources, with a particular nod to Alfred Schnittke's
            evocative Concerto for Piano and String Orchestra, this composition embarks on a visceral
            journey through the complexities of the human psyche. At its core, this concerto is
            a study in contrasts—an exploration of the tension between Romantic lyricism and uncompromising
            dissonance, between the ethereal beauty of soaring melodies and the haunting stillness
            of static textures. Much like the human experience itself, the music traverses the
            heights of passion and the depths of despair, weaving together a tapestry of emotions
            that resonate with raw intensity. The influence of Schnittke's masterwork is present
            throughout, infusing the composition with a sense of urgency and existential weight.
            A language of dense, tortuous harmonies and angular melodies is employed to evoke
            a world teetering on the brink of chaos—a world where beauty and brutality intertwine
            in a delicate balance. Yet, the concerto is not beholden solely to Schnittke's aesthetic
            vision; rather, it draws from a rich tapestry of musical influences, including Christopher
            Rouse's visceral piano concerto "Seeing," Rachmaninoff's iconic Second Piano Concerto,
            the bold, angular compositions of Sergei Prokofiev, and the wildly expressive piano
            works of Michael Finnissy. These influences manifest in the concerto's multifaceted
            approach to orchestration, its juxtaposition of contrasting themes and textures, and
            its relentless pursuit of emotional authenticity. Concerto for Piano and Strings is,
            at its heart, a meditation on the human experience—a testament to the complexity of
            our inner worlds and the myriad emotions that course through our veins. It is a journey
            through the darkest recesses of the soul and the soaring heights of transcendence—a
            symphony of joy and sorrow, hope and despair, love and loss.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>I examine the effect of the change from incurred loss model to the current expected
            credit loss (CECL) model on mortgage lending. I find that the extent that the CECL
            model under ASC 326 exacerbates the lending disparities for low-income and minority
            (LIM) borrowers is dependent on banks' choice of relief. I find banks who opted for
            regulatory relief that defers CECL's effect on regulatory capital, but not net income,
            decreased lending to LIM borrowers in preparation for and after enactment of ASC 326.
            In contrast, banks who opted for statutory relief that defers CECL's effect on both
            regulatory capital and net income did not reduce lending to LIM borrowers. Banks who
            opted for no relief decreased lending to LIM borrowers after enactment of ASC 326.
            This study highlights how the choice of relief (regulatory, statutory or no relief),
            which is heavily influenced by investor pressure, can have real consequences for LIM
            borrowers.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This research delves into the lived experiences of individuals with mixed/multicultural
            backgrounds in the United States, spurred by the researcher's introspection during
            the COVID-19 pandemic and a personal journey navigating systemic oppression. Employing
            a hermeneutic phenomenological methodology, the study aims to not only elucidate the
            experiences of mixed/multicultural individuals through the medium of art-making but
            also to probe the researcher's own identity. The investigation centers on the transformative
            efficacy of art-making, with the objectives of addressing and mitigating anxiety and
            confusion, challenging prevailing power dynamics, establishing a sense of place and
            belonging, and fostering self-acceptance among those with mixed/multicultural identities.
            This exploration yields valuable insights into the intricate intersections of identity,
            lived experiences, and the therapeutic dimensions of artistic expression. The utilization
            of response art and epochs assisted myself as the researcher in navigating personal
            biases and beliefs, enabling me to bracket these factors aside to maintain curiosity
            and focus. This aspect of hermeneutic phenomenology contributes to a clear understanding
            of the interpretation of data that informs other scholars on the necessity of exploring
            their own experiences to uphold objectivity. Furthermore, this study invites fellow
            therapist-researchers to incorporate art as a tool for cultural humility practice
            and to explore shared intersections, not solely with participants but also with clients.</p>

            by Ivan Turgenev. I will explain how Kollontay expresses through music unique emotions
            in response to narrated events from Turgenev's literary works. The second chapter
            examines Arzoumanov's Op. 74, "27 Easy Pieces." I will document and explain the musical
            references embedded in these work that draw upon Arzoumanov's personal experience
            living in Russia during the Soviet era and his educational journey. Both composers
            demonstrate a keen awareness of their Russian cultural background, and creatively
            present observed cultural elements in their music.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are recognized as an excellent alternative
            to embryonic stem cells in the fields of regenerative medicine, in vitro model construction,
            and drug discovery. Given the challenge of limited passages to primary cells from
            patients, the use of hiPSCs has greatly facilitated diverse studies aiming to recapitulate
            physiological and pathological mechanisms. This approach has led to the development
            of more precise disease modeling platforms. Furthermore, the investigation of the
            interaction between hiPSCs and extracellular matrix(ECM) at the 3D level, and subsequently
            modeling the central nervous system, such as the blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB)
            and blood brain barrier (BBB), has been investigated to a limited extent. Therefore,
            the first objective of this study is to investigate the interaction between hiPSC-derived
            organoid differentiation and 3D scaffold or hydrogel network. The second objective
            is to utilize hiPSC-derived organoids to construct a 3D in vitro model that can recapitulate
            structures and functionalities similar to those in the human body, such as the BSCB.
            Models of the BBB have been explored for decades, and the transition from 2D to 3D
            modeling methods has been well-established. However, the authentic BBB involves fluid
            blood, exerting shear stress on the endothelial cell layer. Thus, there is a need
            for the development of a dynamic BBB structure to enhance BBB modeling.Auxetic materials
            are those capable of displaying a negative Poisson's ratio, which indicates the degree
            to which a material contracts or expands transversally when axially strained. Human
            stem cells are sensitive to the mechanical properties of their microenvironment, including
            surface properties, stiffness, and Poisson's ratio. In this study, six different auxetic
            polyurethane (PU) foams with varying elastic moduli (0.7-1.8 kPa) and Poisson's ratios
            (-0.1 to -0.5) were fabricated to investigate lineage specification of human induced
            pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). The cells exhibited differential adherent density
            and differentiation capacity on different auxetic foams. Surface modification with
            chitosan and heparin promoted hindbrain and hippocampal markers, but not forebrain
            markers, during neural patterning of hiPSCs. Furthermore, properly surface-engineered
            auxetic scaffolds could enhance vascular differentiation of hiPSCs. This study presents
            a versatile and multifunctional scaffold fabrication approach that could lead to the
            development of a suitable system for establishing hiPSC culture models for applications
            in neurovascular disease modeling. The spinal cord is also a important components
            of central nervous system (CNS) and controls the different motions of the human body.
            The injury of spinal cord (SCI) also cause disability with less effective repairing
            method. Hence, the development of specific spinal cord organoids(hSCOs) for SCI treatment
            is necessary. Based on methylacrylated (MA) hyaluronic acid (HA), different HA hydrogels
            for generation and vascularization of spinal cord organoids derived from hiPSCs. In
            particular, the effects of viscoelasticity of the HA hydrogels on spinal cord organoid
            patterning were investigated. The morphogenesis, regional patterning, and vascularization
            of human spinal cord organoids (hSCOs) were influenced by different hydrogels. Dorsal
            marker expression was evaluated where more viscoelastic hydrogels can promote dorsal
            marker expression, while softer hydrogels resulted in higher interneuron marker expression.
            This study also found differences when generating the blood-spinal cord barrier with
            the coculture of hSCOs and human blood vessel organoids. In addition, Yes-associated
            protein nuclear translocation was determined to reveal the mechanism of cell-ECM mechano-transduction.
            Moreover, the hiPSC-derived blood vessel organoids were cocultured with hSCOs and
            pericytes for making transwell and 3D micro fluidic BSCB models. Lastly, hiPSCs exhibit
            multipotency, allowing them to differentiate into various cell types or tissues, making
            them valuable for applications in tissue engineering and injury repair. Nevertheless,
            hiPSCs pose significant challenges due to low consistency in target cell differentiation
            and a tendency for cancer-like infinite proliferation. [Furthermore, the impact of
            shear stress on the secretion and cargo profiles of hiPSC-derived organoids, particularly
            extracellular vesicles (EVs) such as the subset 'exosomes,' is recognized. [Comment:
            Consider clarifying how shear stress impacts the secretion and cargo profiles of hiPSC-derived
            organoids for greater clarity.] Exosomes show promising potential as an alternative
            in stem cell therapy to some extent. Additionally, encapsulating them with different
            hydrogels can be explored to control the rate of EV release.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Collegiate athletes are at risk of exposure to crises-like outcomes when transitioning
            out of their sport. These outcomes include anxiety (Alfermann, 2000), depression (Brewer
            et al., 1993), reduced self-worth, identity confusion (Park et al., 2013), and social
            dysfunction (Blakelock et al., 2016; Brown &amp; Potrac, 2009; Gouttebarge et al., 2016).
            This study involved the development and testing of an intervention aimed at reducing
            these outcomes. Specifically, the intervention was developed to educate collegiate
            student-athletes about the potential challenges and psychological changes they could
            expect to experience when retiring from their sport, and to offer strategies that
            the student-athletes can employ when navigating these retirement difficulties. Participants
            recruited for the study were current NCAA collegiate student-athletes in the United
            States. Measures included participants' knowledge of the retirement process, their
            behaviors in preparation for the retirement process, their perceptions of social support,
            and athletic identity. Participants completed a pre-test comprising these measures.
            Participants were then randomly assigned to a control or treatment group. Participants
            in the control group viewed a 14-minute sport retirement video presentation about
            facts about NCAA retirement (e.g., advanced education attainment among NCAA student-athletes)
            that were not theorized to be related to the key challenges of retirement or relevant
            coping strategies. The treatment group viewed a 14-minute sport retirement education
            video presentation that concerned concepts theorized to be related to the key challenges
            of retirement and relevant coping strategies. Participants then completed a post-test
            and a four-week follow-up test comprising the study measures. Findings revealed that,
            in relation to the control condition, the intervention significantly increased participants'
            perceived knowledge about sport retirement challenges, but had no significant effect
            on the remaining variables. In conclusion, this study has provided some evidence that
            the intervention developed for this study might be useful in raising awareness in
            student-athletes of the retirement process. Applied implications of this research
            study are considered for student-athletes, coaches, parents, and sport organizations
            including the NCAA. Recommended avenues of future research are also outlined.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Pre-service science teachers develop their teaching practices within and across the
            university and school contexts of their teacher education programs. The practices
            and visions of teaching and learning emphasized in each context are often disjointed,
            a problem referred to as the "two-worlds pitfall." Responding to the call for teacher
            education programs to better support pre-service teachers' work towards teaching that
            is responsive to students' thinking, this study is situated within the university
            and subsequent school contexts of a teacher education program. Taking an asset-based
            approach to pre-service teachers' learning, this study understood pre-service teachers
            as agentive sense makers as they appropriated teaching practices across contexts.
            Three pre-service science teachers participated in this qualitative case study, and
            the research question about how pre-service teachers appropriated teaching practices
            across the school and university contexts relied on the development of case narratives
            from analysis of interview materials, lesson planning documents, and teaching observation.
            These case narratives distilled central teaching practices through which pre-service
            teachers processes of appropriation could be understood. The findings highlight how
            pre-service teachers' appropriation of practices across contexts aligned with their
            orientation to students' thinking as problems or as resources, and that their appropriation
            and orientations to students' thinking were consistent across the contexts of the
            two-worlds pitfall. Pre-service teachers' experiences with tensions in their school
            contexts highlighted their agency to maintain, re-envision, and reject the visions
            of teaching that did or did not align with their patterns of appropriation and orientations
            to students' thinking that were consistent across contexts. As such, this study challenges
            traditional models of the two-worlds pitfall that anticipate significant shifts in
            pre-service teachers' practices across contexts. Rather, this study highlights the
            availability of productive ideas about responsive and rigorous instruction in pre-service
            teachers' thinking, and missed opportunities for teacher educators to draw out and
            leverage those ideas to support pre-service teachers' development of teaching that
            capitalizes on students' thinking.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This comprehensive study explores the experiences of underrepresented students who
            have participated in informal science education programs at the American Museum of
            Natural History (AMNH). Using qualitative methods, including interviews and participant
            observations, the research uncovers transformative insights shaping the educational
            landscape.The study focuses on 10 students who have participated in the AMNH Lang
            Program, an Informal Science Education (ISE) initiative for New York City students
            starting in the fifth grade and ending in the twelfth grade. Semi-structured interviews
            provided data, which was analyzed using a combination of a priori, in vivo, and values
            coding. A central finding reveals the holistic impact of these programs on students'
            academic trajectories, acting as catalysts for broadening horizons and discovering,
            and in some cases reaffirming STEM passions. The holistic influence of out-of-school
            time learning through ISE challenges conventional notions of informal education's
            impact on a student's entire educational journey. Emphasizing the tangible role of
            hands-on experiences, participants of this study highlighted the significance of physically
            engaging with scientific concepts by bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge
            and real-world applications.Beyond academics, the study uncovers the profound role
            of ISE programs in shaping the identity of underrepresented students within the STEM
            community. These programs become pivotal in forming a STEM identity, dispelling stereotypes,
            and empowering students to see themselves as integral members of the scientific community.
            Mentorship emerges as a powerful force, with mentors sharing similar backgrounds crucial
            in guiding students through academic and career complexities. Tailored mentorship
            programs for underrepresented students serve as inspirational anchors beyond immediate
            educational contexts. Intrinsic motivation derived from enjoyable science-based experiences
            within the programs is emphasized, suggesting that incorporating enjoyment into STEM
            education enhances long-term commitment. The development of a supportive community
            among participants and peers is highlighted as a motivational ecosystem, contributing
            to sustained motivation and shared commitment to success. Participants draw a clear
            link between program involvement and the decision to pursue STEM-related degrees and
            careers, emphasizing the enduring impact on long-term career trajectories. These insights
            contribute to the discourse on the effectiveness of informal science education programs,
            promoting diversity and inclusion within STEM. Recommendations for administrators,
            leaders, practitioners, and researchers include expanding hands-on experiences, strengthening
            mentorship programs, promoting diversity, and facilitating collaborative efforts between
            formal and informal education. Implementing these recommendations can create more
            inclusive, impactful, and effective informal science education programs for underrepresented
            students, both locally and within the larger educational landscape. This study serves
            as a roadmap for transformative action, ensuring that underrepresented students not
            only enter but thrive in the dynamic STEM landscape that fuels U.S. innovation.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This dissertation implements three studies related to understanding the impacts of
            groundwater-surface water interactions on both the aquatic geochemistry and water
            quantity of karst spring systems. The first study examined aquifer and spring geochemistry
            following a series of sinkhole lake dry-downs in the Wakulla Springshed of north Florida,
            where lake water was injected into the aquifer. Geochemical data showed groundwater
            values in a down-gradient monitoring well varied widely on the daily time scale with
            evidence that lake water weathered the aquifer confining unit as it recharged. No
            long-term impacts were seen at the well, and no impacts were seen at the spring. The
            second study aimed to model spring stage at Wakulla Springs using spatially distributed
            groundwater, surface water, and meteorological data from a monitoring network within
            the springshed. Different combinations of input variables were tested, and the model
            that considers a conceptual understanding of meteorological, groundwater, and surface
            water process was seen to perform the best. The final study trained a complex, interpretable
            neural network model using meteorological and springshed data from multiple springsheds
            of the Outstanding Florida Springs to create a universal model of eogenetic karst
            spring flow. The results were limited by the small number of springs used to train
            the model but were largely positive as it made accurate springflow predictions and
            could explain which input variables were impacting springflow predictions. These three
            studies show successful applications of applying established and new techniques to
            study groundwater-surface water interactions in the eogenetic karst environments to
            provide insight on Florida's karst spring systems and provide future directions for
            additional work in this field.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>In three essays, this dissertation explores how marketing strategies, both in the
            development and marketing of food and media, influence consumer well-being. Chapter
            2 explores maladaptive consumption and the future of food, examining new consumption
            trends and phenomena. Specifically, I study emerging trends in the marketplace related
            to (1) sustainability and alternative protein sources and (2) technology in food production
            and the supply chain. I explore the emerging trends in terms of implications for marketing
            theory and research, managers, and public policymakers, as well as their connections
            with the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals. In Chapter 3, I explore the
            consumers' preference for snacks. Specifically, I explore how an emerging labeling
            and promotion strategy for "fuel snacks" impacts consumer evaluations and perceptions.
            Furthermore, I study how snacks labeled in such a way appeal to consumers with certain
            characteristics – namely, consumers under caregiving stress. In doing so, I propose
            a dynamic effect of fuel snacks, such that the effects of snack perceptions differ
            by labeling and promotion strategies, and how they appeal to certain consumer segments.
            Finally, in Chapter 4, I explore how various labeling strategies and characteristics
            affect consumers' beliefs about mis- and disinformation. I theorize how the timing
            of warning labels, the content of the misinformation, and consumers' alignment with
            the content impacts perceptions about the mis- and disinformation and subsequent downstream
            behaviors. I present five studies demonstrating that some warning labels successfully
            reduce the belief of misinformation while others backfire. Taken together, this dissertation
            seeks to provide insights into when and why labeling and promotion might undermine
            or support consumer well-being.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>There is a plethora of articles and documents by scholarly figures articulating their
            views on what constitutes "good" art. Whether it's Halbert Britan or Milton Babbitt
            , the common strategy within aesthetic discourse is to claim that "certain objects
            or forms please us 'naturally' by virtue of certain human universals" and assert "the
            belief that a norm and thus 'standard' of correct and defective taste can be derived
            accordingly." In other words, those attuned to a given community's sensibilities are
            morally sound, have "good taste," and are superior to the flawed individuals in opposition
            to the community's proclivities. The saxophone, invented in 1838, found itself at
            a point in history where classical music in the twentieth century became increasingly
            splintered, allowing for different aesthetics to exist simultaneously, resulting in
            greater stratification of taste between laymen and professional musicians. This document
            will use the saxophone and its repertoire in a case study that will explore the saxophone's
            history, how it can influence the development of a saxophonist's identity, and how
            our identity influences our artistic palate and sense of musical value.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Spatial learning is impaired in humans with preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD),
            and we've previously reported similar impairments in a mouse model of AD. Spatial
            navigation impairments are one of the earliest symptoms to appear in this disease,
            and could be the result of impairments in navigational computations, memory encoding
            or retrieval, or some combination of navigational and memory impairments. Both cortex
            and hippocampus are important for memory encoding and navigational computations, with
            interactions between these two regions supporting these processes. Memory reactivation
            during sleep is critical for learning related plasticity, and memory formation is
            correlated with hippocampal (HPC) sharp wave ripple (SWR) density, cortical delta
            waves (DWs), cortical spindles, and the temporal coupling of these events - postulated
            as physiological substrates for memory consolidation. Further, HPC-cortical dyscoordination
            is prevalent in individuals with AD. Thus, we hypothesized impaired memory formation
            mechanisms in HPC-cortical networks could account for spatial memory deficits. We
            assessed sleep architecture, SWR/DW dynamics and memory reactivation in a mouse model
            of tauopathy and amyloidosis (3xTg-AD) implanted with a recording array targeting
            parietal cortex (PC) and HPC. Mice underwent daily recording sessions of rest-task-rest
            while learning the spatial reorientation task. We assessed pattern reactivation by
            matching activity patterns from the approach to the unmarked reward zone to patterns
            during slow wave sleep (SWS). AD mice had more SWS, but reduced SWR and spindle density.
            The increased SWS compensated for reduced SWR and spindle density so there was no
            reduction in SWR or spindle number. In control mice hippocampal SWR-PC DW coupling
            was strengthened in post-task- sleep and was correlated with performance on the spatial
            reorientation task the following day. However, in AD mice SWR-DW and spindle-DW coupling
            were impaired. Thus, reduced SWR-DW coupling may cause impaired learning in AD and
            spindle-DW coupling during short rest-task-rest sessions may serve as a biomarker
            for early AD related changes in these brain dynamics. Previously, various forms of
            40 Hz stimulation have been shown to clear AD pathology in mice and improve functional
            connectivity in preclinical AD patients. Thus, we assessed HPC-cortical coordination
            in 40 Hz or Sham stimulated 3xTg-AD/PVcre mice learning the spatial reorientation
            task. We implanted a 16-tetrode recording array targeting PC and HPC and an optical
            fiber targeting HPC. Daily recording sessions of rest-task-rest began as mice learned
            the VM, followed by HPC optogenetic stimulation, either 40 Hz or Sham. We assessed
            sleep quality metrics, DWs in cortex, and SWRs during SWS. Only 40 Hz stimulation
            increased 40 Hz power in HPC and to a lesser extent also PC. In SHAM stimulated mice
            SWR-DW cross-correlations were reduced, similar to 3xTg-AD mice. In 40 Hz stimulated
            mice, this phase-locking was rescued. Furthermore, the 40 Hz stimulation restored
            performance on the VM compared to Sham mice. However, this rescued HPC-cortical coupling
            no longer predicted performance as in NonTg animals. Instead, SWRs and DWs independently
            predicted performance in 40 Hz mice only. We also found reduction of amyloid beta
            (Aβ) in PC and ventral CA1, but no reduction in dorsal CA1, synaptically closer to
            stimulation. Thus, 40 Hz stimulation of HPC rescued learning and memory related functional
            interactions in the HPC-PC network during sleep and as a consequence rescued impairments
            in spatial navigation, despite a decoupling between HPC-cortical coupling and learning
            and memory. Furthermore, the observed effects seems to be mediated by direct 40 Hz
            impacts on brain dynamics (or another yet uncovered mechanism), due to an absence
            of robust glia, Aβ, and tau effects, contrasting previous reports. In addition to
            sleep, HPC-PC interactions are important in active navigation computations. In navigation,
            HPC is involved in creating a cognitive map-like representation of the environment.
            PC is involved in the translation of this cognitive representation based on body-centered
            location into the appropriate navigation decision. Thus, we tested the hypothesis
            that impaired HPC-cortical interactions during navigation underlie deficits in spatial
            navigation in a mouse model of AD. We decoded correct and incorrect trials from HPC
            and PC neural data on the spatial reorientation task. 3xTg-AD mice showed a different
            cross-region pattern compared to control, indicating that HPC-PC coordination impairments
            during active navigation may contribute spatial navigation deficits. Additionally,
            3xTg-AD mice showed a shift in how the HPC mapped the spatial-reorientation-task,
            indicating underlying dysfunction in HPC may also contribute to spatial navigation
            deficits.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This treatise offers educators a graded selection of violin compositions by Latin
            American composers, serving as a supplemental selection alongside the Suzuki repertoire.
            The research highlights these compositions and advocates for their inclusion in pedagogical
            instruction and performance repertoire. It provides a brief historical context about
            the composers and their works, delving into each piece's technical and musical aspects.
            Then, it highlights and suggests teaching points while comparing them to the Suzuki
            core repertoire and determining their suitable placements. Chapter One presents context
            information about violin literature, Latin American music production, and information
            on Suzuki's philosophy and repertoire. Chapters Two, Three, and Four provide the detailed
            content of each piece and separate them into three levels: beginner, intermediate,
            and advanced pieces. Appendix A provides a table for easy reference of the findings
            presented in the previous chapters. By integrating these compositions with the widely
            known Suzuki method, this research expands pedagogical possibilities and broadens
            the options for musical instruction. This treatise provides a useful pedagogical resource,
            encouraging teachers and performers to include alternative works and fostering further
            exploration of Latin American music.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>High entropy oxides (HEO) are the oxides containing five or more metals in a single
            lattice andthe large composition space suggests that properties of interest can be
            readily optimized. Magnetic correlation in HEOs that inherently depend on the coordination
            geometry, valence, spin state, and type of metal cations that are hybridized with
            the bridging oxygen, are naturally affected by an extreme diversity of neighboring
            ionic configuration. In this dissertation, we synthesized the bulk target of high
            entropy vanadium oxide, as the spinel vanadate and ferrite is a magnetically frustrated
            system an interesting non-collinear spin textures at low temperatures. We report the
            epitaxial growth of AF e2O4,(where A site contains five elements MgO, Fe2O3, NiO,
            CuO, CoO) thin films on the substrates spanning a range of strain states. We successfully
            grew the single crystalline thin films on different substrates of MgO, MgAl2O4, and
            STO where the crystal structure changed from its bulk cubic to a tetragonal unit cell
            which is confirmed by the Rigaku X-ray diffraction. These films show smooth surfaces,
            high crystallinity, and strong magnetic responses at room temperature. The perturbations
            in the crystal structure lead to interesting magnetic properties in the AF e2O4 thin
            films. We investigated the magnetic behavior in the material as the temperature-dependent
            magnetization measurements performed on AFe2O4 film show a magnetic transition onset
            above the room temperature regardless of the strain state. Strain effects have a strong
            influence on magnetization responses. For the tensile strained AFe2O4 film grown on
            MgO substrate, out- of-plane shows the hysteresis with the higher coercive field which
            indicates the easy axis on the out-of-plane direction. But in the case of slightly
            compressed film on a-axes and strained on c-axes strained AFe2O4 film on MAO substrate
            the out-of-plane shows slightly smaller hysteresis with a smaller coercive field which
            moves the easy axis towards an in-plane direction. The differences in the magnetic
            behavior between the bulk and thin film, in both the magnetic structure and anisotropy,
            provide insights on tuning the compositionally complex materials that may be applicable
            in the next-generation memory devices.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>With the current priorities and challenges surrounding equity in higher education,
            many institutions are looking for new resources to support diversity, equity, and
            inclusion (DEI) goals at their institutions. One resource that has been shown to be
            underutilized across social justice development in higher education are peer leaders.
            While some institutions may have peer leader groups that specialize in supporting
            social justice initiatives, peer leaders, unless it's their primary function, are
            not being trained on social justice or utilized at most institutions of higher education
            to support social justice development. However, peer leaders have been found to be
            very impactful on the development and experience of their peers throughout college,
            but because peer leaders are not exploring social justice in training, it limits their
            ability to support their peers in the topic. Throughout this, a qualitative exploratory
            study is explored that was facilitated with peer leaders at Stetson University to
            understand how peer leaders serve as socially just leaders within a campus community
            and what support institutions can provide to develop peer leaders to serve as socially
            just leaders. Individual interviews and focus group interviews were conducted to gain
            perspective from peer leaders, their understanding of leadership and social justice,
            their application of socially just leadership, and areas of support they looked for
            from the institution. The culturally relevant leadership learning model served as
            the theoretical framework for this study which supported the development of interview
            questions, analysis of data, and development of recommendations from the study. Research
            within this study found common trends from the peer leaders in the ways in which they
            supported their peers as socially just leaders through common themes and sub-themes.
            And the study also found commons trends in the ways in which the peer leaders were
            looking for further support from the university to be socially just leaders. Results
            in the study suggest that peer leaders, no matter the focus of their peer leader role,
            have the ability to serve as socially just leaders and peer leaders are looking for
            support from their institutions to help them in serving as socially just leaders in
            their peer leader roles. Results also breakdown different ways in which peer leaders
            are serving as socially just leaders within the campus community.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The purpose of this qualitative exploratory multiple-case study was to explore how
            school-based teams make decisions and implement a Multi-Tiered System of Support for
            students exhibiting problem behavior (MTSS-B). Mandates require the use of MTSS to
            support both academic (MTSS-A) and behavioral needs (MTSS-B) of K-12 students. The
            definitions, guidelines, and structures for MTSS-A are more consistent and well-researched
            than those for MTSS-B. Little is known about how school-based teams make decisions
            about implementing MTSS-B and the factors they identify as influencing those decisions.
            It is important to learn how MTSS-B team members engage in the process at each tier
            (1, 2, and 3), how they develop interventions of increasing intensity, and what factors
            influence individual and team decision-making. Chapter One introduces the importance
            of understanding the history of disproportionate discipline and identification for
            special education services and provides a brief literature review of research previously
            conducted about how teams, fidelity, and culture are related to MTSS-B and how Contingency
            Theory and contingent decision-making have been connected to systems including schools.
            Chapter Two is the methods section where the rationale and details of this multiple
            case study are provided including how I increased trustworthiness and how the data
            was collected and analyzed. Chapter Three provides findings of the analyzed data both
            within and across cases. The themes developed are evidenced using invivo codes provided
            by participants. Overarching themes reflect some significant differences in how MTSS-B
            is implemented at each school. Differences are attributed to the factors considered
            by teams such as the home life of students, poverty, drug use, students' exposure
            to domestic violence, lack of supervision, homelessness, and the violent neighborhood
            where School 2 is located. School 1 identified factors such as the poverty experienced
            by their students and the often-unrecognized need for academic support. The types
            of behaviors exhibited by students were described as mainly classroom disruptions
            at School 1 and as physical aggression at School 2, requiring different approaches
            to consequences. Chapter Three concludes with a synthesis of how the elements of the
            exploratory framework are represented in how teams report implementing MTSS-B, how
            fidelity may contribute to the current operations of the teams, and how culture is
            represented by the factors influencing decision-making. Chapter Four's discussion
            ties components of the exploratory framework and collected data to previous research.
            Teams both report using a wide variety of factors, variables, and contingencies both
            subjective and objective to guide decision-making. This use of additional contextual
            and environmental variables indicates the likelihood that while teams report the use
            of traditional data-driven decision-making additionally, they are engaging in the
            contingency theory of decision-making. The chapter concludes with limitations and
            implications for future research.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Elite private institutions, renowned for their exceptional academic offerings and
            rigorous selection processes, attract top-tier students and faculty; however, exclusive
            private schooling has perpetuated social and economic disparities by granting unequal
            advantages to select groups, deepening educational gaps in society. This dissertation
            investigated the integration of social justice principles in the educational framework
            of an elite private Episcopal institution in a major Florida metropolitan area. Guided
            by the ethos of the U.S. Episcopal Church and its commitment to inclusivity and social
            justice, the study delved into how teachers at the study site navigated the implementation
            of social justice-oriented themes in their classrooms. Drawing upon critical theory,
            the research explored the challenges and approaches of seven selected teachers known
            for their dedication to social justice values. Through purposeful sampling and multiple
            data collection methods—including semistructured interviews, focus groups, classroom
            observations, and participant equity walkthroughs—the study elucidated the complexities
            and nuances of integrating social justice into classroom practices in an elite educational
            setting. Key research questions examined teachers' definitions, approaches, enactments,
            and negotiations of social justice, shedding light on the ways these principles are
            manifested and challenged in the school community. This single-case study offered
            an in-depth exploration, unraveling the intricate interplay between social justice
            values and educational practices in the context of an Episcopal school committed to
            fostering diversity, equity, and inclusion. Key findings suggested that some educators
            found their motivation in spiritual or religious themes, (a) emphasizing service and
            philanthropy as a way to give back to others, (b) drawing inspiration from various
            world religions, and (c) aligning efforts with the school's Christian mission. Conversely,
            another group expressed focus on promoting equality, catalyzing social transformation,
            and empowering marginalized voices by prioritizing systemic change over mere acts
            of service. Despite these differing perspectives on social justice, both groups acknowledged
            the privileged status of their students and described their aims to instill a sense
            of responsibility toward serving others, whether through direct assistance or empowerment.
            The participants viewed socially just classroom environments as inclusive spaces that
            fostered trust and belonging, where students could make mistakes, engage in critical
            analysis, and receive differentiated support. Conversely, educators also discussed
            facing challenges in implementing social justice principles due to Florida's social
            climate, lack of organizational mission alignment, and time constraints. Despite these
            obstacles, the research aimed to uncover the underlying causes of inequity by examining
            how teachers conceptualized and enacted social justice in their classrooms amid external
            pressures. The study identified three key themes: (a) the role of elite private Episcopal
            schools in perpetuating social reproduction and elitism, (b) the crucial role of teachers
            in fostering Episcopal values and social justice advocacy, and (c) the potential of
            the Episcopal identity to serve as a powerful force for promoting justice in various
            forms. Overall, the findings and recommendations provide guidance for elite Episcopal
            schools seeking to reaffirm their commitment to justice and equality, emphasizing
            the importance of instilling Christian values of democracy and egalitarianism while
            raising awareness of students' privileges and moral obligations to contribute to a
            fair society.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The shipping industry is one of the significant sources of pollution and global warming.
            About 2.5% of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions in 2018 came from the shipping industry.
            Conventional tugboats are viewed as one of the contributors towards the overall amount
            of emissions produced from maritime transportation. The International Maritime Organization
            (IMO) estimates that tugboats account for 2% of global shipping emissions, including
            nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), and particulate matter (PM). Electric
            tugboats could be a promising alternative to these issues because they don't emit
            any harmful gases. Furthermore, electric tugboats do not produce as much noise as
            conventional tugboats. However, certain aspects should be carefully considered before
            the wide deployment of electric tugboats would be feasible, including financial viability
            of using electric tugboats, impacts on society, legal framework for using electric
            tugboats, and the overall practicality of deploying electric tugboats.This research
            mainly focuses on a comprehensive assessment of advantages and disadvantages from
            electric tugboat deployment in maritime transportation. First, all the basic background
            information associated with the development and deployment of electric tugboats is
            reviewed in detail. Second, a thorough literature review is conducted focusing on
            different aspects, including safety issues associated with tugboats, tugboat scheduling,
            electric tugboats versus conventional tugboats, environmental issues, salvage tugboats
            and other types of tugboats. Third, a comprehensive evaluation of electric tugboats
            is performed based on all the information acquired along with the interviews that
            were performed with the leading experts in the tugboat industry. Last but not least,
            the financial viability and economic performance of electric tugboats using econometric
            techniques is assessed as a part of this thesis research as well. Electric tugboats
            consistently demonstrate a greater initial capital outlay, although offer substantially
            reduced ongoing operational expenses owing to their enhanced efficiency and diminished
            maintenance needs. Consequently, they emerge as the most economically appealing alternative
            for long-term planning. On the other hand, conventional tugboats may seem more economically
            advantageous in the short term, but they ultimately accumulate significantly more
            expenses over time, especially in the face of increasing annual costs (e.g., unexpected
            increase in the cost of diesel fuel, unexpected increase in maintenance costs). Hybrid
            tugboats present a viable compromise, exhibiting certain cost benefits in comparison
            to the conventional and electric tugboat options. Therefore, the existing obstacles
            related to electric tugboat deployment have to be further investigated and addressed
            in the following years. The conducted research would be of essence to researchers
            and industry practitioners and can serve as a valuable reference for the relevant
            future studies.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Due to the rapid development of imaging acquisition techniques, a large amount of
            large-scale biomedical studies on neuro-related diseases have been established, such
            as Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study, the Human Connectome
            Project (HCP) study and the UK biobank (UKB) study. These databases have myriad data
            types, including genomic data, phenotypic data, imaging data, clinical outcomes, and
            many others. Among the studies on biomedical data, functional regression has received
            the most attention in functional data analysis (FDA). However, existing statistical
            methods in this field still face challenges while considering unknown confounders
            caused by imaging heterogeneity, non-Euclidean imaging data, or imaging data with
            jump discontinuities. To tackle these challenges, we propose several functional regression
            models for biomedical data with different structures. First, the function-on-scalar
            regression model is a powerful tool for building the relationship between the functional
            responses and covariates of interest. Although it has been widely applied in many
            large-scale neuroimaging studies, most existing approaches fail to take into account
            the nonlinear relationship and the unknown confounders caused by imaging heterogeneity.
            In particular, the potential heterogeneity may be caused by the differences in the
            study environment, population, design, protocols, and other unknown factors. To address
            this challenge, we develop a single index function-on-scalar regression model to investigate
            the nonlinear relationship between functional responses and covariates of interest
            while adjusting for unknown confounding factors caused by potential imaging heterogeneity.
            Both estimation and inference procedures are established for unknown quantities in
            our proposed model. In addition, the asymptotic properties of estimated functions
            and detected confounding factors are also systematically investigated. The finite-sample
            performance of our proposed method is assessed by using both Monte Carlo simulations
            and a real data example on the diffusion tensor images from the ADNI study. Second,
            causal mediation analysis is widely utilized in neuroscience to investigate the role
            of brain image phenotypes in the neurological pathways from genetic exposures to clinical
            outcomes. However, it is still difficult to conduct a genome-wide mediation analysis
            with the shapes of brain regions as mediators due to several challenges including
            (i) large-scale genetic exposures, i.e., millions of single-nucleotide polymorphisms
            (SNPs); (ii) nonlinear Hilbert space for shape mediators; and (iii) statistical inference
            on the direct and indirect effects. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes
            a mediation analysis framework with high dimensional genetic exposures and shape mediators.
            First, to address the issue caused by the high dimensionality in genetic exposures,
            a fast genome-wide association analysis is conducted to discover potential genetic
            variants with significant genetic effects on the clinical outcome. Second, the square-root
            velocity function representations are extracted from the shapes of the subcortical
            brain structure, which fall in an unconstrained linear Hilbert subspace. Third, to
            identify the underlying causal pathways from the detected SNPs to the clinical outcome
            implicitly through the shape mediators, we proposed a framework consisting of a shape-on-scalar
            model and a scalar-on-shape model. Furthermore, the bootstrap resampling approach
            is adopted to investigate both global and spatial significant mediation effects. Finally,
            our framework is applied to the ADNI corpus callosum shape data, and we successfully
            identify the mediation effect of a subset of candidate SNPs on Alzheimer's Disease
            through some specific subregions of the corpus callosum. Finally, most existing methods
            in functional data analysis assume the smoothness of the functional responses and
            the coefficient functions or require some smoothing techniques before fitting the
            functional responses into the statistical models. However, this is often violated
            in biomedical imaging data, which usually contains spatially contiguous regions or
            effect regions with relatively sharp edges due to the physical or biological reasons.
            Thus they tend to blur the image data near the edges or jumps. While the pixel or
            voxel based methods ignore the spatial information of imaging data, they fail to characterize
            the spatial correlations.Thus, it is essential to propose an appropriate framework
            to reveal the relationship between imaging responses and the covariates of interest,
            while taking the discontinuous property and spatial correlation into account simultaneously.
            To address these challenges, we proposed a Bayesian hypothesis testing framework on
            image-on-scalar regression model with mixed effects, and consider wavelet basis decomposition
            to account for the sudden transitions in the imaging responses. To depict the spatial
            correlation between grids for each observation, a conditional auto-regressive (CAR)
            model is utilized. Due to the advantage of Bayesian analysis in hypothesis testing,
            we propose a Bayesian framework for an image-on-scalar CAR model using a set of Normal
            - Inverse-Gamma - Uniform priors, introducing the local indicators to conduct block-wise
            hypothesis tests efficiently and flexibly.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Inorganic nanocrystals have garnered significant attention due to their unique physical
            and optical properties, spurring extensive research into their development for technological
            applications like electronic devices, solar cells, and biomedical diagnostics. Tailoring
            these nanocrystals for specific environments requires precise control over their photophysical,
            mechanical, and chemical properties. Particularly in bio-related applications, engineering
            the surface of these nanomaterials to be hydrophilic, biocompatible, and amenable
            to further bioconjugation while maintaining stability in challenging conditions is
            crucial. This dissertation aims to explore new ligands to passivate the surfaces of
            inorganic nanomaterials, preserving their structural and optoelectronic integrity
            and ensuring long-term stability. Additionally, the dissertation investigates the
            formation of protein corona on metallic nanocrystals, focusing on understanding the
            factors governing corona formation and strategies for prevention through ligand design.
            Furthermore, we explore leveraging the optical properties of gold nanoparticles to
            design biosensing tools with high sensitivity, specificity, and rapid assay times.
            In Chapter 1, fundamental optical, physical, and chemical characteristics of plasmonic,
            semiconductor, and magnetic nanomaterials are described. Synthetic chemistry and surface
            coating techniques are briefly outlined, with recent advancements in surface engineering
            and ligand design being highlighted. Various effective methods for bioconjugation
            on nanoparticle surfaces are explored. Additionally, "protein corona" is defined,
            its composition is examined in terms of factors influencing it, and its implications
            for biology and the environment are discussed. Finally, notable examples of bio-applications
            involving inorganic nanomaterials are discussed. Chapter 2 presents a novel series
            of polymer ligands with multi-coordinating sites, which were designed using the hydroxamate
            anchoring motif. These ligands were subsequently employed for coating luminescent
            quantum dots, gold nanoparticles, and iron oxide nanoparticles. The synthesis of the
            ligands involved a nucleophilic addition reaction between poly(isobutylene-alt-maleic
            anhydride) and amine-terminated moieties, including the hydroxamate precursor (NH2OH-HCl)
            and short polyethylene glycol hydrophilic blocks. This synthesis method allowed the
            architecture and stoichiometry of the final compound to be adjusted. It was found
            that these hydroxamate-based polymers were strongly coordinated with ZnS-overcoated
            quantum dots (QDs), Au nanoparticles (AuNPs), and iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs),
            resulting in stable dispersions for all three systems. Chapter 3 examines the non-specific
            adsorption of proteins on AuNPs by strategically altering the structures of a series
            of DHLA-based ligands. Electrophoretic mobility is employed to monitor potential corona
            formation on AuNPs when exposed to bovine serum albumin (BSA) or serum samples, allowing
            the kinetics of binding to be determined. It is indicated by our findings that AuNPs
            capped with hydrolipoic acid (DHLA), a small alkyl-COOH, are susceptible to size-dependent
            interactions with proteins. Insight into the deposition of proteins on the surface
            of nanomaterials is provided by theoretical calculations using a close-packed model.
            Corona formation is significantly reduced by coating AuNPs with polyethylene glycol-
            or zwitterion-appended DHLA. Furthermore, protein adsorption is further characterized
            using UV-Vis spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering. The significance of surface
            chemistry and nanomaterial size in corona formation, and potentially preventing it,
            is underscored by our results. In Chapter 4, the application of plasmonic nanoparticles
            for sensing purposes is explored. A charge-mediated diagnostic tool for detecting
            early-stage cancer biomarkers is developed by leveraging the sensitivity of AuNPs'
            localized surface plasmon resonance to interparticle distance. Three sets of peptides,
            each with three specific segments, featuring oppositely charged amino acids at their
            ends to balance the overall peptide charge, are designed. Two of these peptides are
            used as substrates for matrix metalloproteinase-14 (MMP-14), a cancer biomarker, while
            the third is utilized as a negative control. When the cleaved peptide undergoes enzymatic
            digestion, its interaction with negatively charged AuNPs triggers their assembly in
            a concentration- and time-dependent process. The assay is investigated to determine
            how varying the size of the nanoparticles affects it, different peptides are explored,
            and enzyme kinetics are tracked. It is demonstrated by our results that the sensor
            has a nanomolar range Limit of Detection (LoD) and minimal cross-reactivity with other
            abundant proteins in serum. The rapid assay time suggests promising applications for
            the design of future diagnostic tools for cancer and other diseases. In Chapter 5,
            the findings and implications detailed in this dissertation are summarized, accompanied
            by a discussion of the future prospects in corona science and biosensor design.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Across the United States a significant number of individuals find themselves incarcerated
            each year. For the state of Florida, this number represents one of the highest in
            the country (Carson, 2021). Prior research has indicated that incarcerated populations
            across the country tend to have a lower literacy level and less education experience
            than most (Bender et al., 2016; Cho &amp; Tyler, 2010; Dewey et al., 2020; Lockwood et
            al., 2015; Pompoco et al., 2017). The addition of education to one's experience while
            serving their time in prison can not only improve these things but also their post-release
            job opportunities and the individual's quality of life while serving their time (Cho
            &amp; Tyler, 2010; Courtney, 2019; Lockwood et al., 2015; McCorkel &amp; DeFina, 2019; Pompoco
            et al., 2017). Knowing the benefits education can bring, this study looks to understand
            access to education programs for those housed in a Florida Department of Corrections
            facility. Specifically, this study examines what community and institutional factors
            may predict the offering of career and technical education (CTE) programs and academic
            and special education (ASE) programs and why. Through a series of logistical regressions,
            this study found that there are several factors that can predict certain education
            offerings both at the county and facility levels. For CTE programs, positive factors
            predicting that a facility will offer CTE include location in a rural county, the
            number of facilities within an area, being privately run, and potentially new legislation.
            For ASE programming, the size of the correctional facility population as well as the
            gender served were positive factors on the probability of program offering. Within
            both areas, there are also factors that can reduce the probability of program offering.
            For CTE programs these include increased enrollment within post-secondary education
            within the county, the race of the county population, the custody classification level
            of the correctional facility, gender served at the facility, and the percentage of
            residents committed to a correctional facility each year. For ASE programming, institutions
            in rural counties have a lower likelihood of offering ASE coursework. There are several
            study implications that focus on increasing access to education programs for those
            currently incarcerated in Florida. First is evaluating the connection between rural
            communities and correctional education offering. For CTE programs, location in a rural
            county is a positive relationship, while for ASE programs it is not. Understanding
            the support and value the rural community is bringing to CTE education can not only
            help to expand it, but also address what challenges may come to offering basic education
            in the same way. Additionally, the population of both the county and facility were
            significant in the odds of program offering. For counties with an increased diversity,
            odds of CTE program offerings declined. For every 1% increase of Black residents,
            the probability of CTE programs were lower by 10.4%. A similar trend was seen for
            those classified as Other showing 25.9% lower odds. Looking at the population of residents,
            it is important to dive deeper into this analysis, breaking down the population into
            further subgroups to truly understand the outcomes. Additionally, correctional facilities
            serving male residents showed a higher probability of ASE programs, but a lower probability
            of CTE programs. Focusing on the facility itself, both those locations with a highest
            custody classification of community or maximum saw lower odds of CTE program offering
            as compared to other custody classifications. In contrast, privately run facilities
            saw higher probability of CTE programs. While the study did conclude that education
            access was present for those incarcerated within Florida, several factors were identified
            that could hinder the offering of these programs in certain facilities and areas.
            The thing found most impactful was the location where an individual was housed. Focusing
            on both the physical location as well as the custody designation given to the facility,
            the likelihood of CTE and ASE program offerings differed. With a goal of expanding
            programming to all, knowing why both the opportunities and challenges exist provides
            context to expand partnership and legislation within the state system.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>I proceed according to a skeptical, Pyrrhonist inspired metaphilosophy to address
            two perennial issues: the nature of human agency and our culpability in acting. After
            unpacking this approach, as well as offering some initial remarks that lay out the
            playing field, I work to accomplish two things. First, I problematize a picture of
            human beings and their agency in which they amount to the independent sources of what
            they do—such that they can be held accountable in a fashion that presupposes such
            things. Second, I offer a replacement intended to fill the void left by critique:
            a different orientation toward action, free will, and moral responsibility. By pursuing
            these tasks, I follow the skeptic way as it shows itself to me—in which one is to
            offer both a skeptical critique and a skeptical solution to philosophical problems.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>HBCUs have contributed to the formation of strong leaders who have challenged many
            assumptions of our nation's founders, defended our sovereignty when attacked by internal
            and external enemies, and sacrificed for the betterment of their communities. HBCU
            campuses include opportunities for Black students to engage in religious and community
            service and to identify with cultural strengths that are expected to help them succeed
            (Albritton, 2012). HBCUs have higher retention and graduation rates for Black students,
            and "African American students attending HBCUs are up to 33% more likely to graduate
            than African American students attending a similar non-HBCU" (Gordon et al., 2021,
            p. 333). HBCUs are known to provide students with faculty mentors, supportive learning
            experiences, and a sense of belonging on campus (Kim &amp; Conrad, 2006). Students Although
            some HBCUs offer MSW programs, participants' decision to attend graduate school at
            FSU was motivated by the need for a clinically oriented program, internship opportunities,
            and a desire for new experiences. Following undergraduate studies, 74.8% of graduate
            social work students attend predominately White institutions (PWIs). However, Black
            students at PWIs reported that discrimination, isolation, and a lack of support services
            negatively affected their experiences and served as a distraction to learning (Banks,
            2020; Beasley, 2020; Person &amp; Christensen, 1996). Additionally, research exploring
            Black students' experiences transitioning to a PWI for graduate studies has focused
            on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) careers (Allen &amp; Dika,
            2020; Charleston et al., 2014; McGee &amp; Martin, 2011). While there is a benefit in
            understanding the experiences of these students, the increase in the number of Black
            students pursuing careers in social work and other behavioral sciences warrants research
            (Bowie et al., 2011). Also, while Rasheem and Brunson (2018) added valuable research
            contributions focused on Black women and HBCU graduate social work programs, this
            study expands the conversation to address the unique experiences of Black HBCU graduates
            seeking MSWs at PWIs. The literature included in this study expands Black students'
            voices and provides diverse approaches to understanding how to create educational
            environments that meet their needs (Allen &amp; Dika, 2020; Ladson-Billings, 2013). Deconstructing
            deficit-based paradigms and elevating the voices of researchers engaged in developing
            culturally relevant pedagogy provides educational systems with an opportunity to create
            academic environments that value the intellectual and cultural strengths that students
            possess (Ladson-Billings, 2017; Royal &amp; Gibson, 2017; Yosso, 2005). Using a qualitative
            case study design, this study examined the experiences and perceptions of 17 Black
            Master of Social Work (MSW) students enrolled in the Florida State University (FSU)
            College of Social Work (CSW) who obtained an undergraduate degree from an HBCU. According
            to data from the FSU Office of Institutional Research, Black MSW student enrollment
            increased from 539 students in 2019 to 875 in 2023. The study findings are extricated
            through brave conversations filled with candor, wit, and resilience as participants
            recounted the cultural dissonance between their HBCU and PWI experiences. As a result,
            the study findings identify the cultural strengths and expectations HBCU graduates
            bring to PWI graduate social work programs, the environmental challenges Black students
            contend with, and the differences they encounter in faculty and peer relationships.
            The findings from this study provide implications that advance inclusive academic
            experiences for Black HBCU graduates attending Predominantly White Institutions (PWIs)
            for their MSW. To provide comparable levels of support Black students receive at HBCUs,
            PWIs must better meet the needs of Black students (Banks et al., 2020; Beasley, 2021).
            Credle and Dean (1991) noted that PWIs must create policies and practices that better
            meet African American students' culture and academic expectations if they are committed
            to retaining them. In accordance with the ADEI standards, CSWE's EPAS, and the FSW
            CSW DEI Plan, this study directly implicates aspects of social work education at PWIs
            that address implicit and explicit curricula, utilizing inclusive strategies that
            emphasize student identity, faculty development, and student engagement (Banks et
            al., 2020; Beasley, 2021; Herzig, 2004).</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This thesis is a qualitative analysis of the framing used in President Donald Trump's
            2020 election-related tweets from April 2020 through January 6, 2021, the day of the
            attack on the U.S. Capitol, from the perspective of political communication theory.
            The tweets were analyzed using Fairclough's Critical Discourse Analysis to allow for
            examination of the text, the discursive practices, and the social practices within
            the former president's tweets. Analysis, which included textual analysis, as well
            as consideration of the historical resources of the Final Report of the Select Committee
            to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol and contemporaneous
            news articles, revealed that Trump framed his election-related tweets in five interconnected
            narrative frames: (1) rigged election, (2) making the Red Mirage look real, (3) us
            v. them, (4) media bias, and (5) stop the steal. Through these frames, communicated
            to his supporters via his Twitter account, Trump was able to direct, participate,
            and ultimately end the attack on the U.S. Capitol. Further, implications of the research
            for communication theory, social media, and United States government are discussed,
            limitations are presented, and areas of future research are suggested.</p>

            the program's outdoor learning experiences. Using a thematic analysis approach, I
            developed three core themes common to the experiences: inspiration from others, growth
            and transformation, and emotional resilience. Consistent with previous research on

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Many venom proteins have presumably been convergently recruited by taxa from diverse
            venomous lineages. These toxic proteins have characteristics that allow them to remain
            stable in solution and have a high propensity for toxic effects on prey and/or potential
            predators. Despite this well-established convergent toxin recruitment, some toxins
            seem to be lineage specific. To further investigate the toxic proteins found throughout
            venomous lineages, in chapter one we performed venom proteomics and venom-gland transcriptomics
            on two individual red bark centipedes (Scolopocryptops sexspinosus). Combining the
            protein phenotype with the transcript genotype resulted in the first in-depth venom
            characterization of S. sexspinosus, including 72 venom components that were identified
            in both the transcriptome and proteome and 1,468 nontoxin transcripts identified in
            the transcriptome. Ten different toxin families were represented in the venom and
            venom gland with the majority of the toxins belonging to metalloproteases, CAPS (cysteine-rich
            secretory protein, antigen 5, and pathogenesis-related 1 proteins), and -pore-forming
            toxins. Nine of these toxin families shared a similar proteomic structure to venom
            proteins previously identified from other centipedes. However, the most highly expressed
            toxin family, the adamalysin-like metalloproteases, has until now only been observed
            in the venom of snakes. We confirmed adamalysin-like metalloprotease activity by means
            of in vivo functional assays. The recruitment of an adamalysin-like metalloprotease
            into centipede venom represents a striking case of convergent evolution. In chapter
            two, we investigated the evolution of venom proteins and we tested two different hypotheses
            of venom evolution. Whole gene duplication followed by nucleotide differentiation
            is one of the simplest mechanisms to develop new functions for genes. However, the
            processes underlying multigene family evolution remain controversial. We utilize multigene
            families found within the diversity of toxic proteins in venom to test two separate
            hypotheses related to venom evolution, the two-speed mode of venom evolution and the
            rapid accumulation of variation in exposed residues or RAVER model. The two-speed
            mode of venom evolution proposes that different types of selection impact ancient
            and younger venomous lineages with negative selection being the predominant form in
            ancient lineages and positive selection being the dominant form in younger lineages.
            The RAVER hypothesis states that instead of different types of selection acting on
            different ages of venomous lineages, the different types of selection will selectively
            contribute to amino acid variation based on whether or not the residue is exposed
            to the solvent. This follows the longstanding understanding of protein evolution that
            suggests that residues found within the structural or active regions of the protein
            will be under negative or purifying selection, while residues that do not form part
            of these areas will be more prone to positive selection. To test these two different
            hypotheses, we compared the venom of 26 scolopendromorph centipedes from six currently
            recognized species from across North America using both transcriptomics and proteomics.
            First, we estimated the phylogenetic relationships of the centipedes used in this
            study and then characterized the diverse the venom components from across the identified
            clades. From this diversity of venom family proteins, we conducted selection-based
            analyses and compared them with the three-dimensional properties of the venom proteins.
            We found support for both venom evolution hypotheses through the prevalence of negative
            selection across all proteins and found evidence of positive selection occurring on
            residues that were exposed to the solvent, while the structural and less solvent exposed
            residues corresponded with higher rates of negative selection. Through the use of
            phylogenetics, proteo-transcriptomics, and selection-based analyses, we were able
            to describe the evolution of venom from an ancient venomous lineage and support principles
            of protein evolution that directly relate to multigene family evolution. In chapter
            three, we examined how a phenotype and the corresponding genotype of one species can
            affect the phenotype and genotype of a coevolving species. Coevolution, or the reciprocal
            selection between two interacting species, is a key mechanism for the generation and
            maintenance of adaptive variation. To understand the genetic mechanisms of coevolution,
            we first need to establish the genotype-by-genotype interactions that contribute to
            reciprocal selection. However, linking a singular complex trait to its genotype is
            one of the most difficult challenges in biology, and that difficulty increases when
            linking the genotypes of two traits that are acting interspecifically. To disentangle
            the genetic mechanisms behind coevolving traits, we investigated the interaction between
            two complex traits, venom and venom resistance. To connect the genetics mechanisms
            behind venom and venom resistance, we performed an extreme quantitative loci mapping
            study to uncover the genetic mechanisms underlying venom resistance through injecting
            two distinct centipede venoms into Drosophila. Through injecting a mainly proteolytic
            venom and a mainly neurotoxic venom, previously described through proteo-transcriptomics,
            we revealed a unique genome-wide response to venom resistance. We identified a unique
            genetic response to both venom types, where the mainly proteolytic venom was associated
            with biological processes relating to cell adhesion, cytoskeleton organization, synapse
            organization and nervous system development, while the principally neurotoxic venom
            was only associated with synapse organization. This comparative approach also uncovered
            a sex-specific response to venom resistance, which has not yet been described in the
            literature. To verify the function of the causal genes from our genotype-to-genotype
            map of venom and venom resistance, we performed an RNAi knockdown study which implicated
            genes and genetic pathways already described in the literature and uncovered novel
            pathways that could lead to venom resistance. Through an experimental approach, we
            comparatively characterized the genetic basis of complex traits and molecularly linked
            interspecific traits, adding to our understanding of venom and venom resistance and
            how organisms can coevolve.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>A new algorithm that hybridizes massless marker particles with the coupled level set
            moment-of-fluid method to improve the interface reconstruction in multiphase flow
            problems is proposed. This new method aims to take advantage of both near-interface
            and on-interface Lagrangian marker particles in a similar fashion to the Particle
            Level Set (PLS) Method, first introduced by Enright et al. [28]. In contrast to Enright
            et al. who used particles to improve the mass conservation of the level set method,
            in this thesis the utility of the particles are studied to improve the slope reconstruction
            for the multimaterial moment of fluid (MOF) method [54]. Additionally, prior to this,
            PLS methods have not been implemented on N-phase flow problems involving more than
            two materials. The proposed method is volume-preserving. Furthermore, we hypothesize
            that deriving slopes from particles overcomes the surface tension checkerboard instability
            of the MOF method first discussed by Ye et al. [116]. Ye et al. developed the ``Continuous
            Moment of Fluid'' (CMOF) method in order to overcome this checkerboard instability.
            It is asserted in this thesis that augmenting the interface representation with meshless
            particle produces similar results to that of the CMOF method, at a lowered computational
            cost. The new coupled particle level set and moment of fluid method (PLSMOF) is demonstrated
            on benchmark tests in 2d, 3d axisymmetric ``R-Z", and 3d problems including rigid
            body motion, two phase flow, and incompressible multiphase flow problems undergoing
            phase change involving several different materials with `triple-points'. Comparisons
            are made between the new PLSMOF method proposed herein, the CMOF method, and the MOF
            method for multimaterial multiphase flows.</p>

            and Meryl Streep. There are tastebud-based superpowers, tattoo wish lists, and the
            desire to start a band with one's dead high school friends. There are dysfunctional
            family dynamics compounded by a mother's cancer diagnosis, struggles with the body
            and self-image, and there are bagel and vegan cake-related accidents. Meanwhile, ALL

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Mobile Homes Drive is the story of a mother, Nessa, raising a teenage daughter alone
            in a trailer park in the mid-nineties. When Nessa discovers neighbor Justin's dead
            child in a hot car, she finds herself amid a culture war. The town's sympathies do
            not extend to Justin, a recovering drug addict, though Nessa believes the child's
            death was an accident. At the front of the movement against Justin is Shelby Fuller,
            pastor of the local church and Nessa's boss. Nessa's testimony as witness to the incident
            is challenged as Shelby uses the child's death to kick off a bid for town mayor. Months
            later, participation in Justin's defense prompts Shelby to fire Nessa. Meanwhile,
            Shelby plans to demolish Mobile Homes Drive, where Nessa lives, to appease his constituents'
            prejudices against poverty. To legally outmaneuver the powerful clergyman, Nessa consults
            Justin's attractive attorney, Brent. Just as Nessa's new relationship blooms, her
            estranged husband Dale returns with a pregnant fiancé in tow. When Dale discovers
            an inappropriate relationship between his daughter and Pastor Shelby's adult son,
            Dale threatens jobless, homeless Nessa's custody of their daughter. Mobile Homes Drive
            contemplates the subtleties of a small-town class system, the role of Christianity
            in Southern politics, and the tangle of familial relationships.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>According to research from FSU's Hate Crime and Policy Institute, since early 2010,
            print journalists have been deadnaming (i.e., calling a transgender person by their
            birth name when they have changed their name as part of their gender transition) and
            misgendering transgender victims of violence in fatal crime reporting across the U.S.
            These are hateful acts toward the LGBTQ+ community, and affected transgender people
            have been repeatedly misrepresented in mainstream media now for over a decade. Though
            the LGBTQ+ movement has progressed immensely, there are concentrated geographic regions
            that showcase high numbers of transgender murder victims, and even higher numbers
            of offensive journalistic practices regarding trans lives and deaths. In order for
            researchers, journalists, and activists to eliminate such journalistic practices,
            they must first understand the recent landscape of journalism and how news content
            on anti-transgender violence has changed in the last decade. In the master's thesis,
            "Are Journalists Still Deadnaming? Journalistic Practices and Rhetorical Choices in
            Reporting on Murdered Transgender People," I utilize quantitative research methods
            to explore first, the foundation for this media phenomenon by collecting basic statistics
            on news coverage from 1980-2010; then, I utilize qualitative methods based on political
            economy of media and rhetorical criticism to deeply analyze the structure and copy
            of articles written on transgender murder cases from 2016-2022. My research questions
            include 1) How, if at all, has the use of deadnaming and pronouns changed from 2016-2022
            in journalistic reporting on murdered transgender people? 2) What themes are present
            in journalistic writing that communicate a political or ideological viewpoint on transgender
            people in relation to their murder? 3) Are the life narratives of murdered transgender
            people featured in the news reporting on their deaths? Using this data, I draw conclusions
            and recommend changes to newspaper journalism to avoid media misrepresentation of
            murdered transgender people in the future.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The topic of sustainability, in regard to cruelty-free and sustainable efforts from
            brands, has become growling popular with the younger generations, specifically in
            the cosmetic industry. This study investigated the impact of cosmetic companies' regarding
            branding cruelty-free and sustainability on consumer engagement by looking at likes,
            followers, comment numbers and other Instagram metrics. The literature review highlighted
            important studies about animal testing theories, legitimacy theory, corporate social
            responsibility, customer relationship management, sustainability, and cruelty-free
            branding, and Kolter's 5 A's of Marketing. Overall, there were no significant differences
            between cruelty-free and non-cruelty free brands regarding their branding of cruelty-free
            and sustainability on consumer engagement. Although, the findings show that posts
            that include cruelty-free hashtags had higher (or more) likes than cosmetic brands
            that do not include cruelty-free hashtags The findings of this study indicate that
            cruelty-free brands used voice overs on videos, while non-cruelty-free brands used
            music or a model speaking to you. Another significant finding was that cruelty-free
            brands will use the later stages of the 5 A's of Sales Marketing, like act and advocate
            which encourage consumers to use and purchase their products. The findings of this
            study also indicate that cosmetic brands that post about their CSR initiatives use
            the later stages of the 5 A's of Sales Marketing.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Thermoelectric materials hold tremendous promise for advances in fundamental science
            and practical applications; particularly for robust electricity generation in extreme
            and remote environments. However, for most materials, the energy conversion efficiency
            is limited by the proportionality between the electrical and thermal conductivities
            and small values of the Seebeck coefficient for metals. Despite these limitations,
            promising thermoelectric properties have been reported forsome Yb-based heavy-fermion
            compounds. In this dissertation, I explore the hypothesis that the thermoelectric
            properties of those family compounds, due to their novel structure with exotic electronic
            and magnetic properties, can be further enhanced through chemical substitution. Additionally,
            I elaborate on the manufacturability of thermoelectric devices using these compounds
            and their possible application for cooling probes.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>In the 1983 publication, Frames of Mind, Howard Gardner presented his Theory of Multiple
            Intelligences, which challenged the notion of a quantifiable single general intelligence,
            g, often measured as IQ. Gardner determined the criteria for the selection of various
            individual intelligences present in all humans and used these criteria to suggest
            the existence of seven intelligences: linguistic intelligence, musical intelligence,
            logical-mathematical intelligence, spatial intelligence, bodily-kinesthetic intelligence,
            and two personal intelligences; i.e., intrapersonal and interpersonal intelligences.
            This theory rapidly gained traction in the field of education due to its potential
            for aiding in the development of adaptable methods of teaching and learning. In his
            1999 publication, The Disciplined Mind: What All Students Should Understand, Gardner
            applied his Multiple Intelligences Theory to an educational framework for facilitating
            understanding. Gardner's work on cognition and pedagogy has been successfully applied
            in many disciplines, and the present treatise aims to utilize this framework to create
            and label a variety of approaches to fundamental tuba pedagogy and inspire others
            to do the same in this and other contexts. In the pages below, the reader can expect
            to learn about the tenets and justification of Gardner's Theory of Multiple Intelligences,
            his framework of teaching for understanding, and be introduced to different methods
            of teaching the fundamentals of breathing, sound production, intonation, range, dynamics,
            and articulation in tuba pedagogy from the lens of Gardner's framework of teaching
            for understanding and his Theory of Multiple Intelligences. This research can be expanded
            into other concepts within tuba pedagogy, and the contents herein may prove useful
            to teachers seeking to diversify their teaching.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The purpose of this study was to assess music therapists' knowledge of music therapy
            research for treatment for persons with diabetes mellitus (DM). Participants (N =
            236) for this study were music therapists who were members of the Certification Board
            of Music Therapists. Participants were emailed a link to an online survey and results
            were sent to the researcher after completion. Results indicated a significant difference
            between how well music therapists who are working with persons with DM know music
            therapy research for treatment of DM (M = 1.1, SD = 0.30) compared to music therapists
            not working with persons with DM (M = 1.47, SD = 0.76), t (167) = 4.14, p &lt; .05, d
            = 0.64. There was also a significant difference regarding how comfortable music therapists
            felt working with persons with DM (M = 3.8, SD = 1.13) compared to their wiliness
            to work with persons with DM (M = 4.4, SD = 0.92), t (364) = -4.75, p &lt; .05, d = 0.49.
            Results suggest that, while music therapists working with persons with DM know music
            therapy research better than those not working with persons with DM, they still do
            not know music therapy research well. Music therapists are, however, comfortable,
            and very willing to work with persons with DM.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>A simplified model of the Great Plains Nocturnal Low-level Jet (NLLJ) is formulated
            to include the classical inertial oscillation (Blackadar) and baroclinic (Holton)
            mechanisms. Time and height dependent solutions are analytically obtained with and
            without baroclinic forcing. Solutions are shown to be consistent with results from
            previous literature and observations. A novel application of this model is that it
            is applied to evaluate the temporal evolution of storm-relative helicity (SRH) overnight.
            That is, the NLLJ evolution is analytically linked to SRH_{0-1 km} to gauge its impact
            on magnitudes of environmental shear favorable for supercells and tornadoes. It is
            found that the NLLJ can contribute to sustaining SRH_{0-1 km} &gt; 100 m^2 / s^2 for
            more than eight hours of the nocturnal period, provided there is sufficient baroclinic
            forcing to drive stronger amplitude oscillations of the winds.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Preceramic polymers (PCPs) offer advantages in producing ceramics due to their processability
            and ability to tailor their chemical structure. However, challenges such as volume
            shrinkage and mass loss during pyrolysis often result in pores and cracks. PCP-grafted
            ceramic nanoparticles (PCPGNP) have been proposed and studied as a solution to volume
            shrinkage and mass loss problems. PCPGNPs also help to reduce aggregation and to control
            the nanoparticle arrangement. The neat state of these PCPGNPs has been characterized
            with respect to thermal properties and rheology. Dispersing PCPGNPs in commercial
            preceramic polymer matrices is another attractive, but unexplored, route to control
            the rheological and char yield properties of the matrices. In this work, a systematic
            rheological study of well-defined mixtures of a commercial PCP, SMP-877, and PCPGNPs
            (silica with poly(1,1-dimethylpropylsilane) corona) was executed to develop design
            rules for the processing of such mixtures. A rheological study demonstrated the effect
            of increasing particle concentration on network formation with percolation occurring
            between 50-60 wt%. Samples above the percolation threshold also exhibited higher viscosities
            and rapid shear thinning thus demonstrating their printability. X-ray photon correlation
            spectroscopy (XPCS) corroborated the rheology and showed two diffusive modes when
            the material was above percolation. Mixtures of PCPGNPS and SMP-877 had synergistically
            higher char yields upon thermal treatment and pyrolysis. XPCS and rheological measurements
            during thermal treatment identified thermal jamming of the polymer grafts as a key
            factor in improving the char yield. With the insights gained here we expect these
            mixed systems to provide advanced inks for additive manufacturing of ceramics for
            aerospace applications.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Through three independent essays, this manuscript addresses improving civic engagement,
            gender equity, and diversity within organizations through three unique lenses. The
            first paper explores the experiences of participants from a national leadership training
            organization providing the type of training and network building connections that
            those who are typically removed from the privilege to power pipeline fail to access.
            Ensuring a diverse workforce is often listed as an organizational goal or achievement,
            but aside from being understudied, it is also not utilized to its max capacity for
            organizational performance. Developing human capital among a diverse workforce remains
            critical for a representative and responsive public service, yet evidence-based recommendations
            for public training and development programs remain understudied. The second paper
            is based on a mixed methods gender equity study of a large police department and highlights
            opportunities for continued growth and improvement to allow masculine organizations
            to attempt to reach gender parity among their workforce and subsequently, their workforce's
            interactions with the residents they serve. The third paper is an exploratory descriptive
            case study investigating how an advocacy group, a public sector union, can influence
            voter turnout and voter registration and contribute to an uptick in civic engagement
            through voting. Implications for future coalition building and the need to expand
            future literature to study public sector labor unions in the field of public administration
            beyond focusing on collective bargaining activities.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Research on language and cognitive processes in bilinguals over the past few decades
            has underscored the activation of words in the first language (L1) during comprehension
            and production of the second language (L2) (e.g., Dijkstra, Van Jaarsveld, &amp; Ten Brinke,
            1998; Van Heuven, Dijkstra, &amp; Grainger, 1998; Hermans, Bongaerts, De Bot, &amp; Schreuder,
            1998;Lemhöfer, et al., 2008). This activation extends bidirectionally, with words
            from the L2 also influencing the processing of the L1 (e.g., Van Hell &amp; De Groot,
            2008; Linck, Kroll, &amp; Sunderman, 2009; Schmid &amp; Jarvis, 2014; Schmid &amp; Keijzer, 2009),
            leading to cross-linguistic interference (CLI) in bilinguals' language processing.
            However, the nature and extent of this interference may vary depending on the bilingual's
            dominant language and immersion context. L1-dominant bilinguals may struggle to control
            interference from their L1s, while the opposite may hold true for L2-dominant bilinguals,
            even when their L2 is not their native language. Consequently, the formerly dominant
            L1 of some bilinguals may exhibit signs of attrition. This dissertation explores the
            relationship between attrition and L2 acquisition, addressing two key questions: (1)
            to what extent does context (place of residence) and nature of bilingualism influences
            the amount and direction of cross-language interference? and (2) to what extent (if
            any) is the activation of form and meaning modulated by the nature of the lexical
            relationships and individual differences measures? And, if effects are found, how
            does sentence context modulate those effects? The contribution of this study stems
            from the novel examination of two types of semantic extensions: a) new meanings or
            words that share form but do not share any semantic relationship across languages;
            and b) extended meanings or words that share form and at least one semantic sense
            across languages. Additionally, synonyms, unrelated words, cognates, interlingual
            homographs and translation pairs are also included to explore form-meaning interactions.
            The comprehension of words with varying degrees of form-meaning relatedness is evaluated
            in two tasks: (1) a semantic-relatedness decision task (SRDT) within and across languages
            and (2) a self-paced reading task (SPR). Sentence cues in unilingual language contexts
            are manipulated in congruent and incongruent conditions to assess interference effects.
            Participants also complete a flanker task as a measure of cognitive control and a
            battery of proficiency measures. These tasks are implemented across five participant
            groups: Page 12 of 308 (1) monolingual speakers of English in the U.S, (2) monolingual
            Spanish speakers in Argentina, (3) L1 Spanish-L2 English bilinguals in the USA, (4),
            L1 Spanish-L2 English bilinguals in Argentina and (5) L1 English- L2 Spanish learners
            in the USA. Results from this study indicate that immersion context influences the
            direction of language interference, with more L2 to L1 effects observed for immersed
            bilinguals compared to non-immersed counterparts, and with both groups being vulnerable
            to CLI effects compared to monolinguals. Despite extended exposure in an L2 dominant
            context, bilinguals can maintain their L1 proficiency, contradicting L1 attrition
            views. The activation of form-meaning relationships is directly related to the nature
            of the lexical relationships, with orthographically and semantically related words
            (e.g., cognates; extended meanings) showing processing advantages over orthographically
            related but semantically unrelated words across languages (e.g., false friends, new
            meanings). Within-language semantic competitors cause more interference during processing
            compared to unrelated words. Inhibitory control mechanisms or language dominance do
            not significantly attenuate CLI effects from form-meaning competitors in the non-target
            language. Results from the SPR revealed that sentence context can modulate interference
            effects, facilitating the resolution of lexical ambiguities and form-meaning relationships.
            However, language cues from a sentence alone are not sufficient to constrain CL competition,
            highlighting the importance of semantic information conveyed by the sentence context
            for language non-selectivity to occur. Overall, bilingual characteristics, including
            the type of bilingual, linguistic exposure/experience and levels of L1-L2 proficiency
            all seem to influence language processing. This dissertation contributes to the field
            of psycholinguistics of bilingualism, language attrition and second language acquisition.
            It highlights the importance of understanding language-attrition as a bridge between
            first- and second-language lexical processing.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The purpose of this dissertation was to extend the literature base for teaching students
            with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) mathematics and self-determination
            skills using an evidence-based practice called modified schema-based instruction (MSBI).
            Chapter one provides the rationale for teaching both mathematics and self-determination
            skills to students with IDD, highlighting the correlation between both skill sets
            and positive post-secondary outcomes. This chapter presents the rationale for conducting
            this dissertation, which extends from prior MSBI research and is grounded in educational
            theory. To answer the five proposed research questions, this dissertation uses a mixed
            methods embedded experimental design. This dissertation follows mixed methods publishing
            recommendations by presenting the findings across multiple manuscripts (i.e., chapters).
            Chapter two presents the findings from the quantitative single-case design exploring
            the effects of teacher- and paraprofessional-delivered MSBI targeting personal finance
            mathematics word problems by students with IDD in a small group setting. Results indicate
            a functional relation and strong effect sizes between MSBI and learned mathematics
            skills of students with IDD, further adding to the extant literature base of positive
            student outcomes produced during MSBI instruction. Chapter three presents the findings
            from the integrated mixed methods results exploring how, why, and under what conditions
            MSBI works for teaching mathematics to students with IDD through a rigorous evaluation
            of fidelity of implementation. Findings provide important contextual information for
            how differentiated instructional delivery of MSBI can impact student outcomes; additionally,
            results identified six influences impacting instructional delivery and student outcomes,
            adding novel information for under what conditions MSBI is effective in teaching mathematics
            to students with IDD.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The Iberian city of Seville offers a case study of motif and iconographic transference
            in the late Middle Ages and Early Modern era. Previous scholars have addressed the
            idea of transference through a formal lens without consideration for the cultural
            and historical contexts that surround it, and have previously noted, though rarely
            explicated, a Sevillian school of painting. The limited foundational studies on late
            fifteenth- and early sixteenth-century artworks in Seville, most published in the
            early twentieth century, focus on stylistic categorization and the indiscriminate
            application of terms such as Hispano-Flemish and mudéjar. My dissertation nuances
            these terms through an investigation of the artworks' place and development in a Sevillian
            context, specifically parsing local and global stylistic and iconographic influences
            apparent in the works. My work addresses the local outside of the simple framework
            of mudéjar, the stylistic qualification meant to designate ornamentation, architecture,
            and motifs showing Islamic stylistic influence but created within a Christian Iberian
            context. A close study of how prints and printing in general functioned in Seville
            and Granada clarifies how iconographies were transferred across media as well as how
            specific motifs were deployed in efforts to convert Muslims and Jews. While many prints
            do not survive, my dissertation reconstructs how they were employed by the citizens
            of Seville. The function and purpose of prints varied significantly: many were kept
            in the home and used for personal devotion by so-called Old Christians; they were
            distributed to non-Christians and new converts, and helped to prevent accusations
            of apostasy; and they served as models for painted and carved panel compositions.
            Additionally, terminology like "mudéjar" does not work for a Sevillian context where
            Islamic decorative motifs were strongly connected to the culture and history of the
            city. Tracking how, when, and why these motifs were copied and transferred sheds light
            on the global function of Iberian artworks and provides insight into how these methods
            operated more broadly. My research highlights connectivity and diversity in a way
            that impacts current studies and modern understandings of how we can define globality
            in the Middle Ages.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>La related proteins (LARPs) form a superfamily of 7 distinct, homologous RNA regulatory
            protein which utilize a tandem La domain and ribonucleotide recognition motif (RRM),
            termed the La module, to recognize their individual RNA targets. LARP6, in vertebrates,
            functions to regulate the coordinated synthesis of type 1 collagen peptide mRNA during
            wound healing processes through the specific recognition of an mRNA secondary structure,
            the 5' stem loop (5'SL). This stem loop is located at the junction between the 5'
            untranslated region and protein- encoding region of mature type 1 and type 3 collagen
            mRNA, preoccupying the translation initiation codon. Prolonged injury from chronic
            disease, lifestyle, or aging results in the hyperactivity of wound healing mechanisms.
            Overactive myofibroblasts, which excrete extracellular matrix material (ECM) composed
            primarily of type 1 collagen, fill functional parenchymal tissue space with nonfunctional
            scaffoldings which rigidifies the tissue or organ. This hyperactivity results in fibrotic
            scarring which is progressively less reversible and was associated with &gt;17% of mortalities
            globally prior to 2020. LARP6 acts as a central regulatory element of type 1 collagen
            mRNA, governing the potential for high-volume collagen excretion and is therefore
            operative in the development of fibrosis.Recent work, from our lab and others, presented
            evidence that La related protein 1 (LARP1) lacks an RRM downstream from the La domain.
            Instead, the intrinsically unstructured region contains a type 2 polyadenylate binding
            protein association motif (PAM2) sequence which is recognized by the C-terminal MLLE
            domain of cytosolic polyadenylate binding protein (PABPC1). The PAM2 motif of LARP1
            and other protein functions to protect, circularize, regulate, or destabilize 3' polyadenylated
            tails of RNA polymerase II transcripts. The PAM2 motif of xi LARP1 deviates from the
            canonical physiochemical composition and standard length of the consensus sequence
            from other PAM2 motif-containing protein. In this work novel features of LARP6 substrate
            recognition and LARP1A PAM2 motif recognition are investigated by NMR spectroscopy
            and biophysical analysis, as neither system crystalized in our hands. LARP6 can recognize
            5'SL RNA without the explicit requirement of the RRM domain, which was previously
            reported to be mandatory for specific, high-affinity binding. The structure of the
            LARP6 La domain, residues 79-183, in complex with a 35-nucleotide model of the 5'
            SL has been determined by NMR spectroscopy. Specificity conferring arrangements of
            the La domain and 5'SL explain the ability of the La domain to function as an isolated
            domain. The alternative MLLE recognition elements within the LARP1 PAM2 motif have
            also been investigated. This motif deviates in its N-terminal segment from the canonical
            composition of other PAM2 motifs which have been co-crystallized with the MLLE domain.
            Chemical shift perturbation of isotopically enriched MLLE domain in the presence of
            PAM2 peptides, coupled with molecular dynamics simulations, elucidates how the differences
            between these PAM2 still result in similar binding modes on MLLE. This work is concluded
            with a review of methyl-detected NMR methods for determining allosteric motions or
            interactions with the kinetic cooperativity model of human glucokinase as a case study.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Professional development is viewed as a lifelong learning process for educators to
            improve student instruction and professional skills (Darling-Hammond et al., 2017).
            Online professional development for teachers of student who are visually impaired
            (TVIs) provides opportunities for continuing education, including for earning of recertification
            hours. With the rapid growth of online professional development, there is a need to
            assess the efficacy of synchronous and asynchronous options (Rowe, 2019). The purpose
            of this quantitative study was to compare two types of abacus professional development,
            online synchronous and online asynchronous, provided to TVIs to determine if a significant
            difference existed for growth of abacus knowledge, participant engagement, and participant
            satisfaction. Moore's transactional distance theory (1973) provided a conceptual framework
            for the study. The results of the analyses found that participants (N = 93) in both
            conditions had learning gains. The repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA)
            suggested the participants in the asynchronous condition had greater gains in abacus
            knowledge, but the proximity of the p-value (p=.051) to the customary threshold of
            .05 makes it difficult to use the p-value to draw conclusions regarding the statistical
            significance of this difference. Participants reported approximately the same levels
            of engagement or satisfaction in both conditions. This study adds to the very limited
            literature on differences in educational outcomes for online synchronous and asynchronous
            professional development for TVIs. The fact that online asynchronous professional
            development appears to have impacted learning growth more than online synchronous
            professional development was intriguing. This study suggests that online learning
            environments can be engaging and satisfying whether delivered synchronously or asynchronously.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The purpose of this research is to understand the relationship among school conditions,
            teacher job satisfaction, intention to stay, and school type (charter versus traditional
            public schools) and to determine if school conditions, and thereby job satisfaction,
            influences teachers' intention to stay in the field. Understanding this is critical
            to addressing teacher shortages from a policy and practical perspective. Data was
            collected from 275 teachers in four Florida counties, with comparable samples of charter
            and traditional public schools, through an online Qualtrics survey and all survey
            responses remained anonymous. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and independent
            samples t-test, multiple regression and multiple logistic regression analysis, and
            ANOVA to determine if significant relationships exist. The findings noted that of
            eight school conditions, six of those conditions were scored higher by charter school
            teachers, with one not significant and another higher by traditional public school
            teachers. None of the school conditions predicted a teacher's intention to stay in
            the field and only three (salary, high-stakes testing, and student behavior) significantly
            related to teacher job satisfaction. Of those three, only high-stakes testing and

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Teogonía is a symphonic poem in five sections based on the mural, Teogonía de los
            dioses chibchas, by Luis Alberto Acuña. Each section introduces one of the Chibcha
            Gods and the creation story of the Muisca people. Other references that inspired me
            are symphonic works by Latin-American composers: Silvestre Revueltas, Alberto Ginastera,
            José Pablo Moncayo, and Arturo Márquez. This work was written in partial fulfillment
            of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Music from Florida State University.
            Based on the mural located at the Hotel Tequendama in Bogotá, Colombia, Teogonía is
            meant to depict the creation story of the Muisca, or Chibcha people. While there are
            many more characters in the mural, this orchestral work illustrates the five principal
            Gods of the creation story: Chiminigagua, Súe, Chía, Chibchacum, and Bochica. The
            piece opens with Chiminigagua, the all-powerful God and creator of the universe. This
            character is represented by a three-note motive [D-F-G] which is the basis of the
            piece and reappears in each of the following sections. The piece begins in a primordial
            state of the universe until the spark of creation which leads into the second section.
            Súe is the God of the sun and represents light and energy. This upbeat section is
            characterized by the use of traditional Colombian dance rhythms, most prominently,
            the bambuco. These rhythms can be identified by the simultaneous and alternating groupings
            of two and three. The third section depicts the moon Goddess, Chía. In mythology,
            Chía and Súe are married and perpetually follow each other in the sky. This section
            is about their love and culminates in the single moment they can be together, during
            an eclipse. The fourth section tells the story of Chibchacum, God of thunder and rain.
            The orchestra, here, depicts the great storm that flooded the world, wiping away the
            corruption that had spread. The final section introduces Bochica who is commonly seen
            as the messenger of Chiminigagua. Bochica arrives after the great flood on a rainbow
            and strikes the ground with his staff creating the Tequendama falls. He teaches the
            Musica people about moral norms, ways to organize their states, agriculture, metalworking,
            and crafts. This final section concludes the piece and combines statements of all
            previous Gods' themes.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This dissertation explores women's property ownership in the south of France from
            1750-1815, with a particular emphasis on an overlooked group of women in Bas Languedoc,
            centered around Montpellier. The study investigates the impact of women's legal and
            marital status on their economic agency, filling a gap in historical scholarship that
            has neglected this specific group. In contrast to other regions of France where customary
            law prevailed, women in the south, subject to written law, enjoyed legal and social
            empowerment enabling them to independently own and manage property. This assertion
            applies regardless of social and demographic variables. The argument is substantiated
            by a blend of qualitative and quantitative evidence. Three in-depth case studies featuring
            prominent married women- the Marquise de Spinola, the Marquise de Murs, and Catherine
            Rose Mallié- serve as illustrative examples. These case studies highlight women's
            formal property ownership and their active engagement in wealth management through
            activities such as litigation, transactions, leasing, and philanthropy. To complement
            the case studies, a meticulous examination of notary and tax records reveals the breadth
            and prevalence of women's property ownership. Geographic comparisons and temporal
            analyses further illuminate the varied landscape of women's economic autonomy over
            time. This dissertation argues for the importance of regional perspectives in understanding
            French history, emphasizing the necessity to provincialize historical narratives for
            a more nuanced comprehension of women's diverse experiences. Furthermore, it challenges
            conventional assumptions about the limitations of marriage as an institution, encouraging
            historians to move beyond passive interpretations of its role in shaping women's economic
            agency.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This research delves into the complex history of Chitimacha-speaking communities to
            form a speculated migrations route during the French Colonial era. The arrival of
            the French marked a pivotal moment, introducing diseases, displacement, and cultural
            assimilation for Chitimacha-speakers as well as other Indigenous communities. This
            research analyzes historical documents, archaeological findings, and georeferenced
            maps to unravel Chitimacha-speaking communities' migration through Louisiana to the
            western Atchafalaya Basin, address the gap of knowledge of the Chitimacha-Speakers'
            past, and shed light on challenges that this research and archaeology face. Due to
            the unknown accuracy of the historic maps and where the cartographers got their data
            from, it was determined that historical maps are not a reliable dataset on their own
            to determine Indigenous migration, but instead should be analyzed alongside historical
            documents and archaeological findings. Analysis of pottery sherds helped place the
            current study area into regional context through comparisons to findings from previous
            investigations. A Coles Creek-Plaquemine component is proposed for 16SMY2 and 16SMY12
            because of the pottery sherds recovered from previous archaeological investigations
            in the region. The other three current archaeological investigation areas do not have
            enough data to be placed into context.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Dovetailing is a collection of nineteen personal essays about my experience with debilitating
            anxiety and depression. In the collection, I use birds as a mechanism to explore mental
            illness, with each essay focusing on a specific bird. Throughout the collection, I
            braid my experience seeing each essay's titular bird with research about birds, mental
            illness, literature, or other topics. The entire structure of the book mirrors the
            experience of being consumed by mental illness and learning to cope with and accept
            that illness. The opening essays of the collection are shorter, more fragmented, and
            contain more repetitions, mirroring the way anxiety is cyclical, as well as the way
            it fragments the way one experiences the world. As the collection progresses, the
            essays become more linear and less focused on anxiety, mirroring the way the narrator
            better understands her anxiety and no longer considers it an all-consuming experience.
            The final essay in the collection, "Passeridae," is fragmented and follows the narrator
            through a difficult spell of anxiety. Ending the collection this way allows the collection
            to counter the notion that anxiety and mental disorders can be "cured." While the
            essay collection investigates the way that the narrator finds watching birds a healing
            and grounding process, it also rejects the common nature writing cliche that nature
            exists to be healing. Instead, birdwatching has become a part of the narrator, just
            as she has accepted anxiety and depression as part of her. Accompanying these creative
            essays is a critical essay that examines the goals and inspirations behind my creative
            work.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Music therapy research (93%) has indicated the impact of music therapy on older adults
            with dementia, which is enhancing the quality of life, decreasing stress and agitation,
            improving mood, increasing cognitive and language skills, and improving physical movement.
            The purpose of this study was to review and analyze publications in the Journal of
            Music Therapy (JMT) and Music Therapy Perspectives (MTP) on older adults with dementia
            from the years 1980-1999 and 2000-2024. The researcher sought to find the most effective
            interventions and mostly used assessments for older adults with dementia. The results
            of this content analysis suggest that singing activities are the mostly used intervention,
            observation is the most common assessment used followed by using the Mini-Mental State
            Examination (MMSE) as a reference for creating music therapy assessments, and that
            more research is needed due to the small number of articles published. Recommendations
            were also given to expand research in the field of older adults with dementia.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The use of music therapy with adolescents/young adults (AYA) in mental health facilities
            has proven to be effective. The purpose of this research was to examine the use of
            music therapy interventions with AYA at mental health facilities in Journal of Music
            Therapy, Music Therapy Perspectives, and Voices: A World Forum for Music Therapy from
            2019 through 2024. Criteria for inclusion were music therapy applied to the population
            with music as the primary focus of the intervention, the presence of music therapy
            interventions in AYA mental health facilities and research from 2019 through 2024.
            Of the 321 articles, 21 met these criteria, and 5 were identified for further inspection.
            Overall, the specific interventions used by music therapists with this population
            is slim. Further research and in-depth annotation of music therapy interventions with
            AYA in mental health facilities is needed to continue the expansion of accessibility
            of music therapy within this population. With continued research and robust research
            contributing to the field, there is hope that a plethora of resources will be utilized
            by the field of music therapy.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>In this dissertation, we address the development of mathematical frameworks for computationally
            feasible methods to compare and analyze large datasets of complex-shaped data. We
            discuss several projects at the intersections of optimal transport, geometric measure
            theory, elastic shape analysis, and geometric deep learning that contribute novel
            algorithms for the practical analysis of shape data and develop the theoretical foundations
            of shape analysis. We propose a supervised deep geometric learning method to achieve
            a parameterization-invariant calculation of the square root velocity (SRV) shape distance
            function. This method learns the invariance of the SRV metric to reparameterizations
            by implementing a shape-preserving data augmentation method during the training process.
            Moreover, we propose an unsupervised geometric deep learning method that utilizes
            methods from geometric measure theory to learn parameterization-invariant feature
            vector representations of curves and shape graphs. This method provides a robust and
            efficient approach for the classification of shape data and the identification of
            point-to-point correspondences between curves and shape graphs. Additionally, we discuss
            several methods within a framework of relaxed matching between surfaces with respect
            to a family of second-order Sobolev metrics. These methods combine Riemannian metrics
            from elastic shape analysis for shape comparison, along with a relaxed matching loss
            from the domain of geometric measure theory, to solve the correspondence problem.
            The adoption of weighted varifold representations of shapes facilitates the matching
            of shapes with different topological structures, accommodating noise, occlusions,
            and partial matching problems between shapes. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive
            framework to perform statistical analysis of populations in the space of shapes. We
            also describe the restriction of this model to shapes that undergo deformations within
            a basis of biologically relevant or physically feasible deformations. We also discuss
            a project studying connection between the Square Root Normal Field (SRNF) elastic
            shape pseudo-metric and the Wasserstein Fisher-Rao (WFR) unbalanced optimal transport
            metric. By studying this connection, we construct algorithms and deepen the theoretical
            understanding of the SRNF and WFR metrics. Specifically, we offer a characterization
            of the closure of the SRNF map and shapes that are indistinguishable with respect
            to the SRNF metric. Furthermore, we propose a formulation of the WFR as a diffeomorphic
            optimization problem related to Gallou\"{e}t and Vialard's recent extension of the
            Riemannian submersion result of Otto.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Animal ethics is the branch of ethics concerning non-human animals. Population ethics
            is the branch of ethics concerning ethical issues related to who will exist or the
            number of people that will exist. In this dissertation, I argue for some views in
            animal ethics by appealing to insights from population ethics, and I argue for some
            views in population ethics by appealing to some insights from animal ethics. There
            are five chapters. The first chapter introduces the project, while the subsequent
            chapters each present one of four independent essays. The chapters can be read in
            any order and each one is self-contained. In the second chapter, I defend a virtue
            ethics approach to animal ethics. In the third chapter, I discuss an objection to
            my approach to animal ethics, namely that my approach runs counter to common sense.
            In the fourth chapter, I defend a theory of well-being that helps us to avoid the
            so-called "repugnant conclusion," a conclusion that many population ethicists desire
            to avoid. In the fifth chapter, I defend a view about the so-called "non-identity
            problem," by denying the distinction between doing and allowing harm in what I refer
            to as "non-identity cases".</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The contemporary power grid landscape is witnessing a transformative shift. As the
            integration ofrenewable energy resources intensifies and decarbonization objectives
            gain prominence, there is a discernible migration from traditional synchronous generator
            (SG)-based systems to inverter-based resources (IBRs). This shift, while promising,
            heralds the dawn of a modernized electric power grid characterized by unparalleled
            flexibility and adaptability. Despite the potential advantages, this transition presents
            complex challenges. At the forefront is the phase-locked loop (PLL), a critical synchronization
            mechanism for the AC power grid. While its role in inverter controls is essential,
            it has been linked to issues such as oscillations and subsynchronous harmonics. Additionally,
            the "black start"process remains a significant concern. For SGs, initiating a black
            start can be time-consuming, often taking tens of minutes due to factors like the
            mechanical inertia of generators, extended energizing transients, and system control
            latency. In the context of IBRs, the black start process is similarly constrained,
            especially by the bandwidth limitations of the PLL. To address these challenges, this
            thesis presents a novel PLL-free inverter control approach. Impressively, this new
            control, even without the PLL, offers a faster transient response to various grid
            changes while maintaining a low steady-state error. We also introduce advanced startup
            methods for IBRs. Our hysteresis-based technique allows inverters to connect to the
            grid within one fundamental cycle without inrush current and is resilient to grid
            voltage distortions. Further, we propose a switching-cycle-based startup method, enabling
            inverters to become operational within just two switching cycles, without any inrush
            current. Together, these innovative methods not only improve the black start process
            for IBRs but also enhance the overall stability and resilience of power systems.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This dissertation proposes a novel approach to policy innovation and dissemination
            studies by developing a comprehensive framework incorporating three key dimensions:
            space, time, and actors. Policy innovation and diffusion research in the spatial dimension
            should prioritize the domestic realm and encompass the global sphere. This dissertation
            demonstrates the influence of national culture on the dissemination of a worldwide
            policy, using the gender mainstreaming policy as a case study. Using quantitative
            comparative analysis (QCA) on data from 44 nations, I can identify three distinct
            pathways when studying the relationship between national culture and the diffusion
            of global gender mainstreaming policy. This innovative technique is particularly well-suited
            for symbolic measures. As the adage goes, "Yesterday is history. The future is a mystery.
            However, today is a gift." Academics do acknowledge the significance of the present
            circumstances. Nevertheless, it is imperative to recognize the values of both historical
            and future-oriented principles. Hence, exploring the integration of path dependency,
            policy innovation, and diffusion is a valuable subject for researchers. Using GMM
            models, I have observed that fiscal transparency rankings, as opposed to specific
            fiscal transparency scores, play a more crucial role in deterring corruption in China.
            Furthermore, the previous fiscal transparency ranking had a significant influence
            on corruption in China.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Pursuing higher education in a foreign country entails numerous challenges and opportunities
            for development for international students. Social media allows individuals adapting
            to a new environment to connect, communicate, collaborate, network, and learn, overcoming
            geographical, temporal, linguistic, cultural, and social boundaries. In this study,
            I explored how international graduate students used social media to seek support for
            acculturation and academic integration, as well as their perceptions of the benefits
            and challenges of using social media for support-seeking. I employed a naturalistic
            multiple-case study design to investigate this phenomenon relating to international
            graduate students' acculturation and academic integration with social media. I selected
            participants through snowball and purposeful sampling. The inclusion criteria included
            that students were in the same university, had finished their first year of study
            in their academic program, and used social media regularly for support-seeking. The
            primary inclusion criterion was that students had spent their first year of study
            in their educational program and used social media regularly for support-seeking.
            I balanced participant samples based on demographic backgrounds, including country
            of origin, field of study, and gender, to understand diverse students' experiences.Participants
            were eleven international graduate students from seven countries studying in education,
            social science, humanities, and STEM programs, with an average age of 27. Data were
            collected through two semi-structured interviews via Zoom and ten participant-generated
            digital artifacts via Padlet from each participant depicting their use of social media
            for acculturation and academic integration. Data were transcribed, cleaned, and anonymized
            before data analysis. I adopted inductive and deductive thematic analysis, guided
            by Activity Systems Analysis (ASA), as the analytic framework for my data analysis.
            I used the qualitative data analysis software NVivo to facilitate data analysis. The
            study findings revealed that international graduate participants' primary objectives
            for using social media were to receive emotional and social support, manage daily
            and academic tasks, and integrate into their local and academic communities. Participants
            used a mix of home-country and U.S. social media platforms, with some employing a
            wide range of platforms and web services and others opting for a few selective ones.
            Participants purposefully tailored social media platforms to suit the groups of people
            they interacted with, the tasks they addressed, and their personal preferences and
            topics at hand. The advantages of using social media for support-seeking included
            affordability, convenience, vast access to information, and extended social and incidental
            learning opportunities. However, several tensions arose from negative experiences,
            such as emotional distress related to social media engagement, with some intensified
            by algorithms designed for mindless scrolling. Commonly reported tensions included
            digital distractions, compulsive use of social media, and mindless scrolling. Other
            tensions included varying information quality and limited access to different language
            information sources. Accordingly, implications for practice and future research were
            discussed, including implementing social media curricula to support students' effective
            use of social media for personal and professional goals while adapting to their new
            cultural and educational environment.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Since the passing of NAGPRA legislation in 1990, the academic community has published
            extensively on the process of repatriation and its impacts on the field of anthropology
            and stakeholder communities. While systemic critiques of the legislation are widespread
            in anthropological advocacy and discourse, there remains a gap in the literature about
            the actual processes of repatriation and the application of NAGPRA regulations, particularly
            as they relate to collections that have become/remained split amongst various state
            entities, universities, museums, and federal holdings. Through a process of literature

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Spanish-English speaking multilinguals (MLs) with Developmental Language Disorders
            (DLD) have greater difficulty with verb morphology compared to their typically developing
            peers. Patterns of error are observed in both monolinguals and MLs. However, there
            are more studies that have explored the effectiveness of grammar intervention targeting
            verb morphology for monolinguals compared to MLs. Moreover, there are even fewer studies
            that compare the effectiveness of implicit and explicit approaches used in grammar
            interventions. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine an adapted alternating
            treatment single case design (AATD) to compare the (1) effectiveness of implicit and
            explicit approaches used in grammar interventions that target the inflectional past
            tense –ED and third person singular –s (3S) and (2) efficiency of the implicit and

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This study explores tonal states in the music of Dmitri Shostakovich (1906–1975) by
            examining harmony and voice leading from a Schenkerian perspective. Chapter 1 examines
            Shostakovich's realignment with socialist aesthetic ideologies in 1936, demonstrating
            how traditional idioms and forms in works written after the Pravda attacks enable
            a wider range of access points for tonal analysis. Methodologies derived from Russian
            theoretical thought such as modal lowering and modal derivation address surface relations;
            however, they do not make connections between local modal elements and large-scale
            tonal structure. Analyses by David Fanning and Sarah Marlowe demonstrate that while
            modal and chromatic behaviors are exhibited at foreground levels, these events represent
            post-tonal intensifications of customary idioms that unfold within broader tonal designs.
            Schenkerian processes of mixture and tonicization illustrate how Shostakovich's modal-chromatic
            qualities can be contextualized within tonal frameworks. Building on the modal and
            tonal analytical models from Chapter 1, Chapter 2 investigates how selected passages
            from Shostakovich's music articulate tonal structures in a variety of post-1936 works,
            including the second movement of String Quartet No. 9, the fourth movement of String
            Quartet No. 3, and Prelude Nos. 4, 13, and 22 from the Twenty-Four Preludes and Fugues,
            op. 87. Schenkerian theory contextualizes modal and chromatic inflections in String
            Quartet Nos. 3 and 9 within deeper levels of counterpoint and through the processes
            of simple, secondary, and double mixture. In Prelude Nos. 4, 13, and 22, Shostakovich's
            emulation of Baroque contrapuntal techniques produces foreground and middleground
            structures that resonate with customary linear models in the Bach-to-Brahms tradition.
            Although static structures are generated in Prelude Nos. 4 and 22, prolongational
            techniques express their monotonal designs. Chapter 3 examines the tonal structure
            of the Passacaglia from Shostakovich's Violin Concerto No. 1. At the middleground
            level, this movement produces a static bass line and an incomplete Urlinie (\hat{5}–\hat{4}–\hat{3}).
            The passacaglia rotations navigate tonal pathways through goal-oriented counterpoint,
            motivic confirmation of structural thirds, and local bass arpeggiations. The ground
            bass expands the tonic through surface-level arpeggiations, interior \hat{5}–\hat{1}
            motions, and the linear idiom 5–6–5 above the tonic pedal, producing a static harmonic
            state in the first half of the middleground. In the second half, the modulatory function
            of the cadenza is expressed as it transitions into the last movement, illustrating
            how chromatic voice leading bridges the F minor key area of the Passacaglia with A
            minor. Although Schenkerian theory does not accommodate modulations at the structural
            level, Chapter 3 introduces a model for contextualizing harmony and voice leading
            in Shostakovich's attacca transitions. The second case study explores tonal expressions
            in the second movement of Symphony No. 12. Chapter 4 demonstrates how modal lowering
            and mixture generate chromatic elements in the second movement's themes, motives,
            and secondary key areas. The modally lowered theme establishes a monotonal state through
            third motions, tonic arpeggiations, and 5–6–5 gestures. A linear framework for the
            second movement elucidates how its secondary key areas function as chromatic embellishments
            of standard contrapuntal procedures. A Schenkerian approach illustrates tonal closure
            within the obligatory register, producing a melodic structure that resonates with
            customary Urlinien. Lastly, Chapter 5 analyzes selected passages from Shostakovich's
            "formalist" works in 1927–1936, including opera Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District,
            the first movement of Symphony No. 4 in C Minor, and Symphony No. 2. These works present
            challenges to Schenkerian methodologies in that they provide fewer access points for
            tonal orientations. Analysis of tonal structure and voice leading in these pieces
            is complicated by mutable passages that generate subsets of pitches that compete for
            centricity, counterpoint that lacks directed motion toward a tonal goal (non-functional
            counterpoint), and melodies with modal orientations that are less responsive to tonal
            methodology. The studies provide a foundation for tonal applications to Shostakovich's
            music. Ultimately, the analyses demonstrate that many components of Shostakovich's
            compositional process are addressed by a Schenkerian approach.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Mountain glaciers export ancient, energy-rich, and highly bioavailable dissolved organic
            matter (DOM) to freshwater and marine ecosystems, influencing downstream carbon cycling
            and supporting food webs. Despite its importance and the sensitivity of mountain glaciers
            to climate change, the sources of organic matter (OM) underpinning glacier DOM composition
            and its high bioavailability remain poorly constrained. To date, our understanding
            of the glacier carbon cycle has been formed from a handful of glaciers in a small
            number of regions (typically Greenland, Alaska, and the High Mountains of Asia), where
            geographically disparate studies have yielded different conclusions as to the dominant
            source of glacier OM. For example, studies in Greenland have suggested glacier DOM
            is predominately microbial in origin, whereas studies based in Alaska and Tibet postulate
            DOM to be primarily atmospheric deposition-derived. Implicitly, these studies indicate
            there may be regional and global heterogeneity in glacier DOM source and composition,
            which would have implications for understanding the fate of glacier-derived DOM and
            the age of carbon respired across glacier-fed ecosystems. In this dissertation combined
            analytical approaches (including molecular-level and carbon isotopic techniques) are
            used to assess glacier DOM composition across regional and global gradients. We highlight
            the glacier DOM pool as a distinct and dynamic carbon pool in the global carbon cycle,
            with significant diversity in DOM source and composition at both intra-regional and
            global scales. By analyzing global variability in composition across 136 glacier outflows
            covering six continents, we demonstrate glacier DOM is regionally distinct, where
            its composition is largely determined by the relative contribution of OM from in situ
            production and atmospheric deposition. We combine molecular-level, and bulk and compound-specific
            black carbon isotopic analyses, to show that anthropogenic deposition (i.e., fossil
            fuel combustion byproducts) has impacted glacier carbon cycling at the global scale.
            Nonetheless, in regions downwind of industrial centers (e.g., Alaska) the glacier
            OM pool is likely older and more stable in composition compared to remote regions
            (e.g., Ecuador), where glacier DOM is likely predominately derived from in situ production.
            In glaciers dominated by in situ production, the DOM exported to downstream and marine
            ecosystems is likely younger in radiocarbon age and relatively more aliphatic (i.e.,
            energy-rich). Using novel respiratory carbon recovery system experiments for a subset
            of glacier outflows in southeast Alaska, we conclude this modern, in situ produced
            OM, may underpin the high bioavailability of the glacier dissolved organic carbon
            (DOC) pool. Thus, although globally glacier DOC is ancient and bioavailable, a modern
            pool of OM may underpin its high bioavailability. Together, these findings have wide
            ranging implications for how we contextualize the glacier carbon cycle and the role
            of glacier-derived DOC in downstream ecosystems.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The purpose of this Dissertation in Practice was to explore the relationship between
            cultural intelligence and burnout in teachers. This purpose was rooted in a growing
            trend of teachers reporting a significant degree of burnout and education frequently
            being noted as one of the most stressful professions in the job market (Johnson et
            al., 2005; Saloviita &amp; Pakarinen, 2021). In particular, teachers who work with a culturally
            heterogeneous student body face challenges with linguistic, behavioral, and social
            differences which can result in work-related stress which, if unmanaged, leads to
            burnout (Dilg, 2003; Dubbeld et al., 2019; Gutentag et al., 2018). Since cultural
            intelligence is an indicator as to how successful a person will be navigating culturally
            diverse environments and has been related to outcomes associated with job performance
            and job satisfaction (Baluku et al., 2019), it is worth exploring whether a relationship
            exists between the four factors of cultural intelligence and the three factors of
            burnout. This exploratory research study used a quantitative approach with a survey
            method. Research participants included 153 PK-12th grade teachers working at an international
            boarding school located in South Florida. Data collected was analyzed through the
            lens of three research questions:What level of cultural intelligence (CQ) and degree
            of burnout are reported by teachers working at an international school in the United
            States? How do the levels of teacher CQ and degree of burnout differ by teachers'
            demographic characteristics? What are the relationships between the four factors of
            cultural intelligence and the three factors of burnout in teachers working at an international
            school in the United States? The data was analyzed using descriptive statistics, independent
            t-tests, and a series of multiple linear regression models. The results of the study
            are reported in two parts. First the descriptive statistics and results from the t-tests
            for the mean differences of each factor of CQ and each factor of burnout between demographic
            groups are reported. Second, multiple linear regression models were fitted, and the
            results of each model were addressed. All data analyses were conducted using SPSS.
            The results of the multiple linear regression analyses are especially important as
            this research found that teachers with high motivational cultural intelligence tend
            to report lower degrees of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization and higher degrees
            of personal accomplishment. This study expands the knowledge on cultural intelligence
            in educators by finding that Motivational CQ was the only factor statistically significantly
            related to all three factors of burnout. Moving forward, it is recommended that educational
            leaders focus on professional development aimed at increasing a teacher's motivational
            cultural intelligence as this may lead to a decrease in their burnout. Two limitations
            of this study are the small sample size and the fact that all teachers work at the
            same school. Therefore, it is suggested that future research examines the relationship
            between cultural intelligence and burnout by surveying a larger sample size of teachers
            who work at multiple schools to allow for greater generalizability of the results.</p>

            an in-depth analysis of 181 journal articles published in the American Music Therapy
            Association (AMTA) journals. These publications were categorized by their degree of
            relevance to the practice of teaching social skills. Although a frequently assigned
            treatment goal and a topic of considerable interest, there remains disagreement among
            professionals on how to operationally define social skills. The results reflect this
            discrepancy but provide some useful recommendations on how to successfully treat social
            skills in music therapy practice with a variety of populations. The most common social
            skills addressed in music therapy practice were those of initiating verbal communication
            (49%) and self-regulation (19%). Interventions addressing social skills were implemented
            by board-certified music therapists typically to children and adolescents with developmental
            disabilities (31.8%) and mental health disorders (15.4%) using applications with musical
            instrument play (32%) and group singing (22.9%). Implications for future practice
            and research are discussed.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>In drug discovery, predicting protein-ligand binding structures and affinities is
            crucial for lead identification. Over the past decades, molecular dynamics simulation-based
            approaches have gained prominence in this endeavor. Despite some progress, achieving
            accurate and efficient protein-ligand binding prediction remains challenging. This
            doctoral dissertation addresses several challenges by focusing on understanding the
            molecular dynamics sampling bottleneck, developing an accurate isobaric-isothermal
            ensemble, and creating an automated program to streamline simulation workflow for
            large-scale lead identification.Enabling sufficient and robust sampling for quantitative
            protein-ligand binding prediction is challenging in molecular dynamics simulation.
            Motivated by specific viewpoints on existing sampling challenges, active developments
            were made largely in four categories: unguided free energy sampling methods, geometry-based
            free energy sampling methods, alchemical free energy sampling methods, and trajectory
            stratification approaches. We systematically analyzed these representative methods.
            In particular, we focus our discussion on essential features of these methods and
            derive our viewpoint that the orthogonal space sampling problem is the major bottleneck
            for all of the existing methods. Future areas of improvement that need to be explored
            was also expanded. The isobaric-isothermal (NPT) ensemble mimics conditions often
            encountered in chemical and biochemical experiments. Thus, its accuracy is important
            in obtaining correct biomolecular dynamics and thermodynamic properties in molecular
            dynamics simulations. We introduced "MTK-Langevin", a novel NPT ensemble method meticulously
            optimized the critical components that significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency.
            Specifically, MTK-Langevin: 1) incorporated correction terms to the equations of motion
            for the desired NPT partition function, 2) used the Langevin piston algorithm for
            barostat thermalization to reduce mass-dependent ringing effects, 3) integrated the
            barostat using BAOAB scheme to ensure minimal error and high stability, and 4) optimized
            parameters for improved equilibration efficiency. Tests showed MTK-Langevin achieved
            accurate temperature and pressure control with fast equilibration. Alchemical free
            energy simulations entail intricate steps, making manual setup labor-intensive and
            error prone. Practical lead identification campaigns often require numerous calculations,
            rendering manual setup impractical. To address this, we developed "AutoAlchem" to
            automate the simulation workflow. AutoAlchem streamlines topology generation, system
            building, equilibration, GPU-accelerated production runs, and data analysis. Tested
            in lead optimization, it consistently delivers accurate and efficient setup. Key features
            of AutoAlchem include integration of enhanced sampling methods and active learning
            techniques, allowing for large-scale simulations with high recall rates while sampling
            only a subset of molecules. In summary, these studies highlighted the sampling bottleneck
            during protein ligand binding process and developed an NPT ensemble method and an
            automated workflow aimed at enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of protein ligand
            binding prediction.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This treatise is in two chapters, each based on a lecture recital I presented during
            my doctoral studies at Florida State University. While the topics are not specifically
            related to each other, both explore performance practices and compositional processes
            that are not typically considered part of the modern Western classical keyboard tradition.
            The first half concerns itself with historical keyboard improvisation. Variation sets
            by W.A. Mozart and C.P.E. Bach are examined for their relationship to improvised eighteenth-century
            performances and explored as potential learning resources for would-be improvisers.
            The second half is devoted to three piano pieces by the contemporary composers Gareth
            Farr, Reena Esmail, and Zhou Long. Each piece combines specific Asian classical traditions
            with Western composition. The cross-cultural elements present in each composition
            are analyzed and contextualized to aid performers, scholars, and listeners.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>From its inception, Joseph Smith Jr.'s Latter Day Saint Movement, and by consequence,
            many of the hymns that accompanied this religious tradition, have been preoccupied
            with place and geography. Looking to Latter Day Saint scripture, as well as Smith's
            particular theologies of Millennialism, embodiment, and exaltation, this thesis contextualizes
            the descriptions of place within early Latter Day Saint hymns as both soundscapes
            and a dialogue with the movement's own sacred geography. These hymns served as tools
            of sonic placemaking, imbuing the landscape with meaning for the Latter Day Saints
            as the main body of the movement migrated westward, from New York to Ohio, Missouri,
            Illinois, and finally as refugees to the Salt Lake Valley in the Great Basin area
            of the American West. As musical negotiations with the North American continent and
            the larger globe, these Latter Day Saint hymns enabled their writers and performers,
            European and Euro-American settlers and colonizers, to interact with their surroundings
            and create a sonic space for themselves in the New World.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Ultra high performance concrete (UHPC) is an advanced construction material for civil
            infrastructure development due to its supreme mechanical characteristics and distinct
            durability properties. There is a notable surge in the application of UHPC, particularly
            in highway infrastructures in the United States. The current dissertation addresses
            two critical challenges regarding the implementation of UHPC structures. The first
            part of the dissertation investigates the impact of fiber orientation and construction
            processes on the structural performance of UHPC. A comprehensive synthesis of existing
            literature and the UHPC structural design specifications and recommendations worldwide
            is conducted to understand how construction processes impact fiber orientation in
            UHPC elements and how this influence should be addressed in UHPC design. In the second
            part of the dissertation, sustainable UHPC materials are developed using a multi-scale
            and probabilistic design approach. A key challenge with UHPC is its high price and
            high environmental impact from carbon emissions associated with the use of manufactured
            steel fibers. This study explores the feasibility of using recycled steel fibers (RSF)
            derived from waste tires in UHPC production. The characteristics of RSF are comprehensively
            characterized, and their influence on the pullout behavior is determined through experimental
            and analytical methods. A multi-scale probabilistic framework is then employed to
            facilitate the design of UHPC composites incorporating RSF. The cost of UHPC production
            using MSF and RSF are calculated and compared where RSF based UHPC showed significantly
            lower production cost. The embodied carbon and embodied energy for these UHPCs are
            also calculated and again RSF based UHPCs showed more sustainability with significantly
            lower values for these parameters. In conclusion, the dissertation contributes to
            the sustainable development of UHPC structures by addressing key issues such as fiber
            orientation and utilizing recycled materials, ultimately enhancing the environmental
            and economic feasibility of UHPC applications in infrastructure construction.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Chapter 1 explores how shared micromobility impacts other transportation networks,
            specifically taxi markets in New York City. I exploit the spatial variation in the
            rollout of Citi Bike dock stations in a difference-in-differences research design.
            I find that Citi Bike and taxis are substitutes, with the average taxi market experiencing
            a 3.2% decline in trips each week. Heterogeneity analysis suggests that this effect
            is largely driven by rider substituting for relatively short trips. Two potential
            mechanisms are explored; direct substitution to Citi Bike and substituting from taxis
            to use Citi Bike and public transportation in tandem. I find evidence that both mechanisms
            generate the observed substitution pattern. Chapter 2 explores how transportation
            stations impact local crime. Most studies on the link between crime and transit stations
            focus on public transportation, however, there is limited evidence for other transportation
            alternatives, like micromobility. Using a spatial difference-in-differences research
            design, we provide evidence that bike share docking stations cause a significant increase
            in crime within 25 meters by leveraging data on Citi Bike and reported crime in New
            York City. Our results are robust across various estimators and counterfactuals, and
            we find heterogeneous effects depending on the type of crime and the time of day a
            crime was reported to have occurred. These findings provide insights into the external
            costs of micromobility, offering policymakers further information when considering
            its adoption as a transportation alternative. Chapter 3 investigates the impact of
            shared micromobility access on self-reported drunk driving using data from the Behavioral
            Risk Factor Surveillance System survey for Selected Metropolitan/Micropolitan Area
            Risk Trends. By exploiting the heterogeneous rollout of shared micromobility services
            in the metropolitan area in a difference-in-differences research design, I estimate
            a small but negative point estimate for the effect of micromobility access on self-reported
            drunk driving. Standard errors for the estimates are large, resulting in statistically
            insignificant results. Therefore, I remain agnostic in the interpretation of my results.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The built environment consists of various, diverse, and independent systems distributed
            across different organizational levels, such as team, project, regional, state, and
            national, creating a structured hierarchy. Interactions within and between these hierarchical
            levels, involving human participants, physical resources, and policies, are crucial
            for the functionality and efficiency of these systems. However, these interactions—physical,
            spatial, logical, and cyber in nature—can lead to unexpected 'emergent' properties
            or behaviors not anticipated in the original design of the systems.Emergence, a concept
            well-recognized in systems engineering, has not been fully integrated into research
            and practice related to the built environment. Scientific attempts to study processes
            in the built environment often adopt a reductionist perspective, treating the outcome
            of the built environment as the sum of its individual elements, thus simplifying and
            neglecting the complexity arising from continuous interactions among components. This
            simplification can overlook emergent behaviors that significantly influence planning
            and management across various areas, including construction productivity, safety,
            infrastructure planning, and operations, either positively or negatively. Considering
            the magnitude and nature of impact of any resultant emergent behavior on the holistic
            outcome of operations and processes in the built environment, it is crucial to acknowledge
            and account for emergence during planning and decision-making. This necessity becomes
            especially vital within the framework of resilience and sustainability planning, where
            achieving ambitious goals demands a holistic approach that transcends isolated entity
            planning. To date, research exploring emergence within engineering contexts has been
            limited. Even among the limited engineering studies that recognize the potential impact
            of emergent behavior and its significance, formalized analysis approaches are lacking.
            Moreover, none of these studies have endeavored to regulate the interactions underlying
            emergent behavior in pursuit of more favorable outcomes. As such, the potential of
            incorporating the concept of emergence in built environment planning and decision-making,
            particularly within the realms of sustainability and resilience, remains largely untapped.
            This research seeks to fill this gap by developing a formalized framework for effective
            modeling, analysis, and control of emergent behavior. It begins with establishing
            a taxonomy of emergent behaviors, classifying them into four distinct types based
            on (a) nature of underlying interactions, (b) level of complexity, and (c) boundaries
            of information available. This taxonomy is then used as a foundation for a three-step
            framework – (i) classification, (ii) operationalization, and (iii) implementation
            – for the systematic modeling and analysis of the different types of emergence within
            construction and infrastructure engineering and management applications. This study
            demonstrates the efficacy of the developed framework in augmenting and guiding system-
            and operational level planning and decision-making within the contexts of infrastructure
            resilience and construction sustainability planning through two case studies. The
            first case study examines the disparities in the resilience of municipal solid waste
            management systems (MSWMSs) during the COVID-19 pandemic stemming from their complex
            socio-technical interactions. Specifically, empirical investigation of the operation
            of MSWMSs during the course of the pandemic was conducted in order to investigate
            the variance in their adopted adaptation pathways as a function of their systems characteristic,
            particularly in terms of composition, topology, and control. Subsequently, these variances
            were used to explain the emerged resilience performance of MSWMSs, particularly with
            regards to (i) the resourcefulness of each system in establishing and implementing
            response measures and (ii) its rapidity in recovering and adapting to increasingly
            complex and dynamic conditions. Findings from this case study serve as a foundation
            for enhancing the resilience of MSWMSs to future pandemics and other disturbances.
            The second case study investigates the improvements or reductions in the productivity
            of heavy equipment during demolition debris sorting operations stemming from their
            spatial interactions. Specifically, lab-based scaled models of demolition operations
            utilizing small-scale excavators were employed to monitor the variables impacting
            the underlying spatial interactions, particularly (i) the proximity between excavators
            and (ii) the orientation of excavators during operations. Statistical models were
            subsequently established to explain the resulting impact on the collective productivity
            based on these variables. The insights gained from this case study provide a basis
            for optimizing excavator allocation and spatial arrangement during material separation
            operations to maximize the recovery of recyclable demolition waste.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Following the Affordable Care Act (ACA), state governments have had the option to
            expand the eligibility of Medicaid programs since 2014. The expansion states increased
            the eligibility threshold to 138% of the federal poverty line, which allows more individuals
            to be covered by the program. In the first year, twenty-seven states, including the
            District of Columbia, decided to expand the program. However, several states hesitated
            to adopt the expansion, primarily due to concerns regarding the potential increase
            in fiscal burdens. Therefore, it is imperative to investigate whether Medicaid expansion
            significantly impacts state budgets thoroughly. Furthermore, Medicaid expansion also
            affects hospitals and healthcare providers, as it leads to a decrease in the uninsured
            rate and expands coverage. Consequently, it is crucial to examine how expansion alters
            managerial conditions and decision-making processes within healthcare organizations.
            Moreover, given that the primary goal of Medicaid expansion is to improve access to
            care for low-income individuals, it is imperative to assess the policy outcomes in
            a more precise and comprehensive manner. This necessitates thorough evaluation and
            analysis to understand the extent to which Medicaid expansion achieves its intended
            objectives and addresses the healthcare needs of low-income populations effectively.
            In this regard, this dissertation aims to provide a more clear and comprehensive understanding
            of the impact of Medicaid expansion by investigating from the perspectives of state
            governments, hospitals, and low-income individuals. To assess whether the expansion
            imposes an excessive fiscal burden on the states that adopt the policy, I explore
            how the number of Medicaid enrollees, expenditures for the program, and overall state
            fiscal conditions respond to a sudden economic downturn and analyze whether states
            expanded the programs should bear more fiscal burden compared to states that have
            not adopted it. Also, I focus on the fact that nonprofit hospitals have been criticized
            for providing benefits to their communities at an insufficient level despite enjoying
            enormous amounts of savings due to their tax-exemption status. Employing the principal-agent
            theory to understand the decision-making mechanisms underlying this behavior, I investigated
            whether Medicaid expansion mitigates this agency problem. Moreover, to offer a more
            comprehensive evaluation of Medicaid expansion's impact on access to care, I analyze
            whether the benefits of the policy are distributed differently among individuals depending
            on the presence of accessibility barriers. The findings of my study indicate that
            the Medicaid expansion would not significantly increase the fiscal burden for the
            states while allowing many people to stay insured during economic recessions. Also,
            the expansion affects the managerial conditions of nonprofit hospitals by decreasing
            their costs of uncompensated care. Despite this saving, hospitals are found not to
            change their behavior and to keep their scrutiny in providing financial assistance
            to their patients. In addition, my finding shows that Medicaid expansion relieves
            the financial burden of healthcare for low-income people, but the benefits are not
            universal to them. When individuals have low accessibility to their healthcare providers,
            they still have limited access to care even though they have have same health conditions
            and income levels. That is, there exists a disparity in the benefits from Medicaid
            expansion among the low-income groups. With these findings, I contribute to the relevant
            literature by offering a deeper understanding of the impact of Medicaid expansion,
            both theoretically and empirically. By exploring the nuances of Medicaid expansion's
            effects on state budgets, healthcare organizations, and access to care, my research
            provides valuable insights into the multifaceted implications of this policy. Furthermore,
            I offer practical implications for policymakers to understand the true costs of Medicaid
            expansion better and identify areas for policy refinement to enhance access to care
            effectively. By highlighting the potential challenges and opportunities associated
            with Medicaid expansion, policymakers can make informed decisions to optimize the
            policy's effectiveness and ensure equitable access to healthcare for all individuals.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Shipboard power systems (SPS) are increasing their reliance on communication systems.
            Communication enables system-level controls to coordinate the usage of the SPS and
            provide significant improvements (e.g., size, weight, cost). Communication is commonly
            divided into layers (application, presentation, session, transport, network, data
            link, physical). While the lower layers have not had significant changes, the application
            layer is constantly in flux. New protocols are often introduced, providing new capabilities
            to facilitate communication.Real-time simulation (RTS) is a tool that has been effectively
            utilized to study SPSs. Many models and techniques exist. Similarly, the simulation
            of computer networks exists. However, leveraging these Real-time simulation tools/facilities
            for evaluating protocols has received little attention. Currently, a co-simulation
            environment of the SPS electrical system and its computer network provides a way to
            evaluate the operation of SPS models and assess their capabilities. Protocols are
            typically defined in the communication system. Yet not much is known about the potential
            impact of these protocols. This work proposes a framework to evaluate application
            layer communication protocols in the communication system of system-level SPS controls
            using RTS. The framework's effectiveness was demonstrated by analyzing Modbus TCP
            and Data Distribution Service (DDS). The network utilization metric was used to compare
            and contrast the protocols.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Romantic love and intimacy are critical for emerging adults to explore self-identity.
            Relationship efficacy is a cognitive process related to conflict management that plays
            an important role in romantic relationship development and quality. Overparenting,
            characterized by high control and involvement, could undermine the development of
            emerging adults. Despite the potential negative impact of overparenting, the association
            between overparenting and relationship efficacy remains unexplored. Furthermore, differences
            related to norms in romantic relationship development and parenting practices across
            cultures should be considered, particularly between individualistic societies in the
            U.S. and collectivist societies in Asia. Using a person-centered approach, this study
            aimed to investigate the associations between profiles of overparenting and relationship
            efficacy in the U.S. and Hong Kong. Additionally, the potential moderation by individual-level
            cultural beliefs was explored to investigate whether these associations vary by horizontal
            individualism, vertical individualism, horizontal collectivism, or vertical collectivism.
            Data were collected from 235 American and 303 Hong Kong Chinese emerging adults who
            were currently in a romantic relationship. Overparenting was assessed across academic,
            financial, relational, health domains. Results from latent profile analysis (LPA)
            revealed three profiles in the U.S sample and two profiles in the Hong Kong sample.
            Regression analyses indicated that an "overall high overparenting" profile was associated
            with the lowest level of relationship efficacy in both samples. A distinct "overall
            medium overparenting, but high in financial and low in relational overparenting" profile
            emerged in the U.S. sample which was related to the most optimal relationship efficacy
            among American emerging adults. Additionally, moderating effects by individual cultural
            beliefs suggested that, in the U.S. sample, individuals with higher vertical individualism
            beliefs were found to be more susceptible to the negative impact of "overall high
            overparenting" on relationship efficacy compared to those who experienced "overall
            low overparenting." Implications, future directions, and limitations were further
            discussed.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are a pivotal component of highly successful modern
            Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT. FPGA's capabilities
            of parallelism and efficiency provide an opportunity to provide quicker computation
            of ANNs than both CPUs or GPUs, whilst consuming much less power in both in data center
            and edge computing environments. A custom instruction component for the Nios II soft
            processor and supporting software were developed to allow easy, configurable generation
            and deployment of high-performance ANN inference on FPGA devices. The custom instruction
            performs integer matrix-vector multiplications, with each column of the product computed
            in parallel with pipelined multiply accumulate units. Nios II embedded computer systems
            were created both with and without the generated custom instruction. FPGA device resource
            utilization and execution time were evaluated for each system when performing ANN-based
            image classification on the MNIST handwritten digit database. Speedups of over 300x
            were achieved when using the custom instruction, at the expense of higher FPGA resource
            utilization.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Repeated evolution in biology is widespread among morphologic forms but also recognized
            at essentially all biological levels. Organisms achieving the same functional goal
            is reported at the level of simple biochemical pathways, complex tissue types, and
            even social behaviors. Before the advent of the sequencing revolution, studies of
            repeated evolution centered on morphologic data. With the power of current DNA technologies
            researchers are increasingly focusing on understanding how repeated forms at the phenotypic
            level arise at the genetic level. Most of the trait's biologists' study are likely
            continuous and polygenic in nature. Additionally, within diploid sexual organisms,
            these traits often could exist within populations which consist predominantly of standing
            genetic variation, opening the door for drift to create genetic variance dictated
            by history and not fitness. To investigate genetic repeatability from standing genetic
            variation and retain a possible insight into macroevolutionary outcomes I designed
            an experiment using two recently diverged species of Drosophila. To create a parallel
            phenotypic response, we designed a parallel divergent artificial selection experiment
            in D. melanogaster and D. simulans predominantly selecting on a multi-trait index
            of proportional length of the three major leg segments. We complimented the phenotypic
            experiment with population-based whole genome DNA sequencing of individuals from the
            initial populations and the evolved populations artificially selected for fifteen
            generations. An experimental design resulting in low estimates of Ne and concurrently
            strong selection yielded a complicated and idiosyncratic genetic response even within
            replicates of a species. Evolve and Resequence and convergent evolution experimental
            designs and null hypotheses often use an expectation that repeated genetics underlies
            repeated phenotypes. We suggest more skepticism that repeated phenotypes might not
            be the product of parallel genetic responses for complex quantitative traits..</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This study explores the role of social media in addressing educational inequity, focusing
            on prospective first-generation students' college exploration. The study answers two
            questions: (1) how do prospective first-generation students describe their social
            media usage related to college? (2) how do prospective first-generation students describe
            the role of social media in their college choice system? To achieve this goal, I employed
            interviews and social media diaries. Eleven high school seniors whose parents did
            not complete a 4-year college/university participated in the study. Social media diaries
            were adopted to capture participants' daily social media usage related to college.
            Interviews were conducted to delve into their lived experiences in detail. I analyzed
            the collected data using reflexive thematic analysis. For the first research question,
            I examined specific platforms participants utilize: Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Facebook,
            Reddit, Discord, GroupMe, and Twitter. Among them, a subreddit r/A2C (Apply to College),
            the only niche social media site specifically designed for college information, was
            used by only one participant, implying the crucial role of a knowledgeable friend.
            The general pattern of network engagement showed that participants remained within
            their existing networks rather than forming new connections via social media. Participants
            explored diverse topics related to college, encompassing majors, options, applications,
            scholarships, and transitions. For the second research question, the findings revealed
            that participants were exposed to college information daily. Under the overall influence
            of social media, however, three contradictory subthemes were identified: vicarious
            experience vs. not your experience, thought-provoking vs. not leading to actions,
            and inspiring vs. distressing. The contradictory themes indicate the complex roles
            of social media in addressing educational inequity. The findings showed that social
            media plays a beneficial role in prospective first-generation students' college choice
            system, albeit with enduring boundaries and constraints. Such complex realities indicate
            that participants' digital experiences are not transcending the boundaries existing
            in their non-digital world but rather are deeply intertwined with them, underscoring
            the existing structural inequities that marginalized teens are faced with. The study
            suggests implications for research and practice to provide better support for prospective
            first-generation students' postsecondary educational opportunities.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This paper introduces the concept of longstanding anger and seeks to address the thought
            that maintaining anger indefinitely is corruptive to the character of the agent and
            destructive to relationships. It denies that anger is inherently harmful and argues
            that it plays a significant role in the moral landscape as a method of 'valuing the
            valuable' that cannot be replicated through forgiveness. The paper argues that forgiveness
            is not morally superior to anger, and our reasons for condemning anger often have
            to do with discomfort surrounding the presence of discord, rather than anger being
            unfitting. Anger is explored within its role as a social emotion as conditions are
            set out for how and when anger can reasonably be maintained indefinitely, showing
            how it can fittingly not diminish, even upon the death of the wrongdoer. The paper
            suggests that longstanding anger arises from circumstances when an unrepentant wrongdoer
            maintains their commitment to the wrong and can be resolved either by the wrongdoer
            or through recognition of the wrong by the greater social community.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES, 2022) reported that White faculty
            members constituted 74% of the total number of faculty, while racial and ethnically
            minoritized groups, including Black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, and Native
            Americans, collectively comprised less than one-fourth of faculty members. Comparatively,
            a decade ago, NCES, (2013) illustrated similar trends, with only 21% of racially minoritized
            faculty showcasing negligible progress over the past 10 years. This underrepresentation
            extends beyond specific disciplines, suggesting a systemic issue prevalent across
            academia, especially in allied healthcare programs. According to Salsberg et al. (2021)
            study of 10 healthcare professions, there is a notable underrepresentation of Black,
            Hispanic, and Native Americans compared to their respective proportions in the population.
            The allied healthcare programs in this study include Cardiovascular Technologist,
            Emergency Medical Service, Diagnostic Medical Sonography, Radiographer, Occupational
            Therapist Assistant, and Respiratory Care. This abstract qualitative exploratory study
            aimed at to examine racial minority faculty experiences and perceptions of difficulties
            and success within allied healthcare full-time faculty in colleges serving the rural
            areas of Florida. Understanding the challenges faced by racially and ethnically minoritized
            faculty members is critical for addressing the persistent underrepresentation in allied
            healthcare fields (Abdul-Raheem, 2016; Allen &amp; Garg, 2016; Kaplan et al., 2018) by
            identifying the challenges of underrepresentation, and effective interventions to
            enhance racially minoritized healthcare faculty recruitment and retention. Addressing
            this shortage is pivotal for fostering diversity among faculty, improving graduation
            outcomes for diverse allied healthcare students, enhancing cultural competence within
            the healthcare workforce, and ameliorating healthcare disparities in underserved rural
            communities. By shedding light on biases, microaggressions, and skepticism regarding
            qualifications, the findings from this research underscore the pervasive nature of
            bias within academic environments. Consequently, academia faces an urgent imperative
            to confront these disparities and cultivate inclusive climates where all faculty members
            are valued for their scholarly contributions. Initiatives focusing on mentorship,
            professional development, and supportive leadership emerge as pivotal pathways to
            empower minoritized faculty to navigate and surmount prevailing obstacles. Addressing
            systemic barriers and fostering diversity, equity, and inclusion are crucial for enabling
            all faculty members, irrespective of background, to thrive and contribute effectively
            to academia and healthcare (Nair &amp; Adetayo, 2019; Poole &amp; Brownlee, 2020; Ratledge,
            2020) The implication of this study for allied healthcare is the key necessity to
            recruit and retain a minoritized allied healthcare faculty by promoting mentorship
            and a supportive network for professional development. Overcoming system biases are
            critical to dismantling barriers faced by a minoritized faculty member, promoting
            their success, and enriching the cultural variety of healthcare education and profession.
            Moreover, the implications of this study extend beyond academia to inform broader
            societal conversations about systemic racism, discrimination, and social justice.
            The study contributes to ongoing efforts to address disparities in various sectors,
            including student experiences, institutional leadership dynamics, policy frameworks,
            and diversity and inclusion endeavors. Effective interventions necessitate decisive
            leadership action bolstered by robust policy frameworks to improve healthcare disparities
            in resource allocation and promote equitable support structures for all faculty. Mitigating
            stereotypes, biases, and resource disparities while fostering supportive leadership
            and mentorship is crucial for creating an environment where all faculty members feel
            valued, supported, and empowered to succeed (Luster-Edward &amp; Martin, 2018; Llama et
            al., 2019; Kelly et al., 2017; Kelly &amp; McCann, 2014). The study's findings supported
            recommendations needed for further research to advance knowledge about the experiences
            of minoritized faculty within academia and inform evidence-based interventions to
            mitigate disparities and promote a sense of belonging, intentional support, and welcome.
            Acknowledging and addressing the challenges faced by racially and ethnically minoritized
            allied healthcare faculty is crucial for institutions to fulfill their mandate of
            providing equitable opportunities for scholarly engagement and professional advancement.
            Pursuing these research avenues is essential for realizing academia's standard as
            an inclusive and intellectually vibrant community fostering the holistic development
            of all academic members in higher education. The exploratory study revealed support
            recommendations for practice to advocate for racially and ethnically minoritized full-time
            faculty members. The combination of proactive leadership for an engaging support system,
            cultural awareness training, and professional training to identify and navigate bias
            for all employees, and an intentional mentorship program to encourage collaboration
            and a supportive network is essential for minoritized healthcare faculty members to
            succeed.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>In modernist and contemporary art history, abstract art has long been associated with
            issues surrounding autonomy and breaks with figurative art. Scholarship surrounding
            the development of abstract art in Brazil has tended to focus on those connections
            in addition to its receptions by local art critics Ferreira Gullar and Mário Pedrosa
            and trajectories of European movements in abstract art, namely De Stijl, neoplasticism,
            and concrete art. While these readings have recognized important lineages for abstraction
            contextualized within the visual arts, the intersection between abstraction in Brazil
            and architecture remains understudied in comparison. I examine the work of Brazilian
            postwar and contemporary artist Lygia Clark (1920–1988) to show how her work is just
            at home in fields of painting and sculpture as it is in disciplines of architecture
            and design. By forging these connections outside of the visual arts, Brazilian abstract
            art in the postwar period became a political cultural tool of modern architecture
            and space, as well as an outlet for civilians to contribute to Brazil's status as
            a growing modern nation by constructing modernist spaces. Through formal and social
            art historical analysis of the work of Lygia Clark, this dissertation revises histories
            of abstraction in postwar Brazilian art to better account for understudied contexts
            of architecture, public space, and the built environment. Clark is best known for
            her interactive geometric Bicho (Critter; 1960–1966) sculptures and association with
            the neoconcrete group (1959–1961), the Brazilian artistic avant-garde recognized for
            its participatory artwork. Much like the histories of abstract art to which she belonged,
            namely concrete and neoconcrete art, her contributions are often tied to painting
            and sculpture, despite her career-long engagement with architecture. In response to
            this historiographic problem, this dissertation addresses Clark's sustained work in
            and engagement of architecture such as her little-known works, including her ink drawing
            of a street scene from 1948 and a mural mosaic from 1951, still extant in Rio. Examination
            of her training and collaboration with landscape designers and architects reveals
            her synthetic approach to the arts, which facilitates new debates about integrative
            approaches to the arts that tend to focus on De Stijl and the Bauhaus. Chapter Two,
            "Staircases, Interiors, and Studies of Space: The Early Works, 1948–1953," focuses
            on the earliest and often overlooked stage of Clark's career—where her architectural
            engagement began—prior to her affiliation with concretism with the Grupo Frente in
            the mid-1950s. Chapter Three, "Clark's Models of Houses and Architectural Interiors:
            Displays of Modernist Living," provides the first in-depth study of Clark's small-scale
            models of homes from 1955 to 1964, of which she made six. This chapter argues that
            Clark re-envisioned neoconcrete art—a form of abstract art—as manipulatable architectural
            models that engaged with local and global trends of architecture and provided opportunities
            for viewers to construct home layouts. Chapter Four, "'Walking Along:' Path-Making
            as Spatial and Subversive Interventions," analyzes Clark's sculptural action and abstract
            sculptures in politicized contexts of Brazil. Fostering interventionist spatial imaginaries,
            Caminhando (Walking; 1963), and Trepante (Climber; 1965), and Trepante e caixa (Climber
            and Box; 1964), use "the winding path" as a strategy to subvert authority by questioning
            spatial and architectural boundaries of the built environment. Chapter Five, "Clark's
            Articulation of Architectural and Environmental Imaginaries," examines the sculptural
            objects, entitled Caixas de fósforos (Matchboxes, 1964) and Arquitetura fantástica
            bichos (Fantastic Architecture Critters; 1963), the installation, entitled A casa
            é o corpo: penetração, ovulação, germinação, expulsão (The House is the Body: Penetration,
            Ovulation, Germination, Expulsion; 1968), and propositions, entitled Arquitetura Biológica
            II (Biologic Architecture II; 1969) and Estruturas vivas (Live Structures; 1969) as
            case studies. As articulations of anti-authoritarian architectural and environmental
            imaginaries in varying degrees, these sculptural objects, installations, and propositions
            demonstrate how space and structure provided outlets to challenge authority and question
            the possibilities of architecture, while also intensifying environments and feelings
            associated with political repression under Brazil's military dictatorship. Using formal
            and social art historical analysis, supported by extensive archival and field research
            conducted in Brazil, Argentina, England, and the United States, this dissertation
            addresses existing gaps between visual art and architecture in the field of art history,
            particularly in histories of abstract art. Rather than situating Clark's work mainly
            in relation to histories of neoconcrete art and its broader legacies of painting and
            sculpture, I have instead mapped out a new trajectory for her practice based on architecture
            and urbanism as politicized sites of modernism in and out of Brazil in the postwar
            decades. In doing so, this project also formulates a new term in relation to Clark,
            the "artist-architect," a helpful designation for artists who straddle the line between
            the visual arts and the built environment. This term can encourage global intersections
            across potentially disparate areas and periods. Analyzing works of "artist-architects"
            across media can also present experimental grounds for transgressive practices of
            resistance and self-expression.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This dissertation explores theoretical mechanisms associated with the adoption and
            implementation of policy instruments. The first paper addresses the impact of past
            policy choices on the adoption of vaping policy instruments in the United States,
            specifically investigating how states with strong anti-smoking policies are more likely
            to adopt vaping control policy instruments. This suggests that compatibility with
            past policies plays a key role in the adoption of policy tools. On the other hand,
            the second and third papers focus on the effectiveness of policy instruments in the
            context of citizen participation. They examine how citizen participation affects government
            efficiency and responsiveness, and how participation costs influence the level of
            citizen involvement, respectively. These three studies make an important contribution
            to theories of policy instruments, particularly in understanding the adoption and

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Research on Task Based Language Teaching (TBLT), and learning has developed significantly
            in recent years. As a result of the popularity of TBLT, numerous studies in second
            language acquisition (SLA) have explored the effect of task repetition on L2 performance.
            However, while previous task repetition studies mainly focused on the effects of repeating
            the same task on the complexity, accuracy, and fluency (CAF) of oral language production,
            limited research has examined the influence of different types of task repetition
            on learners' written production. Moreover, although written corrective feedback has
            been extensively investigated in SLA, the synergy effect between task repetition and
            written corrective feedback in shaping the quality of individual writing task output
            has not received adequate attention. Notably, no study has yet compared the influence
            of two types of task repetition (identical repetition and procedural repetition),
            by providing two distinct types of feedback—direct feedback and metalinguistic feedback,
            on written production for upper-intermediate adult EFL learners. To address this research
            gap, the current study investigated the effect of task repetition and two types of
            feedback on the accuracy of students' written task performance. Additionally, recognizing
            the growing importance of individual differences (ID) in SLA, this study investigated
            the role of individual differences constructs such as working memory capacity, L2
            writing anxiety, and L2 writing motivation on L2 learners' written production. Additionally,
            the level of motivation and anxiety to complete learning tasks was identified as another
            important factor contributing to individual variation (Kormos &amp; Wilby, 2019). Task
            motivation is a complex construct influenced by various contingencies associated with
            multiple actional contexts, making it more intricate than a simple composite of general
            and state motivation (Dornyei, 2002, 2005). Therefore, beyond general L2 writing motivation
            and L2 anxiety, the study also examined task-specific anxiety and motivation, which
            are transitory, to determine whether their levels change over time during task performance.
            Eighty adult Korean EFL learners participated in four intact classes randomly assigned
            to four treatment groups: identical repetition + direct feedback, identical repetition
            + metalinguistic feedback, procedural repetition + direct feedback, and procedural
            repetition + metalinguistic feedback. A pretest and posttest were employed. The two
            identical repetition groups repeated the same writing procedure with the same picture
            description, while two procedural repetition groups repeated the same writing procedure
            with different picture descriptions. Two types of feedback (direct and metalinguistic)
            were provided for each task repetition condition. To measure learners' writing development,
            overall accuracy and accuracy on three target structures (past tense, articles, and
            prepositions) were assessed. L2 writing motivation and L2 writing anxiety were measured
            before the treatment sessions began to explore learners' general orientation of motivation
            and anxiety toward L2 writing learning. However, task motivation and task anxiety
            were measured after they performed writing tasks each week as outcome measurers to
            observe their patterns. Questionnaires were used for all these four constructs, Lastly,
            a reading span test (RSPAN) was used for the working memory test. Results from ANCOVA
            indicated that the procedural task repetition groups significantly outperformed the
            two identical task repetition groups in overall accuracy and past tense accuracy.
            Regarding the role of individual differences in working memory, motivation, and anxiety,
            multiple regressions revealed distinct results based on treatments under each group.
            For both procedural task repetitions, anxiety was a positive predictor, while working
            memory was a negative predictor. In contrast to the two procedural task repetitions,
            anxiety was a negative predictor for both identical task repetition groups. Lastly,
            two-way repeated measure ANOVA results showed distinct motivational patterns after
            writing between the two task repetition groups. The two procedural task repetition
            groups increased their motivation, whereas the two identical task repetition groups
            decreased task motivation over time. Nevertheless, repeating either content or procedures
            appeared to alleviate learners' task-specific anxiety in writing tasks. The findings
            further our understanding of the language learners' perceived motivational and emotional
            factors influenced by task implementation and instructional strategies in the language
            learning context. These findings provide valuable insights into L2 pedagogy.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This treatise offers a diverse approach to practicing with Digital Audio Workstations
            (DAWs). For many musicians, DAWs are indispensable tools for recording professional
            projects. Many resources within DAWs allow the musician to discern fluctuations through
            a detailed analysis, as discussed in this treatise. The pieces chosen to be practiced
            and examined with the integration of DAWs include three solo pieces for trumpet and
            piano and three orchestral pieces. Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) are software
            applications designed to produce, modify, and capture audio files. They serve different
            purposes, such as professional music productions and personal projects. The applications
            offer a diverse approach to assessing a musician's performance by analyzing their
            audio using a range of effects integrated into the software. When producing a high-quality
            recording using DAWs, one can uncover aspects of trumpet playing that would otherwise
            go unnoticed during a practice session.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This illustrative case study investigates teachers' formative written responses to
            students' writing, and how those responses could be inventive for students' future
            composing practices. It engages with the concept of "invention" from a rhetoric/composition
            standpoint in order to ask: To what extent do different formative written responses
            on student writing function inventively? What are students' perceptions of instructors'
            written responses on their papers? How can these written responses prompt students
            to respond inventively in future writing and revisions? There is a general lack of
            writing assessment or response literature engaging explicitly with invention, even
            though much of it touches on relevant invention-related concepts, like "topoi" or
            "heuristic" (Connors, Lunsford 209; Melzer). This research critically considers that
            literature and makes a case for inventive response, because students' generativity
            in their writing could be compatible with the growth-oriented characteristics of formative
            feedback. The study uses existing scholarship alongside the research questions to
            inductively analyze three document-based, semi-structured interviews with student
            writers at Florida State University. Through answering narrative inquiry-based and
            descriptive questions, the interviewees indicated generativity in response by perceiving
            teachers' feedback as conversational, interpretive, and contextually-influenced. Further,
            the interviews compellingly implied that positive and question-based teacher comments
            led students to invent new writing ideas, new writing strategies, and new writing
            confidence. Based on these findings, the study concludes by pointing to connections
            for future research, and by providing practical suggestions for teachers to implement
            more inventive response.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This dissertation discusses hybrid venture firm performance. The predictors include
            the complementary and competitive institutional logics of social impact accelerators

            founder human capital. In Essay 1, I argue that SIA logics shape hybrid ventures'
            performance in different ways and that these effects are moderated by both firm logics
            and founder human capital. In Essay 2, I argue that the effects of the SIA logics
            not only differ, but also depend on aspects of the institutional environment, specifically
            the level of managerial discretion and social assistance in countries. Together, the
            results suggest that the effects of participating in SIAs are contingent upon the
            institutional-, SIA-, firm-, and entrepreneurial-level characteristics.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Intermolecular interactions of metal-oxide bound molecules can have a substantial
            impact on the electrochemical and photophysical processes of molecules and their subsequent
            performances as catalysts, sensors, or electron injectors in solar energy conversion.
            Inherent to the metal oxide-organic molecule interface is the close proximity of molecules,
            which can facilitate interactions and processes including aggregation, triplet-triplet
            annihilation, excimer formation, singlet fission, dimerization, and more. These processes
            can be either advantageous or disadvantageous for a given application, which makes
            the intentional formation or inhibition of such interactions critical. We have made
            efforts to understand the role of post-loading atomic layer deposition (ALD) on ZrO2-bound
            molecules, in which the precursor for an inert metal oxide (Al2O3) reacts with the
            ZrO2 surface. Both decreased surface loading density of molecules and an increasing
            number of ALD overlayers resulted in a decrease in excimer formation. However, photoluminescent
            and femtosecond transient absorption measurements were still dominated by excimer
            features. These results suggest that ALD may provide a post-surface loading means
            of influencing such intermolecular interactions. Instead of reacting solely with the
            ZrO¬¬2 surface, our current research investigates the effects of ALD directly reacting
            with functionalized, metal-oxide bound molecules.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Gideon Rosen famously defends a novel skeptical conclusion about moral responsibility,
            arguing that we are never warranted in confidently judging that any particular someone
            X is morally blameworthy for some particular action A. Alternative accounts might
            seem preferable to Rosen's, at least on the grounds that they are more consistent
            with our current blaming practices. However, Rosen's opponents tend to avoid his conclusion
            by advocating what Alvarez and Littlejohn call the "asymmetry thesis," essentially
            the thesis that non-normative ignorance is excused in a different way than moral ignorance.
            In doing so, they reject a crucial premise in Rosen's argument. I argue that one needn't
            give up what I will call Rosen's "symmetry thesis" in order to avoid his ultimate
            conclusion. I first motivate a reason for wanting to preserve symmetry by detailing
            an objection to symmetry-denying quality-of-will views. I then attack the final premise
            in Rosen's skeptical argument, essentially relying on plausible assumptions about
            standards of justification and the general commonplace of akratic action.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The adoption of quantum computing presents a considerable risk to the security of
            traditionalcryptographic methods, including those used in current blockchain technologies.
            Quantum algo- rithms, especially Shor's and Grover's, can efficiently solve problems
            that classical cryptographic algorithms rely on for security, rendering them vulnerable
            to attacks. This thesis explores the creation of quantum-resistant blockchain platforms
            to address this critical issue. The research begins with a comprehensive study of
            the prevailing blockchain infrastructure and the potential vulnerabilities posed by
            quantum computing, with a particular focus on con- sensus algorithms and cryptographic
            primitives. Various post-quantum cryptographic approaches, including lattice-based
            cryptography and quantum-safe digital signatures, are investigated for their suitability
            in securing blockchain systems against quantum threats. The thesis presents an original
            contribution in the form of a novel quantum-safe blockchain protocol that utilizes
            advanced cryptographic techniques to provide robust security in the quantum era. The
            proposed protocol is rigorously analyzed and evaluated for its effectiveness in various
            applications, including cryptocurrency, healthcare, tokenization and real world assets.
            The findings of this research underscore the urgent need for transitioning to quantum-resistant
            blockchain systems. The thesis offers a practical framework and guidelines for designing
            and im- plementing secure quantum-resistant blockchain architectures, taking into
            account the challenges and considerations involved in such a transition. By addressing
            the imminent threat of quantum computing to blockchain security, this research aims
            to forge resilient and forward-looking blockchain systems. The outcomes of this thesis
            have sig- nificant implications for ensuring the continued viability, security, and
            trustworthiness of blockchain technology against the advancements in quantum computing.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Community colleges are institutions that provide access to higher education to anyone
            with a high school diploma or GED (Kim &amp; Dolan, 2015). The student body is highly
            diverse and may not be prepared for academic coursework (Cohen et al., 2014). These
            challenges may be supplemented through embedding services directly into college courses.
            The focus of this study is specifically on embedding librarians in undergraduate courses
            that have a research component. For students that have been out of school for a while,
            or just struggled with research while in high school, an embedded librarian might
            be a resource that aids in student success. In order to understand what motivates
            a faculty member to embed, or not embed, a librarian in their courses, I conducted
            an exploratory qualitative case study at a single institution in the southeastern
            United States. Interviews were conducted with nine full-time faculty members from
            this institution. They reflected a variety of campuses, departments, and faculty static
            levels. I then utilized In Vivo coding for first cycle coding and focused coding for
            second cycle coding. As a result of the study, I found some common understanding of
            roles and tasks that embedded librarians can have in college courses; however, I also
            discovered some underlying emotional reactions to embedding that ranged from excitement
            to worry. It seems that there is some room for development when explaining what embedded
            librarians should do, and what embedded librarians should not do. Much of this knowledge
            comes about through relationships development, and ongoing communication, between
            the embedded librarian and the faculty member.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The U.S. regularly incarcerates its residents, where time spent behind bars is overwhelmingly
            negative (Massoglia, 2008a; Rose &amp; Clear, 1998). But not all persons have an equal
            chance of incarceration. State and federal policies target ethnically heterogenous
            neighborhoods in ways that lead to residents' disparate surveillance, arrest, and
            incarceration, even while research demonstrates that such policies are damaging (Menjívar
            &amp; Abrego, 2012; Peterson &amp; Krivo, 2010). Contrary to traditional criminological theory,
            evidence suggests that cultural diversity may work to keep individuals and their communities
            safer (Wright &amp; Rodriguez, 2014). Indeed, an immigrant paradox has been found, where
            immigrants are less likely to commit violence, use substances, or offend, though they
            are more often exposed to criminogenic environments (Salas-Wright et al., 2016).Criminological
            literature takes this protective effect of diversity for granted, neglecting to unpack
            the immigrant paradox. It is unknown whether the immigrant paradox extends to prison—where
            foreign-born persons are less likely to exhibit mental health crises or engage in
            misconduct—or if incarceration will undo their resilience. Yet effective correctional
            policy must be sensitive to the diversity of those incarcerated. Guided by theory
            and research on the immigrant paradox, prison misconduct, and mental health behind
            bars, the goal of this study is to examine whether incarcerated native- and foreign-born
            persons vary in the number and kinds of misconducts they engage in and/or mental health
            crises they experience. Further, this dissertation examines whether relationships
            vary by sources of heterogeneity within the immigrant group, including sending country,
            race, and detainer status. To solve these research puzzles, this study asks three
            primary research questions. First, do incarcerated immigrants differ from non-immigrants
            in their involvement in prison misconduct? Second, do incarcerated immigrants differ
            from non-immigrants in their likelihood of experiencing an in-prison mental health
            crisis? Third, and finally, do incarcerated immigrants who are subject to deportation
            differ from those who are not in their involvement in prison misconduct or experience
            of a mental health crisis? Data from administrative records on the full population
            of incarcerated adults housed in a state prison in the western U.S. between 2010 and
            2020 (N=58,289) are used. Over 13% (N=7,697) of individuals come from over 120 different
            countries, not including the U.S. or its territories. Data trace all administrative
            details of individuals' in-prison experiences from intake to release. This rich information,
            coupled with the growing diversity of this western state, render this system ideal
            for advancing theory and research on the bounds of the immigrant paradox. Analyses
            find support for an in-prison immigrant paradox, but they further reveal that the
            effect of immigrant status varies by race. That is, incarcerated immigrants are expected
            to engage in fewer counts and types of misconduct than their non-immigrant counterparts
            and are less likely to experience in-prison mental health crises. But patterns differ
            for property misconduct and are not uniform across racially diverse individuals. Instead,
            the immigrant paradox is pronounced among Latinx persons, where these individuals
            are less likely to engage in most types of prison infractions and have lower odds
            of mental health crises compared to those of other races. Alternatively, White immigrants
            more often experience mental health crises behind bars relative to immigrants of color.
            These differences signify that the protective factors that drive the immigrant paradox
            may not be readily available to all foreign-born persons, that diverse persons present
            with diverse in-prison needs, and that prior experience with hardship may be one reason
            that immigrants are resilient to adversity. Finally, incarcerated immigrants who face
            deportation only slightly differ from those who do not in their involvement in misconduct
            or their experience of mental health crises. While immigrants with detainers were
            less likely to engage in drug misconduct or experience in-prison mental health crises
            than those without, findings did not significantly differ by detainer status for overall
            misconduct or any other infraction type. As such, incarcerated immigrants may already
            anticipate deportation, and certain characteristics about immigrants who receive detainers
            may matter more than the threat of deportation itself. Yet further investigation of
            the effect of deportation is needed. Broadly, the substantive effect of the immigrant
            paradox is diminished in a prison setting and is conditioned by heterogeneous statuses
            of immigrants, but it is not erased. Treating immigrants harshly for fear that they
            pose a dangerous criminal threat is unfounded and is only successful in perpetuating
            legal violence against them. While additional work is needed to further unpack the
            immigrant paradox in incarcerated settings, we must be mindful of clumsy, overly punitive
            social policies that harm foreign-born populations.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The field of plasmonics as a whole is gathering widespread interest due to their wide
            range of applications and new technology advancements because of their enhancement
            of light-matter interactions. Although scientists have largely used noble metals plasmonic
            metals such as gold, silver, or aluminum, the growing field of plasmonic semiconductor
            nanocrystals (PSNCs) still require extensive research towards how the semiconducting
            electronic structure impacts relevant properties such as charge carrier mobility,
            conductivity, and near field enhancement. This work focuses on how the host nanocrystal
            density of states directly impacts and modifies the plasmonic properties of interest
            in both the static and ultrafast transient time regimes. Chapter 1 introduces the
            concept of plasmons starting from the simple harmonic oscillator model leading to
            the free electron model's critical relationship for plasmon frequency, carrier density,
            and carrier effective mass. From there, the concept of band theory is introduced,
            and the interactions of charge carrier quasiparticles with the semiconducting electronic
            structure are outlined and discussed. Chapter 2 introduces the intermediate band semiconductor,
            Cu5FeS4, where magnetic circular dichroism is used to analyze the carrier effective
            mass as a function of applied magnetic field. Chapter 3 introduces one of the highest
            energy PSNCs in literature to date, WO3-x, where transient absorption relaxation dynamics
            are deconvoluted for plasmon and optical band gap excited regimes. Chapter 4 turns
            to CuxFeS4 (x=3,5,7), where the ratio of Cu:Fe is shown to modulate the hole-phonon
            and phonon-phonon transient absorption relaxation rates correlated with carrier effective
            mass and plasmon damping frequency respectively. Overall, this thesis showcases that
            static plasmon properties correlate well with transient plasmonic properties, where
            experiments such as magnetic circular dichroism and transient absorption are effective
            tools for developing the correlations needed for predicting desired plasmonic properties
            when designing novel PSNCs for future applications.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Teachers of Color bring valuable assets into the classroom and play a vital role in
            empowering marginalized students (Brown, 2014; Dee, 2004), however these teachers
            remain severely underrepresented, especially in STEM fields (Irwin, 2022, 2023; NCES,
            2020). Meanwhile, preservice teachers (PSTs) of Color often confront marginalization
            including lack of representation, isolation, and pressures to assimilate in teacher
            education programs situated in historically white institutions (HWIs) (Gist, 2017;
            Haddix, 2010; Hayes &amp; Fasching-Varner, 2015). More specifically, Latina STEM PSTs
            encounter gender stereotypes, unwelcoming climates, and assumptions questioning their
            abilities (McGee, 2020; Ong et al., 2018). Understanding the barriers that these Latinas
            face, alongside their sources of resilience and resistance, can inform policies and
            curriculum to better support minoritized teacher candidates (Kohli, 2021). As such,
            the central question guiding this study asks: What are the experiences of three Latina
            STEM preservice teachers at a historically white institution (HWI)?Using frameworks
            of Latinidad, LatCrit theory (Solórzano &amp; Yosso, 2001), and transformational resistance
            (Solórzano &amp; Bernal, 2001), this study examines Latinas' intersectional barriers and
            resilience in white-dominated contexts of STEM and teacher education. Through two
            semi-structured interviews with each PST, aimed at eliciting their narratives on motivations
            and experiences in their program, I analyze using qualitative methods how these PSTs
            navigated systemic inequities and explore their resistance to systemic oppression
            (Hannegan-Martinez et al., 2022; Solórzano &amp; Yosso, 2001). Findings revealed four
            key patterns in Latina PSTs' journeys: (1) gendered and racialized microaggressions
            which affected their emotional and psychological wellbeing; (2) stark underrepresentation
            in STEM courses heightening isolation and self-doubt; (3) inspiration and motivation
            from personal experiences to pursue teaching of marginalized students, and (4) advocacy
            for engagement with sociopolitical issues affecting communities of Color within teacher
            preparation programs. Despite barriers imposed by dominant structures, the Latina
            PSTs displayed transformational resistance as they leveraged wisdom from lived experiences
            to inform their aspiration to teach (Yosso, 2005). Findings center the participants'
            knowledge and lived experiences to inform teacher preparation practices in ways that
            could better support other Latina PSTs in STEM. This study makes an important contribution
            by applying LatCrit frameworks to elucidate Latinas' diverse lived experiences at
            the intersection of race, gender, and class (Chavez-Moreno, 2023) and by positioning
            Latin* identities as assets for STEM teaching (Fierros &amp; Delgado Bernal, 2016). Additionally,
            the study highlights the ongoing resilience and resistance of Latina STEM educators
            against layered oppression (Hannegan-Martinez et al., 2022). More broadly, the study
            underscores the urgent need for greater inclusiveness, representation, and cultural
            responsiveness in teacher education. This includes fostering spaces for minoritized
            PSTs to share their counterstories, openly discuss oppression, and nurture critical
            consciousness towards social justice (Kohli, 2021; McGee, 2021; Solórzano &amp; Yosso,
            2002).</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Older adults are vulnerable to glucocorticoid-induced muscle atrophy and weakness,
            with sex potentially influencing susceptibility to those effects. Aerobic exercise
            can reduce glucocorticoid-induced muscle atrophy in young rodents. However, it is
            unknown whether aerobic exercise can antagonize glucocorticoid myopathic features
            in aged muscle. The objectives of this study were to define the extent to which sex
            influences the development of glucocorticoid myopathy in aged muscle, and to determine
            the extent to which moderate intensity aerobic exercise training protects against
            development of myopathy. 24-month-old female (n=30) and male (n=33) mice were randomized
            to either sedentary or aerobic exercise groups. Within their respective groups, mice
            were randomized to either daily treatment with injections of dexamethasone (DEX) or
            saline. Following treatments, the contractile properties of the triceps surae complex
            were assessed in situ. DEX marginally lowered muscle mass and soluble protein content
            in both sexes, which was attenuated by aerobic exercise only in females. DEX-treated
            females expressed greater sub-tetanic contractile properties in a sex-specific manner,
            which were not influenced by aerobic exercise. DEX increased muscle fatigue in both
            sexes, but aerobic exercise prevented the fatigue induction only in females. The sex-specific
            differences to muscle function in response to DEX treatment coincided with sex-specific
            changes to the contents of protein related to calcium handling, mitochondrial quality
            control, and glucocorticoid receptor in muscle. These findings define several important
            sexually dimorphic changes to aged skeletal muscle physiology in response to glucocorticoid
            treatment and define the capacity of short-term aerobic exercise to protect against
            those changes.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The genetic mechanisms that regulate transformation of genetic material from genotype
            tophenotype influence evolutionary response to environmental change and promote species
            diversity. Identifying molecular regulatory mechanisms that affect gene expression
            is challenging for researchers because they are complex, highly variable, and affect
            nearly every phase of gene expression. Venom provides an ideal system for studying
            adaptive evolution as it is a complex phenotype used for prey capture and defense
            that is subject to strong selective pressures. Snake venom in particular appears to
            have arisen through rapid evolution, resulting in a conserved set of toxin gene families
            that are expressed at highly diverse rates across a wide range of taxa. The venom
            secretion is the result of a fairly straightforward genotype-to-phenotype map, which
            allows researchers to study expression at various points along the central dogma.
            To further investigate the evolution of venom gene expression, in Chapter 1 we characterized
            the venom profile of the Cottonmouth Snake (Agkistrodon piscivorus). We found that
            across their geographic range, A. piscivorus venom expression consists primarily of
            proteins in the Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) gene family. In total, we identified nine
            complete PLA2s tandemly arrayed in the A. piscivorus genome of a female snake collected
            from the Apalachicola National Forest (ANF) in north Florida, which is more than in
            any previously characterized North American pit viper. The array contains four expressed
            PLA2s, one copy of the basic PLA2-K and three copies of the acidic PLA2-A that appear
            to be the result of gene duplication. This PLA2 region is consistent with the PLA2
            arrays of previously annotated hemorrhagic-type rattlesnakes, which lack the characteristic
            heterodimeric PLA2s in neurotoxic rattlesnake venoms. We found that expression of
            the four toxin PLA2s varied among individual A. piscivorus, but in all cases PLA2-K
            was expressed most highly in the venom gland. In Chapter 2, we aimed to determine
            whether expression variation of the four toxin PLA2s were differentially expressed
            among the sampled individuals. We collected snakes from the three recognized subspecies
            of A. piscivorus : The Florida Cottonmouth (A. p. conanti), the Western Cottonmouth
            (A. p. leucostoma), and the Eastern Cottonmouth (A. p. piscivorus) and performed RNA-sequencing
            to quantify venom gland expression. We found that only one copy of the acidic PLA2-A1c
            was differentially expressed between Florida (A. p. conanti) and Continental (A. p.
            leucostoma and A. p. piscivorus) individuals. This differential expression seemed
            largely driven by relatively high expression of PLA2-A1c in half of the sampled Florida
            individuals. Despite the high conservation of the PLA2s gene array across sampled
            individuals, we did find that this expression variation may be driven by sequence
            variation found only in the three more high-expression Florida individuals. We identified
            one synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the coding region of Exon 2
            of PLA2-A1c that was only present in these individuals. We believe that this SNP could
            be in linkage with regulatory elements that control PLA2 expression, and thus may
            explain the increased relative expression. In addition to differential expression
            among individuals, we all found that PLA2 paralogs are expressed at varying amount
            within a given individual. In Chapter 3, we aimed to characterize the genomic architecture
            that may regulate expression of the PLA2 gene family in A. piscivorus. To achieve
            this, we used ATAC-sequencing of two individuals collected from North Florida (ANF)
            to characterize accessible chromatin and H3K27ac CUT&amp;RUN sequencing of one individual
            collected from North Florida (ANF) to identify regions containing active enhancers.
            We found several regions of interest that may regulate PLA2 expression in A. piscivorus,
            including open chromatin regions just upstream of each of the four expressed PLA2s
            that likely contain promoters and large regions of open chromatin downstream of the
            four expressed PLA2s. We also found three distinct CUT&amp;RUN sequencing peaks associated
            with active enhancers located between each PLA2-A and their associated unexpressed
            PLA2-C. These regions are homologous to the third exon of the non-venom expressed
            PLA2-E, which also shares the associated peak. We used Sequence Capture sequencing
            reads from 147 individual A. piscivorus to determine whether sequence variation in
            the identified enhancer and promoter peaks could contribute to PLA2 paralog expression.
            However, we found that these regions were highly conserved among sampled individuals.
            Therefore, future works should further investigate the identified peak regions to
            determine what regulatory elements may be present and contribute to PLA2-expression.</p>

            revealed that emerging adults (individuals between 18 and 29 years of age) are more
            vulnerable to social media addiction than other populations. Theories and research
            have suggested overparenting as a potential predictor for emerging adults' problematic
            technology use. Specifically, the theory of emerging adulthood and self-determination
            theory offer explanations for the detrimental effects of overparenting behavior in
            the lives of emerging adults, as they seek autonomy and independence at this stage.
            Further, studies have linked overparenting to emerging adults' internet addiction,
            as well as game and social media addictive behaviors. Nevertheless, the underlying
            mechanisms through which overparenting impacts social media addiction remain understudied
            in the literature. Therefore, the present study examined the association between overparenting
            and social media addiction among a sample of emerging adults. Parental autonomy control
            and low self-efficacy were also assessed as potential mediators for this association.
            College students (N = 545) completed surveys at three time points over 12 weeks. Structural
            equation modeling suggested that overparenting was positively related to social media
            addiction via higher levels of parental autonomy control and lower levels of self-efficacy.
            Future directions and implications of the present study were provided.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>As one of the most widely printed and read texts in the world, Dante Alighieri's Commedia
            has firmly established its place in the global literary canon. Written between 1308
            and 1320, the Commedia quickly became a widely disseminated and studied text. The
            first lectura dantis, or public readings and accompanying lectures about the poem
            by the great Giovanni Boccaccio, were held mere years after Dante's death, and study
            of the poem has continued for the past 700 years. Its enduring cultural and linguistic
            value for the Italian people have solidified Dante as a godlike figure in Italian
            history. The study of diegetic sound and music in the poem, however, has largely been
            overlooked or ignored, with a few exceptions. This thesis contributes to scholarship
            on the music and sound in Dante's Commedia, responds to existing Dante scholars such
            as Francesco Ciabattoni and sound studies scholars such as R. Murray Schafer and Aimée
            Boutin, and offers a collection of my thoughts and interpretations on the subject.
            I argue that Dante crafted an intentional sonic design into the fabric of the poem,
            and that through analysis of the design we are able to learn more about both the poem
            and poet. Using the text as an archive of sonic memory that tells the reader significant
            and culturally relevant information about the city of Florence and its surrounding
            area in the Middle Ages, I seek to develop a new methodology through which word and
            music scholars may "listen in" to the past through literature. I also engage with
            protopsychomusicology and the affective power of music through the ears of Dante.
            Scenes such as the interaction with the musician Casella in Purgatorio 2 suggest the
            use of music in an intentionally comforting or healing manner. Although sparse and
            uncertain, in biographical accounts scholars speculate that Dante may have had epilepsy
            (or a similar condition), and through the poem I argue that he used music in a therapeutic
            manner to treat his own condition, similarly to modern medical music therapy. Finally,
            I look at the sonic remnants of the past in the poem and consider how Dante used audible
            memory to recall and relate to past literary voices and sought to establish a cultural
            epic through sonic memory. Dante adopted and adapted elements of epic throughout his
            work in order to secure his place in literary history, and through this I argue for
            the relevance of sound in this channel of study. Through this thesis I open avenues
            for future exploration of the sonic design of the Commedia and establish new ideas
            with which future Dante and sound studies scholars may approach this and other similar
            texts.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This qualitative case study explored the experiences of first-generation students
            with varying levels of support at Bentley University, a private, business-focused
            university in the Northeast. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews
            with 11 first-generation students that represented different ethnic/racial backgrounds,
            gender identities, class standing, and majors. The study found that while first-generation
            students of color had established supportive communities on campus, they often struggled
            with feelings of inadequacy in foundational business courses. Participants also had
            challenges accessing high impact practices, such as internships and studying abroad.
            Bentley prides itself on providing broad opportunities for students, including international
            education and career development, so these first-generation student experiences do
            not align with the university's efforts to support all students.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This dissertation contributes to the intersection of public administration, public
            policy, and public management by exploring avenues to enhance local government capacities
            for interlocal collaborations and citizen-government interactions. The first study
            investigates the joint influence of yardstick competition and managerial stability
            on bolstering interlocal collaborations for public service delivery, utilizing panel
            data from municipal governments in Florida for empirical testing. Regarding citizen-government
            interactions, the second paper focuses on public assessments of local government sustainability
            strategies and performance. Survey experiment results reveal that citizens exhibit
            distinct preferences regarding sustainability strategies contingent upon sustainability
            performance conditions, with these preferences further diverging across different
            subgroups. Furthermore, the third paper examines how administrative burden reductions
            by local governments can improve the permitting efficiency of energy infrastructure
            projects for applicants. The findings suggest that reducing eligibility cost can expedite
            permitting time for applicants in the short term, especially within low-income and
            high-minority communities, while reducing collaboration cost can accelerate the application
            process in the long run, particularly across non low-income and low-minority communities.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This study illuminates the nuanced experiences of Asian international women students
            in Computer and Mathematical Sciences, and Engineering doctoral programs in the United
            States, a domain historically shaped by male dominance, White supremacy, and Western
            ideologies. While existing literature on gender and racial-ethnic disparities in Science,
            Technology, Engineering, and Math has utilized an intersectionality framework, this
            investigation reveals the particular ways in which AIS women's identities are constructed
            and negotiated within these spaces. Employing narrative inquiries and a counter-storytelling
            approach, the research uncovers the intersectionality of race, foreign status, and
            gender identity among these scholars, demonstrating how these dimensions interact
            uniquely for AIS women. Key findings reveal a pronounced de-emphasis of racial identity
            in favor of a strong STEM identity, a strategic response to systemic marginalization
            and racial challenges. This prioritization reflects a culturally embedded respect
            for meritocracy and academic achievement, reshaped in the U.S. context by their experiences
            of racialization and othering.The study also highlights the salient gender identity
            of AIS women, exacerbated by the masculine culture of CME fields. Despite the external
            assumption of privilege due to their Asian and international status, these women confront
            significant gender stereotypes and discrimination. Their strong STEM identity, fostered
            through resilience and the pursuit of academic and professional excellence, emerges
            as a counter to traditional gender norms and a mechanism for navigating the complex
            landscape of gender and racial inequality in STEM. The research proposes a new conceptual
            framework integrating the intersectionality of AIS women's identities with the Looking-Glass
            Self theory, offering a comprehensive understanding of their experiences across different
            cultural and social contexts. This framework challenges the prevailing deficit thinking
            about AIS women in CME, emphasizing the complexity and resilience of their identity
            construction in the face of multifaceted inequalities. Implications of this study
            are vast, suggesting changes in research, policy, and practice to better support AIS
            women in STEM. By recognizing the intertwined nature of their gender, foreign, and
            racial identities, this research calls for a more nuanced approach in academic support,
            mentorship, and policy formulation to foster an inclusive environment that acknowledges
            and addresses the unique challenges faced by AIS women in CME fields.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This dissertation explores the integration of quantum electrodynamics (QED) with electronic
            structure theory to accurately model and understand complex light-matter interactions
            within optical cavities. Clever designs of optical cavities have enabled experimentalists
            to achieve strong light-matter coupling, where the interaction between light and matter
            is so strong that new hybrid light-matter states emerge, known as polaritons. These
            polariton states can significantly alter molecular properties and chemical reactivity,
            leading to potential applications in quantum information processing, quantum materials,
            and light-driven chemical reactions. The dissertation focuses on the development of
            advanced quantum chemistry methods to capture cavity-induced effects and to provide
            a comprehensive understanding of the underlying physics. Several key technical advancements
            in QED are presented, including the development of QED generalizations of coupled-cluster
            (CC) and equation-of-motion (EOM) CC theories, as well as a framework to automate
            the derivation of optimized many-body equations for QED. These correlated many-body
            methods are compared to QED generalizations of mean-field methods like density functional
            theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) for qualitative assessments of cavity-modified
            molecular properties. In addition, analytic gradients are derived for QED-DFT to elucidate
            the orientation dependence of cavity-influenced reactions and to caution against the
            use of unmodified geometries obtained from standard electronic structure calculations
            in the absence of a cavity. Through the developments of these methods, the dissertation
            aims to provide novel theoretical insights into cavity-controlled chemistry. Specific
            topics addressed include the characterization of photon character within electron-attached
            excited states, the relevance of orbital relaxation within mean-field theories, and
            the orientation dependence of cavity-influenced reactions. By bridging quantum chemistry
            and QED, this research paves the way for new fundamental discoveries of light and
            matter coupling and provides a foundation for understanding and controlling cavity-modified
            chemistry in experimental settings. The dissertation reflects the substantial progress
            in modeling complex QED systems, despite challenges regarding their computational
            efficiency and accuracy.</p>

            of the historical data in a likelihood combined with current data. We develop a new
            type of conditional power prior called the historical-bias power prior using an empirical
            Bayes approach. It relaxes the assumption of the traditional power priors to allow
            for historical bias. Moreover, our new weight function controls the amount of borrowing
            and only borrows when historical data satisfy the borrowing criteria. This is achieved
            by embedding the Frequentist test-then-pool approach in the weight function. Hence,
            the historical-bias power prior builds a bridge between the Frequentist test-then-pool
            and the Bayesian power prior. In the simulation, we examine the impact of historical
            bias on the operating characteristics for borrowing approaches, which has not been
            explored in previous literature. The results show that the historical-bias power prior
            yields accurate estimation and robustly powerful tests for the experimental treatment
            effect with good type I error control especially when the historical bias exists.
            Furthermore, we extend the historical-bias power prior to account for differences
            in subjects' baseline covariates between the historical and current studies by implementing
            the inverse-probability-weighting adjustment. In the simulation, the adjusted outcomes
            are examined under two different scenarios based on the imbalanced subjects' baseline.
            The results show that the operating characteristics may be influenced by the adjustment
            and is associated with the degree of imbalance between subjects. However, the adjustment
            is effective because it mitigates the impact of the confounders between studies after
            borrowing, leading to more reliable inference.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This treatise will briefly explore the reasons a composer would accredit their own
            works to a different name other than theirs; whether the name is of another living
            or deceased composer, or a name that is fabricated altogether. This will serve as
            a prerequisite to the central topic on hand, an examination of a set of guitar studies
            composed by the German classical guitar pedagogue, performer, as well as composer,
            Tilman Hoppstock (1961-). In 1992, Hoppstock recorded a piece by an allegedly obscure
            composer, Franz Werthmüller (1769-1841), and for the next 15 years managed to keep
            the secret that Werthmüller was merely Hoppstock's first use of a pseudonym, to present
            a piece written in the style of an older musical era. In 2010, Hoppstock published
            a set of 12 studies, for the guitar, under another obscure composer, Allan Willcocks
            (1869-1956). Undoubtedly, Willcocks was in fact another pseudonym used by Hoppstock,
            and though this British composer came with an in-depth two-page biography, facsimiles
            of hand-written manuscripts, and even old photographs documenting various stages of
            Willcocks' life, it took only two years for the true identity behind these studies
            to come out. This treatise will explore the alleged life of Allan Willcocks, Hoppstock's
            own reasons for inventing this character, why the Willcocks' 12 Studies for Guitar
            has proven to be a valuable addition to classical guitar literature, as well as the
            style in which they were written in. Provided are musical examples, biographical information,
            original manuscripts, photographs and even concert programs that Hoppstock put together
            to introduce the world of music to Allan Willcocks.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The exploration of combinatorial mixtures in liquid/liquid extraction and phase-transfer
            catalysis represents a groundbreaking shift in the understanding and application of
            complex organic systems in chemistry and biology. By investigating the enhanced liquid/liquid
            extraction capabilities through the introduction of organic solutes, we have demonstrated
            the superiority of combinatorial mixtures over individual components. At the same
            time, the study on lipid-based phase transfer catalysis challenges traditional views
            by revealing the potential of lipids in catalyzing reactions, as evidenced by the
            successful ester hydrolysis of calcein-AM to fluorescent calcein in phospholipid vesicles.
            These findings not only illuminate the untapped potential of lipid and organic solute
            mixtures in catalysis and extraction processes but also suggest broader applications
            in developing new combinatorial biosensors, materials with unique properties, and
            innovative catalytic systems. This integrated approach highlights the importance of
            combinatorial chemistry in advancing our understanding of molecular interactions and
            the potential for novel applications in synthetic and biological chemistry.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Early American women's history and the history of visual culture tend to avoid overlapping
            in terms of both sources and questions. A gendered lens when applied to the origins
            of America typically seeks to answer the question of how the Revolution affected women,
            whereas the history of American visual culture demonstrates changes over time, or
            the meanings behind symbolism without a fully comprehensive look at gender. This thesis
            seeks to connect the two fields while raising further questions about white women's
            political involvement during the American Revolution through an examination of America
            as represented by a woman in British-American visual sources from approximately 1760
            to 1800. Through both a chronological and thematic approach, this thesis highlights
            how the changing status of women throughout the Revolution and their experiences are
            reflected in paintings, cartoons, and state seals, complicating arguments that these
            female embodiments of America are merely a product of national identity formation.
            The shift from an Indigenous woman to a Roman goddess can be charted parallel to the
            rise of Republican Motherhood ideology and anxieties about female autonomy. This thesis
            will also explore the complex powerful nature of femininity in relation to societal
            norms and additional iconography, including transgressions of sex and sexuality, liberty,
            and the mother/daughter dynamic.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>When a character enters the stage in a musical, the audience begins to make assumptions
            about that character based on what they see—their presented gender, race, etc. Once
            the character begins to act, speak, and sing, the audience learns who that character
            truly is. What interests me is how aspects of a character's identity become manifest
            on the stage. This dissertation centers on the portrayal of male queerness in two
            musicals by Jeanine Tesori, Shrek the Musical (2008) and Fun Home (2015). In exploring
            how the queerness of three characters from these two shows are represented in both
            material and performance, I construct a narrative that traces Tesori's works through
            a spectrum of representations from those that rely on stereotypes to attempt to portray
            queerness in a more individualized fashion. I begin by examining the character of
            Lord Farquaad from Shrek the Musical in Chapter Two. I demonstrate how Farquaad relies
            entirely on visual and sonic stereotypes to present the character as queer, and I
            employ Conceptual Integration Networks to highlight how it is the interactions between
            queer elements, such as his costuming, choreography, vocal performance, and lyrics,
            that code the character as gay. I then turn to Donkey from Shrek the Musical in Chapter
            Three, noting the extra complexity that arises with his character's depiction of both
            queerness and Blackness. I complicate the ways that Donkey's character uses stereotypes,
            questioning the methods employed by the creative team to juggle his marked identities
            effectively. Finally, I examine the character of Bruce Bechdel from Fun Home in Chapter
            Four, whose representation is far from stereotypical, instead relying on queer markers
            established within the musical itself. In examining the differences between how similar
            identities are portrayed in Chapter Five, I reveal a progressive shift in how queerness
            is represented on stage, moving from a stereotypical depiction used to garner laughs
            from the audience to a more true-to-life representation that attempts to capture the
            realities of being queer.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Staff members in institutions of higher education who are not faculty, such as those
            who work in student affairs, information technology, student business services, and
            other areas, may feel invisible and unappreciated. This sense of obscurity for racially
            marginalized staff can be intensified by discrimination and oppression that persist
            within these institutions, despite the implementation of diversity, equity, and inclusion
            (DEI) initiatives. Unfortunately, higher education literature that examines perceptions
            and experiences related to racism, oppression, and DEI initiatives tends to focus
            on students or faculty, neglecting the experiences of professional staff. This qualitative
            case study delved into the perspectives of racially marginalized professional staff
            concerning a predominantly White institution's (PWI) endeavors to establish a diverse,
            equitable, and inclusive environment, employing a critical race theory (CRT) framework.
            Utilizing a two-phase interview approach, encompassing walking and sitting interviews,
            nine participants shared their insights and experiences related to Diversity, Equity,
            and Inclusion (DEI) efforts on campus. The data analysis involved an inductive, iterative
            coding process of the interview data. Concerning participants' workplace encounters
            on campus, the findings underscored instances of racial and ethnic bias, discrimination,
            threats of violence, discrimination based on intersectional identities, being discredited
            in the workplace, and perceptions of being less valued by administrators compared
            to faculty, sometimes even facing devaluation by faculty themselves. Regarding participants'
            perceptions of the institution's DEI effectiveness, a majority expressed unawareness
            of any DEI initiatives and perceived those they were aware of as lacking permanence.
            Participants highlighted the challenge of insufficient racial diversity among employees,
            citing political interference with the institution's DEI efforts. Despite acknowledging
            these challenges, participants strongly felt that the institution should address DEI
            concerns. Additionally, the study revealed that DEI programming encountered issues
            when not appropriately administered, and participants displayed mixed reactions to
            how their White colleagues received DEI programs and initiatives. This study carries
            significant implications, affirming that racially marginalized staff encounter notable
            challenges within Predominantly White Institutions (PWIs), including instances of
            discrimination, bias, ridicule, violence, and devaluation. Moreover, the findings
            suggest that institution-sponsored Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs
            were perceived as more performative than substantive, while grassroots-led initiatives
            initiated by staff members addressing diversity, equity, or inclusion demonstrated
            a greater potential for sustainability. Lastly, a poignant observation from one participant
            underscores the implication that staff being viewed as "second-class citizens" in
            comparison to faculty significantly contributes to their sense of devaluation within
            the institution. Drawing from the study's findings, four key recommendations emerged.
            First, institutions of higher education should take a stand against racial discrimination,
            microaggressions, and violence. Second, higher education institutions should take
            a bow, stop performing, and be intentional with their efforts to positively foster
            diversity, equity, and inclusion on campus. Third, institutions should take a seat
            and increase diverse representation among employees. Fourth, institutions should take
            a leap and prioritize the equal recognition and valuation of staff, mirroring the
            acknowledgment and opportunities afforded to faculty. In terms of future research,
            there is a necessity for in-depth analyses of the experiences of all higher education
            staff, quantitative examinations of staff and faculty salaries from an equity perspective,
            comparative investigations into staff policies and practices in states with restrictive
            DEI legislation versus those without, and further research on the effectiveness of
            grassroots DEI initiatives.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Black male students enrolled in predominantly White institutions (PWIs) face a myriad
            of challenges that hinder their academic success and overall well-being. These students
            often grapple with feelings of disconnection, stress, and isolation. According to
            studies, Black male students in PWIs are more likely to experience lower retention
            rates, higher dropout rates, and lower academic performance compared to their peers
            (Harper et al., 2018). This research explores the critical need to foster a sense
            of belonging for Black male students at PWIs, acknowledging the multifaceted nature
            of their experiences and the systemic barriers they encounter. Drawing on the works
            of Brooms (2020) and McCoy (2014), this study examines administrators' perspectives
            on Black male mentorship programs and their impact on Black male students' sense of
            belonging and success within PWIs. Employing a qualitative methodology (Merriam, 1998),
            this study focused on gaining insights into administrators' viewpoints on Black male
            mentorship programs, allowing them to share their experiences and the significance
            they attributed to these programs (Merriam &amp; Tisdell, 2016). Data collection involved
            interviews with ten administrators directly overseeing and leading Black male mentorship
            programs at mid-size and large PWIs. The research questions probed how administrators
            utilize these programs to cultivate a sense of belonging for Black male undergraduate
            students and how they addressed challenges encountered in overseeing them. The findings
            highlight the positive impact of Black male mentorship programs, indicating that administrators
            perceive them as advantageous for fostering a sense of community, connection, and
            positive experiences. Although administrators recognized the advantages of these programs,
            they also highlighted areas for improvement in different aspects of the programs and
            within their institutions. This nuanced understanding of mentorship programs for Black
            male students has played a significant role in fostering a sense of belonging within
            PWI settings. In response to research question one, the data identified two primary
            themes: (1) facilitating personal connection and (2) fostering an engaging and supportive
            environment. These themes illuminated the ways in which mentorship programs contributed
            to the sense of belonging for Black male undergraduate students, emphasizing the importance
            of personal connections and a supportive academic environment. Addressing research
            question two, administrators navigated challenges through three key themes: (1) creating
            and executing strategies for financial resource management, (2) navigating staff and
            personnel management, and (3) managing the evaluation processes, sharing stories,
            and aligning with institutional goals. These themes unveiled the varied approaches
            employed by program administrators to address challenges and enhance the effectiveness
            of their mentorship programs. Exploring the implications of the findings, administrators
            demonstrated adaptability and resilience in integrating mentorship programs into institutional
            structures. The emergence of engaging activities and understanding program origins
            as crucial elements underscored administrators' ability to seamlessly align programs
            with institutional goals. Challenges were effectively addressed through adept financial
            resource management, strategic personnel navigation, and a commitment to storytelling,
            thus reinforcing institutional alignment. Four recommendations emerged from the findings.
            Recommendation one advocates for prioritizing the hiring of culturally competent staff
            sensitive to the unique challenges faced by Black male students and emphasizing the
            need for ongoing training. Recommendation two stresses the importance of establishing
            clear and measurable program goals, providing a roadmap for success, and enabling
            outcome assessment. Recommendation three encourages institutions to customize mentoring
            programs to meet the specific needs of their campus sizes and communities. Recommendation
            four underscores the need for individualized resource allocation for Black male mentorship
            programs. In conclusion, this research contributes valuable insights into the significance
            of Black male mentorship programs at PWIs, shedding light on their positive impact
            while addressing challenges. The recommendations offer a roadmap for institutions
            to enhance these programs, ultimately fostering a sense of belonging and academic
            success for Black male students in higher education.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Charles Stuart returned to his native country after fourteen years in exile. His subjects
            had just endured eleven years of military dictatorship under Oliver Cromwell and wanted
            a return to the days of monarchy. On 25 May 1660, Charles II landed in Dover and was
            warmly greeted by his people and the leader of the army, George Monck. They set off
            for London and arrived on 29 May, Charles II's thirtieth birthday. Escorting Charles
            into London were his Life Guards, a professional military cavalry force of Royalist
            supporters who followed their king into exile. Having witnessed his father's failure
            to keep his crown because he lacked a loyal bodyguard and seeing first-hand how a
            devoted household helped his cousin Louis XIV maintain his kingdom, Charles II had
            every intention of keeping these guards throughout his reign. The challenge was that
            Charles had promised to disband the military, which had become very unpopular in England
            and was viewed as a tool of tyranny and absolute rule. This dissertation deals with
            the challenges Charles II and his brother James II faced in keeping a loyal guard
            about them in a country that genuinely feared the institution of a standing army.
            The first four Stuart monarchs stubbornly believed in the Divine Right of Kings and
            sought to rule by the Royal Prerogative. How they wielded arbitrary powers in an era
            where Parliament wanted more to say in declaring laws and charting a direction for
            the country was challenging, and all four dealt with it differently. At the root of
            these challenges was how money was collected to fund wars and build armies. The Stuart
            kings could rule without Parliament but not raise taxes to pay for expensive armies
            to conduct military campaigns. For this, they had to call Parliament, and Parliament
            was all too aware of their growing power to the point that they used these episodes
            to demand more say. In this complicated world, Charles II and James II could not rule
            as absolutists without the Life Guards who formed the nucleus of England's standing
            army.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This dissertation provides a comprehensive analysis of the intricate dynamics of coastal
            systems under the extreme stress of hurricanes. A multi-faceted study on the interactions
            between hydrodynamics, morphology dynamics, and various coastal defenses like sand
            dunes and vegetations during hurricane events is presented, employing advanced numerical
            modeling to enhance the understanding of coastal resilience and protection. It is
            constructed upon three pillars of research, each delving into different yet interconnected
            aspects of coastal defense mechanisms and their responses to hurricane-induced forces.The
            research begins by examining the protective functions of sand dunes against hurricane
            forces, utilizing a non-hydrostatic XBeach model (XBNH) to analyze wave dynamics with
            various storm surge after overtopping sand dunes. The research presents an in-depth
            analysis of wave behavior as they encounter sand dunes during hurricane-induced storm
            surges. The research focuses on Hurricane Michael as a case study, dissecting the
            dynamics of wave propagation, breaking, and overtopping. It offers a quantitative
            assessment of the dunes' ability to attenuate waves, pinpointing the conditions that
            precipitate maximum erosion and wave heights. The findings reveal that sand dunes
            are pivotal in reducing wave heights, particularly as storm surges intensify, with
            waves breaking at the dune base, overtopping, and losing their energy as they move
            inland. Through the model validation, the chapter establishes the superior performance
            of XBNH over the hydrostatic mode (XBSB), especially in critical metrics such as significant
            wave height and peak water surface elevation, where XBNH showed a markedly lower average
            and maximum error rates. This research not only underscores the precision of the XBNH,
            also provides the foundation for following research. The investigation then extends
            to the complex processes leading to barrier-island breaching during hurricane conditions.
            A case study using a two-dimensional XBNH model provides a detailed account of how
            hurricane-induced waves and storm surges interplay to alter island topography. The
            study reveals that supercritical flow conditions significantly contribute to the rapid
            erosion and eventual breaching of barrier islands, offering a predictive analysis
            of the morphological changes under extreme weather events. In addition, it provides
            a detailed account of the barrier-island's breaching evolution, through the analysis
            of bed elevation cross-sections and surge-wave profiles across various storm stages.
            This comprehensive examination not only reinforces the model's precision but also
            offers a deeper understanding of barrier island dynamics, contributing valuable knowledge
            to enhance coastal hazard mitigation strategies. The final aspect of the research
            integrates the hydrodynamic focus of the preceding chapters to explore the evolution
            of dune profiles, particular the role of vegetation in coastal protection. It highlights
            how different conditions of vegetation affect dune morphology under storm conditions.
            The study explores the use of the XBeach model to simulate these interactions, emphasizing
            the critical role of vegetation in mitigating erosion. Moreover, the chapter enriches
            the XBeach model's application by incorporating sensitivity analyses to different
            wind conditions, thereby broadening its predictive capability. The study's comprehensive
            approach illuminates the multifaceted relationship between vegetation, coastal morphology,
            and erosion processes. It highlights the indispensable role of vegetation in bolstering
            coastal resilience and provides strategic insights for coastal management, reinforcing
            the vital need for integrated environmental considerations in the design of coastal
            defense systems. To summarize, this dissertation underscores the importance of integrating
            hydrodynamics, morphological dynamics, and ecological considerations into coastal
            management practices. The results contribute valuable insights into the design and
            conservation of coastal defenses, promoting the development of more resilient communities
            in the face of increasing hurricane activities. Through the refined application of
            the XBeach model and the insights gained from its performance, the dissertation makes
            a significant contribution to the field of coastal engineering and environmental protection.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Standardized testing has elementary schools transitioning into departmentalization,
            where a teacher is assigned to teach a particular subject matter. Elementary education
            programs tend to provide a holistic approach to education that includes training in
            all subject matters and learner psychology. The national trend of teacher shortages
            as resulted in the hiring of teachers who have not attended a formal education preparation
            program. Departmentalized elementary teachers in mathematics enter the role without
            prior specialized training due to holistic teacher preparation programs or entering
            the profession from another role. This study explores the implementation of pedagogical
            content knowledge of departmentalized elementary mathematics teachers in a large urban
            district during planning and instruction. Pedagogical content knowledge is the specialized
            content knowledge needed to effectively instruct a subject matter. Through multiple
            case study design, this exploration was able to identify specific elements of pedagogical
            content knowledge evident in the lesson plans, class observations, and interviews
            with seven elementary mathematics teachers in a large urban district. The findings
            provide insight on the various levels of planning in the area of questioning, but
            a consistency of evidence in the areas of multiple representation and problem selection.
            Despite the inconsistent evidence of planning for productive questioning, the elementary
            teachers demonstrated evidence of asking productive questions throughout the lesson
            and responding to student errors. The participants during the interview expressed
            the desire to increase the level of purposeful reflection on their planning and instruction
            as a way to improve their craft. Implications of these findings are discussed for
            school-level professional development programs and district-level structures for continuing
            education for departmentalized elementary mathematics teachers. This study contributes
            to the exploration of pedagogical content knowledge and teacher development specifically
            in the elementary setting and departmentalization that can be supported through collaborative
            structure and formalized reflections.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm is a powerful test of graph isomorphism, and works
            by iteratively isolating clusters of nodes via a coloring scheme based on binary relationships.
            This refinement process is akin to message passing on graph neural networks. Graph
            neural networks are paradigms of computation that yield powerful results for structured
            data based on binary relationships, and therefore their expressivity shares the limitations
            of the Weisfeiler-Leman test. One way to circumvent this limitation relies on identifying
            and working with higher relationships within the data, or by finding a better refinement
            criterion that can be implemented on a machine. In this thesis, we put forward data
            structures closely based on the identification of such higher relationships via Kan
            Extensions of structured data built on binary relations. These data structures are
            well known in algebraic topology as Simplicial Sets; the theoretical underpinnings
            based on the combinatorics of simplicial sets and directed graphs are explored in
            this thesis and, based on of it, algorithms are introduced that can identify higher-order
            relations. A metric that can serve as a quantification for community detection tools
            is also introduced, as well as the notion of a pseudoterminal vertex as a proxy for
            these higher relations. This helps us balance the variance-bias tradeoff necessary
            for generalizability of the architecture. We introduce functors that show how these
            higher relationships can be modelled and expanded. Finally, we propose three neural
            networks that benefit from the topology of these nonbinary relations. These neural
            networks can be ported into the standard graph neural network library to augment feature
            classification in a semisupervised manner. All source code is available at \texttt{https://github.com/abdullahnaeemmalik/simplicial-methods-in-graph-machine-learning}.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Europium exhibits two stable valence states, Eu2+ and Eu3+, with energies closely
            matched, wherein the magnetic Eu2+ state is significantly larger than the nonmagnetic
            Eu3+. EuPd2Si2 (EPS) undergoes a bulk valence state transition from Eu~3+ to Eu~2+
            while cooling. The phase diagram of the EPS compound differs from that of other typical
            rare-earth 1:2:2 compounds with valence instability. Therefore, the valence transition
            of the EPS compound cannot be explained by theoretical models of other compounds and
            remains rather mysterious. This study aims to construct a comprehensive phase diagram
            of the EPS crystal structure during the valence phase transition, while varying chemical
            substitution, temperature, and magnetic field.Chapter one discusses X-ray crystallography
            and crystal structures. Chapter 2 delves into the electronic and magnetic states of
            lanthanides and specifically europium. Curie's susceptibility of the magnetic divalent
            europium atoms and the Van Vleck paramagnetism susceptibility of the non-magnetic
            trivalent europium atoms are discussed. A literature review on the valence instability
            of 1:2:2 rare-earth compounds, especially the EPS compound, is presented in chapter
            three. Chapter four covers the efforts on the growth and characterization of the pristine
            and below 5% chemically substituted EPS compounds. The temperature-dependent X-ray
            diffraction (XRD) powder measurements by the APS synchrotron and our in-lab XRD machines
            will be discussed. In the EPS and its low-doped compounds, another smaller unit cell
            appears beside the high-temperature EPS (HT-EPS) unit cell. The new low-temperature
            EPS (LT-EPS) unit cell is related to the Eu3+ valence state. A magnetic valence transition
            was observed in the DC magnetic susceptibility measurements at temperatures where
            the unit cell transformation starts. In the next chapter, in the 10 to 20 % alloyed
            samples of EPS, the linear thermal coefficient can suddenly increase or slowly decrease
            to up to 3.5 times, or stay constant at all temperatures. Finally, the four thermal
            expansion trends are explained qualitatively by the available space for the europium
            atoms in the unit cell in chapter 6. The analysis of powder patterns of EPS at high
            magnetic fields and low temperatures in Cell 5 of MAGLAB has been conducted in chapter
            7. Key findings include the magnetic field's enhancement of the HT-EPS phase, driving
            the valence transition temperature lower. The weight fraction of the EPS phase demonstrates
            a linear dependence on temperature, particularly around the temperature equating HT-EPS
            and LT-EPS weight fractions. Moreover, quadratic relationships with magnetic field
            strength are observed, along with hysteresis effects influencing the symmetry of these
            relationships. Finally, some of my other side projects that I have done during my
            study at FSU are presented. Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) semiconductor materials serve
            as excellent absorber layers in thin-film photovoltaic devices, yet their low open-circuit
            voltage hinders mass production. Unlike CZTSSe, Ag2ZnSnSe4 (AZTSe) possesses a favorable
            bandgap of 1.4 eV, making it a promising candidate to replace toxic or scarce materials
            in photovoltaics. Powder AZTSe was successfully synthesized. In an attempt to grow
            single-crystal AZTSe via the chemical vapor transport method, Ag8SnSe6 and SnSe2 phases
            were obtained. Further exploration focused on Ag8SnSe6's potential as a thermoelectric
            material, highlighting its superionic conductivity. By constructing a comprehensive
            electron density map of Ag8SnSe6, the path of silver atoms inside the single crystal
            was determined. Additionally, efforts to grow AuPbSbS3 and (Au0.5Cu0.5)PbSbS3 for
            renewable energy applications via chemical vapor transport were explored. Another
            study investigates the impact of light and temperature on the optical properties and
            stability of mixed-ion perovskite thin films, demonstrating slight peak shifts under
            elevated temperature conditions, potentially indicating anisotropic thermal expansion.
            Additionally, doping with Cs shows improved performance and stability compared to
            other compositions, as evidenced by XRD measurements. Another study examines the chemical
            composition of shark teeth artifacts from archaeological sites using XRD analysis,
            revealing residues that provide insights into ancient tool applications. Despite challenges
            posed by uneven surfaces, the integration of XRD patterns uncovers phases like hematite,
            shedding light on ancient material usage and cultural practices.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Some philosophers have recently argued that a decision-theoretic model of rational
            choice can guide us to the answer of what it is appropriate to do in situations of
            moral uncertainty (i.e., uncertainty about what one ought to do). By proposing and
            defending this view, these philosophers aim to show how decision-theoretic procedures
            provide us with action guidance even when we have yet to settle all of the issues
            in normative ethics. In this paper, I argue that decision theory is never action-guiding
            in cases of moral uncertainty. I thus suggest that because of this limitation on decision
            theory's action-guiding capacities, it fails to fulfill the role that these philosophers
            hope to show that it has. I consider several objections to my argument and reply to
            each of them.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This thesis investigates how critics respond to the fat body onstage, aiming to better
            understand how to develop positive fat representation. Through my research, I advocate
            for theatre to develop fat-positive practices. I argue that fat positivity in theatre
            must go beyond simply including fat bodies onstage. A fat-positive theatre would cast
            fat bodies in all roles, while maintaining the sensitivity that the fat body carries
            unique cultural assumptions and may require material changes to the theatrical processes.
            Adopting these fat-positive practices would involve a radical acceptance of fatness
            onstage.My research examines three notable plays as case studies to understand how
            the fat body is performed and received onstage in the United States. My first case
            study, 'night, Mother, takes place in the 1980s as a landmark example of how casting
            a fat body affected a production's reception. The other two case studies, Untitled
            Feminist Show and Fat Ham, focus on the 2010s and 2020s, to examine how recent shifts
            in fat activism and body-positive movements have impacted cultural understandings
            of the fat body. My research seeks to understand how these cultural shifts connect
            to critical receptions of the fat body onstage. Through these case studies, I aim
            to craft a narrative around the shifting ways we conceptualize the neutral body and
            how the fat body challenges this unspoken assumption. In this thesis, I use the term
            "neutral body" to refer to bodies that fit the cultural norms of an ideal performer
            and "non-neutral bodies" to identify fat bodies that visibly break the traditional
            mode of what we expect an actor to look like. This framework provides a way of thinking
            about how fat bodies are routinely excluded from representation and highlights the
            unspoken assumption that the fat body is not the ideal body.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Community colleges provide access to higher education for a wide range of prospective
            students with diverse interests and educational goals. With more than 60 percent of
            incoming community college students deemed as academically underprepared for college-level
            work, traditionally, students have been required to enroll in one semester or more
            of developmental coursework before beginning college-level classes. Several studies
            demonstrate traditional remedial education models seldom increase students' skills
            and contribute towards success in outcomes such as persistence, passage of gateway
            courses, or credential completion (Bailey &amp; Phillips, 2016; Goudas &amp; Boylan, 2013;
            Jaggars &amp; Bickerstaff; 2018). Recent developmental education reform efforts include
            models that have proven to be successful in accelerating the time it takes for students
            to successfully matriculate through developmental coursework (Edgecombe et al., 2013;
            Jaggars &amp; Stacey, 2014). These reform models include options for students to enroll
            directly in college-level courses simultaneously with support courses as with corequisite
            courses, curricula changes and interventions which consolidate multiple standalone
            courses into one single semester as with compressed courses, intensive advising policies,
            and alternatives to traditional placement assessments which result in a higher likelihood
            of placement accuracy and success in college-level coursework. Overwhelmingly, studies
            examining the outcomes of students who participate in developmental reform models
            have found benefits relative to traditional developmental models, however, these studies
            largely consider the effects of one type of developmental model or the presence or
            lack thereof of any type of developmental policy (Bahr et al., 2019; Barbitta &amp; Munn
            2018; Cho et al., 2012; Jaggars et al., 2013; Ran &amp; Lin, 2019). Additionally, many
            studies have failed to examine whether certain types of developmental policies are
            more effective than others and if this differs based on gender and race/ethnicity.
            With states adopting varying developmental education reform policies to improve student
            progression into college-level coursework and beyond, this study examined how recent
            state modifications to placement policies, compressed/corequisite modalities, or changes
            to advising/academic planning have affected student persistence trends. Using a modified
            version of Wang's theoretical model of momentum for community college student success,
            I conceptualized developmental reform policies based on how they may function to contribute
            towards the momentum of students, and therefore, outcomes such as first-year retention
            and graduation rates. Drawing data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data
            System, this study used a difference-in-differences approach between the years of
            2012 to 2020 to observe student success outcomes before and after implementation of
            developmental education policy reform models, while comparing outcomes among non-adopting
            states. This study considered how developmental reform policies in a national context
            contribute to academic momentum and student success outcomes such as persistence and
            completion. Results in the aggregate provide evidence that the presence of developmental
            education reform policies in states increase institutional retention and completion
            rates more so than institutions within states that do not adopt reform policies. Additionally,
            when disaggregating results by type of developmental education reform policy, there
            are no differential impacts on student outcomes, with one exception, holistic reforms
            which may more negatively impact outcomes. Lastly, while developmental education reforms
            aided in increasing overall student outcomes, gaps in graduation rates among genders
            and racial/ethnic groups were observed, with disparities between certain groups widening
            at institutions within states with reforms.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Problem of PracticeSchool principals have a powerful effect on student achievement,
            school culture, and teacher turnover. According to the National Association of Secondary
            School Principals (2020), the average career of a school principal is four years,
            and one in five school principals leave their schools annually. These numbers are
            even greater in more challenging schools with high numbers of minority students, English
            Language Learners, and students living in poverty. These students need the most experienced
            school principals, yet they often end up with the newest and least experienced. Even
            more alarming is that results from a recent survey conducted jointly by NASSP and
            the Learning Policy Institute (LPI) in 2020 indicated that 42% of school principals
            were considering leaving their position. This exploratory qualitative research study
            answers the following research question: The purpose of this study is to answer the
            following research question: What has motivated school principals to remain in school-level
            leadership? The study focuses on gaining the perspectives of principals on factors
            influencing school-based leaders to remain in their positions. Motivation and retention
            of current school leaders is critical to student growth and success, overall school
            achievement, and retention of school educators at all levels. This study will add
            to the current body of research focused on development and support of school leaders
            to positively impact school principal perseverance and retention. Methods Semi-structured
            interviews and coding methods have been used to organize and analyze outcomes effectively
            without losing the individuality of the participants' responses. Ten principals participated
            in semi-structured interviews. The stratified and purposeful sample included both
            males and females, principals at all K-12 levels, Title I and non-Title I schools,
            and urban and suburban schools. Data Analysis First cycle descriptive coding using
            a priori codes in conjunction with in vivo coding outcomes and second cycle coding
            outcomes were charted to identify dominant codes: Relevant Preparation, Relevant Experience,
            Relationships with Staff, the Participants' Perception of the Role/Feelings About
            the Role, Passion for Helping Others, Internal Drive, Future Role, Informal Collaboration
            with Peers, and the Mentor/Mentee Relationship. Code outcomes were clustered based
            on commonality. Six overarching themes emerged and were named: External Validation,
            Collaboration, Preparation and Support, Future Plans, Intrinsic Motivation, and Relationships.
            These themes answered the research question: What has motivated school principals
            to remain in school-level leadership? Recommendations Based on participant interview
            outcomes for this study, the following recommendations are offered. The first recommendation
            is to ensure that the right support is being provided to school leaders to positively
            impact the leader to be able to succeed within the role. The next recommendation is
            focused on collaboration. A focus on formal collaboration needs to shift from interaction
            in meetings to shadowing peers and a sharing of ideas to positively impact schools,
            leadership practices, and student achievement. Informal collaboration when supported
            and celebrated by school districts could potentially support school leaders professionally
            as well as emotionally which would positively impact retention rates. Next, mentor
            programs should be expanded to include both internal and external relationships. For
            mentoring programs to be most impactful on the decision-making of school principals,
            evaluation or fear of retribution should be removed, and this often results from an
            external match. Additionally, it is critical to establish and encourage a pipeline
            of leaders within a school district to ensure a continual pool of qualified leaders
            prepared to support and lead schools. All school districts and current leaders should
            identify and tap potential leaders and provide effective professional development,
            encouragement, and mentorship to develop leadership skills. Creating a pipeline of
            educators at all levels positively impacts students, schools, and school districts
            as a whole. Finally, salaries should increase to compensate school leaders fairly
            and adequately. Conclusion Addressing this research question provides answers and
            informs practice to improve formal and informal learning opportunities for school
            principals in an effort to address principal turnover rates. Ensuring that the right
            learning opportunities and supportive measures are in place are of the utmost importance
            to increase longevity of school leaders in their role to ultimately positively impact
            student achievement, increase teacher retention, and positively impact the climate
            and culture of a school community. Based on the perceptions of current school principals
            in this study, 6 themes have emerged from the data: External Validation, Collaboration,
            Preparation &amp; Support, Future Plans, Intrinsic Motivation, and Relationships. Each
            plays an important role in developing and supporting school leaders. The combination
            of these supports and opportunities increases school principal perseverance and retention
            in their school-based leader role.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This study explored the relationship between autism spectrum disorder (ASD) severity,
            parental stress, barriers to care, and family resilience among 210 parents of children
            with ASD. Using path analysis, the study investigated how ASD severity influences
            parental stress, mediated by barriers to care and family resilience. Results demonstrated
            positive direct effects between ASD severity and parent stress as well as significant
            indirect effects when including barriers to care as a mediator in this relationship.
            The sequential mediation effect of barriers to care and family resilience on the relationship
            between ASD severity and parent stress also supported partial mediation. While family
            resilience alone did not have a significant indirect effect on this relationship,
            resilience plays a significant role in the sequential mediation model alongside barriers
            to care. These findings emphasize the importance of comprehensive interventions that
            address both ASD symptoms and familial stressors. They have implications for clinical
            practice, research, education, public policy, and family support initiatives, suggesting
            the need for improved access to care and increased awareness and inclusivity.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The Sullivan Report (The Sullivan Commission on Diversity in the Healthcare Workforce,
            2004) identified the lack of racial diversity among health care practitioners as a
            major issue. This report points out that, while the U.S. population has continued
            to become more diverse, the composition of health care workers has not kept pace with
            these changes. Emergency Medical Services (EMS) workers provide advanced medical care
            to patients in the prehospital environment. Nationally, 11.6% of the entire workforce
            is African American, and 16.1% are Hispanic. Within the EMS field, African Americans
            represent only 6% of workers, and Hispanics represent 10.6% (U.S. Department of Health
            and Human Services, 2017). One possible impediment to minorities entering the EMS
            workforce may involve the admissions practices of post-secondary institutions offering
            EMS programs (Health Resources and Services Administration [HRSA], 2017). This study
            examined the admissions practices of Florida college-based paramedic programs to determine
            what they currently are and how decisions about these requirements are made. This
            study used a document analysis of Florida college-based paramedic program websites
            to determine what current admissions requirements are in place for these programs,
            as well as interviews with the program managers of 11 of the 25 Florida college-based
            paramedic programs, to determine how decisions are made about which instruments are
            used and how they are used in admissions processes. The study found that these programs
            used a variety of qualitative and quantitative instruments in their admissions processes
            as well as several different methods of selecting students based on these instruments.
            Interviews with program managers revealed that their decision-making processes were
            influenced by a desire to meet several goals, including selecting students they felt
            would successfully complete their programs, pass licensing exams, and perform as competent
            clinicians. They also incorporated influences from accreditors, government regulators,
            and employers of their graduates in their decision-making processes. Program directors
            relied mostly on anecdotal evidence to make these decisions, and diversity considerations
            did not play a meaningful part in their decision-making processes. Accreditors and
            regulators should provide guidance for these decision makers in this area, and research
            should be conducted to assess the validity of common instruments and selection processes
            and their effect on the diversity of these training programs.  </p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Approximately 25% of women and 15% of men have reported being sexually abused in childhood.
            Although child sexual abuse (CSA) prevention and treatment methods have been widely
            supported in the literature, many survivors either never disclose or delay disclosing
            their abuse until later in life. The absence of disclosure presents major challenges
            to holistically understanding CSA prevention and treatment methods. Consequently,
            research attempting to uncover the barriers, influences, recipients, and impacts of
            CSA disclosure has become increasingly prevalent. A perceived negative response to
            CSA disclosure has been linked to a variety of long-term survivor consequences including
            revictimization, mental and physical health struggles, and relational issues. Not
            only is fear of others' responses one of the largest barriers to CSA disclosure, but
            having access to someone you can trust is also the most commonly identified influence
            to disclosing CSA. Unsurprisingly, survivors who decide to disclose initially do so
            and are primarily worried about the responses of their parents. Additionally, much
            of the CSA disclosure literature is oriented especially around children who disclose.
            It is reported, however, that survivors of CSA often delay reporting until adulthood.
            In order to increase feelings of safety for survivors to disclose, there is a need
            to strengthen our awareness of how survivors perceive their parents' responses to
            CSA disclosure. The present study aimed to gain an in-depth understanding of survivors'
            perceptions surrounding disclosure of CSA to a parent. Grounded theory qualitative
            methods were employed to develop a central theory surrounding the process of adult
            CSA disclosure to a parent. Findings highlighted a relational process through which
            adult survivors perceive and interpret their parent's response to CSA disclosure.
            Analyses concluded that parent response to CSA disclosure impacted the parent-child
            relationship by either hindering or strengthening it. Whether a relationship was ultimately
            hindered or strengthened by the CSA disclosure experience was dependent on the manner
            in which parents responded to the disclosure. Harmful and helpful parental responses
            were divided into five subthemes: statements, questions, behaviors, positionality,
            and follow-up actions. Other patterns discussed were wished for responses, familial
            context, and ongoing CSA discussions. Findings from this study provide insights for
            parents and clinicians, as well as future research directions.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This thesis offers the first comprehensive exploration of the Rotherwood site (40SL61)
            in Upper East Tennessee, focusing on faunal remains to understand the subsistence
            practices of its original occupants. Located along the South Fork Holston River, this
            site presents a unique opportunity for archaeological investigation, being relatively
            unexplored and lacking scholarly publication. This study investigates subsistence
            strategies, social organization, and broader behavioral patterns during the Mississippian
            period through faunal analysis. Methodologically, the research addresses taphonomic
            processes, site formation factors, and the challenges of archaeological interpretation.
            The presence of whole animal remains suggests limited carcass sharing, challenging
            prevailing notions about Mississippian cultures in Tennessee. Furthermore, the abundance
            of vertebrate remains suggests that Rotherwood was not a freshwater mussel shell processing
            station, indicating a more diverse subsistence base. By examining the material evidence
            from Rotherwood, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of pre-contact societies
            in Upper East Tennessee and emphasizes the significance of faunal analysis in archaeological
            research.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>In the rapidly evolving world of molecular biology, genetics and epigenetics have
            taken crucial roles in unraveling the complex origins of diseases. Through gene expression,
            genes govern the synthesis of proteins, the fundamental building blocks of life. Conventional
            observational studies grapple with major limitations in exploring the relationships
            between diseases and gene expression, leading to the advent of transcriptome-wide
            association studies (TWAS). Similarly, methylome-wide association studies (MWAS) have
            been developed to explore the relationships between DNA methylation and disease, as
            DNA methylation plays a key role in regulating gene expression. In Chapter 2 of this
            dissertation, we introduce MIMOSA (MWAS Imputing Methylome Obliging Summary-level
            mQTLs and Associated LD matrices), a comprehensive set of DNA methylation prediction
            models for use in MWAS. MIMOSA significantly improves the accuracy of DNA methylation
            prediction and downstream power of MWAS by training on a large, summary-level methylation
            quantitative trait loci (mQTL) dataset from the Genetics of DNA Methylation Consortium.
            We apply MIMOSA to genome-wide summary statistics for 28 complex traits and include
            a case study in high cholesterol. In Chapter 3, we present SUMMIT-FA (Summary-level
            Unified Method for Modeling Integrated Transcriptome with Functional Annotations),
            which extends the state-of-the-art TWAS method SUMMIT by incorporating functional
            annotations from the the Multi-dimensional Annotation-Class Integrative Estimation
            (MACIE). SUMMIT-FA improves gene expression prediction accuracy and TWAS power, which
            we demonstrate through its application to 24 traits and through simulations. In Chapter
            4, we turn our attention to spatial transcriptomics, which measures gene expression
            in situ on slices of tissue. We present a novel zero-inflated hierarchical generalized
            transformation (ZI-HGT) model that functions as a noisy transformation for cell-type
            deconvolution with conditional autoregressive-based deconvolution (CARD). CARD assumes
            normality of the highly zero-inflated, count-valued spatial transcriptomic data, and
            the ZI-HGT transforms the data to better fit this assumption. Joined together, the
            ZI-HGT and CARD not only achieve enhanced cell-type deconvolution accuracy, but naturally
            quantify uncertainty in the estimated cell-type proportions through bootstrap Bayesian
            pointwise credible intervals. This leads to a novel, exploratory ``heterogeneity score''
            for quantitative assessment of cell-type heterogeneity at different locations, which
            is demonstrated to coincide well with pathologist-annotated tissue layer boundaries.
            We apply the combined method to 12 samples of oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC)
            data to gain a better understanding of the tumor microenvironment.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>With regard to Emergency Medical Services (EMS), the response time and consistency
            thatthey can provide care to in need patients is of the upmost importance. The key
            aspects of achieving this efficiency lies in how the EMS vehicles are dispatched to
            a patient from the currently available fleet and how they are then redistributed to
            best cover the area of care. This problem can be formulated as both a Markov-Decision
            Process and as a Multi-Agent Markov Game in which we can find some optimal policy
            to best assist those in needs. Previous works have approached this problem in both
            the combined sense (considering dispatching and redeployment as a single problem)
            or as two separate systems to optimize. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been
            growing in popularity over the past half decade, and applications of these advances
            are still underutilized for this problem. While methods within the DRL family have
            been applied to this problem, they typically only consider the dispatching or redistribution
            sides independently, there has been a growing field of interest in applying one DRL
            policy to multiple tasks. Our approach is centered around improving the redeployment
            side of the problem but we will also be exploring the benefits of using a single policy
            to approach two aspects of a conjoined problem to improve the response time and consistency
            of these vital services.</p>

            Liegroup is a very active area of research [11, 16, 18, 1, 7, 6, 15] and is particularly
            relevant to higher Teichmuller theory. For a closed surface, classical Teichmuller
            space is a connected component of the moduli space of representations into PSL(2,

            analysis studies. I simulated individual-level survival data and created pseudo studies
            that were combined in meta-analyses. I analyzed the pseudo study data using both Cox
            and AFT models, then submitted the studies to meta-analysis. I examined 120 conditions
            describing features of the meta-analyses, each studied with 500 replications. I analyzed
            the simulated meta-analyses of survival data using eight methods including three tests

            test, and four Egger's tests. I calculated the rejection rates of each test based
            on the 500 simulated meta-analyses and analyzed them via ANCOVA models. In the unbiased
            meta-analyses of AFT data, all tests showed type I error rates comparable to their
            alpha levels. In unbiased meta-analyses of Cox data, all tests except the Egger's
            test at the alpha level of .05 showed low type I error rates compared to their alpha
            levels. In the biased meta-analyses of Cox and AFT data, all tests showed low empirical

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This work examines the debate between the luck and relational egalitarians. The former,
            including authors like Dworkin, Cohen, Arneson, Tan, and Lippert-Rasmussen, are said
            to view equality as deriving from the nullification of certain types of bad luck,
            such as by equalizing access to resources, opportunity sets, or experienced well-being.
            Such accounts are said to be distributive in character, as they are concerned chiefly
            with the way some good is distributed in a population. The latter, including authors
            like Anderson, Scheffler, Scanlon, and Schemmel, argue that equality consists not
            in any sort of distribution, such as an equal distribution of bad luck, but instead
            in the nature of the social relationships we are enmeshed in. When these are relations
            of equality, when objectionable status hierarchies are not present and individuals
            are treated with respect and dignity, equality obtains. I argue, in support of philosophers
            such as Kok-Chor Tan and Kasper Lippert-Rasmussen, that the two views are not as distinct
            or incompatible as generally characterized by either side of the debate. Instead,
            I suggest that a pluralist account which incorporates elements of both is the better
            choice for our egalitarian purposes. I argue for this conclusion in large part utilizing
            the work of Richard Rorty, whose pragmatism easily accommodates and encourages the
            sort of pluralism on offer. Such an account is especially important given recent advances
            in economics involving our understanding of the structure and behavior of capitalist
            systems and how they impact the mere distribution of goods. Such distributive concerns
            as raised by Thomas Piketty are difficult to account for if our philosophies must
            be entirely non-distributive in their character. Given the importance of incorporating
            these insights, it stands to reason that merely distributive concerns will be a part
            of any viable egalitarian philosophy. Broadly speaking, this work sets as its goal
            the defense of such distributive approaches to egalitarian philosophy.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The present work is about partially hyperbolic dynamics on closed 3-manifolds and
            closed periodiccurves. Partially hyperbolic systems are dynamical systems characterized
            by a dominated splitting of their tangent bundle into directions of contraction, expansion
            and intermediate behavior. The prime candidates of study are Anosov flows and partially
            hyperbolic diffeomorphisms. In recent years, these systems have gained a lot of interest,
            mainly in dimension 3, where there is lot of machinery available. In the realm of
            Anosov flows, the orbit structure of these systems plays a major role in understanding
            their properties and even helping in their classification. For skewed R-covered Anosov
            flows whose weak stable foliation is transversely orientable, it was shown by Fenley
            [7] that any two distinct freely homotopic periodic orbits are always isotopic. We
            were interested in knowing whether this result was also true for non R-covered Anosov
            flows. Our first main result is to extend this result to a class of systems generalizing
            Anosov flows, called topological Anosov flows. This is theorem 34. In contrast with
            Anosov flows, partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms may not exhibit a very desirable
            property called dynamical coherence. This property means that the center direction
            of the system integrates into a foliation. The first example of a non dynamically
            coherent partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism in dimension 3 was constructed by Hertz,
            Hertz, and Ures [37]. The existence of non differentiable points in curves along the
            center direction, is what makes the system not dynamically coherent. Quite commonly,
            important invariant sets of regularity no more than C 0 appear in the study of dynamical
            systems whose regularity is C 1 or better. Seeing as periodic orbits play an important
            role, we wonder whether a continuous embedded (possibly non differentiable) closed
            periodic curve, under a partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism could be "tangent" (see
            remark 11.2.1) to the center direction. We show this is indeed the case in our second
            main result, theorem 53.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Firms struggle to credibly communicate privately with other firms, which leads them
            to rely on public disclosure to share information. Although public disclosure alleviates
            the credibility concerns of private interfirm communication, it comes with proprietary
            costs. Recent advances in blockchain technology provide a potential solution that
            allows firms to communicate on a shared, immutable, and private ledger which mitigates
            credibility concerns and avoids the proprietary costs of public disclosure. Thus,
            blockchain technology may reduce firms' reliance on public disclosure to corroborate
            private interfirm communications. Using a difference-in-difference design, I find
            results consistent with this argument. Specifically, I find that managers, especially
            those of firms that likely bear greater proprietary costs of public disclosure, decrease
            their public disclosure following blockchain adoption. I find that this decrease in
            public disclosure has negative consequences, as it leads to greater analyst forecast
            errors. Collectively, my results suggest that although blockchain technology can improve
            private interfirm communication, it may have the unintended consequence of deteriorating
            the public information environment through reduced public disclosure.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The purpose of this study was to investigate music therapists' perceptions of including
            a client's primary language in sessions. It also sought to gather relevant information
            regarding what tools would be most helpful to assist music therapists in including
            their clients' primary language in sessions. A 12-question survey was sent to music
            therapists in the United States to gather data on their perceptions of including language
            and culture within music therapy sessions. Results revealed that majority of music
            therapists included in this study are not actively including different languages in
            sessions based on patients' primary language. Results showed having personalized tools
            for learning and applying different languages is an important resource for music therapists
            to begin this inclusion. Findings from this survey may reveal a need for more research
            regarding the effects of language inclusion in music therapy sessions as well as the
            need for this inclusion based on client preferences. Further results and implications

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Self-compassion can be understood as cultivating a gentle and understanding relationship
            with the self. The benefits of self-compassion for romantic relationships have been
            well-established in the literature. Additionally, the benefits of self-compassion
            for LGBTQ+ individuals has also been examined. However, no studies to date have examined
            the associations between self-compassion and relationship outcomes for queer couples.
            Furthermore, given the established connection between internalized stigma and relationship
            quality, it is important to consider how internalized stigma may affect this association
            as well. Therefore, a sample of 143 queer couples was recruited to complete an online
            survey that assessed demographic information, self-compassion, internalized stigma,
            both positive and negative relationship quality, queer consciousness, and self-esteem.
            The data was analyzed using an Actor-Partner Interdependence Mediation Model, or APIMeM,
            to identify the mediating role of internalized stigma on the actor and partner effects
            of self-compassion and relationship quality. Self-compassion was not found to mediate
            the relationship between internalized stigma and relationship quality. The decision
            was made, then, to explore internalized stigma as a mediator between self-compassion
            and relationship quality, which yielded significant indirect effects, thus supporting
            the idea that internalized stigma helps to explain the relationship between self-compassion
            and relationship quality for queer couples. Additionally, self-esteem was added as
            a covariate, which resulted in self-compassion no longer having any significant direct
            or indirect associations with any of the study variables. The clinical implications
            of this study highlight the importance of addressing internalized stigma in queer
            couples who are hoping to increase relationship quality. One such way of addressing
            internalized stigma may be self-compassion interventions. Future directions and additional
            clinical implications are discussed.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>High-achieving teenage students (HATS) take Advanced Placement (AP) courses to fulfill
            two goals: boost their grade point average (GPA) and maintain or increase their class
            rank. To assist in accomplishing these goals, HATS access social media (SM) and technology.
            Smart devices, laptops, and tablets provide easy access for HATS to build social communities
            where exchanging knowledge, sharing opinions, and communicating messages are related
            to AP. Therefore, continual access to social media communities serves as a gateway
            for HATS to participate in academic dishonesty (AD), which can adversely affect their
            performance on the AP exam but ultimately challenge the traditional models of teaching
            and learning. This exploratory qualitative study examines the social, behavioral,
            and technological worlds of HATS' participation in AP courses. Twenty-one participants
            shared their perspectives through focus group interviews to answer why and how social
            media was used to complete AP coursework. Interview transcripts were coded using Atlas.ti,
            and these codes, along with prior research, revealed three themes for each research
            question: 1. Why HATS use SM emerged into the themes of personalized learning structures,
            time management, and building social media communities. 2. How HATS used SM resulted
            in developing learning strategies, fact-checking, and AD. 3. HATS's reactions to AD
            included various emotions, the depths of AD considered through "morally gray" lenses,
            and the justifications given to rationalize AD acts. The results reveal a need to
            redesign our current teaching and learning models rather than trying to catch HATS'
            engaging in AD behaviors.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Collegiate class piano for music majors has grown substantially since its beginnings
            in the mid-twentieth century and has been developed by music teachers and organizations.
            Research on collegiate group piano has increased in the past forty years, and literature
            on teaching strategies, professional development, technology, and perceptions of students
            is available. Presently, there have not been any post-pandemic studies which have
            collected instructor perceptions on collegiate group piano. Additionally, there is
            limited literature focusing on collegiate class piano outside the United States. The
            purpose of the study was to investigate the status of group piano instruction as well
            as instructor perceptions in universities throughout North and South America through
            a mixed methods investigation. To accomplish this goal, the researcher collected data
            from class piano instructors in universities across eight different countries within
            the Western Hemisphere. The questionnaire developed by the researcher served as the
            survey instrument for this investigation. The researcher used the data collected to
            analyze the program structure of collegiate group piano classes, investigate the materials,
            resources, and equipment used by instructors, as well as collect information about
            instructors' educational backgrounds and group piano training. The researcher sent
            emails to a total of 40 universities across North, Central, and South America, and
            received replies from 20 universities. The number of participants for the present
            study was 28. Results from the questionnaire indicated that piano performance (36%)
            was the participating instructors' most common musical concentration during their
            training. Other areas were reported as well such as piano pedagogy, theory/composition,
            collaborative piano, music education, musicology/ethnomusicology, conducting, and
            jazz. Out of all instructors, a slight majority (54%) had not received training specifically
            in group piano pedagogy. Data from the questionnaire revealed that the typical number
            of sequential semesters of class piano offered at universities was 3.55, with music
            theatre (M = 3.5, SD = 1.91) and theory/composition majors (M = 3.29, SD = 1.07) being
            required to take the most semesters. Weekly contact hours were reported to be slightly
            below 2 hours (M = 1.93, SD = 0.73). The textbook most frequently chosen from the
            questionnaire's list for classroom use was Alfred's Group Piano for Adults (43%),
            however several instructors from South America gave titles of the books and materials
            that they use in their classes which gave deeper insight into the curriculum used
            in other countries. Names of smart device applications and websites were also shared.
            Of the digital tools listed in the questionnaire, the most used item across all participating
            countries (30%) was YouTube. The questionnaire also revealed significant differences
            in some perceptions between North and South America. When instructors were asked to
            rank their students' attitudes toward the university class piano requirement, North
            American instructors' rankings (M = 3.4, SD = .83) were lower than South America instructors'
            rankings (M = 3.92, SD = .52). Another significant difference found between the two
            continents was that when asked to rank the importance of 11 skills commonly learned
            in class piano, South American respondents overwhelmingly rated chord progressions
            very highly (M = 4.7, SD = .4) whereas North American responses exhibited greater
            variability and an overall lower ranking (M = 4, SD = 1.13). The reason for this disparity
            is likely due to the manner in which chord progressions and accompaniment styles are
            taught in South American countries. Near the end of the questionnaire, instructors
            also shared their thoughts on the possibility of a national standard for university
            class piano in their countries. Those who were not in favor of a standardized curriculum
            mentioned that it is important to keep class content flexible, and respondents who
            were in favor of a national standard stated that it would be useful for more uniformity
            across institutions. According to the results from the research questionnaire, the
            researcher recommends that more rote teaching be implemented into North American class
            piano instruction to enhance the student learning experience. The researcher also
            proposes that while a standardized curriculum may not be necessary, more national
            guidelines can ensure consistency across universities to give students a strong foundation
            of piano fundamentals on which they can build upon if specialized skills are desired
            in the future. Finally, the researcher suggests embracing a more global perspective
            on piano pedagogy, and that instructors worldwide engage in increased international
            dialogue to foster sharing of repertoire, learning new pedagogical strategies, and
            nurturing mutual growth.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>To this day, the origins and prognosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pose significant
            challenges. This thesis presents a methodology to understand AD by systematically
            applying state-of-the-art techniques from graph neural networks (GNNs) to medical
            images, producing a set of individualized graphs suitable for analysis. We accomplish
            this task by defining a latent graph variable as an intermediate latent variable inferred
            in a machine learning task. As one of the first researchers to explore the use of
            GNNs with medical images, this thesis begins with simple machine learning tasks that
            gradually increase in complexity. In particular, the thesis is organized into the
            following four main parts: (1) establishing a baseline with standard attention-based
            models applied to gray matter and PET probability regions of interest (ROIs), (2)
            developing a 3D-CNN model for processing voxel images directly to infer a latent graph
            more interpretable and closely aligned to known forms of connectivity within the brain,
            (3) learning latent graphs for a challenging network diffusion task with synthetic
            and real longitudinal datasets, (4) and developing a pipeline based on statistical
            analysis and metrics for comparing the learned latent graphs to baseline graphs derived
            from standard methods to assess the performance of the latent graphs. Our experiments
            show that the careful application of GNNs to medical images can provide a suitable
            inductive bias to enhance performance compared to standard baselines such as support
            vector machines and multilayer perceptrons. The latent graph connectivity structure
            learned from our new 3D-CNN-GNN model alone is significant enough to achieve state-of-the-art
            precision when differentiating between patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
            who will progress to AD and those who will maintain an MCI diagnosis, providing a
            set of interpretable features to uncover the mysteries surrounding AD.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Throughout the course of history, women have often been relegated to the margins ofsociety.
            The cultural and societal expectations kept them on the sidelines and in the footnotes
            of history books. Historically, women were not allowed to be composers or performers
            of music, especially of brass instruments until the twentieth-century. This has left
            a gap in the repertoire of women-composed music before the 1900s. During the nineteenth-century,
            many women composers produced quality music within the boundaries that society set
            upon them—music for voice, piano, or sometimes stringed instruments. Unfortunately,
            compositions for brass instruments such as French horn were seen as a masculine endeavor
            and most women composers avoided composing for them until the twentieth- and twenty-first-
            centuries. This document features six compositions by Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel, Clara
            Schumann, and Josephine Lang transcribed and arranged for French horn. The compositions
            include Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel's Schwanenlied from 6 Lieder, op. 1 and Abendbild
            from 5 Lieder, op. 10; Clara Weick Schumann's Liebst du um Schönheit from Op. 12 No.
            14 and Warum Willst du And're Frangen; and Josephine Lang's Wenn zwei Voneinander
            Scheiden and Wie glänzt so hell.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>First we show that, since 2000 the U.S. federal government has imposed over $600 billion
            in penalties and spent over $5 billion in preventing fraud. Yet 87% of firms re-offend,
            which raises the question, is punishment effective? We analyze the effectiveness of
            federal monetary sanctions using U.S. courts' five criminal law rationales for punishment:
            retribution, specific deterrence, general deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation.
            We show that punishment has the largest effects on retribution and rehabilitation.
            We measure that a $1,000,000 increase in annual sanctions is associated with 3% decrease
            in firm value, as measured by Tobin's Q, and a 57% improvement in Li et.al(2020) strong
            culture , which we use as a proxy for firm culture. We find substantial evidence that
            punishment effectiveness is aggravated by firm reputation, governance, and political
            connectedness. Next, we investigate the impact of government subsidies on corporate
            financial strategies, focusing on payout policies, debt reduction, and asset management.
            Utilizing a comprehensive dataset and employing methods to address endogeneity, we
            provide evidence that firms significantly alter their financial behaviors following
            the receipt of government subsidies. Specifically, we find evidence that firms increase
            payouts to shareholders, predominantly through share repurchases, after receiving
            subsidies. This behavior underscores a preference for returning value to shareholders
            when external financing conditions are favorable. We further observe a shift towards
            debt reduction, indicating a concerted effort to optimize capital structure and reduce
            financial risk. Contrary to initial hypotheses, the anticipated increase in asset
            investments is not sustained when endogeneity concerns are addressed, suggesting that
            the immediate response to subsidies does not translate into long-term asset growth.
            Further, our analysis identifies distinct shifts in firm behavior in theaftermath
            of significant economic events, during the dot-com bubble burst and the 2007 financial
            crisis. These periods reflect a change in how firms allocate subsidized resources,
            highlighting the influence of economic context on corporate financial decisions. This
            paper notes that while firms react strongly to both negative and positive shocks from
            the government, the reaction by firms to negative government shocks are broader.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This paper explores modern Bosniak, Serbian, and Bulgarian oral-traditional epic,
            three closely related Balkan cultures and traditions linked through cross-border exchange
            and commonality of experience within the Ottoman ecumene. The dominant gender code
            for men in these borderland societies of the early modern Balkans was epic masculinity,
            as illustrated in heroic songs (BCS junacke pjesme and Bulgarian junaški pesni.) Through
            my reading of these heroic songs, I identify a perplexing, submerged theme—feminine
            roles that scold, censure, and punish failures in epic masculinity. I argue that,
            ultimately, these expressions of scolding, mocking, vulgarity, and curses serve as
            a mechanism to maintain and reinforce epic masculinity. Moreover, this study proposes
            that this function may be an extension of women's child rearing role. Through examination
            of these female roles and their expressions in heroic epic and non-heroic epic, this
            study seeks to recover aspects of epic femininity in oral-traditional narrative song
            and hypothesize as to women's gender roles in their heroic Slavic borderland communities
            of the Balkans.</p>

            about these works is more readily available than those composed by underrepresented
            composers. Despite this, there is a plethora of works written by underrepresented

            provides detailed information about selected repertoire for unaccompanied horn composed
            by women, black, brown, indigenous, Asian (BBIA), and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender,
            queer, plus (LGBTQ+) composers. Reference note cards provide information a performer
            would need to consider when searching for repertoire to program, such as the difficulty
            of the work, what equipment is needed, the setting of the work, and the background
            of the composer. Three pieces of varying difficulty from those provided in this treatise
            are further explored through interviews with the composers and a structural analysis.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The Phanerozoic is typically known as an interval in which complex life has developed
            and thrived. However, there are multiple instances throughout this era in which climatic
            shifts and extinctions have made it difficult for the development of life. One of
            the most notable factors affecting marine biota throughout the Phanerozoic is the
            presence (or lack thereof) of oxygen; thus, better constraining the redox conditions
            of the ocean is vital during intervals of rapid change. One means to do this is through
            the development and improvement of novel and useful redox proxies, such as thallium
            (Tl) isotopes. Using marine sediments off the coasts of California, Mexico, and Peru,
            various low oxygen conditions were analyzed for Tl isotopes to expand settings known
            to record seawater values. This work expanded previous studies that failed to look
            into more suboxic settings and showed that the most accurate seawater records can
            be found in anoxic environments with elevated sulfide content in pore waters, with
            other less reducing conditions showing a range of values between seawater and sources.
            Applying this proxy to the end-Permian mass event (EPME), there are notable shifts
            in Tl isotopes. Not only was there a visible change towards more anoxic conditions
            earlier than other proxies can determine, but there was also a sudden rapid negative
            excursion that indicated short-term oxygenation at the onset of the extinction interval,
            contributing to the massive loss of life through rapid redox fluctuations. Continuing
            this work to the next minor extinction event chronologically, the Smithian-Spathian
            extinction provides a persistence of the low-oxygen conditions that was present at
            the very beginning of the Triassic following the EPME as well as transient redox fluctuations
            at the extinction interval. Lastly, to better constrain these anoxic events, a model
            of oxygen across Oceanic Anoxic Event 2 and the Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event was
            applied. Using these well-studied events, a model comparing excessive oxygen production
            from burial of organic carbon and pyrite sulfur to large igneous province erupted
            reductants was created, the results of which showed a large influx of reductants is
            capable of balancing much of the excess oxygen that should be produced during anoxic

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Infrastructure systems are the backbone of modern civilization, supporting our cities,
            economies, and way of life. Yet, they do not exist in isolation. They are continually
            influenced by a multitude of external social, economic, and environmental factors.
            These impacts may affect the structure of the built environment over time (i.e., through
            the evolutionary process) or the interplays between and within subsystems, thus causing
            emergent behaviors. In anticipation of the immense complexity of the built environment
            and the diversity of the influential factors, the major research challenge is finding
            an approach that yields engineering solutions to understand how, when, and why the
            evolutionary and emergent behavior of a system occurs. Answering such questions is
            the first step toward developing adaptive, preventive, or corrective plans and programs
            to enhance infrastructure resilience to external dynamics. This research proposes
            a framework to facilitate understanding the impact mechanisms of the external factors
            causing infrastructure evolution. Such knowledge is necessary to determine how a behavior
            evolves throughout a system. Given the diversity of the factors affecting the infrastructure
            system, an overwhelming amount of information needs to be continuously monitored and
            analyzed to comprehend the changing nature of the built environment. To address these
            challenges, the proposed framework uses multivariate analysis methods to identify
            and detect the most influential external factors driving the behaviors of the built
            environment system of systems. Dynamic factor models are developed to construct a
            composite index framework that (1) monitors and analyzes large volumes of information
            from numerous external factors impacting the system, (2) detects changes in the trends
            of the influential factors, and identifies how these changes originated within the
            system, and (3) analyzes how the internal system dynamics are influenced by external
            impacts.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The purpose of this research project is to provide insight into 3D GM methods in regard
            to lithic artifact research and provide data that allows a better understanding of
            the variables that affect a 3D GM study and the importance of the third dimension
            when investigating adzes. Geometric Morphometrics (GM) quantifies the shape variation
            of objects while controlling for variables such as scale, size, translation, and rotation
            then utilizes multivariate statistics to identify trends in the data. GM maintains
            the shape of an object more than traditional linear measurements so that morphological
            comparisons can be more comprehensive than traditional linear measurements. Most of
            the archaeological studies that utilize GM in American archaeology focus on skeletal
            remains and bifacial lithic points. While 3D GM analyses of skeletal remains are often
            employed, the lithic analyses have largely been restricted to 2D analyses for reasons
            that will be covered in this thesis. Because there are not many 3D studies on lithic
            tools, a portion of this research will be dedicated to refining 3D GM digitization
            and model construction of thick lithic tools in an effort to help standardize 3D GM
            analysis so that the comparisons of different research projects are more robust and
            error introduction is better understood. The results of this analysis provided ways
            to increase the efficiency of 3D GM studies and indicated that the third dimension
            accounted for a majority of the variation present in adze morphology, suggesting that
            a 2D analysis would be insufficient to understand the morphological trends found within
            this tool type. These methods were also used to analyze a sample of adzes from three
            different sites as well as an assemblage with unknown provenience. When adze morphology
            was compared to the site locations, regional trends were able to be identified.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>ADHD is a behavioral cognitive correlate of achievement associated with lower reading
            performance. The externalizing and internalizing symptoms that characterize ADHD behaviors
            negatively impact the engagement of students experiencing reading difficulties and
            the ability to regulate attention and behavior during the reading acquisition process.
            There is also considerable comorbidity between ADHD and reading-related learning disabilities
            driven by genetic and environmental pathways. This poses challenges for interventions
            (i.e., an environmental factor) containing reading instruction designed to improve
            the reading performance of children who may be exhibiting ADHD behaviors. This study
            examined the associations between ADHD behaviors and response to reading instruction,
            using a diverse sample of at-risk kindergarten and first-grade children (N = 715)
            across 67 classrooms who participated in a randomized control trial evaluating the
            Individualized Student Instruction (ISI) reading intervention. A structural equation
            modeling approach assessed teacher-rated ADHD behaviors predicting response to instruction
            across several teacher-implemented instructional reading approaches (ISI vs. BAU).
            Qualitative differences in the associations based on the operationalization of ADHD
            behaviors (i.e., inattention, hyperactivity-impulsivity, and combined) were examined.
            Exploratory analyses were performed to examine whether the association between ADHD
            behaviors and children's response to reading instruction significantly differed by
            instructional group. Several subscales of the SWAN Rating scale measured ADHD behaviors.
            Response to instruction was based on residual gain scores in reading-related skills
            measured as a composite of decoding and expressive vocabulary skills from subtests
            of the Woodcock-Johnson III Tests of Achievement. A statistically significant negative
            relation was found between the ADHD behaviors and response to instruction. Higher
            teacher-rated ADHD behaviors predicted lower SDs in response to reading instruction.
            Qualitatively, the combined ADHD behaviors produced the strongest association and
            explained the most variance than the other ADHD behaviors. Exploratory analyses suggested
            that there were significant instructional group differences for inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity
            but not the combined ADHD behaviors. The multiple-group models favored the ISI group.
            ADHD behaviors and response to instruction were more strongly related to lower responsiveness
            to instruction in the BAU group compared to ISI. This study highlights the role of
            distinct ADHD behaviors in early reading-related skills in response to reading instruction.
            These preliminary analyses have implications for classroom-based reading instructional
            practices and empirically replicating evidence to understand the influence of ADHD
            behaviors on efforts to remediate poor reading in children.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The destruction of vast tropical forests poses a threat to both globally significant
            biodiversity and carbon storage. Tropical deforestation and degradation are complex
            phenomena driven by a combination of proximate causes, such as agricultural expansion,
            wood extraction, infrastructure development, and biophysical conditions, as well as
            broader underlying drivers, including economic, demographic, technological, and cultural
            factors. Here we present a comprehensive synthesis of case-based studies (n = 199)
            that identified proximate causes and/or underlying drivers of tropical deforestation
            or degradation, and quantified forest cover loss. Latin America emerged as the most
            frequently studied region, accounting for 42.2% of all cases. Agriculture stood out
            as the most commonly identified proximate cause of deforestation across all regions,
            constituting 84.9% of cases and was frequently identified in conjunction with other
            proximate causes. While recent research has emphasized the role of agricultural expansion
            as a prominent contributor to tropical forest cover change, we show that agricultural
            expansion rarely occurs in isolation. Biophysical factors, such as droughts, wildfires,
            and pest outbreaks, also played a significant role in forest cover loss in all regions.
            Rates of forest cover loss associated with different proximate causes did not appear
            to differ. We further examined the ability of common satellite vegetation indices
            of "greenness", the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced
            Vegetation Index (EVI), to capture changes in tropical deforestation or degradation
            after forest cover loss was detected in primary studies. We found that these indices
            failed to show reduced greenness after forest cover loss was identified. In some cases,
            these indices showed increased greenness, presumably owing to conversion to intensive
            commercial agriculture. It appears that only in cases of complete vegetation loss
            from infrastructure projects such as forest conversion to roads or buildings, did
            NDVI and EVI decrease after forest cover loss was detected. Our results suggest that
            strategies for the prevention and mitigation of tropical forest cover loss should
            not only consider the role of agricultural expansion but also how agriculture interacts
            with other proximate causes. Furthermore, the vulnerability of these forests to environmental
            stressors is important to consider given the prominent role of biophysical factors
            in forest cover loss. Lastly, although NDVI and EVI are widely used in large-scale
            analysis of vegetation change, they appear to capture only the near-complete loss
            of vegetation and may be insufficient to detect other ecological impacts of tropical
            forest cover change.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The photophysical and photochemical properties and the photoconversion scope and mechanism
            of di- and triaryl-substituted-1,2,3-triazoles are reported in this work. The ease
            of synthesis of regioisomers of substituted triazoles enables a systematic study on
            the correlation between regiochemistry and excited state properties, which include
            the solvent dependence of fluorescence, energy gap between singlet and triplet emitters,
            and propensity to photon-triggered transformations. Triazoles that carry electron
            (e)-donor and e-acceptor aryl substituents show high fluorescence quantum yields in
            weakly polar solvents and exhibit solvent-dependent fluorescence. The luminescence
            properties of these compounds in glass matrices at 77 K and the thermal and photo-stability
            of these compounds are determined. The position of the e-donor substituent has a significant
            impact on the fluorescence emission energy and solvent sensitivity, singlet-triplet
            energy gap, and photochemical reactivity and stability. Quantum chemical calculations
            were used to explain the experimental observations on the structural correlation with
            the photophysical and photochemical properties. The photochemical reactivity in the
            triazole conversion to indole was leveraged to study the reaction mechanism and intermediates
            (carbene and azirine). A new method for the synthesis of 5-cyanotriazoles was developed
            to expand the scope of the photoconversion of triazoles into indoles.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Understanding how a single genome can produce drastically different phenotypes is
            a central themein evolutionary biology. It requires a keen understanding of the ecological,
            molecular, and genomic regulatory mechanisms driving phenotypic, often adaptive variation.
            As complex traits with clear fitness implications and well-defined genotype-phenotype
            maps, venoms represent practical systems for evaluating the interplay between phenotypic
            change and genetic regulation. In addition, as approximately 15% of all animals are
            venomous, studying venomous animals will likely have wide- ranging impacts for the
            ecosystems in which they inhabit. Furthermore, the tendency for venom proteins to
            target specific physiological systems and pathways makes them excellent resources
            for bioprospecting novel therapeutic compounds. However, most research on venom has
            focused on snakes, which only represent a small proportion of venomous animals. Conversely,
            invertebrates, which represent a disproportionately large number of venomous animals,
            have historically received a disproportionately low level of research attention. Although
            not as charismatic as their reptilian counterparts, research on venomous invertebrates
            benefits from lower regulatory pressures, often trivial sampling methods, reduced
            maintenance effort and cost, and significantly diminished safety risks. For this research
            in this doctoral dissertation, we use scorpions and centipedes to evaluate the molecular
            and genomic regulatory mechanisms underlying the evolution of invertebrate venoms
            and make the case for a scorpion as model species. In Chapter 1, we begin our work
            at the ecological by assessing rates of venom regeneration in one scorpion and one
            centipede species. As biochemical traits with clear fitness consequences, venoms serve
            a critical ecological role for the animals that produce them. Understanding how venoms
            are maintained and regenerated after use will, therefore, provide valuable insight
            into the ecology of venomous animals. Furthermore, most studies on venomous organisms
            often require removing animals from the wild and waiting extended periods of time
            between venom extractions. Uncovering the patterns of venom regeneration across different
            species will likely lead to the development of more efficient venom extraction protocols,
            reducing both experimental time and the number of animals required. Using reversed-phase
            high-performance liquid chromatography, we identified asynchronous regeneration of
            venom protein component abundances in the centipede Scolopendra viridis but found
            no evidence for asynchronous venom regeneration in the scorpion Centruroides hentzi.
            We also observed high levels of intraspecific venom variation in C. hentzi, emphasizing
            the importance of testing for intraspecific venom variation in studies evaluating
            the synchronicity of venom regeneration. Although the regeneration of relative venom
            protein component abundances is an asynchronous process in S. viridis, we provide
            evidence that the presence-absence of major venom components is not an asynchronous
            process and suggest that studies relying on just the presence/absence of individual
            proteins (e.g. bioprospecting, drug discovery) could use catch-and- release methods
            of venom extraction to reduce the number of animals removed from the wild. In Chapter
            2, we leverage high-throughput sequencing technologies to evaluate the genetic ba-
            sis for sex-biased gene expression in centipede. Sexually dimorphic traits are widespread
            across metazoans and are often the result of sex-specific inheritance or sex-based
            differences in gene ex- pression. Intersexual differences have even been observed
            in invertebrate venoms, although the identification of these differences has been
            limited to the more well-studied groups, such as scor- pions and spiders, where sex-based
            differences in morphology and behavior are apparent. Recent studies on centipede venom
            have identified evidence of intraspecific variation, but intersexual dif- ferences
            have not been reported. To investigate the potential for sex-based differences in
            centipede venom composition, we performed reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography
            (RP- HPLC) analyses on five male and 15 female eastern bark centipedes (Hemiscolopendra
            marginata) from the Apalachicola National Forest in northern Florida. After detecting
            a significant sex-based difference in H. marginata venom composition, we completed
            a high-throughput venom-gland tran- scriptomic and venom proteomic analysis of one
            male and one female to determine the genetic basis for differences in venom composition.
            We identified 47 proteomically confirmed toxins and 717 nontoxin transcripts in H.
            marginata venom-glands. Of these proteomically confirmed toxins, the most abundantly
            expressed in the male venom included ion channel-modulating toxins and toxins so divergent
            from any characterized homologs that they could not be given a functional classification,
            whereas the most abundantly expressed in the female venom were γ-glutamyl transferases
            and CAPs (cysteine-rich secretory proteins, antigen 5, and pathogenesis-related 1
            proteins). These differences were then confirmed by performing replicate LC-MS/MS
            analyses on the venom from an additional three male and three female H. marginata.
            Our RP-HPLC and high-throughput transcriptomic and proteomic approach resulted in
            not only an in-depth characterization of H. marginata venom, but represents the first
            example of sex-based variation in centipede venoms. In Chapter 3, we shift towards
            improving our understanding of scorpion venom protein diver- sity by characterizing
            the venom from one species of an underrepresented genus. Scorpion venoms have long
            been studied for their peptide discovery potential, with modern high-throughput venom-
            characterization techniques paving the way for the discovery of thousands of novel
            putative toxins. Research into these toxins has provided insight into the pathology
            and treatment of human diseases, even resulting in the development of one compound
            with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. Although most of this research has
            focused on the toxins of scorpion species considered medically significant to humans,
            the venom of harmless scorpion species possess toxins that are homologous to those
            from medically significant species, indicating that harmless scorpion venoms may also
            serve as valuable sources of novel peptide variants. Furthermore, as harmless scorpions
            represent a vast majority of scorpion species diversity, and therefore venom toxin
            diversity, venoms from these species likely contain entirely new toxin classes. We
            sequenced the venom-gland tran- scriptome and venom proteome of two male Big Bend
            scorpions (Diplocentrus whitei), providing the first high-throughput venom characterization
            for a member of this genus. We identified a total of 82 toxins in the venom of D.
            whitei, 25 of which were identified in both the transcriptome and proteome, and 57
            of which were only identified in the transcriptome. Furthermore, we identified a unique,
            enzyme-rich venom dominated by serine proteases and the first arylsulfatase B toxins
            identified in scorpions. In Chapter 4, we evaluate the molecular signatures of selection
            underlying the evolution of giant desert hairy scorpion venoms. Venoms are primarily
            believed to evolve under strong diversifying selection resulting from persistent coevolution
            between predator and prey. Recent research has challenged this hypothesis, proposing
            that venoms from younger venomous lineages (e.g., snakes and cone snails) are governed
            predominantly by diversifying selection, while venoms from older venomous lineages
            (e.g., centipedes, scorpions, and spiders) are under stronger purifying selection.
            However, most research in older lineages has tested selection at more diverse phylogenetic
            scales. Al- though these tests are important for evaluating broad macroevolutionary
            trends underlying venom evolution, they are less equipped to detect species-level
            evolutionary trends, which likely have large impacts on venom variation seen at more
            diverse phylogenetic scales. To test for selection among closely related species from
            an older venomous lineage, we generated high-throughput venom-gland transcriptomes
            and venom proteomes for four populations of Giant Desert Hairy Scorpions (Hadru- rus),
            including three Hadrurus arizonensis populations and one Hadrurus spadix population.
            We detected significant episodic and pervasive diversifying selection across a highly
            abundant toxin family that likely has a major role in venom function (αKTxs), providing
            a contrast to the stronger purifying selection identified from other studies on scorpion
            venoms. Conversely, we detected weak episodic diversifying and/or stronger purifying
            selection in four toxin families (non-disulfide bridged peptides, phospholipase A2s,
            scorpine-like antimicrobial peptides, and serine proteases), most of which were less
            abundant and likely have ancillary functional roles. Finally, although we detected
            several major toxin families at disproportionate transcriptomic and/or proteomic abundances,
            we did not identify significant sex-based variation in Hadrurus venoms. In Chapter
            5, we broaden our focus to not only test for sex-biased venom genes in a sexually
            di- morphic scorpion, but also evaluate the genomic and epigenomic landscape underlying
            those venom genes. Unfortunately, while our knowledge of how phenotypic variation
            is influenced by changes in ecology, environment, gene number, and gene sequence is
            the result of work in a diverse set of systems, our understanding of complex, genomic
            regulatory networks stems primarily from research on human cells and model systems.
            Because studies in these systems are not typically paired with ecological experiments,
            much of the important context underlying the evolution of genomic regula- tory networks
            is missing. With the emergence of novel genomic methodologies and their continually
            increasing efficiency and decreasing costs, non-model systems, such as venoms, have
            become sen- sible, effective systems for studying how the epigenomic landscape influences
            variation in complex traits. However, as previously discussed, much of what we know
            about the genomic and epigenomic landscape underlying venom genes is the result of
            studies in venomous snakes. In most venomous taxa, venom genes are primarily organized
            into large tandem arrays of duplicated genes on a subset of chromosomes, with few
            exceptions. Generating a comprehensive understanding of the genomic landscape of venomous
            systems requires the generation of high quality reference genomes for mem- bers of
            all venomous lineages. Therefore, to resolve the genomic architecture for scorpion
            venom genes, we assembled the first chromosome-level genome for the Hentz striped
            scorpion (Centruroides hentzi). We also tested for sex-based differences in (1) differential
            expression of venom genes with RNA-seq, (2) differential chromatin accessibility using
            Cleavage Under Targeted Accessible Chro- matin (CUTAC), (3) differential H3K27ac histone
            modification using Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation (CUT&amp;Tag), and (4) diet
            using PCR detection of arthropod-specific cytochrome c oxidase I genes. With this
            multifaceted approach, we not only provide a broad perspective of the ecological and
            genomic regulatory mechanisms underlying the evolution of scorpion venom genes, but
            make the case for C. hentzi as a model system.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This work was designed to provide insight into how a disaster of historical proportions,
            in this case the COVID pandemic, influenced the work foreign language (L2) teachers
            in an English as a foreign language (EFL) setting. The research was situated within
            the framework of positive psychology (Seligman, 2011), with the investigation of the
            interactions of hope, metacognition, and teaching practices. In this work, Hope was
            understood to be a cognitive construct that refers to setting goals, finding pathways
            to achieve those goals, and using agency to persevere in those paths or find alternative
            ones (Snyder, 2002, 2005, 2018). This research hypothesized that the levels of hope
            experienced by L2 teachers were connected with other events in the classroom. The
            questions addressed in this research include the following: 1. What is the relationship
            between hope, metacognition, and foreign language teachers' practice during a period
            of intense global difficulty? 2. Is L2 teacher metacognition a mediating variable
            between hope and teacher practices? 3. What other aspects of L2 teacher hope, L2 teacher
            metacognition, and L2 teacher practices can be identified through teachers' reports
            of their teaching experiences during a period of intense global difficulty? Within
            an explanatory sequential mixed methods design, and using Likert surveys and interviews,
            I examined whether the levels of teacher hope, teacher metacognition and teacher practices
            were associated. The instruments used in in this research were the dispositional hope
            scale (DHS) (Snyder et al., 1991), the Language Teacher Metacognitive Inventory (LTMI)
            (Hiver et al., 2021; Jiang et al., 2016), and the Postsecondary Instructional Practices
            Survey (PIPS) (Walter et al., 2016). Interviews were conducted to provide complementary
            evidence of teacher hope levels, metacognition, and teacher practices of English as
            a Foreign Language (EFL) teachers during COVID-19. The High Leverage Teaching practices
            proposed by Glisan and Donato (2017) complemented the interview in regard to teacher
            practices as they supplement the 10 macrostrategies introduced by Kumaravadivelu (2006).
            The research questions were analyzed following a factorial confirmative approach,
            in which the components of each of the surveys were used to build the constructs they
            represent, and hypothesis were tested on them. This analysis included an exploratory
            factor analysis to examine internal reliability and a subsequent confirmatory factor
            analysis to do the actual testing of the underlying factor structure existence. Afterwards,
            the mediation analysis was achieved by fitting a SEM model and contrast the pathways
            among L2 teacher, hope, L2 teacher metacognition, and L2 teacher practices. Teacher
            interviews complemented the quantitative results, as four the four themes that emerged
            from the qualitative analysis (i.e., Foreign language teacher goals and pathway thinking,
            Foreign Language Teachers' Coping Strategies, Teachers' Metacognitive Classroom Experience,
            and Interaction in the Foreign Language Class) provided additional insights from participating
            teachers. Structural equation modeling suggested that L2 teacher metacognition is
            a significant mediator of the relationship structure between hope and instructional
            practices for the population under study. These findings speak to a connection between
            teacher hope, teacher metacognition, and teacher practices for L2 teachers during
            a period of social upheaval, something that can pave the way for other researchers
            working with teachers in different disciplines and during different periods of time.
            An important conclusion from this study was that understanding these constructs separately,
            their components and their connection may influence how teachers think about their
            profession with a view of improving of what they do in the classroom. Finally, tertiary
            teacher preparation institutions may be encouraged to measure these constructs in
            order to target interventions to influence how teachers think about their profession
            with a view of improvement. Keywords: teacher hope, teacher metacognition, teacher

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The Battery State of Charge (SOC) is the parameter representing the fraction of a
            battery's remaining available energy to its fully charged state. The Battery SOC is
            one of the most important parameters of an electric vehicle's (EV) Battery Management
            System (BMS) as it is used for battery pack balancing, estimating available power,
            battery safety control, and providing users with available runtime. Electric Vehicle
            mostly uses lithium-ion battery because of its high energy density which comes with
            a cost of complex non-linear dynamic system. Lithium-ion batteries are susceptible
            to over-charging and undercharging because of their inherent properties. Their dynamic
            properties also tend to change with ambient temperature, operating current, SOC, and
            operating voltage. Hence requires a complex Battery Management System (BMS) to effectively
            manage the dynamic parameters. SOC is one of the most important intermediate parameters
            required for effective EV battery management. In addition, the life cycle of lithium-ion
            batteries is also a function of its operating SOC. Unfortunately, EV battery SOC cannot
            be measured directly due to lack of parameter linearly proportional to its available
            energy. Hence it requires complex estimation algorithms to achieve an accurate SOC
            estimate. It is often the case that conventional EV SOC management system over-compensates
            the SOC error estimates at the cost of usable energy. Another common challenge with
            conventional algorithms is their inability to reconverge quickly from erroneous initialization.
            Quick convergence and fast SOC estimation algorithm is also required in EV for fast
            charging. This research proposes a novel ensemble algorithm that uses a weighted estimate
            of the Central Difference Kalman Filter (CDKF) and Nonlinear Autoregressive with Exogenous
            Input (NARX) to estimate SOC. The proposed method improves the accuracy of SOC estimates
            in comparison to convention ensemble SOC estimation methods especially at low temperature.
            The method introduces an SOC estimation technique which converges quickly from large
            erroneous initialization state, this is particularly useful in super-fast EV charging
            technology. Finally, the proposed method provides robust and reliable SOC estimates.
            The robustness of the proposed method is tested under various drive cycles and temperatures.
            The estimator provides a reliability indicator in the form of a convergence covariance
            which indicates how close the estimate is to the true value.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>In the theory of wave propagation, several important nonlinear dispersive systems
            are known to be integrable – that is, exactly solvable by linear techniques. Such
            systems are typically characterized by the existence of an infinite number of conserved
            quantities, a Hamiltonian structure, the admittance of soliton solutions, and many
            other rich mathematical properties. The primary focus of this thesis is a study of
            integrable systems that are nonlocal in the sense that they possess a reflected and
            shifted spatial and/or temporal argument. Chapter 1 serves as an informal overview
            of the field of integrable partial differential equations and an introduction to this
            nonlocal variety. Chapter 2 provides a detailed analysis of the solution process,
            known as the inverse scattering transform (IST) method, for several examples of nonlocal
            integrable systems. The IST is developed and solutions are constructed for nonlocal
            variants of the nonlinear Schr ̈odinger (NLS) equation, the modified Korteweg-de Vries
            (mKdV) equation, and the semi-discrete Ablowitz-Ladik (AL) lattice. The secondary
            subject of this thesis is beam propagation in non-Hermitian optical media. In this
            context, non-Hermiticity refers to the presence of a complex-valued index of refraction,
            where the imaginary part is interpreted as a distribution of gain and loss of power
            (which in this case in not conserved). Such systems have been shown (theoretically
            and experimentally) to possess many counter-intuitive properties, one of which is
            the existence of constant-intensity (CI) waves that can propagate through the medium
            without diffracting. In Chapter 3, special types of these CI waves are introduced
            and their properties and further implications, including their usefulness in the study
            of dispersive hydrodynamics in non-Hermitian media, are discussed. These two topics
            are unified by the fact that they both center around NLS-type models in which certain
            fundamental properties such as conservation of power and translational invariance
            are lost. In the latter case, this is due to a complex external potential, while in
            the former case this is due to a nonlocal self-induced potential.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The poems in No More Games explore the cyclical and complex relations of religion,
            loss of faith, newly found love, immigration, the female body, and the Anthropocene
            in a linguistically hybrid landscape. These poems track the internal and the external
            world of a speaker who has immigrated from Turkey to America at a young age, as the
            geographical landscape in which the poems are set vary from Turkey to Kyrgyzstan to
            America. While influenced by contemporary poets, the manuscript aims at shedding light
            onto an encounter that is rarely highlighted in contemporary American poetry: the
            loss of religion, specifically Islam, in a particularly Islamophobic American sphere
            and the complications that may occur from such an encounter. The speaker of the poems
            is concerned with similar tensions, including the impending climate crisis, the metamorphoses
            of cultural identity as a Turkish-American, and the effects of violence upon the female
            body inflicted by a patriarchal figure. These tensions are navigated by the words
            of Gloria Anzaldúa in Borderlands/La Frontera, when she writes "I feel perfectly free
            to rebel and to rail against my culture" (43). She adds to this phrase by stating
            "Yet in leaving home I did not lose touch with my origins because lo mexicano is in
            my system. I am a turtle, wherever I go I carry "home" on my back" (43). This idea
            becomes the compass for No More Games, as the speaker in the poems both rebels and
            is loyal to the roots which haunt the self, whether those roots are Islam, the patriarchal
            aspects of Turkish and American culture, or recording the collective cry of an aging
            world while immersed in love.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This dissertation delves into the factors that motivate business students to enroll
            in internship courses at Florida State University's College of Business, as well as
            the satisfaction they experience with these internships. Using a quantitative approach
            rooted in Self-Determination Theory, the study utilizes the Academic Motivation Scale
            (AMS) (Vallerand et al., 1993) and the Instructional Materials Motivation Scale (IMMS)
            (Reference) to determine students' intrinsic and extrinsic motivations and their satisfaction
            with internship experiences. The research provides an understanding of how internships
            align with students' educational and professional goals, highlighting the role of
            academic curricula and external influences in shaping their decisions. Findings indicate
            the dominance of extrinsic motivations, particularly identified regulation, over intrinsic
            factors. While participants expressed moderate intrinsic motivation, emphasizing the
            "To Experience Stimulation" regulatory style, satisfaction levels, measured by the
            IMMS, revealed a moderate trend. Higher satisfaction correlated with the successful
            completion of course modules and engagement in a well-designed course. Robust correlations
            between intrinsic motivations and satisfaction underscored the significance of autonomy.
            Notably, identified regulation within extrinsic motivations significantly correlated
            with satisfaction, particularly concerning career decision-making. The findings have
            implications for developing internship programs, emphasizing the importance of aligning
            these programs with students' career aspirations and ensuring that they offer meaningful,
            practical learning experiences.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Fates of Man, a series of four polychrome wooden sculptures attributed to Indigenous
            artist Manuel "Caspicara" Chili, made in Quito, Ecuador in c. 1775, stands as one
            of the primary examples of the artwork produced by the Quito school. Characterized
            by their emotionality, the four figures represent the iconographical program of The
            Last Things, a Catholic visual convention demonstrating the four endings that await
            the soul once the material body has passed on, including Death, Soul in Heaven, Soul
            in Hell, and Soul in Purgatory. By considering this group within the complex and ever-changing
            historical landscape of the colonial Andes, the figure of the skeleton takes on a
            broad multivalent meaning. Through the examination of the skeleton within the European
            and Andean iconographic canons, the figure of Death in Caspicara's devotional program
            becomes a means of thinking about the complex worldviews of the eighteenth-century
            Andes that informed the various viewer perceptions of Catholic imagery in the region.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>As governments and other organizations worldwide increase their investment in research,
            the demand for skilled research administrators grows. Researchers need knowledgeable
            administrators to provide guidance and ensure their projects are administratively
            managed according to required policies and guidelines. Institutions must ensure their
            audit risk is managed appropriately without creating unnecessary burdens and hardships
            for their researchers. With a lack of academic programs in research administration,
            most research administration professionals enter the field with limited to no understanding
            of research administration. The need for research administration training programs
            is high. To address Florida State University's (FSU) needs in this area, the Office
            of the Vice President for Research (OVPR) staff developed and implemented a research
            administration certification program. All FSU research administrators must complete
            the eSPEAR Research Administration Certification Program within six months of starting
            their position.Florida State University (FSU) has invested staff time and other resources
            into developing and delivering this program. FSU wishes to evaluate the value provided
            to FSU's research community by eSPEAR and identify where changes or expansion would
            bring value. While FSU's OVPR requests feedback from participants following the training,
            this provides only a snapshot of the learner's experience immediately following the
            completion of the program. No industry-accepted method for evaluating research administration
            training programs exists. Kirkpatrick's Four Levels of Evaluation, which looks at
            learner satisfaction, learning, behavior, and return on expectations, provides a model
            that could potentially fill this void. This study uses Kirkpatrick's Four Levels of
            Evaluation to evaluate FSU's eSPEAR Program. Information was gathered from learners
            who completed the training, their supervisors, the researchers they support, those
            involved in developing eSPEAR, and members of FSU's Council of Associate Deans for
            Research (CADR). Overall, favorable feedback was received from learners and their
            supervisors. The response rate from researchers, CADR members, and those involved
            in developing eSPEAR was lower. Their responses were broad, with some highly favorable
            and others unfavorable. Many respondents answered with neutral answers, mainly due
            to their lack of direct knowledge. The study results provided insights into what works
            well with the program and where additional content, or further training development
            is needed.</p>

            University (Harvard) decision-makers perceive the exchange that occurs through their
            partnership. Since the majority of nonprofit theaters in the United States struggle
            with sustainability (Fonner et al., 2020), and affiliations support sustainable operations
            for nonprofits (Álvarez-González, 2017; Mandel &amp; Brudney, 2018; Shumate, 2018; Sowa,

            theory (Burgess et al., 1979; Homans, 1958) as a theoretical framework. Pragmatism
            (Dewey, 1948; James, 1928) as a philosophical worldview informed the study. This case
            study explores three research questions: (1) What do Harvard and ART decision-makers
            perceive that each entity gives through the exchange? (2) What do Harvard and ART
            decision-makers perceive each entity gets from the exchange? and (3) What is each
            entity's level of relationship commitment and propensity to leave the affiliation?
            Jeong and Oh's (2017) business-to-business social exchange model served as a framework
            for answering research question three. This case study used content analysis (Schreier
            et al., 2019) and interviews (McGrath et al., 2019) to collect data and coding (Strauss
            &amp; Corbin, 1990) to analyze the data. To enhance the study's trustworthiness, member
            checking (Birt et al., 2016) served as a form of structural corroboration (Eisner,
            1991). Through the findings I identified three ways that decision-makers perceive
            what each entity gives and gets through the partnership, (1) resource-driven exchange,
            which includes a give from one organization's resources and a clear get for the other
            organization; (2) byproduct benefits, which are benefits received by one entity as
            a result of the partnership but not definitively tied to the resources of their partner,
            and (3) synergy, which occurs when the partners work together with their resources
            on a single artistic output. The results show that through resource-driven exchange
            ART gives, and Harvard gets: educational support for Harvard's Theater, Dance &amp; Media
            concentration; internship and mentorship for students; facility operations; and Harvard
            events produced by ART, and that Harvard gives and ART gets: use of performance, rehearsal,
            office, and set construction space; financial support; and support for information
            technology, legal, and human resources. As a result of the partnership, ART receives
            the byproduct benefits of: reputational benefits by association with Harvard; increased
            audience development opportunities due to the geographic area they operate in; enhanced
            access to donors who otherwise may not support a nonprofit theater. Likewise, as a
            byproduct of the partnership, Harvard gets: reputational benefits relative to the
            arts, locally, nationally, and internationally; engagement opportunities for local
            community members to access Harvard; the arts more infused in the cognitive life of
            Harvard; opportunities for interdepartmental connections through the arts in an otherwise
            decentralized institution. Through a synergetic collaboration, the partners develop
            new works of theater. ART staff and Harvard researchers each provide their expertise
            to develop well-informed and impactful pieces of art. Through the co-creations ART
            gets access to in-depth expert research, and Harvard researcher get an artistic platform
            to share their research with a broad community. Examples of this include the new musical
            We Live in Cairo, and Ocean Filibuster. The partners exhibited a high level of relationship
            commitment and a low level of propensity to leave the partnership based on Jeong and
            Oh's (2017) model. Decision-makers used the partners' collaboration of a new $100,000,000
            arts center that will house ART as evidence of relationship commitment. Participants
            described high levels of trust between those at ART and Harvard. The decision-makers
            shared that Harvard's policies and bureaucracy created the only challenges. This dissertation
            includes several conclusions, and recommendations for practitioners and future research
            relative to nonprofit arts organization and HEI partnerships based on the study. In
            the ART and Harvard partnership, ART receives more impactful resource-driven benefits
            than byproduct benefits, and Harvard receives more impactful byproduct benefits than
            resource-driven benefits. Recommendations for practitioners include: seek to understand
            what their organization could give and get through a partnership; identify possible
            the motivations a partnered, or potentially partnered organization; and, for decision-makers
            in nonprofit arts organizations, consider how integrated their organization should
            be with an HEI – the more integrated they are, the greater the potential resources
            but the more they must work with the often-bureaucratic structures of an HEI.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The purpose of this treatise is to survey eight of the Ten Fanfares by Ten Composers
            for Brass and Percussion commissioned by Maestro Eugene Goossens and the Cincinnati
            Symphony for performance use throughout the 1942-43 season. Eighteen composers responded
            with fanfares for different combinations of instruments. Ten feature brass and percussion
            exclusively. Composers included in this commission consist of prominent figures such
            as Aaron Copland, Howard Hanson, Virgil Thompson, Paul Creston, among others. This
            treatise revitalizes the importance of these chamber works as an addition to the brass
            ensemble repertoire, the larger diaspora of twentieth century American music, and
            how the underlying connection(s) between musical performance and politics have cultural
            implications that shape and manifest various outlooks on citizens within a nation.In
            addition to exploring the historical and cultural context and legacy of these works,
            this document serves to invite greater discussion within arts organizations about
            the importance of programming lesser-known works for the sake of greater representation.
            These fanfares are less than a century old and many of these works have not seen a
            proper performance since their original premieres in the 1940s. The research and explanations
            in this treatise intend to bring greater exposure surrounding their purpose and effect
            in hopes of these fanfares utilized for performance into the twenty-first century.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Personality has been found to have significant connections to language. Ranging from
            impacting narrative style, to informing expectations about others based on linguistic
            factors such as accent, personality affects both language comprehension and production
            (Oberlander &amp; Gill, 2004; Van den Brink et al., 2012). However, research in this area
            primarily focuses on offline measures. Online measures, such as EEG or pupillometry,
            have not been included until recently. Pupillometry, which involves measuring the
            size of the pupil, is considered a reliable indicator of cognitive effort during language
            comprehension. Hubert-Lyall and Järvikivi are unique in their research studying the
            possible relationship between personality and online language comprehension due to
            their use of pupillometry (Hubert &amp; Järvikivi, 2019; Hubert-Lyall &amp; Järvikivi, 2021).
            They showed that several of the Big Five personality traits are related to the processing
            of errors during language comprehension. Unfortunately, theoretical explanations of
            the language-personality link are undeveloped. One theory, presented by Hubert and
            Järvikivi (2019) and Jiménes-Ortega et. al. (2022) posits that perhaps for Neuroticism,
            anxiety may be the connecting factor between personality traits and language comprehension.
            The current studies had two goals. First, we aimed to replicate the findings of Hubert-Lyall
            and Järvikivi (2021) using the same methodology but in a new population and culture.
            Second, we aimed to address a more specific hypothesis – does Anxiety, through its
            connection to Neuroticism, predict cognitive load in response to errors in sentences?
            Overall, we found mixed results. While we did not replicate the findings from Hubert-Lyall
            and Järvikivi (2021), nor did our results replicate from our own Experiment 1 to Experiment
            2, we did find possible support for the connection between anxiety and language processing.
            However, it does not seem as though anxiety alone can account for the Neuroticism
            x language comprehension connection.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>All-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) represent a promising advancement in electrochemical
            energy storage, with solid electrolytes (SEs) playing a crucial role. Sulfide and
            halide SEs have garnered substantial interest due to their distinct characteristics;
            sulfide SEs offer high ionic conductivity and stability with Li metal anodes, while
            halide SEs have better compatibility with high-voltage cathodes. This dissertation
            explores the structure-property relationship of mixed-anion frameworks in both sulfide-
            and halide-based SEs, aiming to fine-tune material structures and properties for enhanced
            battery performance.Firstly, we delve into the transformation of Li3PS4 via the introduction
            of LiBr. 31P NMR unveils the emergence of a glassy PS43− network interspersed with
            Br−. Solid-state NMR corroborates fast Li+ migration between PS43− and Br−, with increased
            Li+ mobility. A more than four-fold enhancement in ionic conductivity is observed
            upon LiBr incorporation (1.06 mS cm-1) into Li3PS4 (0.23 mS cm-1) resulting from the
            reduction of the energy barrier and transitioning Li+ transport dimensionality from
            2D to 3D. The compatibility of Li3PS4 with Li metal is improved alongside an increase
            in critical current density (CCD) from 0.34 mA cm-2 to 0.50 mA cm-2 while preserving
            the electrochemical stability window. ASSB cells with 3Li3PS4:LiBr as the SE and TiS2
            as the cathode active material (CAM) show robust high-rate and long-term cycling performance.
            Secondly, we incorporated LiBr and LiI simultaneously in Li3PS4 as a mixed-halide
            strategy. We achieve a two-fold increase in conductivity using a one-step ball milling
            technique. Subsequent low-temperature sintering further enhances conductivity to 4.43
            mS/cm with a low activation energy of 0.29 eV. Furthermore, we engineered a cell configuration
            with stable milled SE layers toward Li metal and a high-conductive sintered SE separator
            in the symmetric cell with which CCD further increases compared to individual separators.
            In addition to sulfide-based SEs, Li-deficient lithium yttrium bromide, Li3-xYBr6-x,
            was prepared using the co-melting method. High-resolution X-ray diffraction and Rietveld
            refinement confirm the formation of the monoclinic structure with the C2/m space group
            with increased cation site disorder and polyhedral volume. Bond valence site energy
            calculations show the Li+ migration energy barrier from Li-deficiency. Ab-initio molecular
            dynamics simulations show the emergence of 3D-Li+ conduction. Solid-state NMR spectroscopy
            confirms the elimination of LiBr impurities and reveals increased Li-ion dynamics.
            An ionic conductivity of 4.49 mS cm-1 and activation energy of 0.28 eV were achieved.
            Furthermore, we synthesized a series of Li2.73Ho1.09Cl6-xBrx compounds using a solid-state
            co-melting approach. Crystal structure analysis revealed the presence of Li-ions in
            2d octahedral sites of the C2/m space group for x ≥ 2. Analysis shows highly disordered
            cation sites with mixed occupancy of Li/Ho. 6Li solid-state NMR revealed a highly
            disordered local Li environment, which increases with Br/Cl substitution. The significant
            improvement in room-temperature ionic conductivity from 0.45 mS cm-1 for Li2.73Ho1.09Cl6
            to 3.79 mS cm-1 for Li2.73Ho1.09Cl3.27Br2.73 is achieved with a significant decrease
            in activation energy from 0.38 eV to 0.32 eV, respectively. Further mixing anions
            and cations within a SE significantly enhances ionic conductivity by introducing controlled
            disorder at both cation and anion sites. This increases the system's configurational
            entropy and allows for the overlap of energy bands. Incorporating Mg2+ and Hf4+ into
            a Li3ClBrI mixed-rock-salt structure results in a substantial increase in ionic conductivity,
            reaching 0.88 mS cm⁻¹ for Li1.54Mg0.23Hf0.17Cl0.68BrI. The enhanced conductivity is
            attributed to a nanoscale solid solution between the disordered rock-salt and spinel
            structure. Moreover, introducing a mixed anion sublattice into cost-effective LiAlCl4
            through a simple one-step mechanochemical milling process led to a 22-fold increase
            in ionic conductivity – from 0.0083 mS cm⁻1 to 0.18 mS cm⁻1 for Li2AlCl3S. This improvement
            can be attributed to the formation of new Li sites, enabling efficient 3D Li+ transport.
            The strategy leverages the inherent disorder to modify the Li-sublattice locally,
            leading to broader lithium-ion site occupancies and enhanced ion dynamics through
            polyhedral edge sharing. Mechanochemical milling of thiophosphate-based SEs combined
            with TiS2 CAM produces a composite material that leverages both cationic (Ti3+/4+)
            and anionic (S2-/n-, where n&lt;2) redox processes – resulting in ~2× enhancement in
            specific capacity. Catholytes containing mixed-anion SEs, especially with 3Li3PS4:LiBr,
            demonstrate better cycling performance compared to their mono-anion counterparts due
            to the improved ionic conductivity and thermodynamical stability. In summary, this
            dissertation explores innovative compositional design, optimal synthesis environment,
            and characterization of mixed-anion SEs, in addition to the utilization of these SEs
            in ASSBs. Overall, this research provides valuable insights into the development and
            application of high-performance ASSBs, addressing challenges associated with SEs in
            energy storage.</p>

            and private sectors and the vast number of employees who receive support from training
            and development professionals warrants exploration into how instructional designers
            are supporting a culturally diverse labor force. This qualitative research study explores
            how and why instructional designers developing training in a non-academic, adult learning
            settings incorporate cultural responsiveness in their instructional design (ID) practices.
            Incorporating evidence from semi-structured interviews with thirteen instructional
            designers across various levels of experience and organizational types, findings demonstrate
            that instructional designers are incorporating culturally responsive strategies in
            support of diverse learner populations. Results suggest that focus can be placed on
            cultural responsiveness during all phases of the systematic ID process and that there
            are considerable instructional, institutional, and personal dimensions working together
            at various degrees. Designers rely on their existing ID knowledge and institutional
            supports to execute their strategies and are driven by personal experiences and an
            organizational culture that respects diversity, equity, and inclusion.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The number of Nontraditional-age students has been on the rise in higher education
            over time, and although this population has been increasing nationwide, there has
            been a continued decline in nontraditional-age students at Florida Gulf Coast University
            (FGCU). This quantitative study focused on the background characteristics, academic
            characteristics, and financial characteristics of accepted nontraditional-age undergraduate
            students in an effort to alter admission strategy and improve enrollment of nontraditional-age
            students at the institution. The results of a three-step logistic regression model
            found there were significant predictors of enrollment related to the background characteristics,
            academic characteristics and financial characteristics utilized in the regression
            models of the study. The results of the study will be utilized in FGCU Admissions
            to refine recruitment strategy in an effort to enroll more nontraditional-age undergraduate

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>I argue that the dividing of values into epistemic and non-epistemic is not a productive
            way to understand and judge the influence of values in science. A better approach
            is to consider what is motivating a value and what justifies using it in a particular
            context. By reframing our assessment of values this way, we can better recognize epistemic
            contributions from diverse values. I further argue that when a value improves the
            empirical adequacy of a hypothesis or theory, the use of that value is epistemically
            justified in that context. To illustrate this point, I offer an example where the
            value of egalitarianism, which is widely considered to be a "non-epistemic value,"
            improved the empirical adequacy of a neuroscientific hypothesis, rendering the value
            epistemically justified in that context. Ultimately, I hope to make plausible the
            epistemic advantage of using that which has traditionally been relegated to the category
            of the non-epistemic—morally sound values.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This study addresses the challenge of achieving a stable teleoperation over the Internet,
            improving the convergence rate in the presence of high communication time delays,
            and maintaining consensus in the platoon while the lead agent is being teleoperated
            over Internet. The first part of this thesis dealt with stable teleoperation where
            we employ a passivity-based formalism to establish stability using wave variables
            and wave scattering techniques, and we enhance the convergence rate by combining it
            with predictor-based approaches. The elevated time delay within the teleoperated communication
            layer - The second part is known to induce collision between the agents as well as
            descensus behaviour in the platoon, which reduces the convergence rate and increases
            the settling time in the convergence of power variables. This issue is addressed in
            this paper by utilizing a Smith predictor on the operator end and Minimum Jerk (MJ)
            predictors on the remote end. We present experimental and simulation results to demonstrate
            the improvements, ensuring stable teleoperation under high communication time delays.Contributions
            of this thesis work include: • Setup a teleoperation platform over Wi-Fi and the Internet.
            • Identify the instability in the system, and implement the wave variable method to
            introduce stability which leads to witnessing the convergence issue. • Implementing
            Smith Predictor and MJ predictor to compensate convergence issue. • Design a platoon
            multi-agent system where the first agent is teleoperated over internet. • Study the
            performance of the approached model in Simulink and Hardware.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The introduction of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has greatly improved our understanding
            of structural biology, especially regarding muscle tissue. This technique has been
            key in revealing the complex structure and functional dynamics of myosin filaments,
            essential for muscle contraction. Cryo-EM's ability to provide high-resolution images
            gives us an unmatched look into the intricate interactions of muscle proteins, effectively
            closing the gap between biochemical theory and the actual observation of molecular
            structures. Unlike traditional crystallography, which needs protein crystallization
            and might introduce artifacts, cryo-EM allows for the observation of proteins in a
            state close to their natural environment, avoiding these issues.This study centers
            on the cryo-EM investigation of myosin filaments, focusing on sample preparation,
            data processing, and the protein composition and structure across different species,
            including both vertebrates and invertebrates. Chapter 1 introduces the basic principles
            of structural biology and explaining the groundbreaking role of cryo-EM in this field.
            It covers the essentials of protein structure, tracing the path from genetic code
            to the three-dimensional shapes vital for biological function. It also points out
            the key protein structures related to striated muscle, setting the stage for an in-depth
            look at myosin filaments in the following chapters. Chapter 2 explores the discovery
            of two distinct forms of myosin thick filaments in the flight muscles of Drosophila
            melanogaster, achieved through advanced cryo-EM techniques. This chapter not only
            points out the structural differences between ordered and disordered filament types
            but also introduces variations in flightin, a non-myosin protein, in these filament
            types. By obtaining high-resolution structures, this analysis provides a deeper understanding
            of the protein composition and conformational differences that contribute to these
            variations. In Chapter 3, the focus moves to building atomic models for both filament
            types, enabled by near-atomic resolution structures. This comparative study of myosin
            filament backbones in Drosophila flight muscles highlights the structural differences
            between ordered-head and disordered-head filaments. These models clarify the molecular
            interactions between myosin coiled coils and non-myosin proteins. Additionally, this
            chapter looks at mutations in myosin-related genes linked to human cardiac diseases,
            examining the corresponding residues in the atomic models and the significant interactions
            they are involved in. Chapter 4 turns the focus to vertebrate models, addressing the
            challenges and methodologies involved in preparing myosin filaments for cryo-EM study.
            It emphasizes the critical importance of preserving structural integrity during sample
            preparation, highlighting some techniques that help preserve the structure of the
            vertebrate's filament during this process and paving the way for future experiments
            on vertebrates' myosin filament. Looking forward, future research plans to use cryo-EM
            to study myosin filaments across different Drosophila mutants, comparing them with
            the wild type in terms of protein structure. This effort aims to figure out how changes
            between ordered and disordered configurations happen, hoping to gain deeper insights
            into the molecular mechanisms that control myosin filament organization and the functional
            effects of these structural changes.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Due to the constant mental, physical, and thermal stress of firefighting, it is imperative
            to explore interventions that may mitigate any negative health effects the occupation
            brings to firefighters. One of those risks is heat related illnesses. Because a high
            amount of firefighters experience symptoms of heat related illness and heat related
            illness is associated with an increased risk of mortality, this is a critical component
            to focus on for firefighter safety. Betaine supplementation has been shown to decrease
            heat related deaths in animals and mitigate rises in core temperature in endurance
            athletes. Therefore, the aim of this project was to determine if betaine supplementation
            would decrease risk factors associated with heat related illnesses as well as mitigate
            rises in core temperature during a live burn scenario. In this double-blind placebo-controlled
            trial, structural firefighters (n=13) were stratified based on shift type and sex,
            then randomized to receive 3g/day of rice flour (PLA) or betaine (BET). Participants
            ingested the supplement for roughly 1 month (30 ±2 days) and completed pre-post testing
            for vitals, salivary stress markers, and body composition. During that month, the
            participants also wore a WHOOP 4.0 device to track sleep and components of recovery.
            At the end of the month, participants then underwent a live burn scenario in which
            they completed a stair climb of four stories outdoors then sat in a conex box that
            had a fire in it to be exposed to extreme passive heat (temp here) for 15 minutes.
            Baseline salivary biomarkers, core temperature, sweat rates, vitals, and sweat content
            were measured. Pre to post paired t-tests were used within groups for the 4 weeks
            of supplementation. Unpaired t-tests were used to analyze differences between groups
            in response to the live burn. One tail tests were used on relative thermoregulatory
            outcomes and baseline salivary markers, all other assessments were two tailed tests.
            There were no differences in the BET group for vital signs pre to post supplementation,
            however the PLA group had an increase in resting heart rate. The BET group had significantly
            better sleep quality as observed through restorative sleep increases while the firefighters
            were working on shift and after they got off of work that were not observed in the
            PLA group. When comparing the before and after 4 week supplementation, the BET group
            had decreases in C-Reactive Protein and cortisol which resulted in increases in the
            testosterone:cortisol ratio in the BET group (p&lt;0.05). Arrival interleukin-8 and alpha-Amylase
            were significantly lower in the BET group compared to the PLA group. Absolute core
            temperature differences were not significantly different between groups, however when
            presented relative to caloric expenditure from the stair climb and burn, body weight,
            heart rate average from the stair climb and burn, and air usage, the BET group was
            significantly lower (p &lt; 0.05). Sodium content of sweat in the BET group was significantly
            higher, while sweat rates were not different from the PLA group. Based on these findings,
            BET may decrease chronic stress and inflammation and acutely better maintain blood
            volume and decrease the risk of heat related illnesses and improve on shift safety
            and health in firefighters.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Intercollegiate athletics has become a business enterprise which exists and thrives
            on higher education campuses. As the growth of intercollegiate sport has continued,
            women have been noticeably absent from leadership roles in this extremely male-dominated
            profession. With the passage of Title IX there was hope and expectation that women
            would be considered and accepted on both the playing field and in leadership positions.
            While the playing field has shown significant advances with approximately 50% of student-athletes
            being female, leadership has severely lagged behind. Slow in the evolution of female
            athletic directors, it is important to explore the reasons why and determine if there
            are opportunities for change. Speaking with women in senior leadership roles at NCAA
            Division I FBS institutions provides information and ideas for supporting young women
            who aspire to be athletic directors and leaders in intercollegiate sports. Using this
            exploratory study through the narrative inquiry process, women who assisted in leading
            their departments at NCAA Division I FBS institutions which were classified at the
            time in autonomy conferences were interviewed on the professional development, opportunity,
            and mentorship throughout their careers. The information shared was thoughtful and
            insightful and provides an opportunity for young women and men to understand challenges
            faced and opportunities for change moving forward in assisting and guiding young women
            into leadership positions within these departments. The feedback from these accomplished
            women provides leaders at institutions of higher education, search firms, and hiring
            managers with details and background that may assist in overcoming unconscious bias.
            Culture in intercollegiate athletics must evolve and adapt to the quickly changing
            landscape of intercollegiate sport. Allowing thought leaders in the profession to
            remain white and male will inevitably stunt the advancement of collegiate athletics
            overall. Diversity in gender, as well as race, will provide different perspectives
            to assist in understanding challenges that are faced by those that strive to be leaders
            in this environment.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Microplastic (MP) pollution is an ongoing problem in coastal systems, where wastewater
            treatment plants (WWTPs) and other sources deposit particles daily. While research
            regarding MP pollution worldwide is increasing, especially surrounding the role of
            WWTPs in facilitating MP inputs to marine environments, two major gaps exist within
            the MP literature: (1) MP pollution data within United States coastal areas, especially
            in marine sediments; and (2) MP effects on animals that may be most at risk. MPs are
            bioavailable to a range of marine fauna, including fish, benthic invertebrates, and
            marine mammals, and they can transport invasive species, alter biogeochemical cycles,
            and they can cause physical stress to fauna. These negative effects are potentially
            most pronounced at the base of food webs and in fauna that perform microecosystem
            functions, due to their small sizes and high likelihood for interaction with MPs.
            I posed five questions in my dissertation: (1) What is the spatial and temporal distribution
            of MPs in St. Andrew Bay, Florida? (2) How are spatial and temporal factors correlated
            with the identities of MPs in St. Andrew Bay? (3) What spatial distinctness exists
            within nematode communities in the St. Andrew Bay? (4) How do microbe-MP associations
            alter marine nematode feeding behaviors? And (5) How do MPs alter interstitial marine
            ecosystem functions? I used a combination of field collections and experimental manipulations
            to address these questions, as microplastics and interstitial communities are difficult
            to manipulate in natural environments.To assess spatiotemporal variation in MP pollution
            within St. Andrew Bay, I conducted a seasonal sampling from October 2020 to February
            2022 along 1-km transects across five separate parts of the bay system. Sediments
            in areas of WWTP outflow contained more MP pollution than areas without direct outflow,
            and concentrations of MPs were highest in winter months. Additionally, MP concentrations
            at the Millville WWTP were nearly an order of magnitude higher than anywhere else
            in the bay system, suggesting that damages to and inefficiencies at the plant are
            exacerbating the magnitude of MPs imported into this system, though other factors
            that help explain MP loading patterns, including road runoff, tidal and wave action,
            and microplastic degradation, were not evaluated. Extrapolation of mean MP concentrations
            in the bay system suggests that there may be approximately 30 billion MPs in the bay
            at any time, which are likely exported out to the Gulf of Mexico during heavy rains
            or storms. To assess spatiotemporal variation in MP compositions within the bay system,
            I evaluated the MP polymer types, particle shapes, and sizes. Unexpectedly, fragments
            were the dominant particle shape at WWTP sites, while sediments from other sites were
            mostly fragments and fibers. Mean MP sizes were significantly smaller at WWTP outflow
            sites than elsewhere, which suggests that waste processing and filtration retains
            larger particles or that particle collisions during processing and export lead to
            smaller MP sizes. In the winter, WWTP sediments were dominated by polyester and polyethylene
            terephthalate, which are indicative of the role that laundering of synthetic textiles
            plays in coastal MP pollution. To evaluate spatial distinctness within nematode communities
            in the St. Andrew Bay system, I extracted nematodes from sediments at the two WWTP
            sites and two reference sites at two separate times: winter and summer. Nematode community
            diversity was strongly associated with the distance to the nearest WWTP, and communities
            were dominated by tolerant, opportunistic genera. These findings suggest that the
            system is possibly stressed by organic enrichment, potentially linked to the WWTPs,
            but has not reached an ecological tipping point evidenced by an abundance of pollution
            sensitive nematode genera. To assess the effect of microbe-MP associations on marine
            nematode feeding behaviors, I set up a factorial experiment varying microbe presence,
            MP concentrations, and MP exposure time. Microbe-MP associations did not encourage
            nematodes or other meiofauna to consume MPs, and while nematodes did consume MPs,
            consumption was rare, suggesting that accidental ingestion may be a more plausible
            reason. Finally, to assess the effect of MPs on interstitial marine ecosystem functions,
            I conducted a mesocosm experiment with a control and three MP concentrations (low,
            medium, high), and luminophores—glow in the dark particle tracers—to assess bioturbation
            and oxygen microelectrodes to track oxygen turnover. All MP concentrations resulted
            in reduced bioturbation depths but only the high treatment resulted in increased oxygen
            penetration depth compared to the control treatment. Discrepancies in bioturbation
            and oxygen penetration trends under the influence of MP pollution suggests that MPs
            may be differentially affecting size classes of fauna. Decreased bioturbation because
            of MP contamination supports that MPs are reducing this behavior in macrofauna and
            meiofauna members in the sediments. However, increases in oxygen penetration depth
            that do not align with bioturbation depth suggest that macrofauna and meiofauna may
            not be responsible for these oxygen trends. Instead, deeper oxygen penetration depth
            may be linked to altered microbial activities, changes in microbial community compositions
            where less effective oxygen-consuming bacteria are present in abundance, or changes
            in sediment physical structures that allow for deeper oxygen penetration at high MP
            concentrations.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) youth experience higher rates and severity of
            anxiety, depression, non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), and suicide-related thoughts
            and behaviors (STBs) compared to their cisgender peers and compared to TGD older adults.
            The literature indicates that this disproportionate risk may be attributable in part
            to TGD youths' higher levels of gender nonconformity, gender dysphoria brought on
            by undergoing puberty, and TGD youths' increased risk for bullying and peer victimization.
            Although these factors have generally been found to be cross-sectionally associated
            with internalizing problems, NSSI, and STBs, little longitudinal research has been
            conducted on these relationships. The Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD)
            dataset, an ongoing project which has collected longitudinal data on a large (n =
            11,877) sample of children who were 9-10 years old at baseline, includes measures
            of mental health, gender identity, pubertal development, and peer victimization at
            several time points. The current study tested the relationship between gender nonconformity
            and mental health symptoms over time, mediated by peer victimization and moderated
            by pubertal development, utilizing data from the ABCD dataset. The models were supported,
            in that earlier gender nonconformity significantly positively predicted depression,
            anxiety, and suicide ideation two years later. These associations were significantly
            and partially accounted for by peer victimization. The association between gender
            nonconformity and peer victimization was significantly moderated by pubertal development,
            such that it was stronger at higher levels of pubertal development. These findings
            highlight the importance of studying specific risk factors for adverse mental health
            outcomes for TGD youth.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Scholars Leonard &amp; Woodland (2022) suggest schools and districts face a crucial challenge.
            Are schools and districts ensuring their personnel are prepared to engage in critical
            practices to affirm, include, and support all students, families, peers, and communities?
            Or are schools and districts just haphazardly committing to diversity, equity, and
            inclusion statements to check a box? Current research lacks a focus on how K-12 educators
            make sense of, learn, and implement, as well as the challenges to implementing equity-centered,
            culturally responsive, and antiracist practices. Therefore, this exploratory case
            study sought to address this research gap by focusing on the experiences and perceptions
            of educators who participated in and graduated from the District of Columbia Public
            Schools (DCPS) yearlong professional development program, Anti-Racist Educator University
            (ARE-U). Specifically, this study is interested in examining the processes of sensemaking,
            learning, implementation, and challenges of implementing concepts learned in ARE-U
            in their practice, as well as educators' perspectives on the program's effectiveness.
            This study was informed by four frameworks: sensemaking, critical race theory, intersectionality,
            and critical sensemaking. This study illuminates the narratives and perspectives of
            classroom educators who voluntarily decided to participate in a year-long equity-centered
            and antiracist professional development program to improve their practice. These critical
            perspectives are omitted in current research, but they provide insight into the effectiveness
            of current approaches in supporting educator learning. Moreover, through this study
            and its findings, stakeholders will gain an understanding of educator's experiences
            in equity-minded and antiracist programs from the perspective of these educators.
            Specifically, the process by which educators engage in meaning-making, their understanding
            of concepts in teaching and instruction, and challenges to implementation. ARE-U program
            organizers can use data from this study to evolve ARE-U to be more effective in supporting
            learning and implementation. This data can also challenge school and district leaders'
            resource allocation and decision-making approaches that negatively impact educators.
            This study also supports the value of programs like ARE-U in educator training regarding
            sensemaking of equity and antiracism. Despite some educators' inability to make explicit
            connections between ARE-U's content and its application to their teaching, all educators
            praised ARE-U as a first step in exploring how educators can address systemic inequities
            in their classrooms. Keywords: Antiracism, Equity, Sensemaking, Intersectionality,

            a performer, teacher, and composer while also outlining her compositions in chronological
            order. The following chapters analyze selections from her vocal and piano repertoire:
            The Secret History of Water, sets 1, 2, and 3 (2002-04), with text by Cuban-born American
            poet Silvia Curbelo. The final chapter offers the reader style considerations and
            discusses challenges that the pianist and singer may encounter in the score. The appendix
            provides a complete list of Cloud's compositions. This treatise aims to highlight
            the long legacy of Judith Cloud and encourage vocalists and pianists to explore her
            extensive repertoire.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This treatise examines the Violin Concerto, op. 224 (1955) by American composer Mana-Zucca
            (1885-1981). A highly regarded musician during her lifetime, Mana-Zucca maintained
            successful and simultaneous careers as a virtuoso pianist and a singer and performer
            in operettas and musical comedies. As a composer with a catalogue of 1,100 compositions,
            she dominated the popular music scene in the early- to mid-twentieth century with
            her melodious songs, including "I Love Life" (1923), which launched her into the national
            spotlight. Mana-Zucca's legacy has been inextricably tied to this song and her role
            as a popular composer, but she was also an accomplished composer of instrumental concert
            music. Primary sources illuminate the Violin Concerto as a compositional undertaking
            that was especially significant to her, in part as a demonstration of her legitimacy
            as a serious composer. Despite her perseverance and optimism, the concerto, like many
            of her works, as well as those of other women composers, has been largely overlooked
            since her death in both literature and concert programming. The Violin Concerto can
            be heard as a reflection and culmination of her robust musical pursuits. Its kaleidoscopic
            style and structure incorporate characteristics of romanticism, classicism, and modernism,
            as well as the intimate style of salon music and the dramatic expressiveness of opera.
            Mana-Zucca positioned herself not only within a concert culture network but also at
            the center of a vibrant salon culture, which she cultivated through the fun, accessible
            nature of popular music and the value she placed on music as a force for building
            connection and community. Although the Concerto reflects a push to treat her compositional
            voice in a serious manner, this "professional salon piece" also reveals how a complex,
            virtuosic work for solo and orchestra can capture the appeal and charisma of "light
            music." This treatise is an invitation to reexamine Mana-Zucca's legacy through the
            lens of her Violin Concerto. By providing a historical and stylistic analysis, I contextualize
            Mana-Zucca's style within the broad stylistic trends of twentieth-century American
            music. The work itself provides a way to understand Mana-Zucca's impact on her musical
            network and reflects not only a stylistic synthesis but also her all-encompassing
            pursuit of life as a musician, composer, collaborator, and community leader.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The aim of this study was to understand how Florida State University undergraduate
            students perceive their relationships with social media influencers and whether that
            is changing their intention to pursue their degrees. Six focus group discussions were
            conducted with 15 undergraduate students using a semi-structured interview guide.
            A thematic analysis of the data identified 10 common themes to address their motivations
            and realities in becoming an influencer. Parasocial relationships were formed with
            social media influencers by participants identifying and bonding with them through
            personality traits. What drove the participants' interest in becoming a social media
            influencer were the benefits, such as money, freedom of time, and the lifestyle portrayed.
            Perceived social norms of social media influencers had no effect on the participants'
            academic decisions. Participants had many uncertainties about pursuing becoming a
            social media influencer, such as mental health and job stability. Nearly all participants
            in the study agreed that they would balance pursing their degree program along with
            becoming a social media influencer. As suggested by the findings, the following is
            recommended: meet with university marketing and discuss ways in which students who
            wish to be social media influencers can be an asset to the university in student recruitment
            and other marketing purposes.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This dissertation observed and analyzed the experiences of five higher education students
            participating in a modified tabletop role-playing game (TRPG) intentionally modified
            for teaching adaptive leadership concepts. The study observed participants' capacity
            to learn the adaptive leadership concepts taught throughout the game and the ways
            in which participants exhibited such learning. Further, it inquired about the influence
            of participants' experiences with the game on their ability to identify adaptive leadership
            concepts outside the game.The study followed a qualitative exploratory single-case
            study approach. The combination of teaching strategies selected in the study aimed
            to construct a case that simulates what using a TRPG as a leadership pedagogical tool
            in a leadership undergraduate course could look like. The participants' campaign and
            their interactions served as the case being observed. Data collection consisted of
            the recorded gameplay sessions, post-game debrief sessions, rubrics recording participants
            meeting the game's learning objectives, analytical memos collected throughout the
            study, participant interviews, written reflections, and in-game assessments. The findings
            suggest that TRPGs can serve as adaptive leadership pedagogical tools as long as they
            are supported by other leadership teaching strategies, essentially acting as a space
            where learners can engage with the educational content and experience applying it.
            The study also suggests that the type of learning participants experienced was cognitive
            rather than embodied and that game elements such as engaging nature, co-constructed
            narrative, NPC interactions, guided reflection, and in-game assessments were crucial
            in fostering participant interaction with the game's adaptive leadership concepts.
            Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the potential of role-playing
            games as instructional tools in a traditional educational setting.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Children with hearing loss have a higher risk of not developing crucial language and
            communication skills without the support of early intervention services. Language
            development is crucial for early childhood education, cognitive and socio-emotional
            development. This is due to the lack of access to communicative skills and exchanges
            and other surrounding factors. Early intervention services include music therapy.
            Music therapists must have a general knowledge of working with children with hearing
            loss, utilize hearing loss devices, and Deaf children. The purpose of the current
            study was to explore board certified music therapists' perceptions of willingness,
            comfort, and preparedness of working with children with various levels of hearing
            loss and within the Deaf community. The participants answered their perceptions of
            (1) general benefit of music therapy, (2) preparedness from training, (3) comfort
            adapting music therapy, and (4) willingness to provide music therapy. The participants
            (N= 47) were first cycle board certified music therapists that are currently working
            in the Southeast region. The results revealed that the participants had overall higher
            perceptions of their willingness to provide services and had overall lower perceptions
            of their preparedness from training. Additionally, the results revealed that music
            therapists had higher perceptions of working with children with lower degrees of hearing
            loss and children with hearing loss devices. Further results and analysis are discussed
            within the paper.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Mexican Americans have been native to the United States for centuries, but their educational
            attainment numbers reflect an achievement gap. This has led to increased poverty levels,
            low social capital, and low quality of benefits. One way to increase social mobility
            for a racial group is by increasing the number of bachelor's degree holders. Because
            high school lays the foundation for postsecondary attainment, it is important to study
            college access in high school to understand how students experience and interact with
            this information in preparation for applying to college. This qualitative case study
            looked at the student experience through data collected via open ended interviews.
            Data was analyzed using the Psychosociocultural Theory to account for the psychological,
            social, and cultural barriers that are unique to the Mexican American student population.
            A purposeful sample recruited from Valley High School included five female students
            who were in the 11-25% of their class rank, first-generation to go to college, and
            Mexican American. The findings showed that the majority of the collected data indicated
            the psychological and social realms. Notably, the cultural realm did not contain substantial
            data. A total of seven themes were found ranging from their interactions with their
            peers to the value of sibling experiences. Implications for this study were gender
            related help-seeking behaviors for males and traditional culture roles for females.
            This study adds to the literature surrounding Mexican American students and their
            persistence to postsecondary education and shines a spotlight on the need to include
            student voices when creating college readiness programming in high school.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Transcribing and arranging has become a popular way for musicians to expand and explore
            a wider range of repertoire than is available on one's own instrument. Viola virtuosi,
            such as Lionel Tertis and William Primrose, paved the way for transcribing works that
            would have been otherwise unthinkable for a violist at the time. One does not, however,
            need to be a virtuoso in order to transcribe music for one's instrument. Today, free
            music notation software, along with many other resources, makes creating transcriptions
            achievable for any performer. The purpose of this treatise is to provide an overview
            of the transcription process from a performer's perspective, so that others may it
            use as a guide for their personal use when transcribing music for the viola. The chapters
            give a brief overview of performers who created transcriptions, criteria for choosing
            music to transcribe, methodologies for transcribing music for the viola, and performance
            practices.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Prospective memory (PM), the ability to remember to execute an intention in the future,
            is critical for the performance of everyday tasks important for independence and quality
            of life. PM failures are associated with negative health, financial, and social outcomes,
            and are more frequent with increased age and can be even greater for older adults
            with a cognitive impairment such as subjective cognitive decline (SCD). Technology
            holds promise for providing everyday PM support for older adults with cognitive impairment,
            but little is known regarding their attitudes and preferences toward technology-based
            PM support. The present work utilized an online survey and focus groups to examine
            the attitudes of older adults with SCD toward technologies to support PM. 188 older
            adults with SCD and 190 older adults without SCD completed an online survey and answered
            questions about a variety of technologies to support PM in different activity areas.
            A separate sample of 24 older adults with SCD participated in online focus groups
            and were probed about their perception of the use of technology devices for supporting
            PM, benefits they feel they might derive from these devices, and potential costs or
            barriers to using them. Results show that the attitudes of older adults with SCD 1)
            differed based on the type of device and the type of activity the technology is meant
            to support, 2) were more positive than those of older adults without SCD, and 3) were
            associated with individual difference factors such as attitudes toward technology
            in general, technology proficiency, frequency of memory failures, health, and age.
            Results suggest that older adults with SCD might prefer using mobile apps relative
            to other devices and technology to support healthcare relative to other activities.
            Older adults with SCD also showed privacy concerns related to voice-activated assistants
            and using technology to manage finances. Results indicate that older adults with SCD
            may be a promising population to target using technology-based solutions, and the
            type of device and type of activity being supported are important to consider in the
            development of technology solutions to enhance independence and well-being.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Marine ecosystems are increasingly threatened by human activities, highlighting the
            urgent need for effective conservation strategies. This dissertation focuses on the
            hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) in Brazil as a case study to enhance marine
            conservation efforts. Recognized as keystone species for their ecological significance
            and classified as Critically Endangered by the International Union for Conservation
            of Nature (IUCN), the charismatic flagship species, hawksbill turtle, serve as sentinel,
            important indicator for the health of marine biodiversity. Utilizing satellite telemetry
            and population monitoring, key demographic parameters and spatial ecology of nesting
            hawksbill turtles were investigated. The utilization distribution by tracked turtles
            overlapped with Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and the potential threats, offered insights
            into broader marine conservation strategies. The second chapter advances our understanding
            of marine turtle population dynamics by refining the accuracy of demographic parameter
            estimates, specifically clutch frequency, which is pivotal for assessing marine turtle
            populations. Such parameter is broadly used to estimate number of individual nesting
            females based on the total number of nests, which often times is the only information
            available. In addition, this chapter demonstrate the significant impact of the presence
            of transient turtles on these estimates and are informative for study designs that
            aim estimate total number of nesting females within a season or for the population
            at large. The third chapter breaks down their nesting, foraging, and migratory behaviors
            to inform conservation management. A significant contribution of this work is the
            identification of key migratory corridors and foraging areas, particularly for the
            subpopulation from Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, highlighting the need for spatially
            explicit conservation goals and targets. The effectiveness of Brazil's coastal MPAs
            in protecting the vital habitats for nesting hawksbill turtles was assessed. The findings
            reveal mismatches in the current MPA network, leading to recommendations for strategic
            MPA expansion and management, emphasizing ecological-scale approaches over political
            boundaries to accommodate the species' extensive migratory patterns. The research
            advocates for MPAs to not only cover high-use areas identified through telemetry but
            also to implement protection levels tailored to the hawksbill turtles' specific needs.
            Furthermore, the fourth chapter provides a nuanced understanding of hawksbill turtle
            internesting behavior, using a novel approach to discretize hidden behaviors during
            this critical period. Besides evidencing high fidelity to nesting beaches and residence
            areas, mapping the behaviors provided essential insights into their vulnerability
            to specific threats, including vessel strikes and accidental capture in fishing gear.
            It proposes evidence-based strategies to enhance MPA effectiveness, integrating technological
            advancements with conservation biology to inform policy and management decisions.
            The study's findings underscore the importance of adaptive management strategies,
            responsive to the evolving understanding of hawksbill turtle ecology. Beyond hawksbill
            turtles, the research offers a framework for applying similar conservation strategies
            to other marine species, underlining the potential for species-specific efforts to
            catalyze broader and effective environmental management and conservation. The dissertation
            calls for continued research and adaptive management in response to the dynamic nature
            of marine ecosystems and emerging threats, highlighting the role of science in effective
            conservation policies.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The United States higher education system has developed strategies to prepare students
            for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) careers as the STEM labor market
            expands. One set of educational interventions, known as STEM Intervention Programs
            (SIPs), employs extracurricular activities to engage and retain STEM major students.
            These SIPs often target underrepresented racial-ethnic minority (URM) students, low-income
            students, and women to reduce social disparities in STEM education. However, studies
            assessing the effectiveness of SIPs in improving STEM retention, graduation, and career
            outcomes have produced inconsistent results. Another area of racial-ethnic inequality
            in STEM education is the faculty roster, particularly in terms of representation,
            hiring, and promotion practices. Increasing the number of URM STEM faculty members
            addresses two main issues: equitable representation and providing URM STEM students
            with race-matched instruction, mentorship, and role models. Extracurricular SIPs and
            Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) hiring initiatives for URM STEM faculty are
            common strategies for promoting racial-ethnic equity in STEM education. However, these
            efforts, along with other DEI campaigns, have shown limited success in improving academic
            experiences and outcomes for marginalized groups, including URM STEM students. Some
            of the implicit bias in STEM education can be categorized as institutional racism,
            which is perpetuated through the policies, practices, and structural elements of organizations.
            These institutional features create barriers for URM STEM scholars and faculty during
            their education, hiring, and promotion, limiting race-matched learning opportunities
            for URM STEM undergraduates.This dissertation seeks to advance the literature by investigating
            the relationship between institutional racism and SIPs: does underrepresentation of
            Black and Hispanic/Latino STEM faculty undercut the intended benefits of SIPs on academic
            and career outcomes of URM participants? Using a quantitative research design, this
            study examines the impact of SIPs and the underrepresentation of URM STEM faculty
            on individual and cohort outcomes. Analyzing institutional datasets of three complete,
            consecutive cohorts of undergraduates from a predominantly white higher education
            institution, this study examines how SIP participation and URM faculty exposure relate
            to the success of URM STEM students. As previous research has found the long-term
            benefits of SIP participation to partially depend on other student characteristics
            and experiences, the present study also explores whether the benefits of URM-targeted
            SIPs differ from other SIPs and how these benefits compare with exposure to URM faculty
            in the classroom. I analyzed how these practices and their associated outcomes relate
            to the persistence of institutional racism in STEM education. To contextualize and
            validate the quantitative findings, I triangulated my findings with my advisor and
            committee members with substantive expertise, teasing out the details and broader
            meanings of the quantitative results. Ultimately, the strongest positive relationships
            observed between inputs and desired STEM graduation outcomes was between URM STEM
            faculty exposure and timely STEM graduation. Increasing URM STEM faculty exposure
            may improve timely graduation outcomes, reduce student loan debt, and prepare URM
            STEM graduates for the workforce. In contrast, high-cost extracurricular programming
            may not move the needle URM STEM students' graduation goals. In sum, this case study
            provides insights into the limited benefits of programs that many universities have
            implemented to retain URM STEM students and interprets those lackluster results as
            demonstrating the key tenet of Critical Race Theory known as "interest convergence."</p>

            were commonly examined on the individual level. From an interpersonal perspective,
            the EASI model (Van Kleef, 2009) describes emotions as signals sent to the environment.
            When perceived by others, emotional signals provide information about the person expressing
            the emotion and about the environment. Previous research also examined interpersonal
            emotional processes in naturalistic and experimental designs. Specifically, the process
            of emotional convergence was documented in soccer penalty kick shootouts. This current
            study examined the influence of viewing teammate's performance outcome (i.e., IV1)
            and post-performance emotional expressions of pride or shame (i.e., IV2) on participant's
            (i.e., perceiver) pre-performance emotional state and subsequent performance. An on-the-field
            between-participants experimental design was conducted, in which previous penalty
            kick viewing was manipulated using a pre-recorded Virtual Reality video. Participants
            (N = 93) viewed one of six experimental condition videos, reported their emotional
            state and related cognitions, and shot a penalty for their team's common goal. Results
            indicated no significant differences between groups in pre-performance emotional states,
            although a non-significant trend in anxiety was observed. The data revealed that perceived
            emotions were significantly influenced by the observed performance outcome, regardless
            of the emotional expression. Subsequent performance was significantly affected by
            previous penalty outcome, and a trend regarding the emotional expression appeared
            in the data. The results of the study are discussed within the elements of the EASI
            model (Van Kleef, 2009) and other relevant literature (e.g., context and perceived
            emotions, ironic processing). Plausible explanations for lack of consistency with
            previous literature are offered. Future research is encouraged to examine interpersonal
            emotional processes (e.g., emotional convergence) in advanced experimental designs
            such as using new technologies, as well as in naturalistic settings. Further, we recommend
            that athletes develop effective emotion regulation strategies to mitigate the potential
            negative effects of negative (e.g., shame) emotional expressions on individual and
            team performance.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>In Dragon Year, the speaker explores their emerging queer and polyamorous identity
            amidst one failing relationship and another burgeoning one. At its core, this is a
            story of ode and elegy. The speaker looks back at the people and places who have made
            and unmade them. In the pain of rebirth, the speaker thinks often of death, including
            the suicide of a personal idol, YouTube gamer Desmond "Etika" Amofah. Indeed, video
            games recur throughout the work, demonstrating that digital landscapes and characters
            have also played a large role in the speaker's navigation of self. The poems are organized
            around four sections. The first introduces the speaker's current situation in media
            res; the second delves into the past and early formative situations; the third is
            a sort of quiet climax, a dark night; and the fourth is an emergence into a jubilant
            yet unsure future. Like Frank O'Hara suggests in his famous manifesto "Personism,"
            these poems take place between people. Some of the poems deal explicitly with romantic
            love, especially potential love lost, as in "Applebee's," where the speaker admits,
            "I love you, and you know / though I've never said it, / and you don't love me, though
            we sit close / and talk a secret language." Other poems play out more of a family
            drama, such as "On the Plain of Dura in the Province of Delaware" and "Self-Portrait
            with Oathkeeper &amp; Oblivion," in which the speaker laments their inability to protect
            their younger sister from their parents' divorce deep in the past. Formally, I strike
            a wide range throughout this book. Though most of the poems count as free verse, I
            employ a contemporary take on several traditional forms, such as the sonnet (e.g.
            "Winter Lights: Three Scenes"), the pantoum (e.g. "Blue Gucci"), the blazon (e.g.
            "Blazon featuring Zelda Mixtape &amp; Coconut Oil"), the ode (e.g. "Ode to Just Dance,
            Lindy Hop, &amp; The Great Gatsby"), and the contrapuntal (e.g. "At Least Spiritually").
            I also experiment with forms that carry syntax along paratactically such that the
            entire poem is one sentence (e.g. "Lights Out Ode"). Spirituality is an important
            undercurrent in this book. I've been Catholic my whole life, and that provides some
            consistent tension in my navigation of queerness and other complex contemporary topics.
            Many poems in this book demonstrate a wrestling with faith—a refusal to give in and
            also a refusal to give it up (e.g. "Ode to Boudin, Hurricanes, &amp; Street Performers").
            In comparison to other books or the poetry market, I'd say this book owes a debt to
            Christian Wiman, whose works such as Every Riven Thing or Once in the West demonstrate
            a tense relationship with faith, a holding on even as the speaker fights back. Wiman's
            work, like mine, also demonstrates a deep commitment to tight, intentional form and
            strong musicality, though Wiman's musicality is even more pronounced than mine. I
            would also consider my narrative style in the lineage of Barbara Hamby and David Kirby.
            I expect this book would appeal to readers of poetry who are interested in queer spirituality
            and in poetry books that can strike a wide variety of forms, from the compressed lyric
            to the syntactically-expansive narrative. Though the book's final section attempts
            some sense of acceptance and closure, even then the speaker is just on the brink of
            returning to the beginning of pain again. In the final poem, "Traverse Town," during
            a game of mini-golf, they conclude, "I'm so color drunk I'd almost say it's / enough:
            tonight let's not play therapy, / pack boxes, reach for each other's bodies. / I'll
            birdie the next one—betcha / an ice cream. You say, let's fucking go."</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The study conducted in Dolphin County School District offers a comprehensive exploration
            of teacher beliefs among K-8 educators, specifically focusing on perspectives related
            to mathematics instruction. The findings reveal a diverse array of beliefs, shedding
            light on nuanced aspects of transmissionist, facts-first, and fixed instructional
            plan beliefs.An examination of background characteristics and their relationship with
            teacher beliefs emphasizes the intricate nature of these beliefs within the teaching
            community. The study identifies a weak connection, highlighting the diverse array
            of perspectives held by educators. Factors such as gender, race, and teaching experience
            contribute to this complexity, emphasizing the need for a nuanced understanding of
            the interplay of these factors in shaping teacher perspectives on mathematics education.
            Professional development emerges as a crucial factor influencing teacher beliefs.
            However, the study reveals a lack of statistically significant correlations between
            professional development and teacher beliefs. This calls for a critical reevaluation
            of existing professional development initiatives, urging the district to ensure their
            content aligns effectively with instructional practices that enhance mathematics education.
            The multiple regression analysis accentuates the substantial impact of teacher beliefs
            on average classroom math score growth. Teachers endorsing traditional approaches
            are associated with lower student performance, while those embracing more progressive
            beliefs exhibit a positive influence. Notably, overall teacher beliefs wield a particularly
            strong influence on student outcomes, emphasizing the significance of fostering innovative
            and student-centered approaches to teaching mathematics. While the study acknowledges
            the existence of conflicting research, particularly concerning culturally relevant
            beliefs, it underscores the need for a more extensive study dedicated to beliefs about
            the teaching and learning of mathematics. This recognition of the complexity of teacher
            beliefs aligns with the observations made by Beswick (2007), emphasizing the necessity
            for a more in-depth understanding of these intricate aspects. In response to these
            findings, several recommendations are proposed for Dolphin County School District.
            Firstly, a thorough evaluation and refinement of professional development programs
            are essential to ensure their efficacy in shaping teacher beliefs. Internal examinations
            of belief consistency, encouragement of curriculum flexibility, and initiatives promoting
            innovative teaching approaches are prioritized to foster a cohesive instructional
            culture. Additionally, the district is encouraged to actively support a culture of
            continuous learning and collaboration among teachers through communities of practice.
            By implementing these recommendations, Dolphin County School District can position
            itself as a leader in cultivating a teaching environment where beliefs align with
            effective instructional practices. This proactive stance is poised to enhance the
            quality of mathematics education within the district, ultimately resulting in positive
            impacts on student outcomes. The district's commitment to continuous improvement and
            the provision of high-quality education for all students is evident in these recommendations,
            reflecting its dedication to fostering an environment conducive to both teacher and
            student success.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This dissertation explored the current perceptions and preferences for residence hall
            construction lifespan standards among campus master planners and housing administrators
            in higher education. Historically, universities have built residence halls with the
            intention of them spanning many decades (Guckert &amp; King, 2004). However, there has
            been a recent trend for housing departments to design and build new residence halls
            with the intent to tear them down in a much shorter time frame, perhaps 30 years or
            even less. Several factors have played into this developing trend, such as financial
            constraints, delivery deadlines, perceptions of flexibility, and consumer expectations.
            Beyond just how a college or university campus is built, this topic also contributes
            to the framework of how higher education administrators view the role and impact of
            campus residence halls. One of the theoretical concepts at play in this study is campus
            ecology, which can be described as the transactional processes in which environments
            promote growth and development for participants. Some theorists focus not only on
            the environment, but also the participants' perceptions of it (Evans et al., 2010).
            This study was conducted using both a quantitative survey tool as well as qualitative
            interviews. In total, 92 people from 46 institutions across the 10 states included
            in the SEAHO (Southeast Association of Housing Officers) region were surveyed. Another
            criteria of institutional involvement were select factors of the Carnegie Classification
            of Institutions of Higher Education. The total survey response rate was 53%, with
            a usable response rate of 45%. From there, three qualitative interview participants
            were selected from the survey participants. There were several key findings. Only
            one-third of survey participants indicated that the intended building lifespan of
            their last-constructed residence hall was over 50 years old. A quarter of respondents
            indicated their school has intentionally built a residence hall with a shorter lifespan.
            Seventy one percent of participating schools have not done a P3 project. For the 13
            schools who have done a P3, only four selected construction standards intended to
            have that facility last longer than 50 years. Participants were asked to share what
            key factors they believe played a role in the decision to intentionally build residence
            halls with shorter lifespans. First costs, speed of delivery, P3 projects, and projecting
            the need to replacing buildings sooner due to the changing needs of students, and
            perception of flexible design were the responses. There was division on whether flexible
            design was best achieved through short- or long-lifespan buildings. Another salient
            point was the need for key decision makers and designers to understand and apply how
            residence halls differ from other spaces on campus. The conversation around P3s revealed
            significant hesitation for a variety of reasons, but one interviewer gave strategies
            for their campus attempts to mitigate many of these concerns. Fifty five percent of
            participants indicated they preferred building residence halls to last at least 50
            years. There is a strong desire to be aware of students' wants, needs and perceptions.
            There is also concern about how the residence halls will adapt and over time with
            these changes of student desire. Most of the interview discussions did not favor the
            strategy of shorter lifespan buildings, citing factors such as lack of trust that
            both financial resources and campus footprint would be available 20-30 years in the
            future. A variety of financing strategies were indicated, but bonding was overwhelmingly
            the avenue being used. About 60% of respondents said that financial capacity has at
            least a significant amount of influence on determining the construction design standards
            for new residence halls. In the interviews, the lack of available institutional debt
            capacity was cited as a major factor for both shorter-lifespan buildings as well as
            alternate funding/delivery methods. Another challenge is that some schools are directing
            their revenue-producing operations (like housing) to pursue external funding methods
            to keep that debt off the institution's books, reducing the school's debt capacity
            and potentially creating more capacity for other campus projects. An interviewee positively
            commented that using a P3 delivery method shortened the time frame for securing funding
            versus going through a more traditional bonding process. While this mixed methods
            study explores administrators' current practices, perceptions, and preferences, it
            also points towards more. In short, these factors set the tone and affect the environment
            in which students live, study, and engage. If these settings are perceived to be unreliable,
            reduced, or not tailored to their intended audience (residents), the institution will
            miss the mark on providing intentional spaces for student growth and development.</p>

            the changing propagandistic themes that informed Chinese role-playing games, from
            fighting demon-like Japanese enemies in the 1960s to enjoying playful Japanese opponents
            in the 2010s. By surveying the role real children and players played in reshaping
            China's memories of the Fifteen Years War (1931- 1945), this dissertation aims to
            understand the interactions between children and states, propaganda and reality, identity
            and memory, as well as games and grand strategy presented with children's images and
            actual children's experiences with playthings. Based on primary sources from official
            Chinese propaganda channels toward children in the People's Republic of China (PRC),
            such as New Year's paintings, posters, broadcasts, youth newspapers, magazines, and
            Chinese children's publications in these channels, this project argues that Chinese
            children have been playing active roles in shaping Chinese propaganda throughout the
            history of the PRC. By focusing on children's own experiences and their own voices,
            this dissertation attempts to recenter the essential roles Chinese children played
            not only in the Fifteen Years War but also in the continuing Communist effort to maintain
            China's revolutionary fervor during the Cold War era and beyond.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>High-energy radiations such as X-rays and Gamma rays have become integral to our daily
            lives. They are utilized in various fields, including medical imaging, security screening,
            and scientific research. However, an efficient and reliable detector is required to
            unlock their potential fully. Scintillators play a crucial role in this process as
            they convert these invisible high-energy radiations into visible light photons. Despite
            years of research and numerous breakthroughs, scintillators still face significant
            challenges.Currently, the most commonly used scintillator materials are inorganic,
            such as NaI:Tl and CdWO4. While these materials are somewhat effective, they have
            some drawbacks. They are expensive to produce, and some may even be toxic. Additionally,
            many of these inorganic crystals do not meet the specific requirements of modern applications.
            As an alternative, organic materials like anthracene and stilbene have been explored
            as scintillators. Organic materials offer advantages over their inorganic counterparts,
            such as low cost, short scintillation decay time, and ease of processability. However,
            among many other challenges, their conversion efficiency or ability to convert radiation
            into charge carriers is a significant drawback. In this dissertation work, we explored
            the combination of the merits of both inorganic and organic materials into a single
            system addressing issues such as radiation absorption, scintillation light yield production,
            and radioluminescence decay lifetime. This work involved material and molecular design,
            material synthesis, characterization, processing, device fabrication, and application.
            The first part of this dissertation focused on increasing radiation absorption, enhancing
            scintillation light yield, and achieving a short radioluminescence decay lifetime.
            We explored three different methods. In Chapter 2, we investigated using organic metal
            halide hybrids as sensitizers to planar organic molecules (light emitter). We achieved
            spatial proximity and excellent spectral overlap between the sensitizer and the light
            emitter by embedding planar organic dye molecules and organic metal halide hybrids
            in a polymer matrix. This resulted in efficient energy transfer and a significant
            enhancement of radioluminescence. We also discussed challenges such as residual tailing
            emission and fluorescent quenching resulting from aggregation. In Chapter 3, we addressed
            some problems encountered in Chapter 2 with a new design concept. We ionically coupled
            an Aggregative-Induced Emissive (AIE) organic cation with a high Z metal halide anion,
            promoting efficient sensitization. This work synthesized and fully characterized a
            zero-dimensional (0D) organic metal halide hybrid, with the high Z metal halides acting
            as X-ray sensitizers and AIE organic cations as emitters. These materials were easy
            to prepare at low temperatures and exhibited high light yields with short decay lifetimes,
            dramatically enhancing X-ray scintillation. We also discussed efforts to improve solution
            processability in Chapter 4, where the AIE organic molecule was covalently bonded
            to derive an organic metal halide complex, achieving better solution processability.
            This covalently bonded complex demonstrated efficient molecular sensitization with
            zinc chloride, leading to high-energy radiation harvesting and charge transfer to
            the organic emitting units.The second theme of this dissertation, discussed in Chapter
            5, focused on our approach to achieving scintillator-specific applications, particularly
            in radiotherapy. We utilized molecular engineering to control the effective Z value
            of organic metal halide hybrids, aiming to develop a scintillator with similar radiation
            interaction with water and body tissue. The work highlights the potential of organic
            metal halide hybrids in radiotherapy applications. In the appendix, a few of the new
            structures discovered during the course of this dissertation's experimental work are
            highlighted. Overall, this dissertation contributes to developing new scintillator
            materials and improves our understanding of the structure-property relationship in
            these materials. The findings can guide the design and application of scintillator
            materials and other optoelectronic devices. By addressing the challenges in scintillator
            development, this work paves the way for more precise and accurate detection of high-energy
            radiation in various fields, ultimately benefiting both scientific research and human
            safety.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>It seems to me that the greatest contribution which Christianity has made to the history
            of ethics is its claim that what we should do, above all else, is love—love everyone
            with no exceptions. It is strange to me that this insight has generally not survived
            in contemporary ethics. Though our dominant ethical theories always mention love at
            some point, they seldom give it the seat of honor. This dissertation, then, is an
            argument that they should: that our ethical theories, secular ones included, should
            be founded on love. Perhaps that sounds like a strange suggestion. (You may say, "Are
            you suggesting that contractualism, for example, should be founded on love? Well…
            it isn't. If it were it would not be contractualism.") The structure of my argument
            therefore begins with some remarks on ethics as a project. Why might it be the sort
            of thing that is best approached with the tools of charity? I then turn to an example—one
            possible ethics of charity (and quite a compelling one, in my view), borrowed largely
            from Thomas Aquinas. Finally, I employ this Thomistic theory to the issue of forgiveness
            and correction, as a way of showing how such a theory works itself out in application.
            The hope is that the overall picture is one on which the ethical-theoretical utility
            of love is clearly on display.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This qualitative case study, which took place at Ringling College of Art and Design,
            explores the experiences of students in on-campus where emotional support animals
            (ESAs) are present. With rising disability diagnoses on college campuses and an increasing
            number of requests for students to be allowed to keep an emotional support animal,
            it is important to examine their impact on the living experiences of students who
            share living spaces. Between June and August of 2023, a convenience sample of returners
            and first-time college students at Ringling College of Art and Design were contacted
            about completing the study, which consisted of 56 students. Out of the 56 students,
            12 students decided to complete semi-structured interviews about what they knew about
            ESAs, their personal experiences, and their thoughts on how living on campus with
            an ESA was beneficial or not. The researcher aimed to address the broader question
            of "How does the presence of an emotional support animal influence the experience
            of the roommate or suitemates in on campus housing?" through questions related to
            participant's knowledge of the roles of ESAs, their experiences with ESAs, and their
            personal beliefs of the benefits and downfalls of the animal in on-campus housing.
            Findings showed participants without their own ESA varied in their knowledge of ESA
            policy and procedures. Despite no personal experience regarding ESA approval and accommodation
            on campuses, participants offered their opinions about the roles of ESAs along with
            a lack of knowledge related to the application process and possible misinformation
            about the specifications of an ESA. Participants reported good experiences with the
            owners of ESAs, indicating the potential for community-building and for mature relationships
            to address problems arising from the presence of an ESA. Self-mediation and communication
            practices among suitemates were reported, demonstrating a collective willingness to
            implement potential solutions to the animal's presence. Finally, roommates assessed
            living with ESAs as mainly positive, contributing to their emotional wellbeing and
            to positive relationships among residents. Some respondents were able to identify
            advantages like being able to self-soothe during stressful or depressive episodes,
            or shared happy moments with the ESA, but there were also ongoing criticisms of existing
            policies, specifically regarding the number and types of animals and their movement.
            The findings of the study offer translatable lessons on how to better disseminate
            information about ESAs, about how to foster community-building efforts, and about
            how to increase communication and outreach between residents. Among these, certain
            suggestions might include developing targeted educational sessions, enhancing avenues
            of knowledge dissemination, and perhaps even rethinking or amending ESA rules so as
            to cultivate more close-knit and supportive campuses. The findings address many important
            knowledge gaps, ensure compliance with federal law and campus policies, and encourage
            community. With appropriate college and university policies, guidelines and supports
            in place, uncertainty surrounding the rights of ESAs in on-campus housing complexities
            can be resolved, ensuring institutions may provide greater continuity of care for
            students experiencing mental illness and create campuses that are friendly for both
            students and ESAs.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Short Take-Off and Vertical Landing (STOVL) aircraft achieve the required lift by
            vectoring thrust toward the ground. These jets impinging on the ground exhibit strong
            resonance induced by a feedback mechanism, consisting of downstream-traveling large-scale
            coherent structures and upstream-propagating acoustic waves. Consequently, this resonance
            produces a highly unsteady flowfield, leading to high noise levels, harmful structural
            vibrations, and significant lift loss. Moreover, the presence of multiple impinging
            jets leads to the generation of a fountain flow, which further adds to the complexity
            of the flowfield dynamics. Understanding the flowfield and applying effective flow
            control methods are essential to reducing these negative consequences for STOVL aircraft.In
            the present study, the flowfields of a single supersonic M1.5 jet in over-expanded,
            ideally-expanded, and under-expanded conditions (NPR = 3, 3.67, and 4.5, respectively)
            are examined. For dual impinging jets, the configurations include a Mach 1.5 supersonic
            jet paired with an additional sonic jet at NPRs of 2 and 3. The goal of effectively
            controlling the inherent resonance for this flow is achieved through the use of microjet
            arrays. This requires a better understanding of the properties and parameters governing
            this flow, which was achieved through a systematic study of first single and then
            dual jets using a variety of experimental and analytical tools. Firstly, the influence
            of microjet hardware on acoustics, both passive and active, is examined across a wide
            range of impingement distances (H/D from 0.75 to 10) at a fine resolution (D/16).
            This approach enables a precise quantification and in-depth characterization of resonance
            phenomena. Findings indicate that the use of external microjets, which inject into
            the jet shear layer near the nozzle exit, proves less effective for the over-expanded
            jet condition at NPR of 3. Consequently, the over-expanded Mach 1.5 supersonic jet
            condition at NPR = 3 is selected as the representative condition, given the challenge
            in attenuating jet resonance at this condition. At selected impingement distances,
            schlieren flow visualization and stereo particle image velocimetry (SPIV) are employed
            to further elucidate the flow dynamics and the impact of this control technique. Furthermore,
            an in-depth analysis is conducted to enhance the understanding of the role of large-scale
            coherent structures in jet resonance. Despite the importance of large-scale coherent
            structures, also referred to as disturbances, comprehensive discussion on the disturbance
            convection velocity has been limited due to the challenges posed by nonintrusive measurement
            requirements. To determine the convection velocity of disturbances in the jet shear
            layer, high-speed schlieren flow visualization is carried out, and phase bin-averaged
            wave diagrams are constructed from the image sets. A parametric analysis is performed
            to examine the influence of nozzle pressure ratio on the convection velocity and phase
            lead/lag at specific impingement distances. The results reveal that the impingement
            tonal frequency is nearly independent of the disturbance convection velocity, except
            in cases of staging behavior. A slower downstream convection velocity of the disturbance
            corresponds to larger coherent structures, resulting in increased noise levels. Based
            on the observation of acoustic standing waves, an acoustic speed-based frequency model
            has been proposed. With the help of the allowable frequency range calculated from
            the vortex-sheet model, this model can provide a good approximation for the majority
            of axisymmetric impingement tonal frequencies. To enhance the noise reduction capabilities
            of microjet control, additional microjets have been introduced into the diverging
            section of the supersonic nozzle along with the externally installed microjets. The
            control system for microjet pressure and on/off status has been further upgraded,
            and a genetic algorithm has been utilized at selected impingement distances to optimize
            the microjet configuration for noise reduction. This optimized approach, especially
            with the staggered microjet configuration, has led to significant noise reduction
            achievements, including a reduction of over 12 dB in OASPL and up to 32 dB in impingement
            tones at specific impingement distances. Most notably, the optimized microjet configuration
            has effectively attenuated impingement tones across the entire scanned range of impingement
            distances (H/D from 0.75 to 10), covering over-expanded, ideally-expanded, and under-expanded
            jet conditions. Furthermore, the response of lift loss to microjet control across
            a range of impingement distances under different NPR conditions has been evaluated.
            Lift loss was assessed by measuring pressures on the lower surface of the lift plate.
            Microjet control has been shown to effectively reduce lift loss at lower impingement
            distances. For instance, lift loss at an H/D of 0.75 reaches up to 8% of the nozzle's
            isentropic thrust, which is decreased to 3% upon activating microjet control. Conversely,
            activating microjet control at higher impingement distances slightly increases lift
            loss. In-depth analyses of turbulence intensity distribution were conducted, revealing
            that the presence of large-scale coherent structures in the wall jet significantly
            contributes to higher lift loss. Furthermore, microjet control is observed to increase
            entrainment locally near the nozzle exit. In dual jets configurations, the acoustic
            characteristics and the response to external microjet control on the supersonic nozzle
            are examined for both dissimilar and matching NPR conditions. For the dissimilar NPR
            condition, the supersonic nozzle operates at an NPR of 3, while the sonic nozzle is
            set to an NPR of 2. In contrast, in the matching NPR condition, both nozzles operate
            at an NPR of 3. Modal decomposition techniques are utilized on time-resolved schlieren
            image sets to elucidate the interactions between the jets. Microjet control applied
            in the dual jets configuration has demonstrated better noise attenuation across an
            extended range of impingement distances, in contrast to its application on a single
            jet configuration, which showed effectiveness within a more limited range of impingement
            distances. Volumetric flowfields of both dissimilar and matching NPR configurations
            have been reconstructed using the scanning Stereo Particle Image Velocimetry (scanning-SPIV)
            technique. Additionally, oil surface visualization on the impingement surface has
            been performed, providing a detailed perspective on the flowfield. To the best of
            this author's knowledge, these volumetric, whole field measurements are the first
            of their kind for this complex flowfield. The highly-resolved velocity field provides
            unique insights into the three-dimensional flow dynamics and the intricate interactions
            between the fountain flow and the jet shear layer. Furthermore, in the dual jets configurations,
            the responses of acoustic performance and lift loss to the optimized microjet configuration,
            initially determined for a single jet condition, are evaluated over a range of impingement
            distances.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The vertebrate neural retina acts as a light detector, where photons are transduced
            into chemical and electrical signals at the brain. Phototransduction takes place in
            the photoreceptor cell outer segment (OS). Rods are responsible for dim light vision;
            cones are responsible for color vision and high spatial resolution. Visual information
            is transmitted from photoreceptor synapses to bipolar cells in the inner retina. The
            signal is encoded in the ribbon synapses of these two types of retinal neurons. Humans
            rely upon cone vision. Most mammalian models are nocturnal, and their retinas are
            rod-dominated. Zebrafish has emerged as a powerful model for studying gene function
            and neural development. Zebrafish is diurnal; cone out-number rods in twenty-to-one
            in larval retina. Behavior assays have shown that zebrafish are largely dependent
            on cone vision. My projects utilized zebrafish as genetic models to investigate the
            role of the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor
            (SNARE) complex in cone and bipolar cells. The SNARE complex is a central membrane
            fusion machinery that is essential for synaptic transmission and membrane trafficking.
            Mutations in SNARE proteins have been implicated in microvillus inclusion disease
            (MVID) and a spectrum of neuronal developmental disorder such as encephalopathy and
            retina dystrophy. The t-SNARE protein syntaxin-3 (Stx3) and syntaxin-binding protein-1
            (Stxbp1) are exclusively expressed in the photoreceptor and bipolar cell of the retina.
            Stx3 is crucial for photoreceptor development, rod OS morphogenesis, and synaptic
            vesicle exocytosis in ribbon synapses, whereas the role of Stxbp1 in the retina is
            largely unknown. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) have emerged as a powerful model organism
            for studying gene function. Whole genome duplication has resulted in two STX3 ohnologues
            in zebrafish, Stx3a (Chr.1) and Stx3b (Chr.14). Utilizing the CRISPR-Cas9 targeting
            system in the zebrafish model, my studies have demonstrated that Stx3a is specifically
            essential for cone development and cone-driven vision, whereas Stx3b ensures the signal
            transmission fidelity of bipolar cells. Our previous study found that Stxbp1b, a Stxbp1
            ortholog in zebrafish, is essential for photoreceptor survival. I have shown that
            Stxbp1b is crucial for the protein stability of both Stx3 ohnologs in zebrafish. Collectively,
            my studies demonstrate that the subfunctionalization of Stx3 ohnologs in photoreceptors
            and bipolar cells, along with their chaperone Stxbp1b, are essential for cone vision
            in zebrafish.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Northern high-latitude freshwater systems are an essential link between terrestrial
            and marine carbon cycles, transporting organic matter from ecosystems on land to the
            Arctic Ocean. However, polar regions are warming faster than the global average due
            to anthropogenic climate change, potentially releasing hundreds of tons of carbon
            currently stored in peatland and permafrost soils. Arctic ecosystem dynamics are also
            changing under continued warming, and changing land cover and hydrology will alter
            the amount and composition of organic matter exported by surface waters. Dissolved
            organic matter (DOM) is a crucial component of the carbon cycle, with the global DOM
            pool rivaling the amount of carbon stored in the atmosphere. The composition of DOM
            is fundamentally linked to its reactivity and, as such, partially determines whether
            mobilized DOM will be mineralized and released as greenhouse gases or stored on long
            time scales in marine systems. Understanding DOM dynamics in Arctic freshwater systems
            is thus crucial to understanding the impacts of climate change.This dissertation investigates
            DOM sources, molecular composition, and processing pathways across the pan-Arctic
            watershed and uses a suite of investigative tools, including optical measurements,
            Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS), and spatial
            analysis, to investigate how a changing Arctic landscape may impact DOM dynamics.
            The research focused on four distinct areas: refining dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
            fluxes from the pan-Arctic watershed, characterizing the influences of peatland cover
            and permafrost on exported DOM, evaluating how DOM composition and microbial community
            influence the processing of DOM, and characterizing the composition and reactivity
            of DOM from non-vascular plant sources. DOM composition varied across ecosystems,
            reflecting the chemodiversity inherent to this carbon cycle component. In the Onega
            River, a relatively small and understudied high-latitude river, DOM exhibited a uniquely
            terrestrial signature throughout the year with muted seasonal changes, contrasting
            with the dramatic seasonality of DOM composition in larger watersheds. Scaling data
            from the Onega River increased the estimated pan-Arctic annual DOC flux by approximately
            50% from previously reported estimates, suggesting that including smaller watersheds
            is important for improving pan-Arctic modeling estimates. The Onega River watershed
            is unique from the six largest Arctic rivers by being permafrost-free and having a
            large proportion of its area covered by wetlands; thus, its unique molecular signature
            is likely driven by these landscape features. The relationship between these landscape
            features and DOM composition is explicitly revealed through an analysis of DOM composition
            across a latitudinal gradient in West Siberia, demonstrating that peatland extent
            and permafrost influence have observable impacts on DOM exported by rivers. DOM composition
            from permafrost-free watersheds exhibited greater variability, higher molecular weight,
            and a more terrestrial signature than permafrost-influenced watersheds. Peatland extent
            explained much of the variance in measured variables, with watersheds with greater
            peatland extent exhibiting more heterogenous DOM composition. However, permafrost
            effectively acts as a switch on this peatland influence, and so these data demonstrate
            that DOM from previously permafrost-influenced watersheds may become more heterogeneous
            and exhibit a more terrestrial signature as permafrost thaw continues. A novel bioincubation
            experiment was conducted to explore further how these landscape features and their
            impacts on DOM composition affect DOM biolability and to determine whether the introduction
            of microbes from one type of soil to another impact DOC loss over time. Leachates
            created from two wetland depths of wetland soil and soil from two ages of permafrost
            at distinct filtration levels allowed for the simulation of the mobilization and potential
            mixing of DOM and microbes from these sources under continued permafrost thaw. Data
            from these bioincubations demonstrated that the source and composition of DOM, not
            the microbial community, was the factor that determined DOM biolability and processing.
            Pleistocene permafrost produced compositionally unique DOM that exhibited an approximately
            70% DOC loss rate over time, highlighting the high bioavailability of DOM mobilized
            as these deposits thaw. Warming not only affects permafrost but impacts the distribution
            of vegetation on the landscape. Lignin phenol analysis and optical measurements of
            individual moss and lichen leachates were conducted to explore how shrub expansion
            and associated loss of moss and lichen cover in the Arctic may impact DOM dynamics.
            Moss leachates produced high concentrations of biolabile DOM enriched in p-hydroxy
            phenols; however, the general aromaticity of the DOM and not the phenol composition
            appeared to be the primary driver of DOC loss over time. Overall, these data characterized
            DOC export and DOM composition across a wide range of sources and regions in the pan-Arctic
            watershed and highlight the need for further research to continue elucidating DOM
            dynamics in the Arctic.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Tropical cyclones (TCs) are observed in general circulation models (GCMs) as well
            as reanalyses. However, itis known that GCMs and reanalyses struggle to accurately
            represent TCs and have biases in the TC frequency and intensity distributions. By
            employing the column-integrated moist static energy (MSE) variance budget as a process-oriented
            diagnostic, we can analyze the model representation of physical processes that help
            or hinder the development of TCs. Specifically, we analyze the radiative and surface
            flux feedback terms within the MSE variance budget across 5 different reanalysis datasets
            and 19 different GCM simulations. Binning and compositing of TC snapshots by maximum
            velocity and minimum sea level pressure allows for comparison across the GCMs and
            reanalyses of the feedbacks at a given intensity, as well as an examination of how
            the feedbacks vary with storm intensity. We find that the surface flux feedback on
            TC development is weaker in coupled models. Ocean coupling also influences radiative
            feedbacks, because the TC-induced sea surface temperature (SST) cooling reduces the
            surface upward longwave radiative flux. Across all models, the longwave radiative
            feedback positively contributes to TC development and is driven by cloud effects.
            Models differ regarding the role of the shortwave radiative feedback, though it is
            generally smaller than the longwave. Regarding the intermodel spread in surface flux
            and radiative feedbacks at a given intensity, models with coarse resolution differ
            more from each other and from reanalyses than those with high resolution. These results
            can help us understand how differences in model representation of physical processes
            lead to model differences in TC intensity.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Johannes Kepler's Tabula III in the Mysterium Cosmographicum (1596), printed in Kepler's
            dissertation at the University of Tübingen, is a diagram containing the spheres in
            space and the geometric figures that determine the proportional spaces between them.
            By utilizing the method of visualization taught through images in texts of astronomy
            published in northern Europe in the early modern period to introduce his new geometric
            model of the universe, Kepler solidified visualization as a necessary component of
            viewing astronomical models. Because astronomical models of the 16th century did not
            visually support the investigation of metaphysics, Kepler created a model that would
            allow the viewer to investigate such matters. I argue that in doing so, Kepler created
            an object-diagram that not only animates the viewer's visualization of space, but
            also its celestial mechanics. Additionally, the diagram sits upon a sculptural, geometric
            base, which has not been addressed in art historical treatments of the image. Using
            a semiotic analysis of the individual components of the diagram, the relationships

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>I Play All the Parts is more than a collection of poetry—it is best read as a contemporary
            verse drama, pulling from traditions as early as antiquity. The text explores questions
            regarding motherhood, daughterhood, womanhood, selfhood, cycles of generational trauma,
            sexuality, and gender identity formation and performance as it tests the limits of
            speakers' embodiment and mental (un)wellness and indicts patriarchal, capitalist,
            fascist, sociopolitical systems, such as the contemporary American nuclear family,
            healthcare, and government systems, all of which impose inequities that prove not
            only traumatic but debilitating for these characters. I Play All the Parts emerges
            to address a grave need to dramatize disidentifying discourse in fictive speakers'
            embodied experiences. As queer-femme, neurodivergent bodies wrangle with the imposed
            realities of anti-choice legislation and the criminalizing of survivors of assault
            and other abuses of systemic patriarchal power, I Play All the Parts necromances networks
            of occult rituals that establish politically potent and transgressive identities,
            thereby repairing and (re)animating defunct forms via a community chorus of performative
            polyvocality.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Thermal management is crucial in everyday life across a range of applications, influencing
            our safety, comfort, and efficiency of various technologies. Composite material combines
            different materials to achieve a mutually unique property that cannot be achieved
            by one homogenous material. Composite material used for thermal management offers
            a unique opportunity to enhance overall thermal performance. Composite material is
            a key player in addressing challenges related to heat dissipation and temperature
            control due to its ability of incorporating lightweight and thermal properties. In
            this dissertation, we developed a numerical finite-difference model for 2D transient
            diffusion in lamellar structures. The explicit application is heat transfer, but it
            could equally be applied to dielectric constants, magnetic susceptibilities, electron/ion
            conduction, and mass diffusion as well. The control volume contains two phases A and
            B. The phases have different transport parameters. The modeling aims to evaluate the
            effect of grain size, grain boundaries, and phase contrast on apparent transport properties
            of composite materials, such as laminates, polycrystalline materials, and block copolymers,
            by examining a progression of increasingly complex structures. To validate the model,
            effective transport parameters of parallel and perpendicular structures from the numerical
            model are compared to analytical expressions. Effective Medium Theory provides an
            analytical expression in the limit of many, small, randomly oriented grains. The impact
            of coarse grains on transport is investigated. Specifically, the model is used to
            examine how the apparent transport parameters trend from the limit of a homogeneous
            material to small randomly oriented grains containing two different phases. The effective
            thermal conductivity (averaged over many random structures) was found not to be a
            function of grain size. However, the standard deviation decreased exponentially with
            decreasing grain size, reaching less than 2% variation for transport through 15 grains.
            Thus, the appropriate Effective Medium prediction is reliable for a surprisingly few
            number of grains, and connectivity of the more conducting phase is important only
            in coarse grains with significant contrast. In addition to the 2D lamellar model structure,
            we focus on examining the impact that geometric structure has on the thermal conductivity
            of multi-phase constructs in multiple 3D-printed PLA samples. We explore alternative
            structural configurations beyond planar arrangements, specifically we focus on cylindrical
            and gyroid shapes. We investigate how various infill percentages and infill materials
            influence the thermal conductivity of these structures. By precisely controlling the
            infill percentages and incorporating different infill materials with varying thermal
            conductivities, PLA samples can be tailored to simulate various thermal conductivity
            contrasts observed in practical applications. In this study, we explore the thermal
            conductivity of PLA structures with different infill percentages and two distinct
            infill materials: air and thermal paste. Air represents the least conductive material
            at 0.026 W/(m K), and thermal paste exhibits high thermal conductivity at 5 W/(m K).
            The experimental results are compared to an analytical model prediction to confirm
            the efficacy of the model in predicting the thermal performance of these complex structures.
            Finally, the design of advanced composite nanostructured material requires a fundamental
            understanding of material behavior at several length scales from nanometer to macroscopic,
            linked by mesoscopic structure and dynamics. In this work, the structure and dynamics
            of high molecular weight polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (PS-b-PEO) block copolymers
            (BCPs) were studied. The BCPs exhibited microphase separated cylindrical and lamellar
            morphologies. Structural dynamics were measured with X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy
            (XPCS) in the small-angle regime. Morphologies and domain sizes were evaluated using
            small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and atomic
            force microscopy (AFM). The PS-b-PEO grain size was controlled by different processing
            conditions, a combination of solvent vapor annealing during solution casting and thermal
            annealing, were investigated. The grain sizes were evaluated using SAXS, were found
            to depend weakly on processing only for the rubbery majority BCP and the results showed
            that the grain size variation depends on which block formed the matrix majority. The
            structural relaxation times were examined as a function of PS volume fraction, temperature,
            morphology, and structural sizes. Well above the glass transition temperature (Tg)
            of PS, all samples exhibited stretched autocorrelation decays and diffusive dynamics.
            Near Tg of PS the dynamics of all samples was anomalous with compressed autocorrelation
            decays and hyperdiffusive dynamics. This transition occurred at 153 °C or 1.13 Tg
            of PS. Surprisingly, the structural relaxation times do not correlate with grain size,
            indicating that PS dynamics and out-of-equilibrium state play the dominant roles in
            structural dynamics of these strongly phase segregated BCPs.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>University instructors often lack the knowledge and skills to effectively facilitate
            learning and teaching in the online environment. Instructors in higher education institutions
            (HEIs) have faced common challenges to online teaching, such as a lack of digital
            literacy, access to software and hardware resources and training, and pedagogical
            and content-related concerns. The rapid transition to fully online teaching necessitated
            by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic brought many of these instructional issues to
            the foreground; however, online teaching also encompasses the integration of online
            tools into traditional classroom environments, as well as blended or hybrid instructional
            formats. In this dissertation, I define online teaching broadly to include all such
            formats of online teaching. In this multiple-case study, I aimed to investigate the
            online teaching challenges of higher education instructors in Hong Kong and to examine
            the approaches to professional learning these instructors took in order to address
            the challenges they encountered. I employed qualitative methods in this study, including
            conducting individual semi-structured interviews with instructors working at a tertiary
            university in Hong Kong that specializes in teacher education and collecting artifacts
            from the participants that related to their professional learning experiences. I found
            that instructors experienced online teaching challenges that encompassed content-related,
            pedagogy-related, technology-related, and motivational factors, thereby providing
            insights for both practice and future research into improving online teaching competencies
            and experiences for instructors. My findings highlight the importance of integrating
            both formal and informal professional learning approaches to address online instruction
            challenges. Formal professional development (PD) programs, such as university workshops
            and certificate courses, provided structured learning opportunities for instructors.
            Informal PD through social media platforms and professional networks facilitated collaborative
            learning and knowledge sharing, and was often engaged in to supplement formal PD.
            The integration of both formal and informal PD approaches was suggested to provide
            a comprehensive and personalized professional learning experience. Furthermore, I
            adopted Activity Systems Analysis (ASA) as a framework to analyze my findings regarding
            the professional learning strategies of higher education instructors in response to
            their online teaching challenges. The research implications of ASA included investigating
            the compensatory role of informal PD, understanding the time-intensive nature of informal
            PD tasks, exploring customization possibilities for software tools, and examining
            the impact of mandatory informal PD on instructors' workloads.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This dissertation examines the distinct motivational variables that impact philanthropic
            contributions among millennial graduates of Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University
            (FAMU). This study focuses on examining the philanthropic behaviors of millennial
            graduates from FAMU, with a particular emphasis on understanding the significant impact
            of alumni gifts on preserving and improving the quality of education and facilities
            at institutions. This study uses a qualitative methodology to collect comprehensive
            and detailed data by conducting in-depth interviews. The main aim of the study is
            to determine the principal reasons that drive younger alumni to make financial contributions
            to their alma mater. This study analyzes the interaction between different factors,
            including personal connection, perceived influence of donations, alumni involvement,
            and communication tactics employed by the university. The data demonstrate an intricate
            and diverse array of motivators. A strong emotional connection to FAMU arises from
            favorable experiences during undergraduate studies, exerting a significant influence.
            Nevertheless, the study also reveals a significant inclination among millennials towards
            openness and concrete outcomes resulting from their contributions. The research additionally
            suggests that this generation highly values communications and efforts that are specifically
            tailored to their personal and professional objectives. The dissertation ends with
            strategic suggestions for FAMU to successfully involve millennial alumni. The approach
            supports the advancement of customized communication tactics, cultivating an ongoing
            and significant bond with former students, and establishing specific donation avenues
            that align with the values and interests of the millennial generation. These tactics
            are crucial for improving millennial alumni donations at FAMU and can also offer significant
            insights for other colleges aiming to foster a culture of philanthropy among younger
            alumni groups.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>1,4-Dioxane is a synthetic chemical used as a stabilizer of chlorinated solvents and
            as a solvent in several industrial processes and commercial products. It is identified
            as an emerging water contaminant and classified as "likely to be carcinogenic to humans".
            Removal of 1,4-dioxane from wastewater is challenging due to its high water solubility,
            low Henry's law volatility constant, and low partition coefficients. Bioremediation
            is a promising treatment method for removing 1,4-dioxane from water as it is potentially
            eco-friendly and cost-effective. Some microorganisms can use 1,4-dioxane as a sole
            carbon and energy source, and the degradation of 1,4-dioxane can be enhanced when
            primary substrates are provided to promote microbial growth. The main objective of
            this research was to investigate the co-metabolic biodegradation of 1,4-dioxane. The
            first objective focused on kinetic parameters for ethane biodegradation and co-oxidations
            of ethane and 1,4-dioxane. Based on experiments combined with mathematical modeling,
            it was found that ethane promoted 1,4-dioxane biodegradation when the initial mass
            ratio of ethane:1,4-dioxane was &lt;9:1 mg-COD/mg-COD, while it inhibited 1,4-dioxane
            degradation when the ratio was &gt;9:1. A model-independent parameter estimator was used
            for kinetic-parameter estimation, and all parameter values for 1,4-dioxane were consistent
            with literature-reported ranges. The results support that bacteria that co-oxidize
            ethane- and 1,4-dioxane had a competitive advantage over bacteria that can use only
            one of the two substrates. The minimum 1,4-dioxane concentration required to sustain
            steady-state biomass with 1,4-dioxane as the sole primary substrate was 1.3 mg-COD/L.
            As 1,4-dioxane concentrations at most groundwater sites are less than 0.18 mg-COD/L,
            providing ethane as a primary substrate is vital to enhance biomass growth and 1,4-dioxane
            bioremediation. The second objective investigated the biodegradation of 1,4-dioxane
            using ethane as a primary substrate in an O2-based membrane biofilm reactor (O2-MBfR).
            Based on more than 800 days of continuous operation of two O2-MBfRs with different
            influent ethane concentrations over the various stages, it was found that an ethane:1,4-dioxane
            mole ratio of around 300:1 was required to remove 1,4-dioxane from 100 µg/L to ~10
            µg/L and from 10 µg/L to 2 µg/L. Results from the microbial community analysis showed
            that Rhodococcus and Mycobacterium were the two dominant genera in both MBfRs. The
            third objective of this research was to investigate the biodegradation of ethane and
            1,4-dioxane in the O2-MBfR by developing a mathematical model. A higher ethane supply
            resulted in biofilm growth, with the biofilm's active biomass dominated by ethane-
            and 1,4-dioxane-co-oxidizing bacteria. At &gt;200:1 ethane to 1,4-dioxane mole ratio
            and &lt;1.9 mg m-2 d-1 1,4-dioxane loadings, the 1,4-dioxane removal was &gt;70%. On the
            other hand, high ethane (&gt;300:1 ethane to 1,4-dioxane mole ratio) at high 1,4-dioxane
            loadings (&gt;4 mg m-2 d-1) inhibited 1,4-dioxane biodegradation to &lt;30%. The findings
            underscore that at low 1,4-dioxane loadings, ethane is an essential primary substrate
            to maintain sufficient biofilm growth for 1,4-dioxane degradation. In the fourth objective,
            1,4-dioxane-metabolizing mixed cultures were enriched by periodically spiking 1,4-dioxane
            at low concentrations (&lt;1 mg/L). Five 1,4-dioxane-metabolizing pure cultures LCD6B,
            LCD6D, WC10G, WCD6H, and WD4H were isolated and characterized. The partial 16S rRNA
            gene sequencing showed that the five strains were related to Dokdonella sp. (98.3%),
            Acinetobacter sp. (99.0%), Afipia sp. (99.2%), Nitrobacter sp. (97.9%), and Pseudonocardia
            sp. (99.4%), respectively. Compared to the literature, these strains have lower half-maximum-rate
            concentrations (1.8 to 8.2 mg-dioxane/L), lower maximum specific 1,4-dioxane utilization
            rates (0.24 to 0.47 mg-dioxane/mg-protein d)), higher biomass yields (0.29 to 0.38
            mg-protein/mg-dioxane), and lower decay coefficients (0.01 to 0.02 d-1). These are
            characteristics of microorganisms living in oligotrophic environments. Although the
            adsorption kinetics and isotherms of several water pollutants have been widely studied,
            little is known about the adsorption kinetics of 1,4-dioxane. In the fifth objective,
            the kinetics of 1,4-dioxane adsorption by AmberSorb and Granular Activated Carbon
            (GAC) were investigated. A homogeneous surface diffusion model was developed to describe
            the adsorption of 1,4-dioxane in continuous flow and batch systems. The external mass-transfer
            and internal diffusion coefficients of 1,4-dioxane for AmberSorb (1.79x10-3 cm/min
            and 3.52x10-4 cm2/min) were determined about five- and thirty-fold larger than that
            of their corresponding parameters for GAC. For both adsorbents, the adsorption was
            limited by the mass-transfer across the fluid film that covers the adsorbent and the
            adsorbent-adsorbate interaction at the adsorbent surface but not limited by the diffusion
            within the adsorbent. While the mass-transfer across the external fluid film affected
            the maximum 1,4-dioxane removal percentage and the adsorption rate, the isotherm parameters
            mainly controlled the adsorption capacity and adsorbent service life.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This research studied an approach for the characterization of tensile properties of
            continuous carbon nanotube (CNT) yarns to potentially use as the primary composite
            reinforcement in aerospace applications. A standard approach was developed for the
            tensile testing of CNT yarn materials better representing their engineering mechanical
            performance compared to small gauge length tests. CNT yarns were tested under environmental
            conditions and test parameters to determine their tensile property ranges to improve
            the mechanical performance of CNT yarns and CNT yarn-based microcomposites. The effects
            of thermal and mechanical treatments on the tensile properties were investigated.
            The results show the limiting factors of CNT yarn tensile performance are poor load
            transfer ability, shear failure mode, and limited resin infiltration. The research
            provides valuable insights to understand tensile properties and behaviors of high

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This work explores the effects of changing the Cu:Sn ratio in Nb3Sn Rod in Tube (RIT)
            wires togain a better understanding of the Cu-Sn mixing process prior to Nb3Sn formation.
            Internal Tin Nb3Sn wires like the Rod Restack Process ®(RRP) always have complexities
            associated with the Cu-Sn mixing steps. Imperfect mixing compromises the ultimate
            performance of the wire. From this point of view RIT wires are of special interest
            because all the Cu and Sn is contained within one tubular filament that in principle
            offers a simplified window into the mixing and subsequent A15 layer growth. Here we
            examined wires with Cu:Sn atomic ratios of 3:1 and 6:5. We tested new multistep heat
            treatments motivated by the Cu-Sn phase diagram, observing both Cu-Sn and A15 phase
            formation around key transition temperatures. Problems with eliminating low Sn α phase
            compositions from RIT wires with a Cu:Sn ratio of 3:1 were previously discussed by
            Segal et al [1]. and here his experiments were extended by using higher temperature
            Cu-Sn mixing steps above 500C. Using the heat treatment step 525◦C/96h, we were able
            to eliminate the α phase at the Nb-Core interface prior to the A15 reaction step by
            completely mixing the Cu-Sn core. However, this achievement did not lead to improved
            properties like we initially expected. In some cases, wires with worse CuSn mixing
            prior to A15 formation step had better properties than those with a mixed core. None
            of these wires produced good superconducting properties when compared to other common
            wire designs RRP, PIT, and the Bronze process. However, the internal Cu:Sn ratio is
            seen to influence the superconducting properties. Wires with an internal Cu:Sn ratio
            of 3:1 significantly underperform compared to the wires with the starting composition
            of 6:5. We found that the reaction path for 3:1 (and bronze wires) avoids the nausite
            phase (generally thought to be deleterious to Jc) always found in RRP wires while
            the 6:5 wire reaction always went through nausite with decomposition into NbSn2, Nb6Sn5
            and then A15 at high temperatures. Furthermore we recorded that a key difference between
            RIT and RRP is that RIT exhibits a larger spread in the normal to superconducting
            transition curve following the same heat treatment. This transition was shown to be
            a result of gradients in at%Sn across the Nb3Sn layer.</p>

            epic woman-spreading through a Y2K kingdom that houses a Lolita Army, Shitshow Barbie,

            "rummages for loveliness" in works as broad as those by Emily Dickinson, René Magritte,
            and Yorgos Lanthimos and navigates situationships with "Orpheus fuckboy[s]," cultivating
            a nomenclature all her own—nimble, lush, rhythmic verse that restlessly seeks to answer,
            "what is my / true utterance?" In the wake of #MeToo, the dismantling of Roe v. Wade,
            and the increasing climate threat, she dissects any yearning for potential motherhood,

            is a coming-of-age poetry collection that follows a speaker from pre-birth to girlhood,

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The need for increased efficiency and performance of high-speed aircraft has led to
            the need for a reduction in aircraft weight. One option is to use thinner and lightweight
            skin panels at different regions of the aircraft, such as the fuselage, wings, engine
            inlet, and control surfaces. When such an aircraft operates at high speeds, the shock
            wave generated or impinging on those surfaces interacts with the surface boundary
            layer, leading to the well-known phenomenon of shock wave boundary layer interactions
            (SBLI). SBLI on rigid surfaces has been heavily researched in the past and a sufficient
            understanding of parameters affecting SBLI has been obtained, including its detrimental
            effects on the flight vehicle. However, there is a lack of sufficient understanding
            of the effects of SBLI over thin surface panels that led to fluid-structure interactions
            (FSI) and high cycle fatigue damage of flight vehicles and detrimental effects on
            the lives of the crew operating on such missions. Previous studies have shown that
            FSI on a compliant panel is a highly coupled problem depending on several parameters
            such as the shock impingement location, pressure and temperature gradients, shock
            strength, boundary layer thickness, Mach number, material properties, etc., and therefore
            difficult to analyze compared to the SBLI on a rigid surface. The present study aims
            to decouple the effect of some of these parameters to simplify the analysis and better
            understand FSI at high-speeds. In this experimental investigation, one parameter is
            varied at a time to study its effect on the mean and dynamic characteristics of FSI
            on a compliant panel at supersonic speeds. Experiments were carried out at the Florida
            Center for Advanced Aero-Propulsion (FCAAP) supersonic and Pilot wind tunnels. The
            model geometry consists of a compliant panel with a cavity on its underside embedded
            in the tunnel wall. The cavity was pressurized to different values simulating various
            flight conditions, resulting in different levels of static deflection of the panel.
            The panel was subjected to an impinging shock generated by a shock generator at two
            locations, namely, the central and 3/4$^{th}$ length of the panel and three cavity
            pressures equal to ambient, upstream static, and vacuum were tested. In addition,
            the effect of two shock strengths (by varying the shock angle), two Mach numbers (M
            = 2, 5), and two boundary layer thicknesses were studied. Several flow diagnostic
            techniques such as high-speed shadowgraph, surface oil flow measurements, panel deflection
            measurements, and steady and unsteady pressure-sensitive paint measurements were employed
            to study the mean and dynamic flow features of the interaction. The results show that
            the interaction over the panel is curved or three-dimensional, compared to the nominally
            two-dimensional interaction over a rigid plate. The level of curvature of the interaction
            or the separation line is a function of the shock impingement location and the cavity
            pressure. The mean separation bubble length along the panel centerline was modified
            in the case of interaction over the panel compared to the rigid plate. An increased
            width of the upstream influence region was observed in the case of the compliant panel
            compared to the rigid plate for most of the cases tested, indicating increased unsteadiness.
            The centerline pressure distributions over the panel are a strong function of the
            shock impingement location and pressure gradient across the panel. The response of
            the panel to the turbulent boundary layer at supersonic speeds was observed to be
            multi-modal and excited by the turbulent structures within the boundary layer of varying
            lengths and time scales. Compared to the natural structural modes of the panel, these
            interaction modes were observed to shift to relatively higher frequencies. In the
            presence of an impinging shock, some modes were amplified, indicating a strong coupling
            between the panel and the shock. An increase in frequency was also observed compared
            to the no-shock case, for both shock impingement locations and all cavity pressures.
            This may be due to the increased forcing generated by the shock impingement. For a
            fixed shock impingement location, the effect of the cavity pressure was to amplify
            and excite different modes of the panel. While the higher cavity pressures excite
            the lower order modes, the case with cavity at vacuum was observed to excite higher
            order modes. The pressure spectra corresponding to cavity at vacuum is relatively
            broadband indicating reduced coupling. For a fixed shock strength, an increase in
            the boundary layer thickness was observed to increase the separation bubble length
            over the rigid plate and the compliant panel. The sensitivity of the separation line
            to cavity pressure modification was observed to increase in the case of a thicker
            boundary layer. The mean separation bubble length was observed to increase with an
            increase in the shock strength for the panel as well as rigid plate interaction. Considerable
            progress has been made toward addressing the objectives of the current study. The
            remainder of the goals, namely the unsteady aspects of the fluid-structure interaction
            for an increased boundary layer thickness, Mach number, and shock strength, will be
            investigated. 3D deflection data obtained using LASER vibrometry, pressure using PSP,
            and velocity using PIV measurements will be further analyzed. The results from this
            study will help designers and analysts to design structures that can withstand the
            detrimental effects of the aeroelastic coupling encountered at high speeds. It will
            also aid in generating an experimental database for validating numerical solvers for
            FSI. It will help develop higher-order aeroelastic models with detailed structure
            modeling and separated flow effects using the reduced-order modeling approach.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Gold Rush Cherokees looks at the centrality of gold rushes to Cherokee history and
            the importance of Cherokees to the history of American gold rushes. More specifically,
            these chapters investigate Cherokees' lived experiences in the California gold mines
            and their discovery of gold in Colorado in the 1850s. After discovering gold in Georgia
            in the 1820s and then being forced to relinquish these claims, hundreds of Cherokee
            men and women became central actors in the more well-known gold rushes of the mid-nineteenth
            century. With the gold-mining skills and expertise Cherokees developed during the
            Georgia gold rush, many Cherokee men and women took the overland trail and set up
            gold mining companies in California in 1849 and 1850. A Cherokee company from Georgia
            was the first to discover gold at Pike's Peak, a discovery that launched the Colorado
            gold rush in 1858. Thus, as opportunities in California diminished, many joined other
            miners in the new mining communities in Colorado. In these western gold mining spaces,
            these refugees of colonization and removal became colonizers of the west. Some Cherokee
            miners made fortunes while participating in these gold rushes. However, most experienced
            hardships on the overland trails and in the mines, which led many of the Cherokee
            miners to return home to the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma, or to their communities
            in Georgia and North Carolina that had avoided removal.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>My Dissertation in Practice concentrated on sexual assault in community colleges with
            a focus on a mid-western community college. Sexual assault is a pervasive issue that
            has plagued higher education for years. The purpose of this quantitative descriptive
            exploratory research study was to explore students' knowledge and awareness of the
            policies and procedures with respect to sexual assault as well as support services
            available for victims of sexual assault in a community college setting. The purpose
            was to also to learn about students' perspectives on the usefulness of sexual assault
            training if they received training. The following research questions and sub-question
            guided the study: RQ 1: How knowledgeable and aware are the students at a Mid-Western
            community college of sexual assault?Sub-Question: Are there significant differences
            in knowledge and awareness of sexual assault based on the students' full-time or part-time
            status? RQ 2: What are the students' perspectives on the usefulness of sexual assault
            training at a Mid-Western community college? A quantitative approach was the chosen
            methodology for this study. The targeted participants were the freshman students.
            The data collection method for the study consisted of a noninterventional, anonymized,
            web-based survey. My findings concluded that 28 students did not receive sexual assault
            training. Most of the students were at least moderately knowledgeable (16) about how
            to report a sexual assault at this school but least aware (18) of where they can find
            24/7 support related to sexual assault. Findings highlighted opportunities for college
            officials at the mid-western community college to better explore ways to engage students'
            knowledge and awareness of sexual assault.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>By employing an organic theory that views theatre as a living body, this thesis explores
            how theatre has adapted to pandemics throughout history. It suggests that theatre,
            like the human body and mind, operates as a complex adaptive system, evolving in response
            to crises. The study examines three historical pandemics—the Athenian Plague, the
            Spanish Influenza, and COVID-19— through the theatre-as-body framework, highlighting
            theatre's resilience and healing role in society. This exploration reveals two remarkable
            adaptations within the theatre-as-body's immune system: catharsis as a purgative release,
            allowing audiences to emotionally cleanse themselves of collective trauma, and disavowal
            as a protective mechanism, enabling the theatrical space to momentarily distance spectators
            from the harsh realities and uncertainties of pandemics. This thesis emphasizes theatre's
            ability to creatively respond to challenging circumstances and, therefore, reinforce
            its cultural function.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Intensive parenting involves parents centering their children's needs, spending most
            of their free time engaging with them, and following the advice of child experts.
            Although most studies on intensive parenting have been qualitative, one group of researchers
            developed a quantitative measure for intensive parenting attitudes called the Intensive
            Parenting Attitudes Questionnaire (IPAQ). Studies have shown mixed results in terms
            of intensive parenting attitudes being linked with positive and negative outcomes.
            However, scholars have pointed to this construct as being rooted in White, middle-class
            ideals that are not necessarily accurate for parents with other identities and the
            IPAQ has failed to show measurement invariance across racial groups. The current literature
            lacks representation in understanding the experiences and effects of intensive parenting
            in racially and economically diverse populations, therefore, it is reasonable to question
            whether intensive parenting is a valid construct for all parents. This dissertation
            aimed to discover the extent to which this concept may or may not be inclusive for
            parents who do not identify as White and/or middle-class. Through theories of intensive
            parenting and intersectionality, this dissertation utilized a convergent mixed-method
            design to test the content validity of the IPAQ through a confirmatory factor analysis
            and measurement invariance analyses. Additionally, through semi-structured interviews,
            this study aimed to discover how key domains of intensive parenting were described.
            A racially, ethnically, and economically diverse sample of parents was recruited resulting
            in 465 participants for quantitative analyses, and 15 parents were selected for qualitative
            interviews. This study aimed to answer the following research questions: Among a racially
            and economically diverse sample of parents, what is the content validity of the IPAQ?
            And among a racially and economically diverse sample of parents, how are key domains
            of intensive parenting described? Through the confirmatory factor analysis, results
            indicated that the data did not fit the five-factor model of the IPAQ well. Seven
            alternative models were run to find better model fit and with one of these models,
            measurement invariance analyses were conducted. These tests revealed that the alternative
            model only showed configural invariance across racial groups but demonstrated scalar
            invariance across racial groups. Qualitative results suggested that intensive parenting
            is a relevant concept in a racially and economically diverse sample, as descriptions
            of the key domains were consistent with previous literature. The quantitative and
            qualitative data were merged through an integrative analysis to discover how results
            converged, diverged, and were expanded upon. These findings highlighted how contextual
            variables, such as race and socioeconomic status, played a key role in the quantitative
            and qualitative results. While intensive parenting appears to be an important construct
            in a racially and economically diverse sample, more research is needed to fully understand
            how to quantitatively measure intensive parenting attitudes, specifically for racially
            marginalized populations.</p>

            virtual lab simulations despite disparate results from previous investigations of
            student performance comparing virtual lab simulations with traditional laboratory
            teaching methods. The need to characterize performance holistically and evaluate a
            combination of virtual labs with traditional methods has prompted a paradigm shift.
            This dissertation aims to examine the effectiveness of a low immersive virtual chemistry
            pre-lab simulation that complements the traditional chemistry laboratory in achieving
            student cognitive and skill-based learning outcomes and student experiential satisfaction
            in the General chemistry I course. The student achievement measures include cognitive
            and skill-based outcomes, time on task, and student experiential satisfaction taken
            for two General chemistry I experiments. A quasi-experimental with repeated post-tests
            only with a control group research design is implemented at a Florida state college.
            A convenient sample of General chemistry I course sections is randomly assigned to
            either a combination of virtual pre-lab simulation with a traditional chemistry laboratory
            (treatment) or traditional pre-lab and chemistry laboratory (control). The covariance
            (ANCOVA) analysis of repeated cognitive and lab skills measures revealed that the
            treatment group significantly outperformed the control group in both cognitive post
            pre-lab tests. However, the control group attained the greatest increase in cognitive
            scores between the post pre-lab and post lab tests. The time of task revealed significant
            differences, though not consistently for the same group, highlighting a difference
            between laboratory topics. The lab-skills tests showed that both groups performed
            similarly with no significant difference suggesting that neither approach may have
            contributed to their lab skills development. Students also had similar experiential
            satisfaction with no significant difference between the virtual pre-lab simulation
            and the pre-lab in the traditional laboratory manual.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is a thermoplastic polymeric material that is chemically
            inert, vacuum compatible, has a low surface energy, and has a large operating temperature
            range due to its high melting temperature. PTFE is also the lowest friction bulk polymer,
            which has led to its use as a solid lubricant in a wide variety of application spaces
            including, but not limited to, friction modifiers in oils and greases and in low friction
            coatings. However, PTFE suffers from extremely high wear rates, which limits its ability
            to be used as a bulk solid lubricant material. The addition of filler materials to
            bulk PTFE has resulted in wear rates that are 10-10,000x lower than PTFE alone. There
            are several wear reducing mechanisms for PTFE composite materials that have been developed
            in previous studies, including: 1) the prevention of crack propagation and delamination
            of PTFE, 2) the mechanochemical alteration of the material at the sliding interface,
            and 3) the modification of the sliding interface through filler accumulation and inclusion,
            which reinforces the material at the sliding interface. This work seeks to further
            understand the wear reducing mechanisms for ultralow wear PTFE composite materials
            under varying contact conditions, and to develop process-structure-property relationships
            for a multi-polymer composite material, PTFE and poly ether ketone ketone (PEKK) blends,
            and link these relationships to fundamental wear mechanisms. In this work, an ultralow
            wear composite is developed - a PTFE-PEKK blend. PEKK is a thermoplastic polymeric
            material with excellent mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties but suffers from
            high friction and moderate wear. It is found that PTFE-PEKK composite materials can
            result in wear rates which are 1,000 – 10,000x lower than the wear rates of bulk PTFE,
            and low wear behavior can be produced at high weight percent loadings of PEKK. The
            wear and friction behaviors along with the mechanical and thermal properties of the
            composites are found to be dependent on the ratio of the content of PTFE and PEKK
            in the composite. The environmental sensitivity of the material was investigated,
            demonstrating that the wear reducing mechanisms of the composite do not depend as
            heavily on mechanochemically developed species at the interface that many other low
            wear PTFE composite materials rely on, but require the accumulation of PEKK at the
            sliding interface. This PTFE-PEKK composite material's structure and properties can
            be changed significantly through the thermal processing conditions that the material
            undergoes, which is found to be due in large part to a thermal degradation mechanism
            present in PEKK at temperatures necessary for processing PTFE and PEKK composite materials.
            Thermal degradation of the PEKK in the composites and subsequent crosslinking of the
            material leads to an increase in storage modulus of the composite, and a decrease
            in the viscous response of the composite with increasing temperature. Wear rate and
            friction coefficient are found to decrease with increasing thermal degradation of
            the PEKK in the composite. Other materials are investigated, including alumina particles
            and poly ether ether ketone (PEEK), which is a thermoplastic material within the same
            family of polyaryletherketones as PEKK. Wear and friction measurements, along with
            chemical analysis of the sliding interface using infrared spectroscopy, are performed
            on composites comprised of PTFE blended with PEEK and PTFE filled with alumina. Through
            the variation of sliding contact conditions and contacting materials, it is found
            that the PTFE-alumina composite requires a high surface energy gradient and hard sliding
            countersurface to initiate the filler particle breakdown and reincorporation into
            the tribofilm that leads to the development of tribochemical species and the low wear
            behavior. In contrast, PTFE-PEEK composites achieve ultralow wear through the accumulation
            of PEEK at the interface but do not need a hard countersurface to achieve this, and
            benefit from contacting surfaces which are conformal, do not abrade the material,
            and have similar surface energies.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Since its inception in the early twentieth century, academic theatre has used practical
            production experiences as a link between education and the professional industry.
            This experience was propelled by the educational pioneers, George Pierce Baker, Hallie
            Flanagan, and Thomas Wood Stevens, claiming production work as an essential tool for
            industry improvement and professionalization. However, universities struggled with
            the placement of this non-traditional academic work, frequently leaving it to be an
            extra-curricular component and placing large amounts of additional labor on student
            participants. Today, contemporary collegiate theatre programs continue the tradition
            of practical production work as tools of industry improvement and professionalization,
            with this requirement now codified by the National Association for Schools of Theatre's
            (NAST) accreditation standards. This thesis will trace the history of production work
            in academic theatre from the early programs such as Harvard and Yale to Florida State
            University's current School of Theatre (FSU SOT). This history will culminate in an
            exploration of educational ideals in practice as an examination of my autoethnographic
            approach as the calling stage manager for one of FSU's fall productions. This experience
            allows a glimpse at how FSU's ideals manifest in the production process, focusing
            on the labor of student participants and the sustainable systems that have been implemented
            to protect the wellbeing of these students. This thesis proposes that academic theatre
            more closely returns to the original mission of industry improvement, working as a
            try-out space for sustainable labor practices that can shift the professional industry
            away from its current normalization of burnout and exhaustion.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Research has shown that the frequency of patterns in everyday print influences the
            naming speed of those patterns. The present study aims to investigate the impact of
            single-letter frequency on naming time in the Rapid Automatized Naming (RAN) task,
            specifically the isolated (discrete) version. While previous literature has extensively
            explored word frequency effects on recognition speed, the influence of single-letter
            frequency in print on single-letter naming time remains underexplored and inconclusive.
            The significance of understanding factors that impact letter naming speed lies in
            its correlation with word reading ability and its role in serial letter naming, which
            has demonstrated a stronger connection to reading than discrete letter naming. This
            study sought to determine if single-letter frequency significantly influences naming
            times in the discrete task and whether single-letter naming time or frequency uniquely
            predicts naming time in a primed RAN task. These were measured in a study of 108 college-aged
            students. Results showed that reaction times varied by both the person and the letter
            in the discrete RAN task. However, single-letter frequency did not account for this
            variance. The results also showed that reaction times varied by both the person and
            the letter in the primed RAN task as well. Surprisingly, single letter frequency and
            discrete RAN emerged as unique predictors of primed RAN accounting for a significant
            proportion of the variance in reaction times. This finding was unexpected. Single-letter
            reaction time varying between letters has important implications for measuring RAN
            assessments that are commonly used in progress monitoring. Single-letter naming time
            differences may account for some of the variability between forms using different
            letters. Although letter frequency did not account for this variability, future research
            should investigate what other factors may explain this variability between letters.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Skies &amp; Horizons is a collection of pieces for wind ensemble connected through figurative
            and literal concepts pertaining to the ground, earth, sea, sky, and stars. The work
            is divided into ten pieces, totaling twenty-three minutes in length. Succinct and
            full of character, each piece explores various possibilities, in which the wind ensemble
            and its subsections can offer. Throughout history, our place on this planet and university
            have served as a point of inspiration for philosophers, artists, explorers, musicians,
            and numerous other fields. Concepts and inspiration for the work have manifested in
            the pieces: Horizon Expanse (1'), Separating Circle (1:45'), Celestia (2:30'), Mirage
            (2'), Kite-Flying (3'), Redwoods (3'), Soarin' (2:30'), Sky Dive (2:45'), Vanishing
            Point (2:00'), and Fireside (3:30') for a combined duration of approximately 24 minutes.
            While unified under the concept of Skies &amp; Horizons, each piece are distinct in their
            own right. Horizon Expanse opens the work with a powerful fanfare, Three pieces feature
            the subsection of the wind ensemble, Mirage – percussion, Redwoods – woodwinds, Soarin'
            – brass. Separating Circle and Vanishing Point represent intricate and technical pieces
            with angular motives and rhythmic patterns, while Celestia, Kite-Flying, and Sky Dive
            incorporate more flowing, melodic passages. Fireside concludes the work with a requiem

            the pressures of acceptance while also navigating instances of racism and microaggressions
            from their peers and school staff. However, participants were able to acknowledge
            that their involvement with extracurricular activities and the support provided by
            their school regarding mental health and well-being, had a positive impact, mitigating
            some of the challenges faced by Black males. The implications of this study are relevant
            for school officials, administrators, teachers, researchers, and families, providing
            insights into how to better support Black males attending schools in predominantly
            White communities. Keywords: Black Males, High School, Mental Health and Well-being,

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This dissertation focuses on the mechanochemical synthesis of several families of
            multicomponent crystals (MCCs), their characterization by multinuclear solid-state
            NMR (SSNMR) and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), and their structure determination
            by single crystal XRD (SCXRD) and/or NMR-guided Rietveld refinements. All MCCs reported
            herein are inorganic-organic hybrids featuring different combinations of simple organic
            molecules with alkali or ammonium chloride salts, and sometimes water. The MCCs were
            prepared via ball milling, with syntheses optimized for maximum yield and efficiency.
            NMR crystallography (NMRX), which features a combination of multinuclear SSNMR, XRD
            methods, and dispersion-corrected plane-wave DFT calculations, was used to validate,
            refine, and in some cases, aid in solving the crystal structures via Rietveld analysis.
            The NMRX work herein relies upon quadrupolar nuclides (i.e., those with spin &gt; ½),
            with an emphasis on 35Cl SSNMR of chloride ions (Cl–) present in each MCC, as well
            as alkali metal SSNMR (7Li, 23Na, 39K, 87Rb, 133Cs). Additionally, comparisons of
            experimental and calculated 35Cl electric field gradient (EFG) tensors are presented
            as guiding metrics for structural validation, and to elucidate their relationships
            to molecular-level structures and crystallographic symmetry. In Chapter 2, five MCCs
            of the form NR4Cl:xUrea·yH2O (R = H, Et, n-Pr; x = 1, 2; y = 0, 2) were prepared to
            demonstrate the utility of 35Cl SSNMR for use in NMRX investigations. 35Cl SSNMR spectra
            reveal powder patterns that act as spectral fingerprints for each MCC, while also
            detecting residual educts not observed in corresponding PXRD patterns. DFT calculations
            on geometry-optimized structures yielded 35Cl EFG tensors in good agreement with experiment,
            except for NH4Cl:Urea; hence, ab initio molecular dynamics (aiMD) simulations were
            used to study the impact of molecular motions of NH4+ cations on the 35Cl EFG tensors,
            and their concomitant use for structural characterization. Chapter 3 explores accelerated
            aging (AA) reactions that produce four of the MCCs from Chapter 2, using in situ and
            ex situ 35Cl SSNMR and ex situ PXRD for monitoring. Different aspects of the AA reactions
            were investigated, such as mechanical activation (ball milling vs. gentle mixing),
            environmental conditions (temperature and humidity), sample packing and unpacking,
            and different reactant ratios. Comparisons of the AA reactions yielding NH4Cl:Urea
            and NEt4Cl:2Urea demonstrate that the induction times dramatically impact reaction
            rates. Reaction mixtures of NPr4Cl and urea in 1:2 and 1:3 ratios produced MCCs with
            very different AA rates, and revealed a series of transient species, offering insight
            into competitive kinetic and thermodynamic effects on AA reactions. In Chapter 4,
            two classes of MCCs of the forms MCl:xCA (CA = cyanuric acid; M = Li, Na, Rb, Cs;
            x = 1, 2) and MCl:xBA∙yH2O (BA = barbituric acid; x = 1, 2; y = 0, 2; M = Li, Na,
            K, Rb, Cs) were prepared with ball milling. Twelve MCCs were characterized using multinuclear
            SSNMR, including 35Cl, 13C, and alkali metal nuclides, as well as PXRD and SCXRD methods.
            Seven novel MCl:xBA∙yH2O MCCs were discovered, and new crystal structures are reported
            for five of these. Alkali metal SSNMR spectra aid in determining the number of distinct
            sites and rapidly detecting residual educts. Comparison of experimental and calculated
            35Cl EFG tensors suggests they are influenced by both H⋯Cl– hydrogen bonds and electrostatic
            interactions involving alkali cations. Finally, Chapter 5, which combines many ideas
            from the preceding chapters, features three MCCs of the form MCl:Urea∙xH2O (M = Li,
            Na, Cs; x = 0, 1) that were prepared via ball milling and NMRX-guided Rietveld refinements
            to solve their crystal structures. 35Cl SSNMR was the most useful technique for their
            characterization, due to its inherent sensitivity to different H⋯Cl– hydrogen bonding
            configurations. 23Na MAS NMR allowed for the in situ monitoring of the autocatalytic
            degradation of NaCl:Urea∙H2O. All characterization data were used to inform the initial
            structures for Rietveld analysis, with final Rietveld structures subjected to DFT
            geometry optimizations, enabling exploration of relationships between the local hydrogen
            bonding environments of the chloride ions and NMR interaction tensors. It is anticipated
            that the synthetic methods herein will be used to generate a broad range of MCCs of
            increasing complexity, featuring different metal ions, simple organic molecules, and
            ratios of components. These highly efficient syntheses, in combination with the characterization
            protocols described herein, could be beneficial for the design of new quadrupolar
            NMRX techniques for validating, refining, and solving the crystal structures for a
            wide range of MCCs where conventional characterization methods fall short, perhaps
            even allowing for the prediction of hitherto unknown structures in tandem with modern
            crystal structure prediction methods.</p>

            in Journal of Music Therapy, with only three articles published on the topic within
            the last 20 years. The most prominent goal in the literature was social and interpersonal
            skills, and instrument play was the most mentioned type of intervention. Due to the
            gap in literature, further and more current research is needed on music therapy and
            vocational skills with individuals with I/DD.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Scholars have advocated for more environmental education (EE) within elementary preservice
            teacher education through science methods courses as elementary preservice teachers
            have consistently demonstrated limited environmental literacy. This is critical as
            environmental issues continue to threaten our world, preservice teachers must demonstrate
            the environmental literacy needed to teach our youngest students about the impacts
            of these problems on communities. The goal of this qualitative case study was to explore
            how four preservice teachers who engaged in a semester of EE demonstrated environmental
            literacy and reflected on instructional practices that aligned with the Ambitious
            Science Teaching instructional framework that was implemented during the science methods
            course. In-depth interviews with preservice teachers, along with an analysis of their
            written work during the semester, revealed that they drew on their own funds of knowledge
            to demonstrate knowledge and a sense of concern about environmental issues and the
            impact they have on communities in different ways. However, preservice teachers mainly
            showed individualistic ideas about these problems and were reluctant to take action
            within the community to address them. This research also suggests future instructional
            approaches to strengthen preservice teachers' environmental literacy to best prepare
            them to engage their future elementary students in EE, helping our youngest learners
            understand more about the world around them.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Oxidoreductase enzyme complexes are one of the known biomolecular machines, which
            play a cru- cial role in cellular biochemistry including metabolic, signaling, and
            electron transport pathways. In these complexes, individual subunits can oligomerize
            to form homo-multimers or hetero-multimers and can transiently interact with redox
            enzyme partners to perform multistep enzymatic reactions. Multi-subunit oxidoreductases
            can show inter- and intra-subunit domain interactions by switching from open to closed
            conformations in order to deliver electrons to their oxidase partners. Assimi- latory
            sulfite reductase (SiR) is an NADPH-dependent multidomain oxidoreductase that catalyzes
            sulfur reduction to produce sulfide, the bioavailable form of sulfur for subsequent
            synthesis of biomolecules. In Escherichia coli, SiR is a dodecameric holoenzyme, consisting
            of eight subunits of a flavoprotein (SiRFP) and four subunits of a hemoprotein (SiRHP).
            SiRFP is a diflavin reductase, a homolog of cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) that is
            composed of the following domains: a FMN binding flavodoxin (Fld)-like-domain, a connection
            domain interrupting FAD/NADPH bind- ing FNR (Ferredoxin/NADP+ reductase)-like-domain
            and a flexible linker connecting Fld and FNR domains. This flexible linker is ∼ 30
            amino acids long and remains crucial for transferring electrons from one domain to
            another. SiRHP is a metal-harboring domain that contains a siroheme (iron- containing
            tetrapyrrole) cofactor at the active site covalently coupled with Fe4S4 cluster through
            cysteine conjugations. Chapter 1 provides an introduction of multi domain oxidoreductases
            with a main focus on SiR and its homologs.Chapter 2 provides information about small-angle
            scattering technique including both neutron scattering and X-ray scattering. Small-angle
            neutron scattering (SANS) and neutron contrast variation technique are discussed in
            detail. SANS is used to analyze the solution structure of proteins and gives information
            about the radius of gyration, inter atomic distances between the particles, shape
            and size of the protein sample and also gives an approximate idea about the molecular
            weight of the sample. Chapter 3 includes the structural characterization of the SiR
            complex. SANS, neutron contrast variation, analytical ultracentrifugation and other
            biophysical techniques showed that SiR is an asymmetric complex. SiRFP undergoes compaction
            in the complex as compared to the free SiRFP and the four SiRHP binds at the periphery
            of the complex. This study showed the first solution structure of the SiR complex.
            Chapter 4 provides information about the two conformationally restricted variants
            of SiRFP and showed the possibility of open and closed conformations of SiRFP. This
            study showed the presence of domain crossover in SiRFP which indicates that the Fld
            domain of one polypeptide can interact with the FNR domain of an adjacent polypeptide.
            The SANS measurements provide the first model of the possible arrangement of eight
            subunits of SiRFP and showed that the N-terminal helical bundle acts as a central
            core of the complex. Chapter 5 presents a study about a novel variant of SiRFP which
            forms a tetramer. The N- terminus region of SiRFP consists of only 52 amino acids
            which oligomerizes to form an octamer. This study showed that four amino acids (Y39,
            F40, Q22, Q47) of the SiRFP's N-terminus region play a crucial role in the oligomerization
            of the eight copies of SiRFP. These residues show aromatic stacking (Y39, F40) and
            salt bridge interactions (Q22, Q47) between the helices and thus form a strong octameric
            bundle. Mutating these four amino acids results in a tetrameric assembly of SiRFP.
            The ultra stable properties of SiRFP's N-terminus octameric helical bundle are also
            discussed in this chapter. Chapter 6 includes the cryo-EM studies of SiR. SiR is a
            challenging sample to study using cryo-EM due to its sensitivity to the air-water
            interface during the grid preparation. This chapter reveals that a minimal binding
            interface is present between the SiRFP and SiRHP dimer. This study also shows the
            first high resolution structure of the SiRFP/SiRHP variant and explains that this
            minimal interaction is governed by the N-terminus of SiRHP and the FNR domain of SiRFP.
            Additionally, the highly flexible Fld domain of SiRFP explains its accessibility for
            transferring electrons to its redox partner. The last chapter highlights the future
            direction of the SiR project. It explains the ongoing crystallization related work
            for the different variants of SiRFP. Chapter 7 also includes the trou- bleshooting
            of SiR's sample preparation for cryo-EM studies which aims to solve the high resolution
            structure of this complex.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Triple Threat: A Study of American Musical Theatre Training, explores the history,
            growth, ethics, and progression of professional musical theatre training and BFA musical
            theatre programs in the United States. As this type of accredited conservatory training
            has existed for less than sixty years, this project ultimately seeks to pioneer an
            intensive inquiry into the evolution of musical theatre training, both prior to its
            existence within the academy and in the BFA context, and trace its relationship with
            the professional theatre industry. The first part of this work will historicize musical
            theatre training in America prior to its placement within academia, highlighting the
            foundations of existing methodologies, delving into the backgrounds of its most influential
            contributors, and identifying the strengths and challenges presented by the training
            throughout its development. The second part will chart the history of BFA musical
            theatre training within academia, contextualizing the evolution of the training within
            the larger framework of American higher education. This portion of the work will utilize
            three case studies conducted from a sampling of BFA musical theatre programs across
            the country to recount their respective histories and evolution, gain insight into
            the structures and goals of each program, and assess their relationship with the professional
            industry. Using the information learned from the historical research and case study
            portions of the project, the final part of this study will address the challenges
            and potentialities of current musical theatre training. An encompassing scope of the
            entire work will examine the inherent and pathological diversity and inclusion problems
            in both academia and the professional musical theatre industry. I seek to analyze
            how both institutions inform, uphold, or challenge the other, and how both entities
            may strategize for progress and change in these areas to create a more equitable industry,
            which I propose begins with the training. My study aims to unpack the promise of "Triple
            Threat training" that purports to develop well-rounded performers equally proficient
            in acting, singing, and dancing, where the curriculum seems to be both defined and
            limited by a set of prescribed skill sets. While mastery of skills valued by the existing
            industry is an undoubtedly important component of this training, I argue that musical
            theatre training must evolve to emphasize the areas in which scholarship, artistry,
            and craftsmanship may converge, developing artist-thinkers who can identify possibilities
            in the industry that may not be currently presented. I thus propose that this can
            be achieved through a new Triple Threat training model that replaces the pillared
            standards of acting, singing, and dancing with artistry, advocacy, and entrepreneurship.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>In the American music industry, genre is used to efficiently organize music into digestible
            forms for consumers, critics, and creators. The trade-off for efficiency in this industry
            is fewer genre options, which leads to songs and artists being placed in imprecise
            categories. Across the American music industry, streaming platforms (e.g. Spotify),
            media (e.g. Billboard), distributors (e.g. record stores), and award shows affect
            how artists' music is viewed, assessed, heard, and consumed. A prime example of commercial
            efficiency is the misplacement of artists into specific award categories at the Recording
            Academy's Grammy Awards Show. In the past year, this has resulted in Drake and The
            Weekend, two of the biggest pop music stars in the world, withholding their music
            for the 2023 Grammy submission. Their decision is a reaction to the Recording Academy's
            inaccurate assessment of artists and their work. Across the industry, genre handling
            has provided many results that benefit various parties. This thesis aims to examine
            how the music industry's efficient approach to handling genre compares to that of
            the fans who consume music daily.Genre is ever-evolving by the people who make and
            consume it, but it is limited to the musical elements deemed a standard of that genre
            by American music companies. David Brackett states that the music industry uses "marketing
            categories" with varying rules and restrictions that are amendable to the organization
            of music. In contrast, fans view music as "critic-fan genres" with specific rules
            and qualifications for artists and songs to fit into particular genres. I will extend
            Brackett's genre theory by providing further insight into how the American music industry's
            approach to handling genre affects artists and consumers. To accomplish this, I will
            use ethnographic methods and music analysis to provide critical commentary and analytical
            proof for my discussion on genre. I understand that the music industry encompasses
            all areas of music, so I will use hip-hop and Latin trap as case studies to show how
            people associated with the most popular music genres are affected. By providing a
            detailed examination of how the industry and consumers view well-known genres, I would
            like this thesis to assist consumers and music industry insiders in learning about
            the various ways we can improve on the current genre classification system across
            the American music industry.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Dollhouse Dreams and Other Broken Things is a collection of personal essays exploring
            issues of the body, the historically silenced voice and shifting notions of femininity.
            The collection also investigates how myths that shape the body are continually carried
            down and reinforced by families, institutions, and culture. This essay collection
            is both a deconstruction of these myths and a reconstruction of what the body/home
            can look like—or rather what it means to (re)build after the deconstruction of patriarchal
            values. These essays illuminate both the holding of breath and the relinquishing of
            voice, but also the stirring movements towards agency. One sub-focus of this essay
            collection includes an interrogation of the fairy tale childhood—one that not only
            encourages a belief in happy endings anchored by a prince charming but also encourages
            this magical thinking in other avenues. Instead of doing away with these classic tales,
            I merge them with autobiographical essays in order to bring the woman back into these
            stories written by men, rebuilding and reshaping patriarchal representations of womanhood
            in the process.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Visual communication plays an important role in the evolution of organisms, as selection
            processes often rely on the organism's physical appearance. For example, mate choice—often
            by females selecting the most attractive males—can lead to the evolution of brighter
            or more exaggerated patterns. However, there are instances where organisms have evolved
            physical attributes beneficial for sexual selection but costly in terms of energy
            expenditure or increased predation risk. A particularly valuable communication channel,
            then, would be one invisible to predators but helpful for identifying potential mates.
            Signals produced via the mechanism of fluorescence have been proposed to be such a
            channel. Although biologists have described biofluorescence in a diversity of taxa,
            there have been few systematic efforts to document the extent of biofluorescence within
            a taxonomic group or to investigate its general significance. These signals were recently
            discovered in amphibians. The goal of my dissertation was to: (1) assess the diversity
            of frog biofluorescence, (2) examine the function of fluorescence in predation on
            frogs, and to (3) reconstruct a highly supported phylogeny for a treefrog genus upon
            which we can (4) test for accelerated speciation of biofluorescence lineages within
            one treefrog clade. First, through a field survey across South America, I discovered
            and documented patterns of biofluorescence in tropical amphibians. Through these efforts,
            I more than tripled the number of species that have been tested for this trait and
            added representatives from previously untested anuran families. Fluorescence was ubiquitous;
            I recorded at least a low-level fluorescent signal from every individual I tested.
            I found evidence for ecological tuning (i.e., the specific adaptation of a signal
            to the environment in which it is received) of the novel anuran biofluorescent signals.
            For the majority (56.58%) of Anura species tested, the fluorescence excitation peak
            matches the wavelengths most abundant at twilight, the light environment in which
            most frog species are active. Additionally, biofluorescence emission spans both wavelengths
            of low availability in twilight and the peak sensitivity of green-sensitive rods in
            the anuran eye, likely increasing contrast of this signal for a conspecific receiver.
            With evidence of tuning to the ecology and sensory systems of frogs, my results suggest
            frog biofluorescence is likely functioning in anuran communication. After demonstrating
            the significance of frog biofluorescence as a potential signal, the next critical
            line of inquiry was to examine who is receiving the signal: potential predators, mates,
            or both. I began to test this through a case study experimentally testing the function
            of frog fluorescence in predation of a local treefrog species. Over half of the studies
            documenting biofluorescence in the last century suggest this fluorescent signal may
            affect predation; however, to date, only one other experimental study has tested this
            hypothesis. To address this question, I first quantified the spectral characteristics
            of a novel biofluorescence pattern in the Cope's Gray Treefrog, Hyla chrysoscelis.
            In both sexes of this species, the fluorescent signal is concentrated in an area that
            contains a proposed aposematic pattern that may warn predators of the frog's toxic
            secretions. I hypothesized that the biofluorescent trait may increase the conspicuousness
            of this pattern and enable the frogs to deter predators more effectively. I then tested
            this prediction by conducting a clay model field experiment to assess differences
            in predation attempts on fluorescent versus non-fluorescent H. chrysoscelis models
            by various predator types. I found no effect of biofluorescence on the overall presence,
            type, or location of predation, suggesting that biofluorescence alone does not act
            as an antipredator signal of H. chrysoscelis. This study represents one of the first
            attempts to experimentally test the effect of biofluorescence on predation in any
            organism and the first to do so in amphibians. Further work is needed to explore the
            role of this trait in predation in other systems and to investigate alternative functions
            for the biofluorescent signal in H. chrysoscelis. The final goal of my dissertation
            was to examine the evolution of biofluorescence across an amphibian clade. To do so,
            I first reconstructed, and time-calibrated, a highly supported phylogeny for one treefrog
            genus upon which we can test for trait-dependent accelerated speciation rates. With
            108 recognized species, Dendropsophus is one of the most diverse genera of tropical
            treefrogs in the Western Hemisphere. Despite the broad distribution of the clade across
            Central and South America, little is known about the biogeographic origins and expansion
            of the group or how key life history traits have evolved in this taxon. I reconstructed
            a phylogeny of Dendropsophus based on 432 nuclear loci for 78 taxa (72% of species)
            obtained using anchored hybrid enrichment. I estimated divergence times within the
            clade to reconstruct the biogeographic history of the genus to test alternative models
            of dispersal. I also assessed the evolution of egg deposition mode and examined correlations
            with speciation rate and the extent of biogeographic expansions. I recovered a well-resolved
            phylogeny with very strong support at 92% of the nodes. I found evidence that the
            genus likely originated approximately 57 mya, occupying the Eastern Highlands and
            Amazonian-Orinocan Lowland, and underwent multiple expansions into the surrounding
            Central and South American biomes. The origin of the genus predates the beginning
            of the Andean uplift in western South America. The best supported biogeographic hypothesis
            for the Dendropsophus clade is one of unconstrained dispersal between the Eastern
            Highlands and Amazonian Basin. My results suggest that the majority of Dendropsophus
            groups originated via range expansion speciation events that occurred during the Andean
            uplift. Overall, my phylogenomic data provide clear resolution of the evolutionary
            relationships among species of Dendropsophus. My study provides insight into the biogeographic
            origin and expansion of the clade and demonstrates that the dispersal of this group
            was not as heavily constrained by a changing ecological history as previously hypothesized.
            The evolution from an aquatic to terrestrial egg deposition mode was not correlated
            with speciation rate or the extent of biogeographic expansions. Given Dendropsophus
            is one of the most broadly ranging genera in South and Central America, my highly
            supported tree will be an invaluable tool for future clade-specific and comparative
            studies investigating the evolution of life history traits, mating behaviors, and
            ecological associations throughout these regions. Finally, I mapped the evolution
            of biofluorescence across the Dendropsophus treefrog genus. I utilized ancestral state
            reconstruction to examine the evolutionary history of biofluorescent traits (intensity,
            area, and color) within the genus. Dendropsophus is a widespread, diverse South American
            genus, and studies have examined clade-specific drivers of diversification, but only
            within the context of ecological constraints and not color pattern divergence. The
            biofluorescent patterns I discovered in Dendropsophus range from widespread, full
            body coverage to location-specific patches. Hence, my goals of this study were to
            (1) map these traits across the recently published, highly supported, time calibrated
            Dendropsophus phylogeny based on anchored hybrid enrichment data, and (2) use state-dependent
            diversification models to determine if biofluorescence parameters affect speciation
            rate to ascertain whether visual (fluorescence) signals have contributed to an accelerated
            rate of speciation within the genus. My study provides the first insight into the
            evolutionary history of biofluorescence in Dendropsophus frogs. My results suggest
            a biofluorescent ancestor for the clade with an intense, widespread, green emission
            phenotype. I found evidence of a strong phylogenetic signal between the traits of
            fluorescence and the Dendropsophus phylogeny. Finally, fluorescent intensity, but
            not emission color, influenced speciation rate in the genus; and the influence of
            fluorescent area is still unresolved. Dendropsophus lineages with greater than 10%
            biofluorescent intensity had a speciation rate over 7.2 times faster than the speciation
            rate for lineages with less than 10% fluorescent intensity. The combination of my
            findings suggests there is an adaptive function of frog fluorescence for intraspecific
            communication. I found (1) evidence for sensory drive of the frog fluorescent signal,
            (2) this signal meets criteria of ecological significance for intraspecific communication,
            (3) no effect of fluorescence on predation of frogs, and (4) a correlation between
            treefrog fluorescent intensity and an increased speciation rate. Together, these results
            highlight the potential importance of this recently discovered trait and the need
            for further exploration of this novel signal to determine its function in anuran communication.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The purpose of this study was to determine how choral, band, and orchestral string
            musicians perceive the clarity and expressivity of choral, band, and orchestral conductors
            based upon the use or non-use of the baton. This study aimed to address the following
            research questions: (1) Are there differences in collegiate choral, band, and orchestral
            string musicians' ratings of conductor clarity or expressivity dependent upon the
            presence or absence of the baton? (2) Are there differences in collegiate choral,
            band, and orchestral string musicians' ratings of conductor clarity or expressivity
            dependent upon the specialty of the conductor? (3) What aspects of conductor baton
            use or non-use influence collegiate choral, band, and orchestral string musicians'
            ratings of conductor clarity and expressivity? (4) Do collegiate orchestral string
            musicians' ratings of conductor clarity and expressivity align more closely to those
            of choral musicians, band musicians, or neither?I selected three highly expressive
            professional recordings of Morton Lauridsen's O Magnum Mysterium, one each of the
            original chorus composition, the band transcription, and the string orchestra transcription.
            I then invited a graduate orchestral conductor, graduate band conductor, and graduate
            choral conductor to conduct the recording that fit their specialty both with and without
            a baton. I then recorded each conductor as they conducted along to their recording
            with and without a baton and replaced the camera audio with the professional audio.
            Two 30 second to 45 second excerpts from each conducting recording were selected and
            anonymized. These excerpts where then placed into a survey asking participants to
            view each video, rate each video for conducting clarity and expressivity, and optionally
            provide feedback about how they arrived at their ratings. This survey was then distributed
            to several universities around the United States. Participants (N = 238) consisted
            of collegiate choral (n = 93), band (n = 74), and orchestral string (n = 71) musicians.
            Statistical analysis revealed significant main effects for baton use in ratings of
            expressivity as well as significant interactions between conductor specialty and baton
            use for ratings of clarity and expressivity and significant interactions between participant
            musician type and conductor specialty for ratings of clarity. No significant interaction
            between participant musician type and baton use was found. Participants overall found
            the bare hands to be more expressive than the baton, with no significant difference
            in clarity. Both the choral conductor and band conductor were found to be clearer
            with the baton, significantly more so than the orchestral conductor. Chorus musicians
            considered the choral conductor to be clearer than either the band or orchestral conductor,
            while band and orchestral musicians both agreed that the orchestral conductor was
            less clear than either the choral or band conductor. Band and orchestral string musicians
            tended to align on most metrics. Qualitative analysis of comments (N = 599) left by
            participants suggests that most participants were influenced by aspects of the conductors
            unrelated to the baton or right hand. Of those comments that did center on the baton
            or right hand, most were concerned with issues of technique, congruency of musical
            gestures with musical response, and overall quality. Only a small subset of comments
            specifically attributed their ratings to the presence or absence of the baton. Taken
            together, these findings have implications for both conducting research and applied
            conducting. In conducting research, the practice of generalizing findings of studies
            done with wind and percussion players to all instrumentalists, inclusive of string
            players, would appear to be valid. The converse may also be true: the findings of
            future conducting research done with orchestral string players may also be generalizable
            to wind and percussion players. For applied conducting, while the need to be comfortable
            both with a baton and without a baton has not been negated, it seems that as far as
            musicians in general are concerned, conductors may be able to take advantage of the
            increased expressivity of conducting without the baton without a significant loss
            of clarity given appropriate technique and training. However, further research on
            the use of the baton in a variety of styles and tempi is necessary.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Many flutists are familiar with Francois Borne's Carmen Fantasie, Franz and Karl Doppler's
            Rigoletto Fantasie, and Paul Taffanel's Mignon and Der Freischütz Fantasies. While
            these virtuosic showpieces have been favorites of the flute repertoire for decades,
            they only represent a small portion of a much larger body of repertoire. There are
            over 300 extant opera fantasies that feature the flute which have been arranged by
            over 120 composers and feature motives and themes from over 130 operas. In addition
            to discussing the context in which the opera fantasy became so popular in the nineteenth
            century, this document intends to serve as a reference work for flutists by suggesting
            a proposed process for analyzing and performing opera fantasies and cataloging known
            and lost opera fantasies written for the flute. It also proposes why opera fantasies
            fell out of favor in the twentieth century, and presents justification for their continued
            relevance, pedagogical implications, and newfound popularity in the flute repertoire
            today.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Moscow is a State of Mind explores the psychological landscape of a Dark Night of
            the Soul the narrator worked through between 2011-2023. Excising the roots of personal
            trauma by means of poems that describe personal events too intense and traumatic to
            place into narrative format—"event," in this case, meaning a rupture in the narrative
            fabric of reality itself—Moscow is a book that reads "across" itself, as if a strong
            wind were spreading memory, desire, and lawn ornaments across the field of a troubled
            life. The poems speak to one another like an entangled quantum system. A dog appears
            in one poem as a porcelain accessory in an MTV music video, only to reappear later
            being led into the water to be drowned by its owner. By following the different guises
            of the dog and other similar patterns of imagery and exploring how they relate to
            one another, we begin to see a story superimposed on top of its own self, the mind
            as a feedback loop feeding itself back into itself, struggling to make sense of emotional
            realities too intense for narrative to capture. As William Blake wrote in his "Proverbs
            of Hell," "The cistern contains; the fountain overflows." The emotional trauma of
            a difficult childhood explains itself through meditations on time, human consciousness,
            global catastrophes present and past, Biblical allegory, and other similar intensities.
            Throughout, however, a curious form of joy and play provides a levity that counterbalances
            the darkness. In this surreal fusion of hell and joy, the narrator of Moscow is a
            State of Mind dances a war within himself, resolving what cannot be said through witness
            to what must not be forgotten. The end goal is annihilation of self, not through self-destruction
            but through self-transcendence: To wake up from history, even for a moment, into the
            vast presence of every possible dawn.</p>

            Learning (SEL) program, Classroom Champions, would close gaps in SEL skill areas identified
            by a student universal screener. This study specifically examined the skill areas
            of persistence, engagement, and optimism. The first research question examined the
            levels of student persistence, engagement, and optimism in comparison and intervention
            groups before and after program implementation. The second research question examined
            the relationship between student participation in Classroom Champions and student
            growth in the areas of persistence, engagement, and optimism. The third research question
            examined how growth in the areas of persistence, engagement, and optimism among intervention
            group participants differed by gender. Participants in both the intervention (n =
            215) and comparison group (n = 545) were in grades 6-12. Participants were given a
            universal screener prior to SEL curriculum to obtain baseline scores for persistence,
            engagement, and optimism. The screener was administered again after completion of
            instructional delivery to obtain post-test scores. Data analysis was completed with
            the use of paired sample t-tests, independent sample t-tests, simple linear regression,
            and multiple regression. Findings showed that both the intervention and comparison
            group saw statistically significant differences in pre- and post-test scores in the
            area of engagement. There was a statistically significant change score in the area
            of persistence for the intervention group; however, analysis of pre-test means showed
            that the intervention group started out significantly lower than the comparison group
            in this area. There were no statistically significant findings related to gender.
            In conclusion, although there were some statistically significant findings, there
            were no conclusive results that the targeted SEL curriculum was able to close the
            identified SEL skill gaps.</p>

            used in current research, describes the treatment intensity of intervention implemented
            in current research for students with moderate and severe ID and discusses the percentage
            of goal obtained for single case studies as a measure of effect size. Chapter three
            is a single-case, repeated acquisition design study that examines the effects of the
            Accessible Literacy Learning (ALL; Light &amp; McNaughton, 2009) program on the development
            of letter sound correspondence, sound blending and decoding skills for students with
            ESN in small groups. Result of this study indicate that with explicit, systematic
            instruction and supports students ESN can make gains in foundational reading skills.
            Results, social validity, implications and future research are discussed.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>While Black students have experienced significant growth in college enrollment since
            the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Higher Education Act of 1965, they
            are still less likely than their white counterparts to attend and graduate from a
            post-secondary institution (Ryan &amp; Bauman, 2016). There have been previous studies
            on college access programs that aim to combat the challenges contributing to the college
            access gap for Black students, such as percentage plans, admissions lotteries, and
            admissions preferences for low socioeconomic students. Although the aim was to promote
            equality, race-neutral and objective admissions policies perpetuate patterns of power,
            privilege, and racial inequity by assuming that all educational resources are equal
            (Bonilla-Silva, 2010). In an effort to address educational disparities, the Florida
            State University Office of Admissions, Center for Academic Retention and Enhancement
            (CARE), and Office of Financial Aid joined forces in 2015 to launch the High School
            Partners Program, a new college access initiative. Students from eight (8) public
            high schools located in three counties along the eastern and western corridor of Interstate
            10 in Florida receive support with college applications and enrollment through the
            High School Partners Program (Florida State University, 2021). Increasing the percentage
            of students from underfunded public high schools who applied and were accepted to
            Florida State University was the objective of the High School Partners Program. All
            students at participating high schools are eligible for the High School Partners Program,
            regardless of their financial situation or status as first-generation students, although
            most of them come from historically underserved backgrounds. The purpose of this study
            was to explore the role of the High School Partners Program in the college choice
            process among Black students who enrolled at Florida State University through the
            general admissions process. This study is supported by research on factors associated
            with Black students' postsecondary enrollment patterns and chances to improve the
            pipeline and yield of students from high schools with inadequate resources. Hossler
            and Gallagher (1987) created a college choice model that outlined three stages (predisposition,
            search, and choice) that students go through while selecting a college, and this model
            had an influence on the research framework. The study explored a range of factors
            that influence students' decision-making through semi-structured interviews. The sample
            consisted of seven Black students who were enrolled in Fall 2023 and were alumni of
            a school that was affiliated with the High School Partners Program. According to the
            study's findings, Black students' enrollment in the predisposition or search stages
            of the Hossler and Gallagher College Choice Model (1987) was not significantly impacted
            by the High School Partners Program. Comparable to previous studies, family, college
            reputation, geographic location, cost, and availability of financial aid shaped Black
            students' pre-college experiences (Bers &amp; Smith, 1989; Clayton et al., 2023; Comeaux
            et al., 2020; Sevier, 1992; Weiler, 1994). However, the study indicated that the High
            School Partners Program played an influential role in the choice stage. Students gave
            a variety of reasons for choosing to enroll, including scholarship funding, interactions
            with Black FSU personnel, a different academic and cultural setting from their high
            schools, household structure, and family member accessibility. The findings also revealed
            that the High School Partners Program is positively correlated with postsecondary
            enrollment at FSU for Black student populations that were previously overlooked in
            the admissions process. These populations include first-generation students who are
            not eligible for Pell grants and second-generation students who are eligible for Pell
            grants, who each represent only 9.7% of the university's total FTIC Black student
            body in Fall 2023 (FSU Office of Institutional Research, 2024). Participants suggested
            that in order to improve the FSU High School Partners Program, the admissions staff
            should consider three primary modifications: 1) increase awareness of the High School
            Partners Program; 2) provide more opportunities to build relationships with FSU representatives;
            3) assist in integrating students from partner schools into the FSU community. Further
            research is imperative to determine the High School Partners Program's viability as
            an approach to Black student recruitment and to obtain a better understanding of the
            student populations that stand to benefit the most from involvement.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Emerging adulthood is a time of great vulnerability for psychological well-being,
            as during this time, individuals are facing numerous challenges stemming from societal
            demands in this transitional period. Most notably, emerging adults are some of the
            most highly anxious cohorts, with over half reporting symptoms of anxiety (Arnett
            &amp; Colleauges, 2014). Furthermore, anxiety is rising more rapidly for emerging adults
            than any other age bracket (Goodwin et al., 2020). This research aimed to look internally
            and examine how emerging adult's emotion dysregulation may potentially influence their
            levels of anxiety. Further, this study aimed to examine whether parent-child relationship
            quality moderated the relation between emerging adult emotion dysregulation and emerging
            adult anxiety. This research conducted a second study that examined the influence
            of emerging adult emotion dysregulation on their parent's anxiety levels. This study
            also aimed to test whether parenting stress mediated the relation between emerging
            adult emotion dysregulation and their parents' anxiety. Study one participants consisted
            of 449 college students (M age = 20.45 years, SD = 2.85). Furthermore, study two participants
            were 142 parent-child dyads. This study analyzed secondary data, as both samples used
            in this study were sourced from a previous project. Findings from study one suggested
            that emerging adult emotion dysregulation was significantly associated with emerging
            adult anxiety. The hypothesis that parent-child relationship quality would moderate
            the relationship between emerging adult emotion dysregulation and emerging adult anxiety
            was not supported. For study two, results suggested that emerging adult emotion dysregulation
            was not significantly related to parents' anxiety levels. Additionally, the mediation
            hypothesis of parenting stress between emerging adult emotion dysregulation and parent
            anxiety was not supported either. Implications of study findings, recommendations,
            limitations, and future research directions are discussed.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The process of Data Assimilation in the Geosciences, in which real world data is used
            to improve the mathematical simulation of some event of interest, is a large field
            in applied mathematics. When that system is driven by dynamics, and the real world
            data is incomplete and noisy, we use the interactions of Bayes Rule with the probability
            distributions to apply either a filter or smoother to the data. A filter considers
            an estimate of the current state of the system using up-to-date data, while a smoother
            considers an estimate of previous state(s) using up-to-date data. In this thesis,
            we focus on lag-$l$ Linear Ensemble Transfrom Smoothers (LETS), that use current data
            to estimate the state of the system $l$ cycles in the past using Monte-Carlo strategies
            confined to a lower dimensional subspace than the system's dimension. These methods
            assimilate each new observation as it arrives, behaving as a `smoother in filter's
            clothing.' Smoothers can have an advantage in forecasting future states over filters
            in some scenarios; characterizing these scenarios in a way that is practical is one
            of the goals of this work. Each system in the geosciences will have a unique structure;
            the relevance of each observation to a feature of a system (such as a observation
            of wind above Liverpool and an estimate of the temperature in London), or the distance
            between two features in the system (such as the rainfall in New York and the rainfall
            in Seattle). By assimilating this structure, we can further improve the assimilated
            results produced by a smoother; this is called localization. Further, we can assimilate
            the reliability or unreliability of the system; this is called inflation. Finally,
            we can assimilate the `normality' (Gaussian) of the distributions produced to apply
            the correct method at the correct time; this is called hybridization. Each of the
            above can be accomplished by `tuning' scalar superparameters, and turning over the
            task of tuning to a Machine Learning (ML) method. In this work, we consider tuning
            all of the above when applied to the standard Lorenz test problems, using Global Bayesian
            Optimization (GBO) as the ML tool. Showing the extensive flexibility of tuning for
            smoothers, and how they can provide more meaningful comparisons than are standard
            in the literature, is the main goal of this work. Along the way, we consider a novel
            cost/loss functions defined on a lag-$l$ smoother, and various novel LETS methods
            that are created by the constructive composition of multiple methods together. We
            consider different localization strategies under a `more fair' framework than what
            is standard in the literature, by tuning each competitor to near optimum performance
            given the system.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This dissertation explores two chapters of 13D filings. Chapter one examines the impact
            of activism by non-financial corporations. I find that the market reacts more favorably
            to corporate activism relative to non-corporate activism. This is irrespective of
            apparent economic links between a corporate activist and their target firm. Further,
            corporate activists do not facilitate takeovers in the ways traditional activist investors
            do. Despite this, I find that corporate activist target firms experience similar ex-post
            changes in cash, investment, leverage, payout policy, and profitability to non-corporate
            activist targets. Overall, corporate activists are beneficial to target firms, so
            it is important to consider them in future activist studies. Chapter two proposes
            that target firms of activist 13D filings are associated with a decline in the likelihood
            of experiencing an extreme positive return outcome; i.e., a decline in the target
            firm's right-tail return skewness subsequent to the 13D event. The underlying logic
            is that activists often take actions that increase the target firm's stock price at
            the expense of the small possibility of extremely favorable long-term return outcomes.
            Consistent with a correction of skew-induced overpricing, I report that stock price
            reactions to 13D filings are lower for target firms associated with higher idiosyncratic
            skewness. Additional evidence indicates that subsequent changes in firm investment
            are lower for 13D targets relative to non-13D targets. Further, ex-post extreme right-tail
            returns are less likely in the years after the 13D filing for targeted firms as opposed
            to non-targeted firms. Overall, the evidence suggests that investors downwardly revise
            their expectations of an extreme right-tail outcome following the involvement of activists.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This document comprises two main parts which will respectively focus on how composers,
            Johann Sebastian Bach, Claude Debussy, Sergei Prokofiev, and Emma Lou Diemer, composed
            original piano works under the generic title of "Toccata." The second part will explore
            Taiwanese pianist Yi-Chih Lu and his four piano arrangements, which draw on various
            traditional Taiwanese folk songs.The first part explores the history of the toccata
            and its development in various periods, illustrating certain intrinsic toccata features
            that permeate these works. It examines the role these toccatas play in the composers'
            respective periods of composition and the individual approaches of composers in creating
            highly original works, despite all sharing the same title. The second part focuses
            on Yi-Chih Lu and his piano arrangements. Lu, a Taiwanese musician, was born and grew
            up in Taiwan. After completing high school, he went to Europe to continue his music
            study. Lu was majoring in piano performance when he was studying classical music in
            Europe, and this experience influenced a lot in his following arrangements about Taiwanese
            folk songs. Lu has composed numerous arrangements to date, the selected four works
            in this document serve as fitting examples to demonstrate Lu's compositional journey.
            Both Lu and his piano arrangements are gaining more recognition and are being wildly
            performed. Beyond representing Taiwanese folk songs, Lu seeks to merge both types
            of culture in his musical compositions. It is meaningful to discover how Lu employs
            concepts and ideas that he learned from his Western Classical music training and applies
            to his treatment of his homeland's folk tunes. According to Florida State University's
            requirement, this research document is based on two public lecture recitals presented
            on April 27, 2022, and November 21, 2022.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Combining the network governance model with knowledge of emergency management, this
            manuscript analyzes the performance of Hubei and Sichuan provincial governments in
            response to COVID-19 in early 2020. This study reveals that network governance, as
            seen in the Chinese response to COVID-19, does not closely resemble any of the three
            well-known forms of network governance in the literature. Instead, although the prevailing
            governance structure mimics some elements of the Network Administrative Organization
            form, it exhibits some uniquely Chinese characteristics. This manuscript also argues
            that core leaders' characteristics, mass media roles, and path-dependent adherence
            to systems created earlier significantly affect the resulting network governance.
            This manuscript also provides suggestions for improving the effectiveness of network
            governance of emergency management in China's centralized system. Incorporating insights
            from implementation theory and emergency management, this manuscript examines the
            performance of the Henan and Shanghai provincial/municipal governments during their
            early response to COVID-19 in 2020. The study reveals that the Chinese approach to
            COVID-19 policy implementation diverges from traditional models found in the existing
            literature. While it mirrors some of these conventional models, it also showcases
            distinctive Chinese attributes. Furthermore, the paper posits that during the COVID-19
            response, Henan's strategies were predominantly steered by provincial governments,
            with grassroots organizations playing a pivotal role. In contrast, Shanghai's approach
            was chiefly guided by government departments, bolstered significantly by professional
            bureaucrats. Utilizing the Multiple Streams Framework (MSF), this research delves
            into the determinants guiding COVID-related decisions across U.S. states from August
            2020 to January 2022. It critically evaluates eight salient variables linked to the
            problem, policy, and political streams of MSF, focusing on the adoption patterns of
            mask mandate policies. The analysis reveals that factors such as monthly COVID case
            rates, political affiliation, vaccination rates, and interstate travel restrictions
            significantly influenced the strictness of mask mandates during different periods.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The Eukaryotic cells employ a sophisticated process to generate properly assembledribosomes.
            This intricate process commences in the nucleolus through the transcription of a singular
            35S ribosomal RNA precursor (pre-rRNA), encompassing three distinct rRNAs (5.8S, 18S,
            and 25S), along with the 5' and 3' externally or internally transcribed spacer regions
            (5'-ETS, 3'-ETS, ITS1, and ITS2). Approximately 2% of rRNA nucleotides undergo 12
            of the 140 recognized types of RNA modifications (Sharma and Lafontaine, 2015; Sloan
            et al., 2017).Among the most prevalent modifications of rRNA are 2'-O-methylation
            and pseudouridylation, both facilitated by small nucleolar ribonucleoparticles (snoRNPs).
            The box C/D snoRNPs play a pivotal role in the site-specific addition of 2'-O-methyl
            groups at 80-100 sites in rRNA, while the box H/ACA snoRNPs are responsible for the
            isomerization of a similar number of uridines. Each snoRNP comprises a catalytic subunit,
            with fibrillarin serving as the methyltransferase and Cbf5 as the pseudouridine synthase
            in yeast, respectively1 . There are still many unanswered questions to be explored
            for the function of 2'-Omethylation and pseudouridylation. The impact of rRNA modification
            is mainly concentrated on the assembly of ribosome precursors (such as 90S pre-ribosome)
            and the protein synthesis process of mature ribosomes. Therefore, by studying the
            structural and functional changes of pre-ribosome and mature ribosome caused by loss
            of modification, we can understand the regulatory roles of the RNA backbone modification.
            This dissertation uses structural and functional studies to shed light on the intricate
            mechanisms of the regulatory roles of the RNA backbone modification. In Chapter 1,
            we showed that removal of chaperones for box C/D snoRNP can potentially alter the
            dynamics of 90S pre-ribosome of which the U3 box C/D snoRNP forms the core and thus
            allow us the capture of transiently associated factors. Our structure model provides
            the first near atomic model of the yeast Bfr2-Lcp5 complex. And I proved the model
            with the protein-protein interaction results and the secondary structures of recombinant
            Bfr2 and Bfr2-Lcp5 complex obtained by Circular Dichroism. Chapters 2 of this dissertation
            details unpresented views of ribosomes as they function and assemble in absence of
            2'-O-methylation. For the first time, I - 8 - extensively surveyed the growth sensitivity
            of cells that lack 2'-O-methylation to translation inhibitors, revealing a dependence
            of inhibition on temperature. In Chapter 3, I further compared melting temperatures
            of the healthy and the hypomodified ribosomes by Circular Dichroism and showed a significant
            decrease in thermal stability in absence of chemical modifications, underscoring their
            pivotal roles in determining ribosome stability and possibly its sensitivity to translation
            inhibitors. I pioneered the study of the effects of translation inhibitors on ribosome
            stability using Circular Dichroism. Finally, our lab obtained the structure of a hypopseudouridylated
            ribosome bound with a aminoglycoside (hygromycin B), which revealed a possibility
            mechanism for its hypersensivity.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>In recent decades, many research efforts focused on global climate change, multidecadal,
            decadal, interannual variability, and the increasing extreme events of sea surface
            temperature. In contrast, the continuous evolution of the reference frame, the annual
            cycle of SST used to quantify the aforementioned variability and changes, has long
            been overlooked, resulting in difficulties in under- standing the underlying physical
            mechanisms responsible for these variability and changes. This study strives to bridge
            this gap on the changes in SST annual cycle.By devising a running correlation-based
            method, the seasons such as summer and winter are characterized as a period of varying
            SST rather than an exact timing and the phase and amplitude of non-sinusoidal annually
            evolving SST annual cycle is quantified. It is revealed that the varying phases of
            summer or winter are more closely linked to multidecadal SST variability than to long-
            term climate change, with the former reaching 3.0 day/decade. Moreover, the changes
            in amplitude are well-explained by the distinct variation of summer and winter SST.
            Both the systematic shift of the phase and alterations in the annual cycle shape contribute
            to the phase changes which explain up to 1.2 K of monthly SST anomaly with respect
            to climatological annual cycle on multidecadal timescale. The variation of surface
            wind stress is found as an important driver of phase shift of SST annual cycle. Furthermore,
            it is evident that the SST annual cycle in CMIP6 historical simulations experience
            notable bias compared with that in ERA5 SST for both phase and summer/winter SST.
            The low-frequency variability is often overshadowed by substantial high-frequency
            part or, in some cases, underestimated in models. The oversensitivity of modeled SST
            to anthropogenic forcing significantly contributes to these results. A well-simulated
            temperature annual cycle is required for more realistic feedback mechanisms and interactions
            between regional climates.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Power electronic applications that demand ratings exceeding 250kW require medium voltage
            (MV) converters to handle the high power (HP) levels. MV HP converters are widely
            used in motor drive applications such as in heavy-duty electric and hybrid-electric
            propulsion/traction drives, as well as in other industrial applications including
            refiners, fans, pumps, and rolling mills. In addition to drives applications, the
            increased grid integration of renewable energy resources to achieve a more sustainable
            and cleaner energy has led to the proliferation of MV HP converters in utility applications.
            MV converters have played a major role in modernizing traditional transmission and
            distribution networks and facilitating the smart-grid transition. They can provide
            active control of power quality, provide shunt and series compensation, and achieve
            self-healing, islanding operation, fault handling, and other functionalities. To achieve
            low common mode voltages (CMV), low dv/dt stresses, low electromagnetic interference
            (EMI), and better harmonic performance, MV HP converters are often implemented with
            multi-level topologies. Among the several multilevel converter topologies, the modular
            multilevel converter (MMC) has received increasing interest due to its modularity,
            efficiency, and voltage and power scalability features. However, some challenges still
            exist for utilizing MV converters in general, and MMCs in particular, whether in motor
            drives or grid applications. These challenges are mainly driven by the high power
            density requirements. Along with cost, reliability, and efficiency, power density
            has recently become among the fundamental figures of merit when characterizing a power
            electronic conversion system performance. Nevertheless, many barriers exist that hinder
            achieving high power densities in MV applications. These power density barriers include
            the magnetic components such as transformers, harmonic filters, and the arm inductors
            of MMC-based MV conversion systems. As a result, any advancement along the power density
            trajectory would not be possible without a substantial reduction in the volume and
            weight of the aforementioned magnetic components. This research proposes the switched-capacitor
            modular multilevel converter (SCMMC) as a high power density converter, which can
            achieve inductor-less, filter-less, and transformer-less MV conversion. The dissertation
            is divided into six parts. In the first part, the power density challenges of MV converters
            are highlighted in grid and drives applications. In the second part, the switching
            frequency and the modulation technique choice of the multilevel inverters are presented.
            The importance of using the lowest frequency modulation with high number of levels
            to achieve the lowest harmonic distortion is demonstrated as the approach to make
            a filter-less and transformer-less operation possible. In the third part, the SCMMC
            topology is introduced as a solution towards high power density MV power conversion
            through its arm inductor-less topology. In the fourth part, the control of the SCMMC
            is presented; a low output frequency modulation technique is proposed for the SCMMC,
            and a startup control strategy is proposed for the SCMMC with middle submodule. In
            the fifth part, a 2kW, 425Vrms single phase SCMMC prototype built in our lab is showcased,
            and its modulation techniques are verified. In the final part, the scope of future
            research is presented.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Piano literature (or keyboard repertory studies) is commonly included in piano performance
            and some piano pedagogy degrees in the United States. This single or sequential course
            is required by the National Association of Schools of Music (NASM) at both undergraduate
            and graduate levels. While most universities include such courses in their degree
            requirements, it might be argued that not all instructors are well-equipped to teach
            piano literature courses. An oft-cited maxim in higher education is that "faculty
            teach the way they were taught" because they usually receive little formal training
            in teaching before entering the classroom. There are almost no pedagogical resources
            or materials that directly address issues regarding teaching piano literature courses
            to prepare young piano faculty and facilitate their teaching of such courses. While
            the fields of piano pedagogy, music theory, music history, and musicology have many
            up-to-date resources available for reference, there is minimal scholarly discussion
            of teaching piano literature courses in educational journals or at conferences. This
            treatise aims to serve as a reference for both young and experienced college professors
            to think about how piano literature classes for 21st-century pianists can and should
            be taught. It compiles the wisdom and experience of established textbook authors and
            course instructors at prominent music institutions in the United States. Using a qualitative
            inquiry approach, this document will discuss essential and neglected topics surrounding
            teaching a piano literature course. Discussions include teaching methodologies and
            strategies for Generation Z and Generation Alpha in the Artificial Intelligence world,
            selecting course materials that include overlooked composers without compromising
            canonic composers, and navigating the practicality of assignments in a piano literature
            course. This investigation seeks to initiate discussion on these important topics
            and contribute to the pedagogy of piano literature in higher education.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>A wealth of research has documented the association between low self-control and child
            victimization. However, the conditions under which low self-control has the greatest
            impact on victimization have rarely been examined and, more importantly, no prior
            research has examined the complex ways in which neighborhood characteristics interact
            with self-control and other individual characteristics to impact victimization. Using
            data from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods, the current study
            tests whether the effect of low self-control is contingent upon age and poverty and
            whether the positive effect of low self-control on victimization is lessened in neighborhoods
            with high collective efficacy. Furthermore, this study goes beyond the prior literature
            by examining the multifaceted nature of conditional effects. By employing three-level
            multivariate Rasch models and cross-level three-way interactions, the research demonstrates
            that low self-control increases the risk of victimization, and that the effect of
            low self-control depends on the combined effects of neighborhood collective efficacy
            of children, age, and poverty. Thus, this study claims that child victimization is
            a product of the complicated interplay between neighborhood context—child-based collective
            efficacy—and children's individual characteristics—low self-control, age, and poverty.
            This study advances our understanding of the specific conditions and situations where
            low self-control most significantly influences victimization, emphasizing the intricate
            nature of conditional effects. This research contributes importantly to building a
            developmental and life-course perspective on victimization. In addition, by forging
            new pathways in understanding the multifaceted influences on victimization, this research
            paves the way for innovative strategies in prevention and intervention, ultimately
            contributing to more effective and holistic approaches to addressing victimization
            across the lifespan.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This dissertation examines the interaction of social capital, interorganizational
            dynamics, the role of the third sector, and institutional change in post-disaster
            recovery context. The dissertation is a qualitative case study in the rural town of
            Adjuntas, Puerto Rico post-2017 Hurricane Maria. Puerto Rico was impacted by category
            4 Hurricane Maria on September 20, 2017, and left a death toll around 3,000 to 4,000
            people across the island and communties without communications systems, water, gasoline,
            road access and electric power for months and even over a year in some isolated communities.
            Around 6% of residents emigrated to US in the months right after the hurricane. The
            rural town of Adjuntas was selected to study disaster recovery within Puerto Rico
            due to its rural low-income context and its history of community participation in
            mining opposition and sustainable projects, with the local NGO Casa Pueblo playing
            a significant role in its history of community grassroot movements since 1980. This
            dissertation takes a three-paper approach. The first paper, in chapter two, is based
            on the social capital and post-disaster recovery literature. It uses the three dimensions
            of social capital, bonding, bridging, and linking to categorize and examine social
            capital dynamics. It concludes that disaster recovery is rooted in a game of relationships,
            with bonding social capital at the center of those relationships. In this paper, the
            central argument is that bonding social capital is used by communities as a gateway
            to other manifestations of social capital, such as bridging and linking. The second
            paper, in chapter three, discusses the role of non-governmental organizations in disaster
            recovery. This chapter confirms the literature about the key role of NGOs in post-disaster
            recovery, which often become first responders. It further claims that countries and
            communities where governmental response capacity is weak, post-disaster response is
            highly dependent on the response capacity of NGOs. This chapter also uses the metaphor
            of "sancochos comunitarios" to illustrate the interorganizational dynamics of NGOs
            discovered in Adjuntas. The third paper, in chapter four, suggests that a large-scale
            disaster presents an opportunity to shape institutional fields. They create the conditions
            to invite the integration of new players, including individuals, organizations, and
            networks that together have the potential to change institutional fields by creating
            new institutions, norms, collective consensuses and values that define the new society
            post-disaster recovery. This chapter integrates the concepts of sense of urgency,
            time compression, and institutional fields to develop an analytical framework as a
            tool to understand institutional change dynamics in post-disaster contexts.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Quasi-Newton methods have gained popularity across various domains, providing efficient
            iterative algorithms for finding optimal solutions to unconstrained optimization problems.
            Their limited- memory variants offer advantages in terms of reduced storage and computational
            requirements. This dissertation generalizes full Broyden family of limited-memory
            quasi-Newton optimization methods on Riemannian manifold (LRBroyden). The work encompasses
            the comprehensive anal- ysis, implementation, application and evaluation of LRBroyden.
            An essential extension to this research involves the adaptation of these algorithms
            to stochastic methods tailored for large-scale optimization. This results in the generalization
            of the stochastic variant of the Riemannian full Broyden family of limited-memory
            quasi-Newton methods, incorporating with variance reduction (LR-SBroyden-VR). The
            dissertation provides empirical insights into parameter selection and offers a thorough
            evaluation of the performance of various methods.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Ribosomes are giant RNA-protein complexes responsible for translating the information
            encoded by the genome to create the proteome in all kingdoms of life. In budding yeast,
            the mature cytoplasmic 80S ribosome consists of 79 ribosomal proteins (r-proteins)
            and 4 ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), which form the 40S small subunit (SSU) and the 60S large
            subunit (LSU). One of the most important chemical features of ribosomes is post-transcriptional
            modification of the rRNAs, most of which are comprised of pseudouridylation and 2'-hydroxyl
            methylation. Previous biochemical and genetic studies have shown that rRNA modifications:
            (1) facilitate ribosome biogenesis; (2) stabilize the structure of ribosomes; (3)
            ensure the efficiency and fidelity of the translation activity of ribosomes; (4) impact
            antibiotic sensitivity. Notably, the identification of partial modification sites
            on rRNA has added a new layer of ribosome heterogeneity, indicating its role in regulating
            gene expression. Despite the demonstrated importance of rRNA modifications, the molecular
            basis of how rRNA modification affects ribosome biogenesis and ribosome function remain
            elusive, owing to the lack of structural information. In this thesis, I investigate
            the structural impact of rRNA modification on ribosome biogenesis and function. I
            solved a series of atomic resolution cryo-EM structures of mature ribosome and precursor
            ribosome isolated from yeast mutant strains defective in rRNA modification activity.
            By comparing them with previously reported wild-type structures with fully modified
            rRNAs, I identified a surprising number of local and global structural changes. Removal
            of pseudouridine (Ψ) results in loss of Ψ-associated water molecules and Y-associated
            base pairing; altered structural arrangement of the decoding center; abnormal inter-
            and intra-subunit movement. Removal of 2'-hydroxyl methylation (Nm) results in gain
            of Nm-associated water molecules; altered sugar pucker preference; disrupted structural
            arrangement of the exit tunnel; impaired maturation of peptidyl transfer center; erroneous
            domain motions. These structural abnormality upon loss of Ψ or Nm, provide molecular
            explanation for the observed functional defect, paving the road towards understanding
            the role of rRNA modification played in maintaining the accuracy and efficiency of
            ribosome production and function.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Renewable energy source has been integrated into our distribution system with a rapid
            pace. At the same time, the increasing amount of renewable energy source lead to instability
            and low power quality issues to the distribution systems, especially for underground
            cable based distribution systems. The major cause of these issues are the resonant
            phenomenon, which can lead to unwanted oscillations of voltage or current and then
            cause control or hardware failure of the distribution system. So, measures must be
            taken to suppress, transform, or eliminate these unwanted factors. This dissertation
            addresses the issues and analyzes the causes of the underground cable based distribution
            systems with renewable energy source. The state-of-the-art techniques to solve such
            issues are introduced. To perform the theoretical analysis, the mathematical and simulation
            models are built for inverter-based renewable resources, distribution grid interface,
            and underground cable based distribution lines. After that, the proposed strategy
            is comprehensively introduced. The research shows that the traditional interface inverter
            control method limits the possibility of utilizing the characteristics of inverters.
            In order to introduce the new method, a novel PLL-less and voltage sensorless inner
            loop control method of the interfacing inverter of the renewable energy source and
            the distribution network is presented. Then, the virtual resistance control method
            is carried out to showcase how the aforementioned issues can be solved. The first
            chapter will give an introduction of the background of the research, and lead out
            the emerging problems we are facing. The second chapter will give a description of
            the base methodology to be used in the research. The third chapter will introduce
            the control method which will be used for the solution. Chapter four will discuss
            the virtual resistor based method in detail. And finally, chapter five will conclude
            the dissertation and provide future works.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This dissertation includes four research projects. The first two projects mainly focus
            on the depth method on temporal point process data. The third project is the depth
            method on spatial point process. This is an extension of the first two projects. The
            fourth one is about memory and future movement decoding on spike train of small rats,
            which is collaborated with Dr. Aaron Wilber's lab in Psychology Department. I will
            provide summaries of each project below. The details can be found in the main chapters.
            Project 1: Statistical Depth for Point Process via the Isometric Log-Ratio Transformation.
            Statistical depth, a useful tool to measure the center-outward rank of multivariate
            and functional data, is still under-explored in temporal point processes. Recent studies
            on point process depth proposed a weighted product of two terms - one indicates the
            depth of the cardinality of the process, and the other characterizes the conditional
            depth of the temporal events given the cardinality. The second term is of great challenge
            because of the apparent nonlinear structure of event times, and so far only parametric
            representations such as Gaussian and Dirichlet densities have been adopted in the
            definitions. However, these parametric forms ignore the underlying distribution of
            the process events and are difficult to apply to complicated patterns. To deal with
            these problems, a novel distribution-based approach is proposed to the conditional
            depth via the well-known Isometric Log-Ratio (ILR) transformation on the inter-event
            times. Motivated by a uniform distribution on simplex, the new method, called the
            ILR depth, is formally defined for general point process via a Time Rescaling. The
            mathematical properties of the ILR depth are thoroughly examined and the new method
            is well illustrated by using Poisson and non-Poisson processes to demonstrate its
            superiority over previous methods. Finally, the ILR depth is applied in a real dataset
            and the result clearly shows its effectiveness in ranking. Project 2: Depth-Based
            Statistical Inferences in the Spike Train Space. Metric-based summary statistics such
            as mean and covariance have been introduced in neural spike train space. They can
            properly describe template and variability in spike train data, but are often sensitive
            to outliers and expensive to compute. Recent studies also examine outlier detection
            and classification methods on point processes. These tools provide reasonable result,
            whereas the accuracy remains at a low level in certain cases. In this study, we propose
            to adopt a well-established notion of statistical depth to the spike train space.
            This framework can naturally define the median in a set of spike trains, which provides
            a robust description of the "template" of the observations. It also provides a principled
            method to identify "outliers" and classify data from different categories. We systematically
            compare the new median, outlier detection and classification tools with state-of-the-art
            competing methods. The result shows the median has superior description for template
            than the mean. Moreover, the proposed outlier detection and classification perform
            more accurately than previous methods. Project 3: Statistical Depth in Spatial Point
            Process. Statistical depth is widely used as a powerful tool to measure the center-outward
            rank of multivariate and functional data. Recent studies have introduced the notion
            of depth to the temporal point process, which exhibits randomness in the cardinality
            as well as distribution in the observed events. The proposed methods can well capture
            the rank of a point process in a given time interval, where a critical step is to
            measure the rank by using inter-arrival events. We propose to extend the depth concept
            to multivariate spatial point process. In this case, the observed process is in a
            multi-dimensional location and there are no conventional inter-arrival events in the
            temporal process. We adopt the newly-developed depth in metric space by defining two
            different metrics, namely the penalized metric and smoothing metric, to fully explore
            the depth in spatial point process. The mathematical properties and large sample theory,
            as well as depth-based hypothesis testings, are thoroughly discussed. We then use
            several simulations to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed depth method.
            Finally, we apply the new method in a real world dataset and obtain desirable ranking
            performance. Project 4: Memory and Future Movement Decoding on Spike Train Information.
            Movement through space and establishing memories based on such experiences is essential
            for survival of animals including humans. This ability is thought to require storage
            of memories often in an allocentric (map-like) framework and conversion to a body-centered
            reference frame comprised of specific locomotor actions (e.g., turn right). These
            frameworks must be coordinated in a fluid manner during navigation. The encoding observed
            in hippocampus (HPC) and parietal cortex (PC) has led to the notion that this circuit
            operates as a part of a coordinate transformation network; for example, transforming
            a remembered allocentric representation into the appropriate action. While HPC neurons
            are typically modulated by allocentric locations, PC neurons are modulated by multiple
            reference frames including actions (e.g., right turn). This hypothesis was tested
            using a complex spatial sequence task where rats learn to navigate to unmarked locations
            fixed in space in a specific sequence. Landmarks are distributed around the room for
            spatial orientation. We use a sequence (1-2-3-4-1-2-3-5-) that has a repeating path
            segment (1-2-3) followed by one of two distinct actions. Specifically, the rat learns
            in context 1-2-3-4, to go to 4 for reward, while in context 1-2-3-5 the rat must go
            to 5. Thus, navigation to zone 4 or 5 requires a map-to-action transformation. This
            emulates the spatial memory problem one encounters when driving through an intersection
            and remembering the appropriate action given the current route and goals (e.g., turn
            left to a bank versus right to home). Sets of "cued" runs in which a light at each
            goal leads the rat through the sequence are interleaved with unguided (memory) runs
            through the complete 1-2-3-4-1-2-3-5 sequence . During memory runs, following an error,
            a light cue directs the rat to the next zone in the sequence. Thus, during memory
            runs, the rat must coordinate between remembered allocentric context and egocentric
            action. We found that decoded PC ensembles (and some single cells; but not simultaneously
            recorded HPC ensembles) predict upcoming actions following the repeating path segment
            (3-4 &amp; 3-5) during "memory" but not "cued" trials. Additionally, we hypothesize that
            accurate action selection by PC will require HPC encoding of memory for the allocentric
            context. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that a failure in allocentric context
            decoding (forgetting if came from 5 vs 4 while navigating 1-2) by HPC ensembles (but
            not by PC ensembles) also predict behavioral errors. Thus, we provide evidence that
            the HPC-PC circuit is a coordinate transformation network for interfacing between
            map like and person centered reference frames.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>American composer Kevin Day (b.1996) experienced a quick rise to notoriety in the
            wind band community, largely fueled by the success of his Concerto for Euphonium and
            Wind Ensemble (2018). The work's first movement, premiered by Demondrae Thurman, Associate
            Dean and Professor of Euphonium and Chamber Music at Indiana University and the Texas
            Christian University Wind Ensemble, saw an outpouring of interactions and views through
            the spread of a social media post by Thurman. This premiere quickly led to a series
            of concerto commissions by Kevin Day, elevating his reputation and expanding his body
            of work. At this moment in time, Concerto for Euphonium and Wind Ensemble is one of
            four works written for euphonium by Black composers. The work's quality solidifies
            it as a piece that should be studied by high level euphoniumists. This performance
            guide incorporates analysis of form, motivic elements, and musical narrative concepts
            as delineated by Byron Almén. Furthermore, it draws from techniques informed through
            the author's preparation and performance experience, as well as insights gleaned from
            interviews with Kevin Day, Demondrae Thurman, and SSG Hiram Diaz of The President's
            Own United States Marine Band. In addition to the utilization of method books by Jean-Baptiste
            Arban, David Vining, and Johannes Rochut, Kevin Day's 25 Advanced Studies for Euphonium
            are highlighted as modern works written for euphonium that will serve as an aid to
            preparing the concerto. Finally, the guide includes exercises composed by the author
            that isolate passages from the music and simplify them, facilitating a thorough understanding
            of the intervallic relationships and techniques required to execute the Concerto at
            a high level.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Coastal areas are very dynamic places, and a lot of that is due to the movement of
            waves and currents, which are responsible for disturbances on the seabed by causing
            shear-stress. Bed shear-stress can cause sediment motion and transport, which is very
            important in coastal areas because of beach morphology changes, viability of coastal
            constructions, among others. However, sediment transport depends on very complex and
            interactive processes, some of which are still not very well understood or sometimes
            poorly calculated. Waves and currents are the main drivers of sediment movement in
            coastal areas. This study analyzed the wave contribution to the bed shear-stress near
            the coast of the Florida Panhandle. Florida is one of the most vulnerable states to
            hurricanes in the US, but the Peninsular Florida acts as a shield for the Gulf side
            from westerly hurricanes, and the wide West Florida Shelf protects this region from
            the Gulf waters. Dog Island Reef is located near the coast of the Florida Panhandle,
            on a low gradient and low energy continental margin. The region is composed mostly
            of sandy beaches, barrier islands, and low energy waves arrive at the shoreline. Four
            stations were chosen near Dog Island Reef to have sediments collected and analyzed
            for size distribution. The sediment sampling stations were strategically located in
            between two other sites where wave data were collected for four years (2008 – 2011).
            The wave data was acquired using moored ADCPs and narrowed down to the period of peak
            hurricane season (August 1st to October 31st). Relevant statistical wave parameters
            such as significant and maximum wave heights (HS and HMax), and wave directions (WDir)
            are presented for both sites during each storm period. The four sediment samples were
            classified into the textural group "slightly gravely sand", presenting a low percentage
            (~ 5%) of fine gravel or bigger; station 2 showed a high (72%) percentage of small
            sizes (fine sand or smaller) when compared to the other 3 stations (25%). Six tropical
            cyclones that passed through the Northeastern Gulf of Mexico in that period were selected
            for the analysis. All storms caused similar wave heights at site A (HS ~ 1.1 m, HMax
            ~ 1.7 m) with highest waves coming from south-southwest quadrants, and the highest
            wave caused by Tropical Storm Fay. Site B had more variability in wave height (HS
            1.5 ~ 2.8 m, HMax 2.7 ~ 4.5 m) and spread directions. Tropical Storm Lee created southerly
            winds with the longest fetch, generating the highest waves in the record. All recorded
            wind directions followed an organized and delineated clockwise (counterclockwise for
            Fay) change of directions during storms closest approach to mooring sites, while wave
            directions followed that same pattern with a -15° offset approximately. The critical
            shear stress for initiation of movement was calculated for both sites considering
            median grain size d50 = 292.9 µm, and was 0.2 Nm-2. The mean calculated wave-induced
            stress was approximately 0.04 Nm-2 at both sites, and maximum of 0.52 / 1.11 Nm-2
            for sites A/B respectively. Tropical Storm Lee caused the highest stresses for the
            longest time at both sites. During the four-year period analyzed, stress was above
            critical threshold of movement for less than 10% of the year, and storms were usually
            responsible for about 50% of that contribution.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Hiring private tutors is causing a financial burden on parents, as they are made to
            pay high tutoring fees in Nigeria. Yet, Nigerian parents continue to invest heavily
            in financially burdensome private tutoring amid high poverty levels. This evident
            paradox between high poverty levels and the widespread use of financially burdensome
            private educational support in Nigeria has received little attention. This gap motivated
            me to use in-depth qualitative interviews to explore why parents often pay high tutoring
            fees to support their children's education, despite the financial burden it creates,
            and how parents perceive the academic impacts of private tutors. In light of this
            contradiction, this study also uses a cross-sectional survey to examine whether there
            is a relationship between children having a private tutor to assist with homework
            and their reading and numeracy outcomes. A total of 18,737 primary-school-age children
            in a nationally representative household survey data set was used as the analytic
            sample for the quantitative arm of this mixed-methods study. A total of 15 parents
            who hire private tutors to assist their primary school-age children in doing their
            homework were selected for the qualitative phase of this study. Thematic analysis
            and binary logistic regression were used to analyze the qualitative interview data
            and quantitative survey data, respectively. This study found that hiring the service
            of private tutors created a financial burden on parents. This study asked why parents
            continued to invest in private tutoring. This study found that the major reason parents
            hired private tutors to guide their children in doing their homework was to ensure
            they grew academically. Since the major reason why parents invested in private tutoring
            for their children was to ensure they would grow academically, this study asked the
            parents about the perceived impacts of private tutors assisting their children in
            doing their homework on their children's academic outcomes. Nigerian parents perceived
            that private tutoring improved their children's reading and numeracy outcomes as well
            as the outcomes of their children in other academic subjects. However, the parents'
            perceptions might be subjective, and the private tutors who were the classroom teachers
            of the children they tutor in this study might have engaged in unethical activities
            that led to improvement in the children's reading and numeracy outcomes. This plausible
            subjectivity of parents' and teachers' unethical activities made this study take a
            step further to use a cross-sectional, descriptive design to investigate the relationship
            between children having a private tutor to assist with homework and their reading
            and numeracy outcomes. In contrast to parents' stated beliefs, the findings of this
            study's quantitative phase revealed no statistically significant relationship between
            children having a private tutor to assist with homework and their reading performance.
            In addition, this study found that children having parents, other family members,
            and neighbors assisting them with their homework was significantly related to reading
            outcomes. However, in line with parents' stated views, a statistically significant
            positive relationship existed between having a private tutor to guide children with
            homework and their numeracy outcomes. Based on these findings, this study recommends
            that policies be developed to ensure high-quality private tutoring is accessible to
            all children to improve their numeracy outcomes. Also, educated families and neighbors
            should be encouraged to guide their children in their homework to improve their reading
            outcomes.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>With advancements of technology over the past few years, digital imaging data has
            grown significantly.Such data is analyzed here using statistical shape analysis. It
            is important to develop theoretical methods to perform the analysis in a nonparametric
            way. Here, one develops nonparametric procedures for comparing two extrinsic antimeans
            on compact manifolds, using recent limit theorems for extrinsic sample antimeans w.r.t.
            an arbitrary embedding of a compact manifold into a Euclidean space. One derives a
            large sample chi square test for the equality of two extrinsic antimeans. Applications
            are given to distributions on Kendall planar shape spaces, in their complex projective
            space representations, that are Veronese-Whitney embedded in numerical spaces of self-adjoint
            matrices. Two medical imaging examples are given. The study of finite configurations
            of points modulo projective transformations is called projective shape analysis, and
            it is the topic of this paper, which has a various applications in machine vision.
            We also present a suitable coordinate system for this projective shape space, together
            with an appropriate projective shape space. The projective form space that results
            for general arrangements of k points in m dimensions is known to be a combination
            of k-m-2 copies of the axial space Rm. Finally, one also hints at two sample tests
            for means on the projective shape space of k-ads in general position in P(Rm+1) associated
            with R^{m+1}. Applications to 3D bioshape analysis for data extracted from digital
            camera images are introduced. For small samples test are based on Efron's nonparametric
            bootstrap.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>In many Monte Carlo applications, one can substitute the use of pseudorandom numbers
            with quasirandom numbers and achieve improved convergence. This is because quasirandom
            numbers are more uniform than pseudorandom numbers. The most common measure of that
            uniformity is the star discrepancy. In addition, the main error bound in quasi-Monte
            Carlo methods, called the Koksma–Hlawka inequality, has a star discrepancy in its
            formulation. A difficulty with this bound is that computing the star discrepancy is
            known to be an NP-hard problem, so we have been looking for effective approximate
            algorithms. The star discrepancy can be thought of as the maximum of a function called
            the local discrepancy, and we will develop approximate algorithms to maximize this
            function.In this dissertation, we introduce new algorithms for estimating the lower
            bounds for the star discrepancy. The random walk algorithm is based on the Monte Carlo
            method for computing the star discrepancy using random walks through some of the points
            in the unit cube [0, 1]^s. The second algorithm is analogous to the random walk algorithm;
            instead of directly accepting the randomly chosen dimension, we apply the Metropolis
            algorithm to the chosen dimension to accept or reject this movement. We call it the
            Metropolis random walk algorithm. The implementation of this algorithm is based on
            the Markov chain Monte Carlo method. This approximation is much less expensive than
            computing the exact value of the star discrepancy. The random walk algorithm and Metropolis
            random walk algorithm can find the exact value of the star discrepancy or estimate
            the lower bound of the star discrepancy in a reasonable time. The findings of our
            experiment indicate that the estimation of the star discrepancy is obtained without
            a substantial computational cost. Also, in comparison to all previously known techniques,
            the Metropolis random walk algorithm is superior, especially in high dimensions.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Urban traffic congestion has become an increasingly critical issue as the number of
            vehicle owners continues to rise each year, resulting in increased travel times, fuel
            consumption, and environmental pollution. Traditional adaptive traffic signal control
            systems struggle to accommodate this rapid growth in traffic demand, highlighting
            the need for innovative and efficient solutions to manage traffic in urban environments.
            Connected vehicle (CV) technology, which enables vehicles to communicate with each
            other and infrastructure, has emerged as a promising solution to address these challenges.
            The integration of CV data can significantly enhance traffic management systems, allowing
            for more effective traffic signal optimization, improved traffic flow, and increased
            safety. This dissertation focuses on the development and evaluation of a novel algorithm
            for optimizing adaptive traffic signals under platooned CVs. The goal is to harness
            the potential of CV technology and vehicle platooning to improve traffic efficiency,
            safety, and environmental sustainability in urban settings. By leveraging the unique
            characteristics of CVs, mixed traffic scenarios, and the dynamic nature of urban traffic,
            the proposed algorithm aims to address the limitations of existing traffic signal
            control systems and provide a more efficient and adaptable solution. The study begins
            with a comprehensive literature review to identify the current state of the art in
            adaptive traffic signal control systems, CV technologies, platooning, and their integration
            in traffic management. The review serves as a foundation for understanding the research
            gaps and opportunities in this field, setting the stage for the development of the
            proposed algorithm. The main contribution of this dissertation is the development
            of a robust, efficient, and adaptable algorithm for optimizing adaptive traffic signals
            under platooned CVs. A simulation-based framework was designed and implemented to
            evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, considering various performance
            indicators such as travel times, delays, queue lengths, vehicle stops, fuel consumption,
            and emissions. The safety implications of the algorithm were also investigated, providing
            valuable insights into its safety performance. The performance of the proposed algorithm
            was compared with existing traffic signal control strategies, including both traditional
            and connected vehicle-based approaches. The algorithm demonstrated superior performance
            in terms of various traffic parameters and improved traffic safety compared to existing
            strategies. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the algorithm's adaptability
            and robustness under different traffic conditions, CV penetration levels, and platoon
            formation scenarios. The findings of this dissertation have important theoretical
            and practical implications for the fields of adaptive traffic signal control and CV
            technology. The study contributes to existing theories, models, and frameworks in
            the field, while also providing recommendations for traffic engineers, policymakers,
            and other stakeholders on how to leverage the research to improve traffic management,
            alleviate congestion, reduce emissions, and enhance safety. Limitations and future
            research directions are also discussed, offering potential avenues for further investigation
            and development in the area of adaptive traffic signal control and CV technology.
            This research lays the groundwork for the next generation of traffic management systems
            that can effectively accommodate the increasing traffic demand and capitalize on the
            benefits of connected vehicles and platooning.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The country of Serbia, located in Central/Southeastern Europe, offers a rich trumpet
            tradition worth examining due to the depth and diversity of art and knowledge tied
            to its unique socio-political history and cultural traditions. Isolated from Western
            musical trends during the Ottoman Empire's rule over the region from the 15th through
            the 19th centuries, the contemporary music of Serbia offers a synthesis of Eastern
            and Western sound concepts, incorporating musical trends and style elements of folk
            tunes and Orthodox chants as well as elements of atonality, electronic music, classicism,
            romanticism, and jazz. This treatise provides an overview of Serbia's classical trumpet
            tradition by cataloging its history, repertoire, and pedagogical concepts. By compiling
            as much available information into one document, this treatise fills a gap in scholarship
            about the depth and diversity of the music and pedagogy of Serbian classical trumpet,
            and functions as a springboard for those interested in further study on this topic.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The stability of soliton solutions in Ablowitz-Musslimani type equations is investigated.
            In particular, the robustness of line solitons to transverse perturbations is studied.
            The linear stability problem for perturbed solitons is formulated for the nonlocal
            reverse time and parity-time symmetric nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equations. Through
            a combination of numerical and analytical approaches, it is determined that the stability
            profiles for the one soliton solutions are identical to that of the classical NLS
            equation. Direct numerical simulations agree with the stability analysis and reveal
            filamentation and collapse of perturbed solutions. Collapse is explored. A generalized
            variance quantity is introduced in an attempt to describe the blow-up of localized
            functions. Simulations reveal that this quantity going to zero in finite time does
            not, in general, indicate collapse in finite time.In this thesis, we also study modulational
            instability using a neural network approach. This is done by using the Physics Informed
            Neural Network (PINN) applied to the stability problem. In particular, we postulate
            a loss functional whose minimization leads to system parameter identifications. The
            input is a randomly perturbed plane wave and the output is a binary number i.e. 0
            or 1 with 0 representing a stable state whereas 1 indicates a modulationally unstable
            plane wave. The advantage of this approach is that it is fast, accurate, and effective
            (computationally feasible).</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The nervous system of a human being is formed gradually during embryonic development.
            On a microscopic level, neuronal development involves (1) differentiation, polarization
            and migration of nerve and glial cells, (2) the growth and guidance of axons, and
            (3) formation and elimination of synapses. This thesis focuses on two aspects of the
            development: neuronal polarization and axonal growth. Neuronal polarization, a process
            wherein nascent neurons develop a single long axon and multiple short dendrites, can
            occur within in vitro cell cultures without environmental cues. This is an apparently
            random process in which one of several short processes, called neurites, grows to
            become long, while the others remain short. In this thesis, we propose a minimum model
            for neurite growth, which involves bistability and random excitations reflecting actin
            waves. Positive feedback is needed to produce the bistability, while negative feedback
            is required to ensure that no more than one neurite wins the winner-takes-all contest.
            By applying the negative feedback to different aspects of the neurite growth process,
            we demonstrate that targeting the negative feedback to the excitation amplitude results
            in the most persistent polarization. Also, we demonstrate that there are optimal ranges
            of values for the neurite count, and for the excitation rate and amplitude that best
            maintain the polarization. Finally, we show that a previously published model for
            neuronal polarization based on competition for limited resources shares key features
            with our best-performing minimal model: bistability and negative feedback targeted
            to the size of random excitations. Following polarization, an axon grows under the
            intrinsic control of the neuron. We develop a closed-loop multi-scale model for axon
            length regulation based on a frequency-dependent negative feedback mechanism. It builds
            on earlier models by linking molecular motor dynamics to signaling delays that then
            determine signal oscillation period. The signal oscillation is treated as a front
            end for a signaling pathway that modulates axonal length. This model is used to demonstrate
            the feasibility of such a mechanism and is tested against two previously published
            reports in which experimental manipulations were performed that resulted in axon growth.
            The model captures these observations and yields an expression for equilibrium axonal
            length. One major prediction of the model is that increasing motor density in the
            body of an axon results in axonal growth. Several future research directions follow
            naturally from our work. These include: (1) mean first passage time problems of a
            bistable system under Poissonian noise, (2) axonal and dendritic branching variability,
            and (3) bistability in the treatment of Alzheimer Disease by antibodies.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The GlueX experiment is located in Newport News, Virginia and aims to search for exotic
            quantum states that are not predicted by the quark model. These states include multi-quark
            configurations and configurations with excited gluons. This dissertation describes
            an investigation of the photoproduction of \(\eta \eta^\prime \) which is expected
            to decay from an isoscalar partner to the \(\pi_{1}(1600)\) with exotic quantum numbers
            \(J^{PC} = 1^{-+}\). A detailed data selection study is presented to achieve an exclusive
            reaction \(\gamma p \rightarrow \eta^{\prime}\eta p\). A differential cross section
            in four bins of \(M(\eta^{\prime} \eta)\) is calculated. The cross section was calculated
            for a beam energy greater than 7.5 GeV. The mass bin from 1.7 to 2.1 GeV\(/c^{2}\)
            is the region where BESIII observed a candidate for the exotic \(\eta_{1}\). However,
            no significant features were observed in the cross section in this region to corroborate
            their observation. Nonetheless, there are some similarities such as the sharp rise
            near threshold and a peaking structure near 2 GeV\(/c^{2}\). Systematic uncertainties
            are included in the calculation of the cross section using the Barlow test to consider
            the significance of certain data selections.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The GlueX experiment has produced the world's largest statistics for peripheral photoproduction
            of mesons with a goal to search for exotic mesons. This document presents results
            on the search for possible intermediate resonances which decay to $\omega \eta$. Little
            is known for the states seen in this decay channel such as the $\omega(1420)$ and
            $\omega(1650)$. This channel also allows to search for the never seen exotics $J^{PC}=0^{--}$,
            $2^{+-}$, and the elusive $2^{--}$. The $\omega$, in this reaction, is identified
            via the $\pi^{+} \pi^{-} \pi^{0}$ decay mode and the $\eta$ and $\pi^{0}$ are identified
            via the decay to 2$\gamma$. Data from the GlueX Phase I was analyzed. This data was
            obtained at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility utilizing the GlueX
            detector and a tagged linearly polarized photon beam incident on a liquid hydrogen
            target. A model using the expected major wave contributors, $1^{+-}$ and $1^{--}$,
            shows two structure in the region where the $\omega(1420)$ and $\omega(1650)$ are
            expected. A third structure is seen at threshold with the quantum numbers of an $h_1$
            resonance, however, more studies are needed to assert the nature of this structure.
            Instabilities on the $m=\pm 1$ were shown to come from mathematical ambiguities. This
            only occurs between the $m=1$ and $m=-1$ projections when both reflectivities are
            present in close amount. Expanding the intensity equation for a single wave allows
            to extract coefficients that can help describe the data. A tangent study is also presented
            in this document which consists on a direct fit to the line-shape of an isolated N(1535).
            This baryonic resonance is well established but its Breit-Wigner parameters have only
            been obtained from partial wave analysis. In contrast, this study obtained the Breit-Wigner
            parameters using a direct fit and finds the value of the width to be 70.5$\pm$ 9.2
            MeV; this is half of the accepted value.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The actinide elements are playing larger roles in modern life, finding uses in nuclear
            energy, remote power sources, medical uses as radiotherapy isotopes, as well as in
            geological applications in nuclear tools. However, due to their scarcity and radioactivity,
            their chemistry is not well understood and often present unexpected behavior due to
            their position in the periodic table where spin–orbit coupling and relativistic effects
            are increasingly greater. Exploring their chemistry will provide us with a better
            fundamental understanding of superheavy elements which also has the practical aspect
            of aiding us in solving problems such as lanthanide/actinide separation and actinide/actinide
            separation in the processing and recycling of used nuclear fuel. These separation
            processes rely on making advantage of differentiation of the lanthanide and actinide
            series, which often behave very similar to one another. Differentiation between the
            two series can be increased by complexation with soft–donor ligands which increase
            orbital overlap and covalent bonding with actinide complexes in comparison to lanthanide
            complexes, leading to shorter bond distances and structural differences. Differences
            in lanthanide and actinide bonding can also be further examined by deliberately modulating
            the metal–ligand bonds by applying external pressure through diamond anvil cell (DAC)
            techniques. By shortening the bond distances, orbital overlap can be increased to
            varying degrees depending on the particular element or complexing ligand.First, chapter
            1 provides the necessary context and background to the research conducted in this
            dissertation and chapter 2 covers some of the common characterization and experimental
            techniques used. Chapter 3 sets the basis for the dissertation by finishing the trans–uranic
            actinide series neptunium to californium of mellitate complexes by characterizing
            two neptunium mellitate polymers and allows for a broad comparison of the bonding
            differences between the actinide and lanthanide series for the series of mellitate
            compounds. This study shows the two series behave nearly identically in their bonding
            and structure. Chapters 4–7 then examine complexes of neptunium, plutonium, americium,
            curium, and californium with the 1,2–dithiolate ligand maleonitrile dithiolate (mnt),
            which is a soft sulfur–donor ligand, contrasting with the hard oxygen–donor mellitate
            ligand from chapter 3. Spectroscopic, crystallographic, and high–pressure characterizations
            reveal increases in f–orbital participation in the actinide complexes in comparison
            to the lanthanide complexes, resulting in bond lengths substantially shorter than
            expected for their ionic radii as well as f–f transitions greatly stabilized in energy
            which shift by large amounts under applied pressure. Chapter 8 then broadly compares
            the lanthanide and actinide complexes. In the actinide series, differentiation between
            the early part of the series Np–Pu versus the later part Am–Cf is observed, highlighting
            the unique bonding induced by the mnt ligands. Chapter 9 begins the second half of
            the dissertation more focused on high–pressure studies by describing a pressure–induced
            oxidation in two different samarium(II) complexes with a crown ether and a cryptand
            ligand. In both complexes, samarium is observed spectroscopically to oxidize from
            the +2–oxidation state to the +3–oxidation state. In chapter 10 a cerium mellitate
            coordination polymer is structurally characterized under pressure using high–pressure
            X–ray crystallography techniques. This study reveals a cooridination number transition
            from 9 to 9.5 due to the bonding of a lattice water molecule that is interestingly
            not visible in ambient pressure crystal structures. In addition, the bond length decreases
            due to pressure for water and carboxylate oxygens are quantified and agree well with
            computationally determined bond length decreaes. Lastly, in chapter 11, the changes
            in the absorption and photoluminescence spectra for various complexes of americium,
            curium, berkelium, and californium are all examined and compared. This study further
            supports the dependance on the ligand and the metal on the participation of f–electrons
            in bonding, that soft donor ligands and lighter actinides result in a greater degree
            of f–orbital involvement. It also reveals the importance of redox chemistry in pressure
            effects of the spectra as in the case of berkelium, which having an accessible +4–oxidation
            state, exhibits much smaller shifts and even blue–shifting of transitions as opposed
            to more commonly observed red–shifting. This work provides the first examples of of
            trans–uranic actinide(III) with a 1,2–dithiolate ligand which exhibits a particularly
            high degree of lanthanide/actinide differentiation, as well as furthering our understanding
            of the effects of pressure on changes in bonding and structure in lanthanide and actinide

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This thesis revisited a previous topic on how the downstream and/or large-scale midlatitude
            response to a recurving TC potentially depends on the strength and/or location of
            the TC. This study differs from what Brannan and Chagnon (2020) in that this analysis
            examines ensemble forecasts for individual cases, thus controlling for the high variance
            in large-scale circulations that occur between different cases. The two cases focused
            on in this study are Tropical Cyclone (TC) Sandy (2012) and Tropical Cyclone (TC)
            Irene (2011). The question answered in the completion of this project is: How does
            the location and strength of a TC affect the forecast downstream?It was found that
            the nature of the interaction/relationship between the strength and location of a
            TC and how it affects downstream wave behavior is highly case sensitive. A large,
            statistically significant modification of the large-scale wave pattern was found for
            TC Sandy. The sensitivity of the wave pattern to TC characteristics was contingent
            on the storm propagating far enough north to affect the jet. The interaction in TC
            Sandy may have been advantaged due to its occurrence during the fall months (strong
            jet stream that is located not as far north). Specifically, the latitudinal location
            and MSLP anomaly magnitude (strength) of TC Sandy greatly affected the waves observed
            downstream. On the other hand, TC Irene showed less of a relationship between the
            strength/location and the downstream wave behavior. This was thought to be due to
            a lack of a strong jet stream that was located too far north to be affected by TC
            Irene. Nevertheless, TC Irene did exhibit an impact on the downstream wave behavior
            and the location and strength of the storm. The main takeaways of this project are
            that 1) downstream midlatitude effects from a TC are contingent on the location and
            strength of the TC, and 2) the strength of the interaction is case dependent. Meaning
            there might be more similarities between TC Irene and TC Sandy if they were occurring
            in the same season, instead of the latter being in the fall and former being in the
            summer.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The electrical power industry faces a never-ending and increasing demand for innovative
            designs and ideas to provide electrical power with reduced size, a clean environment,
            and resiliency. Electric transport systems are some of the latest innovative techniques
            being researched and developed. The high power demands of the power systems of transport
            platforms need high power density, energy efficiency, and resiliency. High-temperature
            superconducting (HTS) power cables are a viable solution to meet the ambitious goals.
            HTS power cables offer a current density ten times greater than conventional ones.
            HTS power cables can accomplish high power transmission with lower voltage values
            than traditional counterparts. The high current density reduces the size and weight
            of the power cables and other electrical components within the power system. HTS devices
            require a cryogenic environment to regulate the temperature. An electrical insulation
            system suitable for the appropriate voltage and cryogenic operating temperature is
            also needed. Therefore, it is essential to understand the dielectric properties of
            electrical insulation in a realistic cryogenic environment. The research performed
            for this thesis focused on the dielectric properties of cryogenic epoxies as electric
            insulation material for HTS power cables for electrical transport systems such as
            electric ships and aircraft. This thesis focused on three areas: a study to understand
            the various materials used for electrical insulation for power cables, characterization
            of the dielectric properties of common epoxies suitable for cryogenic temperatures,
            assessment of their ability to serve as electrical insulation for HTS cables, and
            a test cable fabricated implementing the epoxies as electrical insulation with liquid
            nitrogen (LN2), gaseous helium (GHe), and GHe gas mixtures.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Object retrieval is used in many popular photo applications. For example, the iPhone
            photos application has a search bar where objects can be queried to find photos of
            the given object. The goal of this thesis is to test a novel framework for object
            retrieval that trains on the running averages of the features of a given object, in
            our case we looked at backpacks and used models to retrieve those objects. A transfer
            learning method by using the top layers of CLIP by Open-AI as well as the top layers
            of SWSL by Meta to extract features of our images then applied different models such
            as Online Feature Selection with Annealing and Online Least Squares. We tested them
            on both a small dataset created through scraping images with the Selenium python package
            as well as the Imagenet1000 validation set from the 2012 challenge. What we found
            is a method that trains fairly quickly with very high recall but low precision which
            is hypothesized to be because of the large dataset having objects that are unknown
            but are similar in features to the queried object.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>In today's digital landscape, the widespread availability and simplicity of image
            manipulation software has contributed to a significant increase in the dissemination
            of manipulated images. Combined with the rapid spread of controversial content on
            social media platforms, there exists a critical need to protect individuals and institutions
            from malicious disinformation campaigns and unjust cancel culture. This calls for
            robust methods of detecting and combating image manipulation. This thesis focuses
            on analyzing the capabilities of two state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural networks,
            CAT-Net and MVSS-Net, in the context of image manipulation detection. By evaluating
            the applicability of these networks, the research aims to identify and measure the
            existing gap in safeguarding against the harmful effects of manipulated images.Building
            upon prior research, the thesis introduces three key experiments to assess the generalization
            ability of CAT-Net and MVSS-Net. The first experiment focuses on calculating the receptive
            field size of the networks, shedding light on their maximum capabilities in the face
            of improving image resolution and quality. The second experiment investigates the
            networks' sensitivity to manipulations, suggesting sensitivity to minute alterations
            as small as 100 pixels in total. These experiments provide valuable insights into
            the networks' strengths and limitations, contributing to a comprehensive understanding
            of their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. The final experiment employs a recently
            theorized concept called the generalization interval to evaluate the networks' performance
            in detecting complex, real-world image manipulations. The findings from this experiment
            reveal that neither network exhibits accurate detection capabilities under the forgiving
            conditions of easy, human-detectable manipulations. However, CAT-Net's architecture
            demonstrates promising potential for future solutions, displaying commendable localization
            performance while results highlight strong memorization characteristics in the model.
            In conclusion, this thesis addresses the pressing need for effective image manipulation
            detection methods in the era of widespread access to image manipulation software and
            the rapid dissemination of controversial content. By evaluating the generalization
            ability of CAT-Net and MVSS-Net, the research contributes to the ongoing efforts to
            protect individuals and institutions from the adverse and unjust effects of disinformation.
            The findings emphasize the importance of advancing the capabilities of deep neural
            networks and developing more robust solutions to combat image manipulation in various
            real-world scenarios.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The exigence for this project lies in the current social-media-dominated moment that
            society finds itself within. This writing technology that's used in all sorts of applications,
            from sharing family photos to managing billion-dollar media empires, has completely
            transformed the way that humanity communicates. Moreover, this composing technology
            not only shapes us, but is shaped by us in equal measure. Due to this mutual effect
            that new media ecologies, this project asks how older ideas in our field may be revised
            and updated to be more congruent with the social media ecologies, and the theory that
            I chose for revision is the theory of the rhetorical situation, originated by Lloyd
            Bitzer in 1968. In revising this theory, my project asks the following questions:
            1. How might the rhetorical situation (RS) be revised to be congruent with social
            media communication? 2. What would a revised rhetorical situation (RRS) reveal about
            how people communicate on social media? 3. What would a revised rhetorical situation
            elide about how people communicate on social media? To test this theory, I applied
            the RRS to a political trolling account on Instagram. This account, username @TheseColorsDontCum
            (hereafter TCDC) is a satirical trolling account whose main goals are ostensibly to
            lampoon the beliefs of the American republican party, whilst posing as a member of
            that political party. I chose trolling as my test case because trolling's overall
            purpose is to halt cooperative discussion by any and every means necessary – no strategy
            too profane or taboo. As such, there's a high likelihood that trolling, by its very
            nature, may frustrate traditional models of the RS. Thus, choosing a "rulebreaker"
            genre like trolling could be doubly instructive, as researchers can learn doubly from
            what the RRS can reveal, and what it can't. Applying the RRS to the political trolling
            account on Instagram revealed two guiding communicative elements: the condition of
            play, and the strategic use of ambivalence in discourse. This play that the various
            trolls in TCDC's discourse community would engage in spanned a variety of manifestations,
            such as playing with their own authorial persona, playing with their language use,
            as well as playing with the play frame itself, freely moving in and out of the bounds
            of play at will. With respect to ambivalence, this ambivalence often caused the exigence
            of a given piece of discourse to be highly destabilized, causing me to record two
            different exigences: an exigence that a rhetor directly states, and an exigence that
            can be observed. This agreed-upon commitment to ambivalence that all the rhetors in
            TCDC employed also worked as an integral community-building tool, allowing community
            members to speak almost exclusively in intertextual pop-cultural references to one
            another, completely eschewing the rules of traditional speech. That the RRS was able
            to uncover such insights – play and ambivalence – suggests that these elements may
            also be at work on other social media sites and platforms as well. What the RRS was
            less successful at accounting for was the specific technological composing tools that
            Instagram had to offer. For example, because I had no way of archiving the various
            "stories" that TCDC posted on their account, seeing as they delete themselves 24-hours
            after posting , the RRS couldn't account for that material. Additionally, because
            Instagram is owned by Meta (formerly Facebook), it is organized by algorithms. However,
            because social media companies often do not allow individual users to have information
            about how (or why) algorithms circulate the content they do, the RRS could not account
            for this undeniable element of social media situations. The RRS likewise could not
            address the efficacy of hashtagging, and how well (or not) those hashtags succeeded
            in extending TCDC's reach to new audience members. However, these deficits that the
            RRS currently has need not be permanent; in this project's conclusion, I suggest that
            many of these current shortcomings can be picked up by researchers in the future.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Research examining incarceration in jails has grown in recent years. Much of this
            work has focused explicitly on pretrial detainees; that is, those housed within local
            jails who have yet to be convicted. This population makes up a growing share of the
            jail population, and currently stands at roughly two-thirds of all jail inmates nationwide.
            The reason that most pretrial detainees find themselves in custody rather than awaiting
            trial in the community is not because they have been determined to pose an unmanageable
            threat to public safety, but rather because they could not pay a cash bail amount
            set by a judge. Recognizing the role of cash bail in America's reliance on jail incarceration,
            past work has attempted to identify the factors underlying judge's bail decisions,
            or to examine the negative consequences associated with our system of cash bail. However,
            this work suffers from three key limitations. First, past work on racial and ethnic
            disparities in pretrial detention has focused narrowly on judges' discretion and the
            factors underlying judicial decision-making. Second, prior research has considered
            the effects of cash bail and pretrial detention beyond the pretrial stage, including
            convictions and post-adjudication recidivism; however, this work has not considered
            the extent to which pretrial considerations shape cumulative disadvantage across the
            criminal justice system. Third, research on the consequences of bail and pretrial
            detention has focused primarily on individual-level criminal justice outcomes, largely
            neglecting the broader impacts of the cash bail system. Using data from Palm Beach
            County, Florida and the American Community Survey, and focusing on theoretical perspectives
            from the sentencing and communities and crime traditions, this dissertation aims to
            address these limitations through three empirical chapters. The first empirical chapter
            examines the role of bail schedules (i.e., policy documents that provide bail amount
            recommendations for different charges) in pretrial release, including whether bail
            schedules contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in release outcomes. Additionally,
            this chapter examines judges' adherence to the bail schedule during the initial court
            hearing, including whether judges similarly rely on schedule recommendations across
            racial and ethnic groups. The second empirical chapter extends this by examining whether
            the bail schedule contributes to adverse outcomes across multiple stages of the criminal
            case process (i.e., pretrial, conviction, sentencing) and whether the cumulative impact
            of these negative outcomes is greater for Black and Latino people relative to Whites.
            The final empirical chapter examines the distribution of cash bail across census tracts
            in Palm Beach County, Florida and identifies the community-level characteristics associated
            with high levels of cash bail. Evidence regarding the impact of bail schedules on
            racial and ethnic disparities in pretrial release was somewhat mixed. Contrary to
            expectations, Black and Latino felony defendants were more likely to be released via
            the bail schedule than their White counterparts. As expected, however, Latino people
            booked on a misdemeanor were less likely to be released than Whites. I attempt to
            explain these patterns, but also note that releases via the schedule comprise fewer
            than one in three cases. In contrast, most individuals booked into the Palm Beach
            County Jail appear before a judge for a bail hearing. The findings revealed that judges
            relied on the bail amount recommended by the schedule in roughly half of these hearings.
            Although departures were more frequently in the direction of issuing lower bail amounts,
            judges departed upward from the recommendation in more than one in five cases. Furthermore,
            while downward departures were issued similarly across racial and ethnic groups, judges
            were more likely to issue upward departures for Black and Latino people relative to
            Whites. These findings suggest that the bail schedule contributes to racial disparities
            primarily through its impact on judicial decision-making. Findings from the second
            chapter additionally revealed that the bail schedule contributes to cumulative disadvantage
            across the criminal justice system's stages. Specifically, those who were detained
            via the bail schedule fared worse during later stages of the criminal case process,
            including adjudication and sentencing. Furthermore, among felony defendants, these
            cumulative impacts were disproportionately experienced by members of racial and ethnic
            minority groups. Taken together, these findings suggest that local pretrial policies
            and practices play an important role in shaping pretrial decision-making, and that
            these pretrial decisions have cascading effects on later criminal justice system stages.
            Findings from the third chapter underscore that despite the important immediate and
            later consequences associated with local pretrial policies and practices, the effects
            of pretrial decisions--and the decision to issue money bail in particular—extend beyond
            the individual. Indeed, similar to other markers of criminal justice involvement,
            including arrest and incarceration, cash bail appears to be spatially concentrated
            in several areas within Palm Beach County, including census tracts that are characterized
            by high levels of concentrated disadvantage, high percentages of Black residents,
            and high levels of criminal justice activity.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>A quasigeodesic is a curve which approximates length up to a multiplicative and/or
            anadditive constant. In this thesis, we are interested in Anosov flows on three manifolds
            whose flowlines are quasigeodesic when lifted in the universal cover. Quasigeodesic
            behavior of flowlines make a bridge between the dynamics of the flow and the large
            scale geometry of the underlying manifold. For this reason, quasigeodesic behaviors
            of flowlines of Anosov flows are widely studied and proven to be very useful, especially
            in hyperbolic three manifolds. Though quasigeodesic Anosov flows are very useful,
            there is no known method to prove that a given flow is quasigeodesic. • In Theorem
            A, we prove that the Generalized Franks-Williams type Anosov flows are Quasigeodesic.
            Franks and Williams introduced a new surgery technique to con- struct non-transitive
            Anosov flows. Our result gives the first examples of quasigeodesic Anosov flows on
            three manifolds that are neither Seifert, nor solvable, nor hyperbolic. We also provide
            a new method to prove that an Anosov flow is quasigeodesic. • In the second Theorem
            B, we study leafwise quasigeodesic behavior of Anosov flows. We construct an one-dimensional
            foliations which are subfoliations of two dimensional foliations in three manifolds;
            this construction is motivated by the Franks-Williams type technique. The subfoliation
            is by quasigeodesics in each two dimensional leaf, but it is not funnel: not all quasigeodesics
            share a common ideal point in most leaves. This result answer a question negatively.
            In the course of the proof of Theorem B, we prove another Theorem C which says that
            if a subfoliation satisfies certain conditions then the leaves of the subfoliations
            are leafwise quasigeodesic.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This paper aimed to examine which factors influence psychologist-in-trainings to use

            study found that openness, social norms, and direct experience positively impact willingness.
            Furthermore, attitudes mediate social norms and direct experience. Psychologists-in-training
            who had direct experience indicated a greater willingness to use telepsychology. However,

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Approximately 10% of U.S. children are diagnosed with ADHD, and the majority of them
            retain clinical levels of ADHD symptoms as an adult. Among them, comorbidities are
            often observed, which can negatively impact a broad range of their everyday life including
            social, emotional, behavioral, and academic/work functioning. A first-line treatment
            option of medication is available but it may cause inadequate responses. It is meaningful
            to diversify psychosocial interventions for the heterogeneous ADHD population. Currently,
            CBT and mindfulness-based interventions are evidence-based interventions. However,
            most ADHD intervention studies do not address unique challenges of college students
            with ADHD. They play a role as an emerging adult as well as a student in formal educational
            settings. During the transition, college students with ADHD may experience more difficulties
            navigating their life without the same structures from their parents and schools.
            This study aims to answer this question: Can adding mindfulness components into CBT-only
            coaching substantially improve the clinical effectiveness in ADHD symptoms, psychological
            health, and academic achievement outcomes among college students diagnosed with ADHD?
            In a non-concurrent multiple baseline single case subject design, four participants
            completed 12 coaching sessions. The results are conflicting. First, adding mindfulness
            to CBT-only coaching did not significantly improve ADHD symptoms or academic achievement
            outcomes. However, in psychological health outcomes, it showed more effectiveness
            than CBT-only coaching but the levels of significance range from weak to strong. Based
            on the results and limitations, implications for both practitioners and future researchers
            follow. In the discussion section, clinical change mechanisms and intervention planning
            depending on students' characteristics are highlighted.</p>

            play a role, and interventions attempting to improve math attitudes may be important
            for increasing the number of STEM-aspiring students. To design effective interventions,
            it is important to understand how these variables might be related, and how these
            relations develop over time. This study used Latent Change Score Modeling (LCSM) with
            an accelerated cohort design to examine how three attitudinal variables – math self-concept,
            math interest, and math anxiety – codevelop in a sample of 2,954 students from a three-wave
            study covering fall of kindergarten to spring of third grade, and to investigate how
            patterns of co-development might differ by gender. Univariate models indicated that
            math interest and math anxiety decreased, while math self-concept increased over the
            time period. Levels of self-concept influenced subsequent change in interest, levels
            of interest influenced subsequent change in anxiety, and levels of anxiety influenced
            subsequent change in interest. Change in interest also influenced later change in
            anxiety. Patterns of co-development were broadly similar for girls and boys, with
            some key distinctions, most notably a lack of significant univariate change in interest
            for girls and a lack of significant coupling between anxiety and change in self-concept
            in boys. Findings suggest that interventions focusing on maintaining high levels of
            math interest and self-concept, and reducing math anxiety, may be particularly fruitful
            in terms of their effects on other variables, and that interventions specifically
            focused on increasing math self-concept may be especially beneficial for girls.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Two significant problems oppose recovery from addiction: difficulty sustaining recovery
            and vocational difficulties. Research suggests that employment problems are linked
            with addiction and that vocational improvements can be helpful in early recovery.
            Little is known about the vocational lives of people beyond early recovery. This study
            explored whether vocational concepts were present at different levels for people in
            different stages of recovery and whether these variables predicted long-term recovery.
            An online survey was given to 173 people in recovery survey about their length of
            abstinence, career adaptability (CA), vocational identity (VI), satisfaction with
            life (SWL), and demographic information. A MANCOVA revealed that SWL was greater for
            people in the third stage of recovery compared to those in the first but that there
            were no differences for VI or CA. The same analysis using greatest length of abstinence
            instead of current revealed similar findings, but added: VI was greater for people
            in the third stage of recovery than those in the second. Multiple Regression demonstrated
            that only age and income predicted length of abstinence, income was the only positive
            predictor of SWL, and CA negatively predicted SWL. The same pattern held in improved
            models, but VI also emerged as a positive predictor of SWL. The primary variables
            of interest were not as influential as hypothesized. However, the importance of income
            in predicting length of abstinence and SWL could represent improvements in career
            and vocational lives. Those in early recovery might be encouraged that SWL was greater
            in later stages of recovery. Finally, VI predicted satisfaction in life but was also
            more prevalent in those who have experienced relapse after a significant length of
            abstinence. Future directions for both research and clinical practice are discussed.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The quality of teachers is crucial for students' learning and human development, particularly
            in modern multicultural classrooms and rapidly evolving environments. A key focus
            of teacher preparation is to transform classroom discourse and promote problem-solving
            skills and critical thinking. In order to foster critical thinking and facilitate
            rigorous understanding among students, teachers need to acquire ambitious teaching
            practices that elicit students' existing knowledge, facilitate discussions, and promote
            synergistic negotiation. Practice-rooted simulation-based teacher learning programs
            that provide ample practice opportunities and real-time feedback are essential for
            systematic knowledge and skills development for teachers before they engage in classroom
            practicum with human students. Unfortunately, there is a lack of such programs. One
            way to address this gap is through the use of virtual reality simulation with artificial
            intelligence (AI)-powered virtual agents. It is also important to provide guidance
            and support within this type of teacher learning environment. To this end, the purpose
            of this study was to examine the effects of model-based support (the widgets that
            are integrated into virtual reality simulation for teacher learning that contain prompts,
            hints, modeling, and reflection in the pretraining, in-simulation, and post-simulation
            phases) on teaching knowledge and skills development and teaching self-efficacy in
            simulation-based teacher learning with AI-powered virtual agents. I employed an experimental
            design in this study to investigate the effects of model-based support in simulation-based
            learning with AI-powered virtual students on the teaching knowledge and skills as
            well as teaching self-efficacy of preservice teachers. I recruited 57 preservice teachers
            to participate in this study. The participating preservice teachers were randomly
            assigned to either the model-based support with AI-powered virtual agents group (i.e.,
            model-based support group), AI-powered virtual agents without model-based support
            group (i.e., AI-powered virtual agent only group), and the no-treatment control group.
            I used pre- and post- teaching knowledge and skills tests and pre- and post-teaching
            self-efficacy scales to collect the data. ANCOVA results demonstrated that participants
            in both model-based support group and AI-powered virtual agents only group outperformed
            those in the no-treatment control group on the teaching knowledge and skills test.
            Bonferroni post hoc comparisons revealed no significant difference between model-based
            support group and AI-powered virtual agents only group. In terms of teaching self-efficacy,
            no significant differences were found between the experimental groups (i.e., model-based
            support group and AI-powered virtual agent only group) and the control group. Further,
            with regression analyses, I found significant predicting effects of the total duration
            of model-based support use (the sum of the duration of pretraining support, in-situ
            support, and post-simulation support use) on teaching knowledge and skills. Specifically,
            the significant effects were observed for the pretraining stage and the post-simulation
            stage, but not for the in-situ stage. The significant predicting effects were not
            found for teaching self-efficacy. The implications of the study findings suggest that
            the design of supports in simulation-based learning for preservice teachers should
            incorporate preparations for ambitious teaching practices as well as human-AI interactions.
            It is also beneficial for the preservice teachers to engage in post-simulation reflections.
            Future research should continue to explore the different designs of learning support
            in simulation-based learning with AI-powered virtual agents for preservice teachers,
            particularly the ones that improve intrinsic integration of the learning support in
            virtual reality simulation-based learning.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This phenomenological study addressed the question, "What is the lived experience
            of Black female collegiate choral directors in North America?" Participants were eight
            Black women who currently held collegiate choral conducting positions. I sought maximum
            variation by selecting participants representing diverse academic (i.e., programs
            of study, institution types, faculty ranks) and life (i.e., motherhood status, region)
            circumstances. Participants engaged in two interviews and one journal activity. I
            sought trustworthiness through triangulation, member checking of transcripts, and
            peer review of coding. Colaizzi's seven-step phenomenological approach to inquiry
            steered the steps in the thematic analysis. Participants exhibited a mindfulness of
            internal (self) and external (others) reactions to race and gender, creating chronic
            discomfort and resilience through necessitation. The participants expressed chronic
            discomfort through statements referring to weaponized biases, isolation (socially
            and professionally), and extra labor (voluntary and involuntary) and resilience through
            necessitation emerged as the participants discussed the lack of representation, their
            rapport with students and peers, and tasks associated with racial uplift. The findings
            of this study could provide collegiate music administrators and admissions personnel
            an in-depth understanding of the complexity of issues faced by Black females in collegiate
            choral music as both students and professors.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Among college students in the United States nationally, non-suicidal self-injurious
            (NSSI) behaviors have become alarmingly and increasingly common. Among those willing
            to disclose, recent estimates indicate 25-30% engaged in NSSI in 2020 alone. Prevalence
            is significantly elevated among students who identify as a sexual minority (i.e.,
            lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer/questioning, etc. [LGBQ+]), with estimates indicating
            an average of 40% of these students reporting NSSI. However, escalation in severity
            and prevalence over the last decade has been accompanied by stagnant, low rates of
            help-seeking among these students, who appear to only be willing to disclose and pursue
            formal treatment upon experiencing severe distress and suicidality. A review of the
            existing literature revealed internalized stigma as a key variable that appears to
            explain both the escalation in self-harm engagement and lack of willingness to seek
            support. Several gaps in the literature were also identified, including: (1) lack
            of an expansive, inclusive definition of self-harm, (2) lack of inclusion of self-harm
            and sexual orientation as variables of interest in nationally-representative research
            investigating college student help-seeking attitudes and behavior, and (3) lack of
            investigation into the influence of different types of internalized stigma on the
            relationship between self-harm and help-seeking, including stigma directly related
            to self-harm behavior and stigma related to sexual orientation. This study employed
            a correlational analysis approach to understanding relationships between the study's
            key variables, including psychological distress, severity of self-harm engagement,
            willingness to seek psychological help, and three distinct types of internalized stigma:
            internalized stigma of mental illness (ISMI), internalized stigma of self-harm (ISSH),
            and internalized heterosexism (IH). The three variables of internalized stigma and
            severity of self-harm engagement were also investigated for their ability to predict
            willingness to seek psychological help. A sample of college students (n = 302), recruited
            via the online crowdsourcing platform Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk), completed
            a brief self-report survey of their experience. Measures included the Kessler 10-item
            Psychological Distress Scale (K-10), the Non-Suicidal Self-Injury Assessment Tool
            (NSSI-AT), the Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness Inventory—10 (ISMI-10), the Self-Injury
            Social Reactions Questionnaire (SI-SRQ), the Sexual Identity Distress Scale (SIDS),
            and the Attitudes Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help Scale—Short Form
            (ATSPPH-SF). Results of correlational and regression analyses indicated that internalized
            stigma and severity of self-harm engagement were significantly associated with willingness
            to seek psychological help among this sample. In the overall sample, which included
            students with and without self-harm engagement, ISMI was the most significant predictor
            of willingness to seek help, regardless of sexual orientation. However, among students
            who did engage in self-harm, at any level of severity, the severity of their self-harm
            was the predominant predictor of their willingness to seek formal psychological help,
            over and above the effects of internalized stigma. Results also supported significant
            relationships between ISMI, ISSH, and IH among the target sample of participants who
            identify with all three of these minority identities: mental illness, self-harm engagement,
            and LGBQ+ identity. Among LGBQ+ students, self-harm severity was additionally related
            to IH, such that those with greater IH reported more severe self-harm. Surprisingly,
            when measured dichotomously between heterosexual and LGBQ+ students, no significant
            differences in severity, internalized stigma, or help-seeking willingness were found
            between students based on sexual orientation. Additionally, psychological distress
            was found to be unrelated to any other variable of interest. These findings support
            the existing literature that self-harm is prevalent and severe among college students,
            and add to the literature by demonstrating that internalized stigma and increasing
            severity of self-harm explain students' reluctance to seek the help of formal psychological
            services. As such, it is imperative that clinicians and other professionals who serve
            these students are prepared to competently, and compassionately, evaluate and treat
            severe self-harm engagement, in order to reduce the likelihood of amplifying the effects
            of internalized stigma that prevent students from seeking help initially. Among other
            recommendations, results implicate future research to: (1) define self-harm utilizing
            a comprehensive, evaluative approach that does not require participants to self-identify
            and label their behavior, (2) further investigate internalized stigma as a barrier
            to help-seeking utilizing a multi-faceted definition that separately measures stigma

            and LGBQ+ identity, (3) further analyze internalized stigma as a co-variate in courses

            designed to reduce internalized stigma (toward mental illness, self-harm engagement,
            and LGBQ+ identity) for their ability to potentially reduce self-harm severity, increase
            willingness to seek formal psychological help, and increase service utilization.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The Jackson's Gap Group is a thin section (~3 km wide) of sheared, compositionally
            interlayered metamorphic rocks spanning from west Georgia to central Alabama, representing
            the southernmost extent of the Brevard Zone. The lithostratigraphic units within the
            Jackson's Gap Group are predominately muscovite and garnetiferous schists ranging
            from graphitic to non-graphitic, which are interlayed with clean and micaceous quartzites
            and minor metaigneous units. Within the western limb of the Tallassee synform, the
            Jackson's Gap Group is separated from the underlying Emuckfaw Group by the Abanda
            fault and the overlying Dadeville complex by the Katy Creek Fault. The Kowaliga Gneiss
            is an Ordovician plutonic body that intruded the stratigraphic boundary between the
            Emuckfaw Group and the Jackson's Gap Group, resulting in augen gneiss sills intruding
            and paralleling the oldest portion of the Jackson's Gap stratigraphy. This intrusional
            boundary suggests the protoliths of the Jackson's Gap Group were deposited within
            closer proximity to the Wedowee-Emuckfaw-Dahlonega back-arc basin than previously
            thought. Additionally, the metaigneous units within the Jackson's Gap Group further
            its association with the Ordovician back-arc system related to the current B-type
            supra-subduction model of the Taconic Orogeny responsible for formation the southern
            Appalachians. Within the study area, a cataclastic zone associated with the Abanda
            fault, around 10 meters thick, contains a wide range of cataclastic rocks that indicate
            multiple stages of reactivation and cataclasis. Both identified Abanda cataclastic
            splays do not offset any surrounding Ordovician-Silurian units within the Emuckfaw
            and Jackson's Gap Groups. Based on these cataclastic rocks and a proposed Abanda fault
            outcrop, the nature of the Abanda fault differs from previous conclusions and tips
            out around the town of Jackson's Gap, Alabama.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Cultural capital is a key term from the Social Reproduction Theory, and it is defined
            as the codes and practices that parents pass on to their children (Bourdieu, 1984).
            Previous empirical studies have confirmed the importance of cultural capital, and
            it is positively related to students' reading achievement (e.g., Košutić, 2017; Noble
            &amp; Davis, 2009). However, few previous studies considered cultural capital from a person-centered
            perspective, not to mention considering it as longitudinal nor measuring its growth
            during students' elementary years. It is also less known how socioeconomic status
            (SES) relates to cultural capital and how these two factors influence students' reading
            achievement together. The goal of the current study was to answer the following research
            questions: for each cultural capital indicator (i.e., parental expectations, the number
            of books owned by the child at home, and library vising frequency), how many latent
            trajectory classes are there? What are the patterns of these trajectory classes? How
            does SES predict the membership of the trajectory class of cultural capital indicators?
            Last but not least, how does the membership of latent trajectory classes for each
            cultural capital indicator predict children's reading achievement in fifth grade?
            The current study used a United States national public use dataset, the Early Childhood
            Longitudinal Study Program, Kindergarten Class of 2010-11. The target population was
            elementary school students and their parents. The sample size for the current study
            was 18,174. After applying appropriate weights, the sample could represent the whole
            United States students enrolled in kindergarten in 2010. Cultural capital was measured
            by three items from the parent interview survey: parental expectation of their children's
            educational attainment, frequency of library or bookstore visit, and the number of
            books at home. Kindergarten year SES is a continuous composite variable based on household
            income, both parents' education level, and occupation. I conducted preliminary analyses
            for descriptive and correlational results. I used growth mixture modeling to answer
            research questions related to culture capital indicators' latent trajectory classes.
            The current study uncovered diverse patterns of cultural capital indicators. Specifically,
            I identified five latent trajectory classes for parental expectations, and two latent
            trajectory classes for the number of books owned by the child. However, I identified
            no unobserved subgroups for visiting a library/bookstore during the previous month,
            which suggested homogeneity within the population. The results also suggested that
            there was no growth of possibility of parents taking the child to visit a library/bookstore
            from first grade to fifth grade. SES significantly predicted latent class membership
            for parental expectations, as well as membership for the number of books at home.
            In addition, SES positively predicted the intercept of the latent growth model of
            library/bookstore visiting. The current study also indicated that the membership of
            parental expectations latent trajectory classes could predict students' fifth grade
            reading achievement, as well as the latent trajectory class membership of the number
            of books. The intercept of the indicator of library/bookstore visiting during elementary
            years positively correlated with students' fifth grade reading achievement.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Online course quality is a prominent issue due to the increasing number of online
            programs and courses offered by institutions of higher education. To ensure the best
            student outcomes, it is necessary to implement effective systemic support for quality
            assurance in online learning. Providing faculty with the environmental supports required
            to design their courses using quality standards may ensure better outcomes for students.
            Similarly, if best practices are not well-supported, not only will student outcomes
            suffer, but so will the reputation of online learning. As complex ecosystems with
            limited resources, colleges that are developing online programs and courses should
            know what environmental factors are effective for improving faculty adoption of quality
            standards. Quality MattersTM (QM) is a quality assurance process for online learning
            comprising a rubric, training, and peer review. Research by QM established the effectiveness
            of the QM standards when implemented in online courses. Other research suggested that
            there may be a gap in implementation after training. Although faculty training to
            design courses around quality standards is intended to ensure the best outcomes for
            students, faculty often do not demonstrate the adoption of those standards. While
            QM focuses on three areas of quality improvement to improve the knowledge and skills
            of faculty, Gilbert's (2007) Behavior Engineering Model predicts that other factors
            have an influence on actual performance. As institutions of higher education invest
            in faculty professional development to improve course quality, additional institutional
            resources may also be required to support faculty to implement what they have learned.
            This study explored effective strategies for supporting quality assurance practices
            that encourage the adoption of QM criteria into online courses at state colleges in
            Florida. Three research questions guided this study: 1. What environmental supports
            are colleges in the Florida Quality Matters Consortium (FLQMC) providing to APPQMR-trained
            faculty to facilitate the adoption of QM criteria in their online courses? 2. What
            are the perceptions of faculty who have received APPQMR training about how effectively
            their QM program supports adoption of QM criteria? 3. What are the perceptions of
            college QMC about how effectively their program supports adoption of QM criteria by
            faculty who have received APPQMR training? A sequential, mixed-method multi-case research
            design was used to collect descriptive statistics and qualitative data to gather information
            about what environmental supports Florida College System colleges provide to faculty
            to facilitate the adoption of QM criteria in their online courses. To develop a more
            complete understanding of the primary research question, an explanatory two-part mixed-methods
            study collected both qualitative and quantitative data to describe college supports
            and explore the perceptions of QM coordinators and online teaching faculty. The study
            included: (1) document analysis and (2) structured interviews with selected participants
            via Zoom. This study utilized the BEM (Gilbert, 2007) to identify environmental supports
            and established the use of the BEM to study environmental support in implementations
            of online course quality initiatives. Further, the Cause Analysis Worksheet (Chevalier,
            2008) was utilized to operationalize the three categories of environmental supports
            as they relate to QM implementation. The categories of environmental support of the
            BEM were identified through document analysis and interviews with faculty and QMC
            at six colleges of varying sizes and length of membership in the Florida Quality Matters
            Consortium. Additionally, the study explored the perceptions of both faculty and QMC
            about how effectively their QM program supports adoption of QM criteria. Effective
            strategies for supporting quality assurance practices that encourage the adoption
            of QM criteria into online courses at state colleges in Florida were identified in
            all three categories: information, resources, and incentives. Findings suggest colleges
            implementing their own programs should provide faculty time to implement QM standards
            in their online courses and assistance with design and development. To efficiently
            allocate resources that effect change, colleges that are developing quality assurance
            programs for online learning can focus on these effective systemic supports to bridge
            the gap from training to adoption.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Global sensitivity analysis studies how uncertainty in a model's output can be attributed
            to uncertainties in the model's inputs. This analysis has applications in various
            fields such as natural sciences, engineering, social sciences, and mathematical sciences.
            Several global sensitivity analysis methods have been introduced in literature, such
            as Sobol' sensitivity indices, activity scores, derivative-based global sensitivity
            measures (DGSM), and Shapley values. The dissertation introduces two new control variate
            Monte Carlo estimators based on the truncated sparse polynomial chaos expansion of
            the function in hand. The control variate estimators are used to estimate the lower
            and upper Sobol' indices in some applications, and are numerically compared with some
            of the best Monte Carlo estimators in the literature. The results suggest that the
            control variate estimators are either the best or among the best in terms of efficiency
            in computationally expensive problems where a low-order polynomial chaos expansion
            is not an accurate approximation of the model but highly correlated with it. We also
            introduce two new approaches to Shapley values, that are based on the first-order
            partial derivatives and the finite-differences of the underlying function. The derivative
            based Shapley value has linear computational complexity in the number of features,
            as opposed to the exponential complexity of other Shapley value approaches. The finite-difference
            based method is especially useful when there are high-order interactions or in the
            presence of noise. The methods are used for global sensitivity analysis and machine
            learning explainability, and numerical comparisons with activity scores, global activity
            scores, SHAP, and KernelSHAP are provided.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Muscle atrophy decreases physical function and overall health. Increased glucocorticoid
            production and/or use of prescription glucocorticoids can result in a myopathy that
            presents with significant muscle atrophy and weakness. Glucocorticoids cause atrophy
            by activating the glucocorticoid receptor, thereby transcribing genes that shift protein
            balance in favor of net protein degradation. While mechanical overload can blunt glucocorticoid-induced
            atrophy in young muscle, it is unknown whether mechanical overload influences glucocorticoid
            receptor nuclear translocation, a critical step in the receptor activation process.
            Moreover, it is unknown whether muscle contractile force alters regulation of glucocorticoid
            receptor because those susceptible to glucocorticoid myopathy are generally at risk
            of having reduced muscle force generation capacity. Therefore, Specific Aim 1 sought
            to determine whether contractile force differentially regulates glucocorticoid receptor
            activation within the skeletal muscle. Male mice were subjected to a single bout of
            unilateral, electrically induced muscle contractions by stimulating the sciatic nerve
            at 100 Hz or 50 Hz frequencies to elicit high force or moderate force contractions
            of the tibialis anterior (TA), respectively. Dexamethasone (DEX) was administered
            via intraperitoneal (IP) injection at 1mg/kg to activate the glucocorticoid receptor
            acutely. Treatment with DEX increased glucocorticoid nuclear translocation and expression
            of putative target genes, but those outcomes were mitigated by high force, but not
            moderate force, contractions. The ability of high force contractions to mitigate glucocorticoid
            receptor translocation coincided with a sustained ability for muscle contractions
            to increase rates of muscle protein synthesis, which is an outcome that can ultimately
            reduce the negative shift in protein balance induced by glucocorticoids. Interestingly,
            moderate force contractions did not increase rates of muscle protein synthesis only
            in the DEX treated mice. Thus, these data show that force generation is important
            for the ability of resistance exercise to mitigate glucocorticoid receptor translocation
            and ultimately activate the processes that will reduce the loss of muscle mass in
            those with elevated glucocorticoids. While these data and the classic data demonstrate
            the potential for mechanical overload to mitigate glucocorticoid myopathy by reducing
            glucocorticoid receptor activation and increasing rates of muscle protein synthesis
            if the mechanical overload and glucocorticoid treatment are started at the same time,
            it is unknown whether mechanical overload can increase muscle protein synthesis when
            the glucocorticoid myopathy is already present. Determining whether mechanical overload
            can increase rates of muscle protein synthesis in glucocorticoid myopathic muscle
            is important because long-term glucocorticoid exposure can increase the expression
            of genes that may prevent activation of pathways like the mechanistic target of rapamycin
            in complex 1 (mTORC1) that contribute to the increase in rates of muscle protein synthesis.
            Therefore, Specific Aim 2 sought to determine the extent to which mechanical overload
            increases muscle protein synthesis during the initiation of glucocorticoid myopathy
            and after the myopathy has more fully developed. Early myopathy was induced in physically
            mature female mice via daily IP injections of saline as control or 1mg/kg DEX. After
            1 week of treatment, the left TA muscle of all mice was subjected to a bout of muscle
            contractions as stated in Aim 1. In a subsequent experiment, physically mature female
            mice received regular drinking water as control or DEX in their drinking water for
            2 weeks to fully induce myopathy. After 2 weeks of treatment, mice were subjected
            to unilateral muscle contractions. In both experiments, signaling through mTORC1 and
            rates of muscle protein synthesis were assessed. Despite initiation of myopathy following
            1 week of DEX treatment, mechanical overload increased protein synthesis and mTORC1
            signaling equally compared to control mice. After 2 weeks, mechanical overload activated
            mTORC1 signaling equally in both DEX and control mice, but protein synthesis was only
            increased by mechanical overload in control mice, suggesting that the stage of glucocorticoid
            myopathy alters the anabolic response to mechanical overload. Altogether, our data
            demonstrate that contractile force and duration of glucocorticoid treatment regulates
            the ability of mechanical overload to alter the signals that would be needed to minimize
            the atrophy induced by glucocorticoids.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>In this dissertation, we develop two novel schemes for solving fully nonlinear PDEs
            that are based on the theoretical treatments of \textit{second order backward stochastic
            differential equations} (2BSDEs), established in \cite{STZ12}. The first scheme is
            a multi-step algorithm which iteratively approximates the optimal quadratic variation
            using an approximation of the value function and its first and second derivatives.
            The second scheme, which is based on the maximum principle for 2BSDEs, approximates
            the solution in an iterative process that combines all time steps into one iteration.
            Our theoretical results demonstrate the convergence of the schemes for a broad class
            of problems. Numerical results on an example of fully nonlinear PDEs, the well-known
            Merton investment-consumption control problem with stochastic volatility Scott's model,
            will be presented to demonstrate the accuracy and advantages of both of our proposed
            schemes. Unlike many of the deep schemes in the literature, where only point estimates
            are provided, the schemes developed in this thesis provides an accurate field estimate
            of the value function.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Deep convective clouds exert an important impact on the chemical composition of the
            upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) since they can rapidly transport aerosols
            and chemical species from the planetary boundary layer (PBL) to the UTLS. The impacts
            on air quality and atmospheric chemistry vary depending on the extent of the transport.
            This transport can change the composition of trace gases and thereby affect weather
            and climate. This thesis examines two observed cases of deep convection, an Oklahoma
            supercell on 29 May 2012, and a mesoscale convective system (MCS) on 11 June 2012,
            both during the Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry (DC3) campaign. The first objective
            is to document the rate of simulated trace gas transport from the PBL to the UTLS.
            We utilize the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem)
            to simulate the deep convection. To reduce errors in the timing, location, and depth
            of the simulated deep convective clouds, a new type of lightning data assimilation
            (LDA) is employed (Heath et al., 2016). We also perform a WRF-Chem simulation without
            LDA. Thus, the second objective is to determine the utility of the LDA scheme. The
            WRF-Chem runs utilize a nested grid with horizontal grid spacings of 36 and 12 km,
            and 70 vertical levels extending to 50 hPa. STAGE-IV and IMERG Final Run precipitation
            observations are used to compare simulated rainfall with and without LDA in terms
            of their timing, location, and intensity. GOES-13 brightness temperature data are
            used to calculate observed cloud top heights that are compared with simulated cloud
            tops with and without LDA. Besides the traditional statistical (grid-to-grid) techniques,
            object-based verification is used to evaluate the simulated precipitation and clouds.
            Results show that the LDA technique improves the timing, development, and especially
            the location of the deep convective clouds. Results also reveal that the LDA method
            increases the correlation between amounts of simulated CO that are transported from
            the PBL to the UTLS via deep convection for both cases compared to aircraft observations.
            Computed mass fluxes reveal that flux densities of the supercell exhibit 13.37% greater
            CO flux densities and 42.94% greater water vapor flux densities in the surface layer,
            meaning that the supercell transports more CO and H2O from the surface to higher altitudes
            per unit area in the supercell region than the MCS case. The MCS case demonstrates
            a weaker transition from the troposphere to the stratosphere in terms of mass fluxes
            compared to the supercell case.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>In this dissertation, I discuss the ways in which a musical cue in a video game expresses
            a given gameplay context, or ludic function, within a game's overall design. My study
            focuses primarily on the soundtracks of games published circa 1980–1995, beginning
            at the point when music became a common feature of video games and ending with the
            rise of CD-ROM-based game machines, when the technological possibilities of streaming
            audio contributed to a fragmentation of musical style across the industry. I address
            the musical conventions of several common ludic functions in early video game music,
            describing the ways in which these conventions differ depending on a game's genre
            and setting. After a review of relevant literature in Chapter 1, I examine video game
            music derived from preexisting sources (e.g., films, television, and classic cartoons)
            in Chapter 2, describing the ways in which these compositions established many of
            the semiotic codes of early video game music. I begin by discussing arcade games from
            the latter half of the 1970s, which relied almost entirely on preexisting compositions
            to accompany the on-screen action. Then, I briefly address two game genres popular
            in early arcades—the maze game and the shoot 'em up—and the ways in which preexisting
            compositions from film and classic cartoons set stylistic precedents for particular
            ludic functions in original soundtracks later in the decade. In Chapter 3, I discuss
            the musical properties of the most common ludic functions found in action games of
            the 1980s and early 1990s. My discussion is divided into three sections based on when
            each ludic function occurs relative to the overall structure of a game: before gameplay
            begins (title screen cues, menu music, and cues immediately preceding gameplay), during
            the main part of the game (level background music, power-up cues, and music for boss
            battles), and after a segment of gameplay (victory music, death and game over cues,
            and music for ending and credits sequences). I consider the ways in which form, harmony,
            melodic contour, and other features are commonly connected with particular ludic functions.
            In Chapter 4, I focus on a single ludic function—level background music—and its varied
            musical realizations within a single game genre: the platformer. After an overview
            of the early history of the genre, I describe the musical conventions used to differentiate
            among several common location types in platformers: overworlds, underworlds, underwater
            and sky areas, islands, deserts, and icy/snowy areas. I then discuss common musical
            strategies for communicating a level's position within the overall game structure:
            heroic signifiers for opening levels, static and repetitive music for mid-game areas,
            and several harmonic schemata used to convey gravitas in the game's final stages.
            In Chapter 5, I discuss ludic function in Japanese role-playing games (JRPGs), a subgenre
            of role-playing game which descended from Western-developed titles but quickly developed
            its own unique set of musical conventions. I begin by summarizing the early history
            of role-playing games, both in the West and in Japan, and the musical conventions
            established by Koichi Sugiyama in the foundational 1986 JRPG Dragon Quest. Then, I
            discuss the ways in which different cue types convey the relative safety or danger
            in several environments and contexts—towns, castles, fields, dungeons, and battles—as
            well as the features of JRPG victory and game over music, which differ from their
            counterparts in action games. I conclude by describing instances in which these musical
            expectations are subverted to convey narrative information to the player.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The purpose of this dissertation is to provide a conductor's analysis of a specific
            set of repertoire by Paul J. Christiansen. The selected works were limited to Paul
            J.'s arrangements of pre-existing musical material. In-depth analysis was limited
            to works in print and available for purchase still today. The author seeks to facilitate
            informed performance of these works and provide a general resource for conductors
            who have an interest in performing the music of Paul J. Christiansen.The study includes
            a short biography of Paul J.'s life and career, providing a brief historical context
            for this man's work. It also includes a short history of the development of the Concordia
            College choral department, namely the Concordia Choir and Concordia Christmas concert,
            for which Paul J. was synonymous for nearly five decades. An annotated catalog of
            Paul J.'s many choral arrangements is provided. Brief information about the key, meter,
            tempo, origin, performance length, date of publication, publisher, and voicing is
            provided. The study concludes with an analysis of two subsets of arrangements of Paul
            J. Christiansen: Christmas carols and folk tunes. These subsets of arrangements include
            the vast majority of Paul J.'s works that continue to be frequently performed and

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Strongly correlated spin systems continue to draw significant interest due to the
            complex interplay between structural, charge, and spin degrees of freedom. This intricate
            relationship gives rise to a range of novel phenomena, such as topologically protected
            spin textures (like skyrmions), unconventional electronic band physics (e.g., flat
            bands), and other emergent states. In this dissertation, we present our results from
            investigations into three distinct compounds within the category of geometrically
            frustrated materials, specifically those of the LnTAl4Ge2 variety. We elucidate the
            process of design and synthesis for these compounds, followed by a thorough characterization
            of their physical properties, including magnetic, thermal, and electronic attributes.
            First, we outlined the design and synthesis of new materials, specifically LnTAl4Ge2
            single crystals, utilizing the molten metal flux crystal growth method. By modulating
            the molar ratio of the reactive elements and the heating/cooling profile, we successfully
            produced phase-pure crystals. We then elucidated the crystalline structures of the
            synthesized LnTAl4Ge2 single crystals using Powder X-ray Diffraction (PXRD) and Energy
            Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS), highlighting that the fabrication of large, phase-pure
            specimens poses significant challenges. We observed the presence of impurity phases
            such as AuAl2, LnAl2Ge2, and Ln2Al3Ge4 alongside with LnTAl4Ge2 phases. Furthermore,
            we found that compounds where the Ln = Ce, Sm, Gd, and Tb can be more easily obtained
            as phase-pure LnAuAl4Ge2 crystals; similarly, when Ln = Sm, Gd, Tb, Y, and Lu, the
            production of phase-pure LnNiAl4Ge2 crystals can be more easily achievable. Then,
            We focus on examples with novel magnetism and reported the comprehensive study of
            magnetic, thermal, and electrical properties in the antiferromagnetic phase of TbAuAl4Ge2.
            Following the discussion of TbAuAl4Ge2, GdAuAl4Ge2 compound is studied, together with
            the thermal results of YAuAl4Ge2. The temperature and magnetic field-dependent magnetization,
            heat capacity, and electrical resistivity measurements reveal that both Tb- and Gd-variant
            compounds exhibit several magnetically ordered states at low temperatures, with evidence
            for magnetic fluctuations extending into the paramagnetic temperature region. For
            magnetic fields applied in the ab-plane, there is particularly rich behavior, with
            several ordered state regions that are separated by metamagnetic phase transitions.
            Despite Gd being an isotropic S-state ion and Tb having an anisotropic J-state, there
            are similarities in the phase diagrams for the two compounds, suggesting that factors
            such as the symmetry of the crystalline lattice, which features well-separated triangular
            planes of lanthanide ions, or the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction control
            the magnetism. We also point out similarities to other centrosymmetric compounds that
            host skyrmion lattices, such as Gd2PdSi3, and propose that the LnAuAl4Ge2 family of
            compounds are of interest as reservoirs for complex magnetism and electronic behaviors.
            Next, we reported and bulk physical properties of SmAuAl4Ge2 single crystals, together
            with experimental results for LuAuAl4Ge2. Temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility
            measurements reveal van Vleck paramagnetism due to trivalent samarium ions, with complex
            antiferromagnetic ordering at TN1 = 13.2 K and TN2 = 7.4 K. Heat capacity measurements
            show that the transitions at TN1 and TN1 are first and second order, respectively,
            while also revealing that the Sommerfeld coefficient is not enhanced compared to the
            nonmagnetic analog YAuAl4Ge2. Together with electrical resistivity measurements, these
            results show that SmAuAl4Ge2 is a weakly correlated metal, where the combination of
            van Vleck paramagnetism with the triangular net arrangement of the samarium ions,
            leads to complex magnetic ordering at low temperatures, resembling what is seen in
            other LnAuAl4Ge2 (Ln = Gd and Tb) analogues. In addition, positive linear magnetoresistance
            appears within the ordered states over a wide field range, further establishing SmAuAl4Ge2
            and the broader family as hosts for novel magnetism and anomalous magnetotransport
            behaviors. Finally, we reported results for GdNiAl4Ge2, which crystallizes in a rhombohedral
            structure that features geometrically frustrated triangular nets of lanthanide ions.
            Magnetic, thermodynamic, and electrical transport measurements reveal metallic behavior
            with antiferromagnetic-like ordering in small magnetic fields, which strongly evolves
            to produce anomalous hysteresis for magnetic fields applied in the ab-plane. In particular,
            over a limited portion of the temperature-field phase space, the magnetic susceptibility
            of the field-cooled curves is smaller than that of the zero-field-cooled curves, and
            the ac magnetic response exhibits frequency and field-dependent peaks only in the
            zero- field-cooled curves. This suggests the formation of history-dependent spin structures
            or domains with complex spin relaxation dynamics, resembling what is seen on other
            materials with nontrivial spin textures. This establishes GdNiAl4Ge2 as a host for
            intriguing quantum spin states and further focuses attention on this family of materials.
            Taken together, the great sensitivity of these properties to changes in temperature
            and magnetic fields, as well as chemical tune, make the LnTAl4Ge2 family of materials
            as a reservoir for an environment to search for strongly correlated magnetism and
            connect them to broader classes of anomalous magnetic metals, including those with
            geometric frustration [83, 84, 85, 5, 86], topological protection [87, 88, 89, 90],
            unconventional Hall effects [91, 92], skyrmion states [71, 93, 7, 27, 94, 36], and
            possibly a metallic quantum spin liquid behavior [95]. This makes our work a great
            value in developing the present understanding of magnetism. In addition, our work
            has attracted solid researchers to further study these materials [81, 152]and will
            be of great value to the theorists for guiding the improvements in understanding magnetism.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The purpose of this study was to assess music therapists' knowledge of autism via
            a validated measure to explore their perspectives regarding how they practiced music
            therapy with autistic clients. The participants for this study were 336 MT-BC's practicing
            across the United States providing music therapy services to at least one autistic
            client. The dependent measure was a survey created by combining the ASKSP-R by McClain
            et al. (2020) with previous demographic, professional and clinical practice items
            selected from previous research by Kern, Rivera, Chandler, and Humpal (2013) and modified
            to today's terminology and practice standards. Results showed that, overall, music
            therapists had adequate knowledge of autism as measured by the ASKSP-R however there
            were gaps in knowledge found. Music therapists reported feeling confident providing
            music therapy services to autistic people. Regarding how music therapists informed
            their practice, they reported using several different resources, organizations, and
            training programs such as Autism Speaks, Autistic Self Advocacy Network, Autistic
            Women &amp; Nonbinary Network, Registered Behavioral Technician training, and applied
            behavior analysis and safety care training. The free text responses on the professional
            practice portion of the survey revealed strong feelings about the current controversy
            over appropriate services for autistic persons. Since the ASKSP-R and portions of
            the survey used person-first language and deficit based language, several music therapists
            expressed their concern and opinions through textual responses on the survey, through
            emails, and social media. While several music therapists showed support for a social
            model and the neurodiversity paradigm, others showed their support for the medical
            diagnosis model, therapies for autism such as ABA, and organizations such as Autism
            Speaks. This study concludes with my personal responses and recommendations as an
            autistic person to the study, diagnosis, and services provided to autistic persons.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Teachers play a large role in determining whether or not the classroom climate experienced
            by students is positive, especially through their visible emotional behaviors (i.e.,
            neutral, positive, and negative emotional expressions). Research suggests that teachers
            make specific contributions to the classroom emotional climate in actions such as
            building relationships with students, managing classroom behaviors, and displaying
            enthusiasm during instruction. The current study explored one specific contribution
            teachers make to the classroom emotional climate (i.e., teacher displayed affective
            demeanor) likely associated with maintaining student engagement. The purpose of this
            study was to capture the unique influences of teacher displayed affective demeanor
            as it relates to students' engagement. Secondary analysis using video recordings of
            84 first through third grade classrooms were used to explore teachers' displayed affective
            demeanor (n = 79) and students' off-task behavior (n = 539) during reading instruction.
            Limited research addresses the contribution of teacher displayed affective demeanor
            as students progress through elementary school and move to new classrooms. This study
            investigated these associations both concurrently and longer term (across three school
            years). Specifically, multilevel growth models were used to explore whether and how
            teachers' affective demeanor and students' off-task behavior were associated over
            time. Two main research aims were addressed: (1) How does teachers' displayed affective
            demeanor relate to students' off-task behavior cross-sectionally in first, second,
            and third grade? and (2) How does teachers' displayed affective demeanor relate to
            growth in student off-task behavior from first through third grade? Teachers' demeanor
            characteristics were associated with students' off-task behavior and distinct associations
            between students' off-task behavior and teachers' demeanor were present in first,
            second, and third grade. Additionally, an increase in teachers' positive demeanor
            was associated with less off-task behavior in the spring of third grade and a more
            rapidly declining rate of growth in off-task behavior over time. The results suggested
            that first grade teachers' positive demeanor contributed to changes in students' off-task
            behavior in the same school year as well as the following two school years that students
            experienced in different classrooms.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The affective salience network is composed of a variety of brain regions, including,
            but not limited to, the anterior insula, amygdala, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex.
            Based primarily on fMRI studies, previous research suggests that activity in the affective
            salience network is related to suicidal behavior. The affective salience network's
            specific role in suicidal behavior is not known, but one possibility is its core function
            in the orienting response to salient stimuli, including threat. This orienting response
            aids in survival and, if diminished to threatening stimuli, may underlie the affective
            salience network's relationship to suicidal behavior by contributing to a key construct
            in leading theories of suicide: capability for suicide, specifically its subconstruct
            called fearlessness about death. Existing treatments for suicidal behavior are sub-optimal,
            and thus interventions targeting the affective salience network may prove beneficial
            in treating suicidal behavior by decreasing capability for suicide. In a first step
            towards investigating such an approach, Chapter 1 reviews the literature on capability
            for suicide, the affective salience network, neural measures of affective salience,
            transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and how it can be used to stimulate subcortical
            areas. Chapter 2 discusses an attempt to use intermittent theta-burst stimulation
            (iTBS), a type of repetitive TMS, to alter affective salience network activity in
            healthy young adults by indirectly targeting a key region of this network: the amygdala.
            In line with previous research using a similar approach, a portion of the rostral
            medial frontal wall (RMW) that demonstrated high functional connectivity with the
            amygdala was stimulated to alter the affective salience network's orienting response
            to affective pictures. To examine this neural activity, an event-related potential
            called the late positive potential (LPP) was measured. Analyses did not reveal any
            significant difference in the LPP between stimulating the RMW and a control site (V1).
            However, if effect sizes were to hold in a larger sample, the data suggest that iTBS
            stimulation to V1 reduces the affective salience network's response to threatening
            images. Chapter 3 discusses future directions based on the results presented in Chapter
            2, and ends with remarks on the state of the suicide neuroscience field. Specifically,
            I discuss the assumptions in the present paradigm, and offer suggestions for how the
            field can improve. In summary, this work failed to find a significant effect of stimulation
            to the RMW to alter the LPP. Nevertheless, the data suggests the possibility that
            V1 stimulation reduces the salience network's response to threatening images. With
            further investigation, the relationship between V1 stimulation and salience network
            activity may inform the scientific community's understanding of the relationship between
            sensory information and salience.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The Latinx college population is at risk for developing anxiety symptoms due to stressors
            related to minority contexts. This study examined the role of familism among Latinx
            college students and how it relates to generational status and anxiety. The sample
            included 154 Latinx college students attending Florida State University (Mage = 20.4,
            SD = 1.692; 71.4% female; 74.9% U.S. born). Participants completed surveys via Qualtrics.
            A path analysis was utilized to examine the mediation from generational status to
            familism to anxiety outcomes. Results indicated no associations with anxiety. In this
            study, familism did not mediate the association between generational status and anxiety.
            The findings of this study highlight familism subscales and their relation to income
            and gender which imply that family obligation may be impacted by income and gender.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The topic of Orofacial Myofunctional Disorders (OMDs) and how they can challenge instrumental
            performance is an area of research that is not frequently discussed. My interest in
            this topic began during my pursuit to improve areas of playing such as tongue positioning
            and articulation. I felt that I was hitting roadblocks, many of which I struggled
            to overcome. I wondered what was different about me and why progress in these areas
            was so challenging. After some reflection, I began to consider whether the tongue
            thrust diagnosis I received in my teen years could still be manifesting in some way.
            This inspired my research on Orofacial Myofunctional Disorders, Tongue Thrust Disorder,
            and their relationship to clarinet performance. The research in this treatise aims
            to accomplish three goals. The first is to provide readers with a better understanding
            of OMDs and Tongue Thrust Disorder and their side effects. The second is to discuss
            the existing literature researching the relationships between clarinet performance
            and Tongue Thrust Disorder. Finally, it will explore some pedagogical methods and
            their effectiveness in cases of tongue thrust.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Atmospheric fronts are responsible for changes in temperature, precipitation, and
            wind direction, and are often associated with extremes related to the weather, such
            as cold snaps and flooding, that have significant socio-economic impacts. Winter cold
            fronts moving across the eastern United States are known to leave residents in states
            of extreme cold and dangerous weather. These temperatures can lead to an increase
            in electricity demand, which can result in increased carbon emissions. With several
            states working to reduce carbon emissions, a better understanding and predictability
            of fronts and their temperature change impacts would help power companies better budget
            for carbon emissions and guide capital investment in renewable technologies. In this
            research, we analyze how several leading modes of climate variability, such as the
            NAO, PNA and ENSO, influence temperature extremes related to the passing of atmospheric
            fronts. This manuscript investigates the average temperature anomalies associated
            with the passage cold and warm fronts for locations in North Carolina, New York, Florida,
            and off the coast of Florida. Several characteristic patterns defining the passage
            of fronts in each location have been discussed. With these anomalies characterized,
            they were compared to the average temperature anomalies associated with cold fronts
            during the positive and negative phases of the NAO, PNA, and ENSO. The modes were
            found to influence the characteristic anomalies surrounding cold fronts. Each mode
            impacted every location differently, but they could cause or suppress extreme temperatures
            as they related to the passage of cold fronts. A preliminary exploration of the relationship
            between electricity demand and the passage of cold fronts was also discussed. The
            influence of frontal strength on spikes in electricity demand was found to result
            in a higher probability for larger spikes in demand with stronger cold fronts and
            a lower probability for spikes with weaker fronts. The location in New York was selected
            to analyze how cold fronts during ENSO may change this relationship that was found
            between cold fronts and electricity demand spikes. This preliminary investigation
            proved that there is a relationship between electricity demand spikes and cold fronts
            and that the modes of variability can impact this relationship. This provides potential
            for more extensive work to be done in the future to fully quantify the scale relationship
            between fronts and electricity demand during specific phases of modes of variability.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Spanish composers María Rodrigo Bellido (1888-1967) and Emiliana Zubeldía e Inda (1888-1987)
            exhibit remarkable personal and professional parallels. Both were born the same year
            during the Bourbon Restoration in Spain, received world-class training abroad, and
            were accomplished concert pianists and published composers in an era when most Spanish
            women were illiterate. Still in their prime, they left Spain and lived the remainder
            of their lives in the Americas, having key roles in the establishment of collegiate
            music programs in Puerto Rico and Mexico, respectively. It is difficult to overestimate
            the quality of their work and significance of their achievements.Their music is endowed
            with rich individuality and reflects the synthesis of wider European musical trends,
            national and regional folk music, key mentors' and collaborators' influences, and
            their own unique compositional vision. Both were prolific vocal and instrumental composers,
            yet neither has received due recognition outside of Mexico and Spain. Very little
            of their work has been published, and the scores that do exist are often hard to locate
            and difficult to read. Additionally, the majority of the limited scholarly research
            published about their lives is written exclusively in Spanish, making it inaccessible
            to an English-speaking audience. This project represents an essential English-language
            biographical resource and a detailed analysis of twenty-five of Rodrigo and Zubeldía's
            art songs, with the object of providing greater awareness of and access to this body
            of work for students, teachers, and professional performers in classical voice. With
            over 41 million Spanish speakers in the United States and a growing demand for racial,
            cultural, and gender inclusivity, this treatise is an important addition to existing
            literature.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The relationships between perfectionism and depression have been widely studied among
            college students (Smith et al., 2020). Research has explained their relationships
            by suggesting different mediating variables in cognitive, social, and behavioral contexts,
            specifically based on the Perfectionism Social Disconnection model (PSDM; Hewitt et
            al., 2006) and the Existential Model of Perfectionism and Depressive Symptoms (EMPDS;
            Graham et al., 2010). However, research has not examined the simultaneous effects
            of cognitive, social, and behavioral variables on the relationships between perfectionism
            and depressive symptoms with consideration of multidimensionality of perfectionism.
            The multidimensionality of perfectionism can be explained with perfectionistic strivings,
            narcissistic perfectionism, and perfectionistic concerns. The lack of an integrated
            model of perfectionism and depressive symptoms have engendered some limitations in
            comprehending multidimensional perfectionism and depressive symptoms. The limitations
            include: 1) the unique/conjoint effects of each perfectionism factor were not fully
            examined and 2) the relative strengths of mediators or their relationships were unclear
            in the perfectionism-depressive symptoms model. The purpose of this study is to investigate
            the integrated model of perfectionism and depressive symptoms through a cognitive,
            social, and behavioral lens by focusing on the three variables representing each domain:
            perceived life discrepancy, lack of social belongingness, and self-concealment. A
            total of 346 college students aged from 18 to 34 were recruited from a southeastern
            university and were used for the current study. The sample was composed of 73.9% female
            (N = 255), 23.4% male (N = 81), and 2.0% others (N = 7). The sample included 65.3%
            (non-Hispanic) White (N = 226), 12.1% Hispanic (N = 42), 4.3% (non-Hispanic) Black
            (N = 15), 2.9% Asian (N = 10), 0.9% Middle Eastern (N = 3), and 13.6% Bi/multiracial
            (N = 47). The sample consisted of 79.5% of students identified as heterosexual (N
            = 275), while 15.9% identified as LGBQ (N = 55). The sample also contained 2.3% international
            students (N = 8) and 20.2% students (N = 70) who identified themselves as a first
            generation in college. The sample spread from freshman to graduate students (8.4%
            freshman; 23.4% sophomore, 28.9% junior, 28.9% senior +, and 10.4% graduate). A cross-sectional
            design was used to test the integrated model of perfectionism and depressive symptoms
            and estimate path coefficients and mediation effects in the model. This research focused
            on three research questions: 1) Do three factors of multidimensional perfectionism
            - perfectionistic strivings, perfectionistic concerns, and narcissistic perfectionism
            - significantly predict depressive symptoms? 2) Do perceived life discrepancy, lack
            of social belongingness, and self-concealment mediate the relationship between the
            three perfectionism factors and depressive symptoms, controlling for other perfectionism
            factors and GPA (integrated parallel mediation model)? and 3) Does self-concealment
            additionally mediate the relationship between perceived life discrepancy and depressive
            symptoms and between lack of social belongingness and depressive symptoms in the parallel
            mediation model in research question 2 (integrated serial mediation model)? GPA was
            considered as a covariate to control its consistent relationships with perfectionism
            and depressive symptoms among college students (Huang, 2015; Madigan, 2019; Sörberg
            Wallin et al., 2019). Research found that perfectionistic strivings, perfectionistic
            concerns, and narcissistic perfectionism impacted depressive symptoms separately (research
            question 1). However, only perfectionistic concerns predicted depressive symptoms
            when the other perfectionism factors and GPA were controlled for. After the integrated
            model was established, the model presented several significant parallel and serial
            mediation effects. Research found that perfectionistic concerns impacted depressive
            symptoms simultaneously through perceived life discrepancy, lack of social belongingness,
            and self-concealment in the parallel mediation model, in addition to its direct influence
            on depressive symptoms. Although perfectionistic strivings and narcissistic perfectionism
            did not impact depressive symptoms directly, they impacted depressive symptoms through
            lack of social belongingness. Self-concealment did not mediate the relationship of
            the two perfectionism factors with depressive symptoms. Perceived life discrepancy
            did not mediate narcissistic perfectionism and depressive symptoms but showed a tendency
            to mediate perfectionistic strivings and depressive symptoms (research questions 2).
            However, with the inclusion of serial mediation effects of self-concealment between
            the other mediators and depressive symptoms (the serial mediation model), self-concealment
            did not directly mediate the relationship between perfectionistic concerns and depressive
            symptoms unlike the result in the parallel mediation model in research question 2.
            Instead, perfectionistic concerns impacted depressive symptoms through lack of social
            belongingness and self-concealment in sequence. Narcissistic perfectionism and perfectionistic
            strivings also showed a tendency to influence depressive symptoms through the path
            from perfectionism, lack of social belongingness, self-concealment, and depressive
            symptoms (research question 3). Surprisingly, unlike the other two perfectionism factors,
            perfectionistic strivings played a unique role in decreasing lack of social belongingness
            or perceived life discrepancy, which later impacted reducing depressive symptoms under
            the circumstance where GPA and the other two perfectionism factors were controlled
            for. Among the three mediators, lack of social belongingness functions as a stronger
            mediator than the other mediators consistently across perfectionism factors. The study
            implications and limitations of this study were discussed.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Despite efforts, evidence suggests adolescent mental health continues to decline.
            The CDC's Youth Risk Behavior Data Summary &amp; Trends Report showed a rise in persistent
            feelings of sadness or hopelessness among adolescents from 2009-2019 (Center for Disease
            Control and Prevention, 2021). Similarly, the percentage of adolescents having suicidal
            ideations, plans, and attempts has also increased (Center for Disease Control and
            Prevention, 2021). Adolescents spend a significant amount of time inside a school
            building, making this environment integral to improving adolescent mental health.
            According to Jacquelynne Eccles and co-authors (1993), many school environments do
            not support the developmental needs of adolescents. They hypothesized that a mismatch
            between adolescent needs and the opportunities to meet said needs in school environments
            is a cause of negative psychological effects, such as poor mental resilience (Eccles
            et al., 1993). To address this need, this study explores how informal social spaces
            in middle schools, i.e., unstructured, non-instructional, and relatively unsupervised
            spaces, can be designed to better support adolescents' developmental needs. Adolescence,
            the developmental years between childhood and adulthood, is often a difficult time
            for many. Early adolescence (ages 10-15) is the liminal stage of these developmental
            years and is marked by the onset of momentous biological, psychological, and social
            changes (Arain et al., 2013). During this time, adolescents attempt to find their
            place in society, resulting in an increased need for belonging and autonomy (Wang
            &amp; Hofkens, 2020). Many middle schools lack the infrastructure and programming to support
            adolescent needs for exploration and self-management. Further, the lack of interactions
            and opportunities for building relationships can prevent students from satisfying
            their increased need for a sense of belonging (Wang &amp; Hofkens, 2020). Informal social
            spaces, such as libraries, cafeterias, and circulationspaces may be a solution for
            schools helping adolescents meet their developmental needs since these spaces offer
            students the opportunity to be themselves and interact with each other freely (Wang
            &amp; Hofkens, 2020). When intentionally designed, informal social spaces have the potential
            to increase adolescents' mental resilience and overall mental health by giving them
            the opportunity to receive genuine support from one another (Vieno et al., 2007).</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Hundreds of millions of liters of oil and natural gas are introduced to the ocean
            annually, yet the ecological consequences of hydrocarbon inputs into the marine environment
            are poorly understood. In particular, the role of microbes in oil and gas consumption
            in the marine environment is not well characterized. Much of what is known about hydrocarbon
            degrading microorganisms, particularly those in the marine environment, stems from
            cultivation-based studies. However, the majority of microbes elude cultivation, which
            leads to a significant knowledge gap regarding the degradation capabilities of uncultured,
            indigenous microbes in the ocean. Multi-omics approaches allow for circumventing the
            need to culture an organism in the lab to study its physiology and provides a definitive
            link between taxonomy, function and activity of uncultured hydrocarbon degrading microbes.
            In this thesis, resolving the identities, metabolic capabilities, and activity of
            uncultured hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms was done through utilization of new
            computational methods for multi-omics datasets to analyze metagenomes and metatranscriptomes
            from the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) water column and global ocean by taking advantage of.
            Chapters two and three were solely focused on microbial hydrocarbon degradation, while
            chapter four included analysis of both hydrocarbon production and consumption. In
            chapters two and three, genome assembly, gene annotation, and read mapping was used
            to elucidate microbial hydrocarbon degradation pathways in the GOM (our datasets)
            and global ocean (previously existing datasets, such as TARA Ocean). Metagenome assembled
            genomes (MAGs) combined with read mapping revealed that previously unrecognized, uncultured
            microbes are actively expressing genes and pathways for hydrocarbon degradation. For
            example, in chapter 2, Planctomycetota, Verrucomicrobiota, and Latescibacterota, clades
            lacking known methane-oxidizers in the marine environment, were identified as novel,
            non-canonical methanotrophs in the GOM and in the global ocean. These findings help
            resolve rate measurement and metatranscriptomic data that showed methane oxidation
            is an active process in northern GOM hypoxic zone, an ecosystem where canonical methane-oxidizing
            microbes are at negligible abundances. Similarly, chapter three multi-omics data analysis
            from the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill deep-sea plume, in which methane was the
            most abundant hydrocarbon, and from the global ocean revealed non-canonical methanotrophs
            in the Cycloclasticus. This represents a novel finding as this clade lacks members
            that are known carry out aerobic methane oxidation. Additional clade specific substrate
            degradation potentials that have not been reported previously included Bermanella
            genomes that encoded and expressed genes for medium and long chain n-alkanes and cycloalkane
            degradation, as did Colwellia, Cycloclasticus, and UBA11654. However, DWH Bermanella
            encoded an alkane hydroxylase, not an alkane monooxygenase, which is an important
            finding given that alkane hydroxylase has a narrow substrate range (C8-C16) compared
            to alkane monooxygenase (alkB) (C12-C26), and is entirely consistent with the profile
            of Macondo oil where C8-C16 were the most abundant non-gaseous n-alkanes. Lastly,
            SAR324 and UBA11654 contained members that encoded for aromatic hydrocarbon degradation.
            While chapters two and three evaluated microbial consumption of fossil fuels input
            to the marine environment, both naturally and through anthropogenic activities, in
            what is termed the long-term hydrocarbon cycle, chapter four evaluated the complete
            cycle of hydrocarbon production to consumption in the photic zone, termed the short-term
            hydrocarbon cycle. The short-term hydrocarbon cycle was evaluated using metatranscriptomic
            data from the photic zone of the GOM and previously assembled genomic data from over
            8,000 MAGs from OceanDNA (Nishimura and Yoshizawa 2022) and close to 1,000 Prochlorococcus
            and Synechococcus genomes from the Prochlorococcus Portal. This analysis revealed
            active pathways for the production of pentadecane (C15) and heptadecane (C17) by Prochlorococcus
            and, to a lesser degree Synechococcus, co-occurring with active n-alkane degradation,
            including C15 and C17 alkanes, by microbes in the photic zone of the GOM. Additionally,
            this active n-alkane degradation pathway was similar to the dominant hydrocarbon degradation
            pathway in the DWH oil spill plume. Specifically, the complete pathway from alkane
            degradation via alkane-monooxygenase through fatty acid metabolism was reconstructed
            for 18 bacterial phyla and one archaeal phylum. Overall, the findings in this dissertation
            indicate there is a large, diverse, and active group of microbes with the ability
            to degrade a spectrum of hydrocarbon substrates. Collectively, these analyses of uncultured
            planktonic microbes link taxonomy and function and provide an opportunity to predict
            the microbial response to oil and gas input to the marine environment, thus providing
            new insights into the fate of oil (and gas) when hydrocarbons are input to the ocean,
            leading to a greater understanding of the ecological consequences to the marine environment.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Childhood trauma has a pronounced effect on both children who have experienced trauma
            as well as adults who were exposed to trauma as children (Felitti et al., 1998). This
            sobering reality is even more pronounced for more vulnerable communities (HHS, 2018),
            such as people of color, women, individuals who identify as LBGTQ+, and individuals
            of lower socioeconomic status. Exposure to childhood trauma can result in a whole
            host of psychological as well as physiological effects Felitti et al., 1998; Giano
            et al., 2020; Sonu et al., 2020). While there exists research on the stand-alone topics
            of childhood trauma (e.g., type, proximity, duration; SAMHSA, 2020; Zare, et al.,
            2018) and collective trauma (i.e., natural disasters, terrorist attacks; Blanchet-Cohen
            &amp; Nelems, 2013; Chriman et al., 2014) minimal research exists on the subject of COVID-19-related
            trauma and the combination of pre-pandemic childhood trauma. The following study investigated
            the relationships between pre-pandemic childhood trauma and COVID-19-related trauma
            in adults during the pandemic while controlling for general mental health difficulties.
            Being that the pandemic is ongoing, the specific period examined in the current study
            was from the onset of the pandemic in early 2020, though when the data was collected
            in early 2022. The study also sought to explore if resiliency and coping had a moderating
            effect on the combination of these two types of trauma. A convenience sampling method
            using Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk; www.MTurk.com) was utilized to recruit 127 adults,
            all over the age of 18, who had previously been exposed to at least one form of childhood
            trauma before the onset of the pandemic. The study sought to explore the following
            research questions: (1) Is childhood trauma related to current COVID-19-related trauma
            in adults during the pandemic, controlling for general mental health difficulties?,
            (2) Is childhood trauma related to peak COVID-19-related trauma in adults during the
            pandemic, controlling for general mental health difficulties?, (3) Do coping and resiliency
            moderate the relationship between childhood trauma and COVID-19-related trauma, controlling
            for general mental health difficulties? Assessment measures employed by the study
            include: Trauma History Questionnaire (THQ; Hooper et al., 2011), COVID Stress Scale
            (CSS; Taylor et al., 2020), Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21; Lovibond et
            al., 1995), Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced (Brief COPE; Carver,
            1997), and the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS; Smith et al., 2008). A path analysis was
            utilized to explore the relation between pre-pandemic childhood trauma, COVID-19 distress,
            coping, and resiliency. Results from the original research questions were not significant
            and will be discussed further in the results section. Furthermore, results from the
            final research question, focusing on whether resiliency and coping moderated the relationship
            pre-pandemic childhood trauma and COVID-19-related trauma, were inconclusive. Additional
            findings from the study found that both types of trauma were widespread amongst the
            research participants. Implications for psychological theory development, clinical
            practice, and possible directions for future research is discussed.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>A commitment is the "pledging or binding of an individual to behavioral acts" (Kiesler
            &amp; Sakumura, 1966, p.349). Commitment has been examined across many academic areas
            such as Psychology (Michael, 2021), Sociology (Kemper, 2012), and Business (Carballo-Penela
            et al., 2020). For example, in Psychology, commitment refers to a state that predicts
            one's behavior and maintains relationships with other people (Michael, 2021). In Sociology,
            commitment is defined as a contribution to maintaining an ongoing connection with
            all the relevant social groups from one's personal history (Kemper, 2012). Also, researchers
            in the business area explained the commitment to sustainability as an element that
            has a favorable impact on job seekers' intentions to seek employment opportunities
            within the organization (Carballo-Penela et al., 2020). Notably, Commitment has been
            regarded as an essential element of motivating, persisting, and achieving objectives
            in sports (Hall, 1993), and has also been studied frequently in the Sport Psychology
            and Management field (Scanlan et al., 1993, p.1). A commitment is known to have different
            types of outcomes. Specifically, many researchers conducted studies on how commitment
            can influence one's mental health by applying Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT).
            ACT is "a type of behavior therapy that uses processes such as acceptance, mindfulness,
            and commitment behaviors to create some flexible psychological processes" (Karimi,
            &amp; Aghaei, 2018, p.2). Applying the ACT in the educational and psychological contexts
            reduced the psychological problems (e.g., anxiety, depression, and stress) of students
            (Karimi, &amp; Aghaei, 2018). Thus, exercisers who used the ACT during aerobics had higher
            levels of subjective well-being and lower psychological distress (Xu et al., 2021).
            Commitment influenced an individual's mental health, yet, there have been no studies
            on how different types and levels of Sport Commitment may be associated with one's
            mental health among college students. Sport Commitment is one's psychological state
            of participating in sports due to the desire or perception of obligation or both (Scanlan
            et al., 1993). The original Sport Commitment Model (SCM) is a representative framework
            of Sport Commitment for explaining the persistent involvement in sports and is designed
            for youth sports. (Scanlan et al., 1993). To apply this model to adult populations,
            Scanlan et al. (2016) updated the original SCM and described it as a theoretical framework
            to "examine commitment and explain why athletes involve in their sport continuously"
            (p. 234), however, several studies applied the model to non-athletes such as recreational
            players as well (Bum, 2018; Casper &amp; Andrew, 2008; Gabriele et al., 2011; Kang et
            al., 2020; Ko &amp; Kim, 2021; Wilson et al., 2004). Even though many studies have focused
            on the determinant of Sport Commitment, only little research has concentrated on the
            outcomes of Sport Commitment including mental health outcomes and, further, no studies
            have investigated the potential association between different profiles of Sport Commitment
            and mental health outcomes among college students who are not student-athletes. Therefore,
            the purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between two different profiles
            of Sport Commitment (i.e., Enthusiastic Commitment, Constrained Commitment) and levels
            of various mental health outcomes (i.e., stress, anxiety, depression, happiness, and
            psychological well-being) among college students who are not student-athletes in the
            US. To fulfill the objective of the present study, this research was designed as cross-sectional
            research. I recruited 300 participants via Prolific, and the 83 items survey was distributed
            using Qualtrics. As measurements, I adopted the SCQ-2 (Scanlan et al., 2016), DASS-21
            (Lovibond &amp; Lovibond, 1995), OHQ (Hills &amp; Argyle, 2002), PERMA Profiler (Butler &amp;
            Kern, 2016), BRCS (Sinclair &amp; Wallston, 2004) to assess Enthusiastic Commitment, Constrained
            Commitment, stress, anxiety, depression, happiness, psychological well-being, and
            resilient coping. After collecting the data, I conducted the descriptive analysis
            and Canonical correlation analysis to explore the association between two profiles
            of Sport Commitment and one's stress, anxiety, depression, happiness, and psychological
            well-being. As a result, it showed that participants who were enthusiastically committed
            to sports had high levels of happiness and psychological well-being, and lower levels
            of stress, anxiety, and depression. In contrast, participants who had a higher level
            of Constrained Commitment tended to have higher degrees of stress, anxiety, and depression,
            and lower happiness and psychological well-being. The present study holds significance
            both in terms of theoretical and practical implications. It contributes to the theoretical
            expansion of the SCM by examining the mental health outcomes of two profiles of Sport
            Commitment among college students who are not student-athletes. Additionally, the
            results highlight the crucial roles of the university in maximizing the level of Enthusiastic
            Commitment that lead to enhancing mental health among college students.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The research questions addressed in this exploratory survey research were: 1) what
            is the degree of teachers' morale, and what perceptions do teachers have about their
            district and school leadership, 2) how does the degree of teachers' morale differ
            by their background characteristics, and 3) how are teacher perceptions of district
            and school leadership associated with their sense of morale, controlling for their
            background characteristics in the Friendship (pseudonym) County School District (FCSD)?
            While many studies have established the link between school leadership and teacher
            morale, few studies have explored teachers' sense of morale and relationship with
            district and school leadership using a districtwide teacher survey in an ethnically
            diverse and economically disadvantaged district such as the Friendship (pseudonym)
            County School District (FCSD). Based on a districtwide survey of 123 teachers, I found
            that the overall degree of teacher morale in the Friendship County School District
            (FCSD) is high. This study also found that the degree of morale was significantly
            and negatively associated with the level of stress and health impact, showing that
            teachers who experience more stress and negative job impacts on their mental and physical
            health are more likely to report a lower degree of morale. Another significant finding
            was that the five dimensions of school leadership and, likewise, five dimensions of
            district leadership are significantly and positively associated with the degree of
            morale; thus, teachers who perceive their leadership positively along these five dimensions
            are more likely to report higher morale. Implications and recommendations for district
            and school leadership for increasing teacher morale are offered.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The purpose of this study was to first determine whether a librarian's years of experience
            positively correlated with their literacy knowledge and efficacy, and to second determine
            whether structured exposure to specific and targeted education of evidence-based strategies
            for literacy could enable librarians to improve their knowledge of the tenants of
            literacy and early language development. 10 librarians from a North Florida Public
            Library System were surveyed prior to and upon completion of an 8-week professional
            training course targeting evidence-based strategies for language and literacy development.
            The pre-training survey, consisting of 7 demographic, 25 knowledge, and 15 efficacy
            questions, intended to serve as a baseline of the librarians' knowledge of general
            language components, acquisition, and development, as well as their level of confidence
            in employing their knowledge to promote early language and literacy development (efficacy).
            The post-training survey consisted of the same knowledge and efficacy questions with
            the addition of 5 free-response questions. Data were collected on the pre- and post-knowledge
            and efficacy responses. All participants demonstrated an increase in the number of
            correct knowledge responses and increased efficacy ratings from pre-training to post-training.
            Additionally, years of experience was found to positively correlate with the librarians'
            efficacy ratings pre-training. However, years of experience was observed to have a
            mild negative correlation with pre-training knowledge. Implications of this study
            suggest that although exposure to structured training for language and literacy may
            be helpful in improving knowledge and efficacy in youth service librarians, years
            of experience in the role does not guarantee that veteran librarians will possess
            more knowledge than those newer to the field. A wider scope of training and content
            is needed to ensure strong foundations of knowledge.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Nucleic acid delivery is crucial for several biomedical applications, including tissue
            engineering, medical implant coatings, cancer treatment and regenerative medicine.
            Localized delivery of nucleic acids through biomaterial substrates can overcome several
            difficulties associated with common systemic delivery and maintain high vector concentrations
            at the target site to enable increased transfection efficiency. In this project, we
            aim to develop substrate-based nucleic acid delivery coatings that can provide extended
            and localized release of non-viral gene delivery vectors for tissue engineering and
            regenerative medicine applications. In vitro studies are conducted to characterize
            the absorption and release interactions between surface coatings made of the bio-inspired
            and naturally derived polymers, including polydopamine (pDA), hyaluronic acid (HA),
            glycol chitosan (GC), and their combinations, and a model polymeric gene delivery
            vector composed of polyethyleneimine (PEI). PEI-DNA polyplexes N/P ratio was observed
            to have a statistically significant impact on the amount of DNA loaded onto each coating,
            while the surface coating type and concentration were surprisingly found to have no
            statistically significant effects. Surface-based transfection as well as bolus transfection
            from these coatings are studied over time for NIH3T3 and HEK293 cells. Surface-based
            transfection efficiencies were significantly impacted by the coating types and polyplex
            N/P ratios for transfection on HEK293 cells. However, for transfection on NIH3T3 cells
            only coating type had a significant impact on the transfection efficiencies. In conclusion,
            this study adds to our understanding of how different biocompatible materials interact
            with nucleic acid delivery polyplexes, which aids in the creation of surface coatings
            that facilitate effective localized nucleic acid delivery for tissue engineering and
            biomedical implant applications.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Until the past few decades, criminological research has almost exclusively focused
            on examining the link between various environmental risk factors and criminal behavior.
            Since then, an emerging body of research has developed exploring the association between
            different antisocial traits and offending. The culmination of this research has revealed
            personality constructs such as low self-control, impulsiveness, aggressiveness, sensation
            seeking, and Machiavellianism, among others to be positively associated with greater
            criminal behaviors. However, this area of research, also known as propensity-based
            studies of offending, remains incomplete. The criminological literature has largely
            overlooked the potential explanatory power of callous-unemotional traits when attempting
            to identify the diverse factors that predict assorted offending patterns, including
            chronic levels of offending. To be certain, research in developmental psychology has
            linked these traits to a host of negative life outcomes typically found within criminological
            studies, including offending. And yet, research in the developmental literature has
            yet to uncover why, and under what conditions, this link exists as well as how this
            association changes based on the variant of callous-unemotional traits being examined.
            Likewise, research examining the etiology of callous-unemotional traits has many gaps
            in the literature particularly concerning male-female differences as well as discerning
            what environmental risk factors explain such development. This dissertation will address
            these gaps in the literature by examining potential pathways to the development of
            both variants of callous-unemotional traits as well as associations between the variants
            and various offending measures (i.e., general, nonviolent, violent, life-course-persistent
            offending, and illicit drug use). The results revealed that the etiology of both variants
            of callous-unemotional traits is dependent upon the sex of the individual. Additionally,
            the environmental factors that predicted callous-unemotional traits were different
            based on the variant being investigated. The models examining the callous-unemotional
            traits-crime link likewise found that the association differed based on the variant
            as well as the sex of the individual. The results of these analyses also find support
            for the link being nonlinear and partially due to a shared genetic etiology. The implications
            of these findings are discussed in reference to policy, theory, and future research.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Throughout the literature, there is a well-documented discrepancy between rating of
            children's behaviors across different informants, typically parents and teachers.
            Many different theories have been investigated to address the root of these discrepancies.
            Previous studies have examined if these discrepancies are the result of informant
            interacting with the child across different contexts, teacher expertise in typical
            childhood behaviors, parent mental health and stress, and the quality of the rating
            forms. The current study sought to investigate such discrepancies in a meta-analytic
            framework in which eleven different informant pairs were examined rating eight different
            behaviors categories. It was hypothesized that the informant pairs that interacted
            with the children in similar contexts, such as Parent-Parent and Teacher-Teacher informant
            pairs, would demonstrate more similar ratings. This hypothesis was supported. It was
            also hypothesized that there would be more agreement on more observable behaviors,
            such as externalizing behaviors. This hypothesis was not supported. It is important
            to be able to understand when such rating discrepancies occur, because the ability
            to anticipate such rating discrepancies can be used in both clinical and empirical
            research.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The warm core structure of a tropical cyclone (TC) has been previously analyzed through
            aircraft observations, dropsondes, satellite-borne Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit
            (AMSU) data, and numerical simulations. It has been shown that aircraft that fly through
            a TC collect data that represent the warm core of a TC well; however, it has been
            theorized that microwave and satellite data struggle to resolve and represent the
            warm core structure throughout the entire center of the TC because of the coarseness
            of the satellite observations. Numerical simulations have been utilized to study the
            height of the warm core with a maximum around 4-8 km and have found that the height
            is nearly constant with varying intensities (Stern and Nolan 2012). This study aims
            to analyze the warm core structure of a TC through reanalysis datasets (ERA5, ERA-Interim,
            MERRA2), as these datasets are the only ones outside of aircraft and observations,
            that can provide long duration data of 3-D and 4-D structure. ERA5 has the finest
            resolution of the three datasets that are analyzed with MERRA2, and ERA-Interim increasingly
            coarse. The average temperature anomaly with respect to the whole basin from the zonal
            mean in all basins is about +4-9K in ERA5, +3-6K in ERA-Interim, and +4-8K in MERRA2
            with the West Pacific basin having the highest magnitudes of average temperature anomalies.
            ERA5 typically sees the highest magnitude in terms of maximum average temperature
            anomaly while ERA-Interim sees the lowest values in all basins, in addition to most
            of the datasets showing tropical storms being statistically significantly cooler than
            all other intensities. The height of the warm core, described here as pressure, was
            subjectively analyzed through the geopotential height anomalies, and was found to
            be nearly constant with increasing intensity around 350-400 hPa, with the West Pacific
            having the highest warm core around 300 hPa. These results suggest that the strength
            of the warm core varies within each basin and within different reanalysis datasets.
            The resolution of the datasets carries a large role in how well the warm core is represented,
            however, the strength is comparable to prior works. The height of the warm core in
            this study showed to be more constant with differing intensities which is different
            than what was found in previous works where the height of the warm core increased
            with intensity.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>LGBTQ+ students exist on college campuses in greater numbers than ever before. Campus
            culture directly impacts how LGBTQ+ students experience college and contributes to
            their overall sense of belonging. Campus culture in turn is shaped by students' access
            to resources and the effectiveness of those resources. Students' experiences, for
            better or for worse, are shaped by the programming they have access to and the environment
            the college fosters through these programs. This dissertation in practice examines
            the relationship between LGBTQ+ students on Emerson College's campus and the resources
            they use. Utilizing an exploratory case study methodology including focus groups and
            campus observations, this research examines the following questions: What are the
            experiences of Emerson's LGBTQ+ students? How do Emerson's LGBTQ+ programs and policies
            meet the needs of LGBTQ+ students on campus? In what ways do Emerson's efforts enhance
            LGBTQ+ students' feelings of belonging? This study found that many organizations and
            campus spaces operate as queer by default due to the orientation of their members,
            shaping the way that students experience campus culture. As such, other motivators
            such as race, ethnicity, and background prior to coming to college influence the connections
            students seek on campus moreso than their LGBTQ+ identity. This study also found that
            LGBTQ+ students experienced belonging in both LGBTQ+ campus activities and non-LGBTQ+
            campus activities, although students do feel a need for more specific LGBTQ+ programming
            reflective of community struggles. Lastly, findings indicated that students felt that
            administration and faculty have a major impact on the sense of belonging present on
            campus as well as the LGBTQ+ offerings of the college, and there is a need for both
            groups to better their efforts as students feel they are earnest but misguided. The
            findings of this study revealed multiple implications for practice. Most of all, sense
            of belonging on campus for LGBTQ+ students encompasses many components, all directly
            related to their base need for connection. This means their sense of community cannot
            be pinpointed on any one item being present, but rather on multiple factors that create
            genuine relationships with others. LGBTQ+ students on Emerson's campus experience
            that definition in unique ways unique to Emerson's campus environment – perhaps most
            significantly, their sense of belonging being influenced greatly by being in the majority
            and attending a campus where they are able to interact with other LGBTQ+ students
            in a variety of settings, not just in specific organizations that cater to that population.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have significantly contributed to the identification
            of genetic variants by leveraging thousands of loci associated with complex traits
            and diseases, leading to breakthroughs in human genetics research. However, interpretation
            of these results is often difficult as the GWAS-identified variants (single-nucleotide
            polymorphisms [SNPs]) often have small effect estimates on target traits, limiting
            their direct application to disease research. Methods such as polygenic risk score
            analysis have been presented to enhance disease risk prediction, however, the clinical
            utility of these methods are controversial. Similarly, the identification of genes
            associated with likely causal SNPs is unclear as identified SNPs explain only a small
            portion of heritability. Genetic regulations of GWAS findings are often characterized
            using statistical methods such as transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), but
            these methods tend to ignore functional mechanisms that play critical roles in gene-regulatory
            pathways, resulting in loss of predictive power.In this essay we present three integrative
            methodologies for improving disease risk prediction as well as identifying likely
            causal genes through incorporation of omics level data and GWAS results for complex
            traits. First, we propose an integrated PRS method that leverages multiple PRS methods,
            as well as multiple GWAS datasets, to improve coronary artery disease (CAD) risk prediction
            over clinically used prediction models (PCE). Our results indicate that our proposed
            method improves model discrimination for incident CAD cases over the PCE model while
            also improving risk reclassification in European populations. Second, we propose a
            Cauchy integrative model that aggregates gene expression levels, DNA methylation,
            and splicing event information to increase identification of likely causal genes in
            24 GWAS complex trait datasets. Additionally, we extend our method to identify causal
            genes for lung adenocarcinoma risk. Finally, we implement our Cauchy integrative model
            to identify likely causal omics biomarkers for CAD and propose a penalized regression
            framework integrative PRS model to improve risk prediction in an African population
            when limited to a European GWAS and reference panel.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Over the last three decades, traffic crashes have been one of the leading causes of
            fatalities and economic losses in the world. Since vulnerable road users have specific
            characteristics, they are perceived to have a higher risk of being involved in fatal
            road crashes. Therefore, it is essential to focus on mitigating the vulnerabilities
            of roadway users as well as investigating the key causes of crashes in order to achieve
            the desired level of roadway safety. It is imperative that we understand the specific
            needs of vulnerable roadway users and their involvement in crashes in order to address
            their unique challenges, determine the underlying factors contributing to their vulnerability,
            and develop targeted interventions and policies that can contribute to improving their
            safety. The level of vulnerability among roadway users depends on a variety of factors,
            including their age, level of protection, surrounding characteristics, situational
            conditions, and the presence of extreme events such as disasters. The majority of
            vulnerabilities cannot be attributed to the negligence of roadway users, since they
            are primarily determined by an individual's intrinsic physical characteristics and
            the conditions imposed by particular circumstances. Therefore, this dissertation provided
            comprehensive insights into helping vulnerable roadway users by examining them from
            four distinct perspectives: (a) exploring young-driver-involved crashes to understand
            vulnerability based on age, (b) investigating pedestrian vulnerability due to their
            lack of protection, (c) examining the challenges faced by drivers experiencing daytime
            sun glare-induced temporary visual impairment to assess vulnerability in relation
            to surrounding circumstances, and (d) analyzing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
            on the entire society to comprehend vulnerability in the context of a disaster situation.The
            purpose of the dissertation is to examine the spatial patterns of vulnerable-involved
            crashes in order to identify those locations that pose high risk to them. Furthermore,
            we develop several robust statistical models according to the type of dependent variables
            for each group of vulnerable road users. Based on an in-depth regression analysis,
            we are able to predict crash likelihood and provide clear guidelines for the development
            of plans, policies, and effective safety countermeasures. In order to accomplish the
            objective of the study, we introduce a Geographic Information System (GIS)-based methodology
            to analyze the spatial crash patterns associated with each crash type in terms of
            focused vulnerability. This is followed by a more detailed examination of selected
            counties of Florida using both planar Euclidean Distance (ED) and Roadway Network
            Distance (RND)-based Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). According to the GIS maps developed
            in this dissertation, there are differences in spatial patterns between vulnerable
            roadway users involved in crashes. In conclusion, this dissertation proposes a number
            of novel methodological approaches in order to address the following objectives: •
            An investigation of contributing factors influencing crashes caused by vulnerable
            youth drivers (aged 16-24) and assessment of the correlation between intersection
            presence near university campuses and likelihood of these crashes, • An assessment
            of the spatial correlation and impact of the network-based distance between locations
            of vulnerable pedestrian-involved crashes and the centroid of associated land use
            of various types, • An assessment of the adverse effects of daytime sun glare on driving
            performance and evaluation of the potential actions taken by vulnerable drivers under
            the direct influence of temporary blindness caused by sun glare, • A spatial-temporal
            investigation of the crash density pattern during the COVID-19 pandemic, assuming
            all individuals to be vulnerable roadway users, in accordance with the specific socio-demographic
            features of the study area. Findings clearly show that intersections near university
            areas pose a significant problem for youth drivers. Moreover, the part of this study
            focusing on pedestrians as another vulnerable roadway user reveal that pedestrian-involved
            crashes were more likely to occur near retail stores and nightclubs. Additionally,
            daylight has an effect regardless of the type of surrounding land use on the severity
            of pedestrian-related crashes. This dissertation also investigates the temporary visual
            impairment caused by sun glare during the daytime as well as the likelihood of potential
            actions performed by drivers experiencing this adverse circumstance. Furthermore,
            the results obtained from the investigation of crashes caused by vulnerable drivers
            exposed to daytime sun glare indicate that the majority of observed actions, particularly
            on local roadways, involve in the violation of stop signs and red lights. In addition,
            drivers tend to follow too closely in high-traffic areas when their vision is impaired
            by sun glare. Moreover, a non-parametric method (Kruskal-Wallis) confirms that there
            is a significant difference in crash densities during the COVID-19 pandemic compared
            to the pre-pandemic period in different counties irrespective of their sociodemographic
            differences. Finally, the findings indicate that the presence of young populations
            (e.g., college students) in Leon County is highly correlated with the decline in the
            number of crashes during COVID-19. In summary, the results of this dissertation can
            be utilized by transportation agencies to pinpoint high-risk locations which have
            a higher likelihood of vulnerable population-involved crashes and to develop more
            reliable plans targeting the vulnerable population and their special needs. The implementation
            of safety countermeasures is essential to improving the safety of vulnerable road
            users. Education campaigns emphasizing defensive driving skills and risk awareness,
            for example, may be effective in preventing young drivers from engaging in risky driving.
            Additionally, implementing cutting-edge Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) technologies
            and offering alternative routes to avoid sun glare may improve driving performance
            and reduce the number of crashes caused by drivers experiencing daytime sun glare.
            A pedestrian-friendly environment, which includes crosswalks, adequate lighting, clear
            signage, and well-maintained sidewalks, also contributes to pedestrian safety. Lastly,
            promoting alternative remote options for E-learning, e-shopping, teleconsultations,
            and teleconferencing can reduce the number of trips generated during the COVID-19
            pandemic and reduce the risk associated with increased vulnerability while maintaining
            road safety for all users in the region affected by the pandemic. In this dissertation,

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The recent reforms in science education envision engaging students in authentic practices
            of science and habits of mind (NRC, 2012); in other words, engaging students in doing
            science. Science is a multidimensional endeavor (Davidson, Jaber, &amp; Southerland, 2020;
            Pickering, 1995). The work of the scientists include various aspects-- conceptual
            (kinds of knowledge such as facts, laws, theories), epistemological (ways of thinking
            and understanding such as how to construct and evaluate scientific knowledge), social
            (social norms and collaborations), and affective (emotional experiences- the joy of
            a successful experiment or frustration over a failed one). With science being a multidimensional
            endeavor, there is a need to view and understand students' disciplinary engagement
            in science as a multidimensional endeavor as well. Using a qualitative, naturalistic,
            case study research design, this dissertation generates an in-depth, multi-faceted
            understanding of the dynamics of students' disciplinary engagement in science classrooms
            by focusing on a single instance of disciplinary engagement of a group of four students
            in a middle school science classroom, examined from three different lenses. The main
            data sources for the three investigations in this dissertation are the audio and video
            recordings of classroom engagement and student interviews from a two-day long lesson–Mechanisms
            of Evolution–in a middle school science classroom. Additional data sources include
            student artifacts such as lab reports and claim-evidence-reasoning posters. The main
            analytical tool used throughout this study was multimodal discourse analysis that
            allowed for a focus both on the verbal and non-verbal cues to make inferences about
            the conceptual, epistemological, social, and affective engagement of students in small
            groups. In the first investigation, we examine the entanglement of the conceptual,
            epistemological, social, and affective dynamics that emerge in a small group as students
            encounter conceptual uncertainties arising from examining ambiguous data in science.
            Our findings from the first investigation demonstrated the ways in which students
            engaged in the epistemic work of science–analyzing data, generating claims, evaluating
            alternative claims, and challenging each other in service of developing a mechanistic
            reasoning for the scientific phenomenon. However, these findings also portray how
            overwhelming social and affective experiences along with persistent conceptual and
            epistemological conflicts have the potential to undermine the rich epistemic work
            of students. While the first investigation examines the dynamics of engagement of
            the whole group, the second investigation in this dissertation explores the shifts
            in discourse moves of a single student in that group with evolving argumentation goals
            and the influence of the shifting discourse moves on shaping opportunities for disciplinary
            sensemaking in a small group. Our findings from the second investigation demonstrated
            that as the local task goals (i.e., students' understanding of what is required or
            what needs to be done at a particular moment) evolve, similarly phrased discourse
            moves can have different effects on students' sensemaking opportunities. In other
            words, depending on the local task goals, the same phrase can be used dialogically
            or rhetorically, by the same student, resulting in opening up or closing off spaces
            for sensemaking. Complementing the first two investigations that examine the student
            engagement from the researchers' perspective, the final investigation in this dissertation
            centers student voices of their experiences in the lesson. Our findings from the third
            investigation highlight the differential experiences of students working in the same
            group when engaging with uncertainty and demonstrate how these four students experienced
            the same episode in different ways. Too, their perspectives allowed us to understand
            how their past experiences with one another in the classroom influenced the ways in
            which they experienced this episode. The differential experiences highlighted in the
            student reflections provide further insights into students' disciplinary engagement
            in science. Our findings from the three investigations considered together suggests
            that students' disciplinary engagement in science is not simple and straightforward.
            Rather, it is "messy" and multidimensional, with students managing both the epistemic
            and relational (i.e., pertaining to the collaborative work) aspects of science. The
            case analyzed in this dissertation presents a unique view of how students engaged
            in rich disciplinary work of science can become overwhelmed with the entanglement
            of dynamics along the multiple dimensions eventually undermining the epistemic work
            of the students. This study contributes to the growing body of literature examining
            the multidimensional nature of students' disciplinary engagement, students' negotiations
            of conflicts and tensions that arise during that engagement, and influential discursive
            moves that support and sustain disciplinary engagement.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Inland aquatic systems such as lakes, rivers, and wetlands are pivotal in cycling
            carbon between the landscape and the atmosphere. However, as global air temperatures
            increase and precipitation patterns continue to change, their roles as net carbon
            sources or sinks will become uncertain. New carbon sources will become available to
            aquatic systems in regions such as the permafrost zone in the northern high latitudes
            or in temperate forested wetlands where increased precipitation connects waterbodies
            to upland catchments. In dryer regions, the water residence time of aquatic systems
            will increase, restricting the inputs of organic carbon from the surrounding landscape,
            but also amplifying its internal production and degradation. This dissertation aims
            to investigate the sources and molecular properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM)
            across northern high-latitude lakes and temperate North American wetlands and to consider
            its potential role in the carbon cycle as these regions continue to experience changes
            in temperature and precipitation. Using a combined approach of Fourier transform ion
            cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS), optical and fluorescence spectroscopy,
            and mediated electrochemical oxidation and reduction, molecular-level DOM composition
            was revealed and related to large-scale climate and physiographic variables. Specifically,
            the goals of this dissertation were to characterize DOM in lakes spanning the Western
            North American Arctic with respect to differences in seasonality and climate (Chapter
            2) as well as hydrology and landscape characteristics (Chapter 3). Using these findings,
            a quantitative relationship between molecular level-composition and bulk electrochemical
            DOM properties was also assessed (Chapter 4). Finally, DOM properties were surveyed
            across various wetland types across temperate North American regions and further examined
            between surface waters and porewaters as well as during different annual hydroperiods
            (Chapter 5). DOM composition and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations varied
            seasonally across Alaskan Tundra lakes. DOC concentrations were significantly higher
            in the winter months than in the summer due to ice exclusion concentrating solutes
            while DOM contained unique signatures indicative of extensive microbial processing.
            DOM properties also varied spatially in this region with shallower lakes and lakes
            closer to the northern coast generally containing more aromatic DOM. Expanding this
            study region further south across boreal ecosystems revealed that DOM aromaticity
            increased northward as forests transitioned into shrublands and permafrost coverage
            became continuous. Many lakes across the Western North American Arctic were primarily
            composed of autochthonous, or internally produced, DOM rather than DOM originating
            from the landscape. These differences were mainly driven by landscape connectivity
            where more hydrologically isolated lakes had higher DOC concentrations but less terrestrial
            DOM than lakes that were hydrologically connected to the landscape. In contrast, DOM
            from the hydrologically connected lakes had greater electron accepting and donating
            capacity, likely originating from the surrounding continuous permafrost soils. Furthermore,
            DOM electrochemical properties correlated positively with bulk aromaticity and negatively
            with protein-like fluorescence and aliphaticity, allowing for the development of the
            Reducing Index which quantified DOM electrochemical properties using FT-ICR MS parameters.
            Finally, temperate North American wetlands had higher DOC concentrations and greater
            DOM aromaticity than other inland waters such as lakes and rivers. However, these
            compositional differences were primarily driven by geographical sampling region rather
            than sampling depth or hydroperiod and possibly related to soil content and vegetation.
            Using FT-ICR MS, 3,489 molecular formulae were found across all sites and persisted
            in both wet and dry hydroperiods, representing the signature of wetland DOM. Many
            of these molecular signatures were also found in the world's largest arctic rivers,
            highlighting the role of wetlands in transporting terrestrial organic matter to coastal
            systems. These studies demonstrate the diversity of aquatic DOM composition and DOC
            concentrations across expansive regions as related to hydrology and physiographic
            properties and allows for future work to draw comparisons to similar regions and assess
            their role in a changing carbon cycle.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>In the spring of 1959, thousands of Tibetans fled China, crossing the border into
            Nepal. They were following the Dalai Lama into exile after years of living under an
            oppressive regime in Chinese-occupied Tibet. In the decades that followed, tens of
            thousands of Tibetans would leave their homeland, searching for a better life abroad.
            As Tibetans found new homes around the world, many stayed close to their homeland,
            seeking refuge and new opportunities in Nepal. One of the opportunities they were
            seeking was access to quality education. A generation later, Tibetans born in exile
            are still seeking the opportunity to become educated. Through in-depth interviews,
            participant observations, and an examination of artifacts, this study aims to explore
            how Tibetan refugees in Nepal construct their identities as educated persons through
            their experiences with differing systems of education, including formalized secular,
            monastic, and a hybrid of formal and monastic education. Additionally, it seeks to
            investigate how Tibetans perform their roles as educated persons within the refugee
            community in Kathmandu. By analyzing their experiences and perspectives, I seek to
            understand how Tibetan refugees have formulated their identities through their educational
            experiences, sociocultural contexts, and historical events, as well as how they perform
            and make sense of their identities as educated persons in the refugee community in
            Kathmandu.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Considering the broad context that there is a growing number of international students
            seeking English teacher education in the Western TEOSL programs and the majority of
            them will eventuallygo back to their own countries to teach, these international TESOL
            trainees face the challenge of integrating two different language education systems.
            Although the social justice movements have pushed the TESOL field to be more inclusive
            and empowering, there still seems to be a need for more focus on how English teachers
            as the actors of language teaching and learning make sense of their living experiences
            and identity formations. Language teaching and learning should be conceptualized as
            a contextual-specific process shaped by both language teachers' identities and sociocultural
            factors. Grounded in the sociocultural framework, this study utilizes qualitative
            narrative inquiry to explore the experiences and identity development of US-TESOL-trained
            English teachers from China in terms of their language teaching and learning background,
            US-TESOL training as well as the knowledge transfer process from the US to China.
            The participants' narratives are collected through individual interviews, focus group
            interviews and artifacts. The findings illuminate the complexity and dynamics of language
            teachers' identity reconstructions in the context of international mobility. Overall,
            this study highlights the multidimensionality of teacher identity and motivations,
            the hybridity of teacher agency, transformation and growth in US-TESOL training, and
            the unevenness of knowledge transfer and translation.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Health and wellness are the cornerstones of life. Unfortunately, even with the COVID-19
            pandemic still fresh in our minds people are not consistently pursuing health activities
            that can bolster health and wellness. In our study, we concentrate on utilizing the
            health and wellness mobile technology (HWMT) to help people establish healthy lifestyle
            habits. Using integrative preventive medicine as a backdrop, we contextualized Hull's
            (1943) stimulus-response-reinforcement (SRR) theoretical framework to explore the
            habit formation mechanism. Results of an empirical online survey (n = 696) validated
            our hypotheses. The stimulus (i.e., health and wellness self-improvement) positively
            influences the physical health goal. In turn, the physical health goal influences
            the two-stage response (i.e., stickiness and engagement). Engagement brings individuals
            positive feelings as the reinforcer (i.e., subjective vitality and sense of accomplishment)
            that lead to HWMT exploitation and health and wellness related habit formation. The
            theoretical and practical implications of the study are provided.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This treatise presents a comparative study of selected works of Chen Yi and Andrea
            Clearfield, exploring their incorporation of Tibetan idioms in their compositions.
            The motivation for this study stems from the contrasting backgrounds of the two composers
            and their unique perspectives on music creation. The treatise begins with an overview
            of the background and motivation, followed by a brief introduction to Tibetan music.
            The subsequent chapters delve into the compositions of Chen Yi and Andrea Clearfield,
            analyzing their respective works and examining how they incorporate Tibetan elements.
            Chen Yi's compositions, namely Tibetan Tunes and China West Suite, are analyzed in
            Chapter Four, while Clearfield's works, Earth Door/Sky Door and Tse Go La Choral Suite,
            are examined in Chapter Five. Throughout the study, particular attention is given
            to the utilization of instruments and traditional Asian pentatonic modes in composing
            pieces inspired by Tibetan genres and the role of the piano in their compositions.
            By addressing these research questions, this comparative study offers insights into
            the specific Tibetan elements employed by both composers, taking into account their
            diverse cultural backgrounds and experiences. The treatise concludes by summarizing
            the findings and emphasizing the significance of their contributions to the representation
            and preservation of Tibetan music within the realm of Western classical compositions.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Speech- language pathologists (SLPs) require up-to-date, evidence-based research to
            inform their treatment decisions. Current literature on clinical recommendations lacks
            ecological validity, meaning they do not reflect the realistic environment in which
            speech sound disorders are treated. This discrepancy impacts the validity of treatment
            practices in speech sound disorders (SSDs) for both children with SSD in isolation
            as well as children with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). Using
            the experience sampling method, we queried school-based speech language pathologists
            in two data collection periods for both populations (n=106, n=50) three times per
            day for five days regarding the dynamics of their speech sound therapy sessions. This
            investigation, specifically, examined target selection for both students with SSD
            in isolation and IDD populations. Our results indicate that /ɹ/ was the most commonly
            targeted speech sound in the SSD in isolation population, and /s/ was the most commonly
            targeted speech sound in the IDD and SSD population.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>In this thesis, we will provide a Finslerian point of view on several objects of classical
            informationgeometry. Therefore we will generalize the Fisher-Rao metric to a family
            of Finsler metrics which we denote by ??-Fisher-Rao metrics. Generalizing a construction
            of Khesin et al. we construct a simplifying transformations, that allows us to derive
            an explicit formula for geodesics on Dens(? ) and that reduces the geodesic problem
            on Prob(? ) to finding geodesics on an ??-sphere. We then show that the Amari-Chentsov
            connection on the space of all positive densities can be interpreted as the Chern
            connection of the ??-Fisher-Rao metric and we also show that this equivalence does
            not hold on the space of probability densities. For the space of densities we can
            use this correspondence to calculate the flag curvatures of the ??-Fisher-Rao metric
            and show that they are identically zero. Next if we restrict ourselves to the case
            of manifolds of dimension one, we can provide a new geometric interpretation of the
            non-periodic Proudman–Johnson equations as geodesic equations of the right invariant
            homogeneous ? 1,?-Finsler metrics on the diffeomorphism group. We then show that in
            the non-periodic case two families of equations, the generalized inviscid Proudman–
            Johnson equation, and the ?-Hunter–Saxton equation (recently introduced by Cotter
            et al.) coincide for a certain range of parameters. Generalizing a construction of
            Lenells for the Hunter–Saxton equation [57], we analyze these equations using an isometry
            from the diffeomorphism group to an appropriate subset of real-valued functions. Thereby
            we show that the periodic case of the ?-Hunter-Saxton equations is equivalent to the
            geodesic equations on the ??-sphere in the space of functions, and the non-periodic
            case for both the ?-Hunter-Saxton and the inviscid Proudman– Johnson equations is
            equivalent to a geodesic flow on a flat space. This allows us to give explicit solutions
            to these equations in the non-periodic case, and answer several questions of Cotter
            et al. regarding their limiting behavior. Finally we derive the geodesic equation
            of a right invariant Orlicz norm on the diffeomorphism group Diff(?1).</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This dissertation seeks to make a valuable contribution to the fields of public policy
            and American politics by introducing novel theoretical and empirical insights via
            the study of the politics of climate change. Climate change represents a daunting
            challenge for societies across the world, but in no other major country are political
            parties more polarized on this issue than in the United States. This dissertation
            takes a dynamic approach to study the interplay between public attitudes on climate
            change and positions the parties adopt. This dissertation's primary goal is to provide
            a more theoretically motivated and comprehensive look at the endogenous relationship
            between public opinion and party agendas. Recent work in political science and other
            social sciences researching climate change has primarily used either cross-sectional
            data to study climate sorting or experiments on top-down forms of opinion change according
            to which elite cues impact opinions and then inferring the causes of sorting. Yet
            not enough work looks at the role of bottom-up processes such as how a party's climate
            change policies impact voter support for the party and its candidates, let alone empirically
            compare the contributions of both processes to overall rates of sorting. This dissertation
            addresses these limitations in prior literature by utilizing a wealth of cross-sectional
            and panel survey data to understand climate change and environment opinion over time,
            as well a novel survey experiment to understand whether and how voters hold parties
            accountable for not supporting climate change action. The contributions described
            above result in a richer and more complete scientific foundation for studying essential
            policy considerations in the modern world. This dissertation offers the first direct
            examination of the interplay between public attitudes and political parties and contributes
            to a clearer yet more dynamic understanding of climate politics.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) is a special type of concrete with high compressive
            and tensile strength, high durability, and a dense microstructure that results in
            improved mechanical and durability properties. However, due to the high cement content
            typically used in UHPC, the carbon footprint of UHPC is generally very high. On the
            other hand, limestone calcined clay cement (LC3) is a more environmentally friendly
            alternative to ordinary Portland cement (OPC) with lower carbon emissions during production.
            Previous research has explored LC3 replacing up to 50% of OPC content in normal strength
            concrete, which contributes to significant reduction of carbon footprint. The use
            of LC3 binder in UHPC material though has not been widely explored. This thesis research
            presents a feasibility study on the development of UHPC with sustainable LC3 binders.
            Up to 30% of OPC replacement with LC3 binder in non-proprietary UHPC mixtures was
            investigated; the workability, compressive and tensile properties of the resultant
            UHPC mixtures were experimentally characterized to determine the influence of LC3
            on UHPC.</p>

            cuts obliquely through Blue Ridge tectonostratigraphy, metamorphic isograds, earlier
            thrusts, and Pennsylvanian regional cross antiforms; making it the youngest fault
            in the kinematic sequence of events along the west flank of the Appalachian orogen.
            In the central segment of the fault, between Hightower, Alabama and Dahlonega, Georgia,
            the Allatoona fault marks the western/eastern Blue Ridge province boundary, and south
            of Hightower the Allatoona fault becomes an internal eastern Blue Ridge structure.
            Just north of Buchannon, Georgia, the Mulberry Rock window (a ~20 km-long breached
            eyelid window) allows a 3-D view into the structural architecture, kinematics, and
            trajectories of the regional thrusts. From here, northeast to Dawsonville, Georgia,
            it carries the Dahlonega Gold belt in its immediate hanging wall, with older faults
            (Burnt Hickory Ridge and Chattahoochee) carried passively piggyback above the gold
            belt. The extension of this fault northeast of Dawsonville has inspired controversy
            for years. However, recent mapping around the complex triple junction between the
            western, central, and eastern Blue Ridge provinces west of Dahlonega, Georgia has
            revealed new evidence supporting the continuation of the Allatoona fault northeast
            of this intersection. For instance, between Dawsonville and Dahlonega, internal Dahlonega
            Gold belt stratigraphy maintains its northeast-trend, and the Allatoona fault cuts
            both the structurally underlying "ancestral Allatoona" fault carrying rocks correlated
            with the Otto Formation, and the Etowah River fault at the base of the Sally Free
            Mafic Complex. Both the "ancestral Allatoona" fault and the Etowah River fault are
            folded by the overturned NW-SE Sally Free synform, and this fold in turn is decapitated
            by the Allatoona fault. Although previous studies suggested that the Hayesville-Soque
            River fault to the northwest postdated the Allatoona fault, the regional Jasper antiform
            folds the Great Smoky thrust, the Murphy synclinorium, the "ancestral Allatoona" fault,
            and the Hayesville-Soque River fault, but is decapitated by the Allatoona fault north
            of Dawsonville. Although the Canton and Univeter Formations of the Dahlonega Gold
            belt were displaced 10's of km northwest along the Allatoona fault and extend &gt;110
            km from type sections near Canton to at least Lake Burton, Georgia, previous interpretations
            have placed the Dahlonega Gold belt in the immediate footwall of the northwest-dipping
            Hayesville-Soque River fault, with the Allatoona fault apparently being cut by this
            fault approximately 12 km north of Dawsonville. Mapping efforts for this study, around
            the complex junction between the western, central, and eastern Blue Ridge provinces,
            have revealed new evidence that supports the continuation of the Allatoona fault north
            of this intersection.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>INTRODUCTION: Obesity is associated with increased cardiometabolic disease risk, although
            the vascular and metabolic features of obesity are often studied independently. Resistance
            to both insulin-mediated suppression of lipolysis and increases in microvascular blood
            flow are important risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases. Emerging evidence points
            to heightened NADPH oxidase (Nox) activity as a critical feature of reduced vascular
            and metabolic function. Overproduction of Nox-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS)
            is a major source of microvascular dysfunction in obesity and increased adipose tissue
            Nox activity is a main determinant of insulin resistance. In addition, Nox-derived
            ROS is an important component of increased lipolysis; however, the mechanisms by which
            Nox regulates lipolysis are unknown. In addition, the mechanistic basis for Nox in
            the intricate relationship between insulin control of vascular and metabolic responses
            is not well described. PURPOSE: The overall objective of this study was to investigate
            whether increased Nox-derived ROS production impairs blood glucose profiles by reducing
            insulin-mediated suppression of lipolysis. METHODS: Sixteen sedentary, non-obese,
            otherwise healthy males and females (males = 1, females = 15; age: 21.7 ± 5 years;
            body mass index: 22.7 ± 4 kg/m2) participated in this study. Participants completed
            three study visits, each after a ten-hour overnight fast. During the first study visit,
            anthropometric assessments were completed, as well as measurement of fasting blood
            glucose and blood pressure. During the second study visit, assessments of body composition
            (via dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, DXA) and maximal aerobic capacity (VO2peak)
            were completed. The final study visit was the main experimental visit, where participants
            underwent microdialysis and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic procedures to monitor local
            adipose tissue (total and Nox-dependent) ROS production and lipolysis (measured as
            dialysate glycerol) under basal as well as hyperinsulinemic conditions. Total dialysate
            H2O2 concentrations, including dismutated superoxide, were detected via perfusion
            of Amplex UltraRed reagent, horseradish peroxidase and superoxide dismutase through
            microdialysis probes. Further, microdialysis probes were perfused with either isoproterenol
            (β-adrenergic agonist) or atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) to stimulate lipolysis
            through independent signaling pathways, then additionally perfused with apocynin (Nox
            inhibitor) to determine the contributions of Nox to lipolysis. RESULTS: Upon perfusion
            of apocynin, the dialysate concentrations of H2O2 decreased in the control (without
            apocynin: 1.17 ± 0.5 M, with apocynin: 0.66 ± 0.2 M; p = 0.003) and isoproterenol
            probes (without apocynin: 1.09 ± 0.6 M, with apocynin: 0.68 ± 0.3 M; p = 0.03).
            Isoproterenol and ANP perfusion significantly increased dialysate glycerol concentrations
            compared to the control probe (control: 56.0 ± 21.9, isoproterenol: 125.6 ± 59.8,
            ANP: 130.9 ± 47.7 mol/L; p &lt; 0.0001). However, apocynin perfusion had no effect on
            dialysate glycerol concentrations in the control (p = 0.99), isoproterenol (p = 0.99)
            or ANP (p = 0.59) probes in the basal state. During the clamp, apocynin perfusion
            decreased dialysate H2O2 concentrations in control (without apocynin: 1.3 ± 0.6 M,
            with apocynin: 0.79 ± 0.3 M; p = 0.046), isoproterenol (without apocynin: 1.58 ±
            0.8 M, with apocynin: 0.83 ± 0.3 M; p = 0.02) and ANP (without apocynin: 1.60 ±
            0.60 M, with apocynin: 0.95 ± 0.3 M; p = 0.04) probes. Hyperinsulinemia decreased
            dialysate glycerol concentrations compared to the basal state (basal: 56.0  21.9
            mol/L, clamp: 32.8  20.2 mol/L; p = 0.02). In addition, dialysate glycerol concentrations
            decreased in the isoproterenol probe following apocynin perfusion during the clamp
            procedure (without apocynin: 126.1  38 mol/L, with apocynin: 91.9  25.7 mol/L;
            p = 0.002). Further, there was a correlation between basal adipose tissue lipolytic
            rates and Nox contributions to basal adipose tissue lipolysis (r = -0.66, p = 0.005),
            and individuals with lower insulin sensitivity (glucose disposal rate) tended to have
            high basal Nox-mediated ROS production (r = 0.56, p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: The novel
            findings of this study are that Nox is a stimulus of adipose tissue ROS production
            in healthy individuals, and this effect contributes to increases in adipose tissue
            lipolysis during hyperinsulinemic conditions. The mechanism by which Nox increases
            lipolysis involves β-adrenergic signaling and is independent of the ANP pathway. These
            data have important implications for individuals with insulin resistance and excess
            adiposity, as basal adipose tissue Nox activity was highest in individuals with lower
            insulin sensitivity and higher basal lipolytic rates, which may impair blood glucose
            regulation and vascular function. Overall, these study findings provide in vivo evidence
            of a novel regulator of adipose tissue lipolysis.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Physical pain is a gendered experience: Women report higher levels of it than do men.
            This pattern may stem from differences in experiences of the body. Women are socialized
            to be attentive to its functioning, appearance, and sensations, while men are discouraged
            from paying much attention to their bodies. Little is known, however, about the precise
            social and economic pathways leading to gender differences in pain, especially in
            middle and later life when pain is most prevalent. I examine this issue using data
            from two waves of Midlife in the United States (2004-2006 and 2013-2014). I consider
            four possible explanations for gender differences in reports of pain: economic security,
            health, relationship strain, and stress exposure. Results indicated that women are
            more likely than men to report experiencing chronic pain and that three out of four
            explanations contributed to explaining this gender difference. Two of the explanations,
            however, played more substantial roles than the others. These conclusions held in
            both the cross-sectional and panel analyses. Results indicated that women's worse
            physical and mental health and their lower economic security played the largest roles
            in accounting for the association between gender and pain. Women's greater relationship
            strain, particularly in their partner and family relationships, also contributed to
            the explanation, but its role was more limited. Stress exposure was the only potential
            mediator that failed to contribute to explaining the association between gender and
            pain. This result derived from the observation that men, rather than women, experienced
            greater exposure to stressful events. This research responds to the call for more
            sociological research on chronic pain (Wood and Bourke 2020). More specifically, it
            adds to the literature on gender and pain by clarifying the processes underlying this
            well-documented association. The results of this study point to the role of macro-level
            social factors, especially socioeconomic inequality, in generating women's greater
            experience of chronic pain. They also reveal the central role that is played by women's
            worse physical and mental health, which can be viewed as another consequence of socioeconomic
            inequality. These results have important implications not only for research on pain
            but also for interventions aimed at reducing gender disparities in pain. The processes
            revealed in this study could be further clarified by research that uses multiple waves
            of data to examine changes in pain as well as potential mediators over time.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The development of a clear vocational identity is a critical task for emerging adult
            undergraduates (Arnett, 2014). Ego psychology theorists (e.g., Marcia, 1993) argue
            that exploration contributes to the development of career commitment, and career commitment
            in the presence of career exploration constitutes one's vocational identity. Career
            courses are an evidence-based intervention provided at many colleges for the purpose
            of career development through structured career exploration (Reardon &amp; Fiore, 2014);
            however, no study of career courses has investigated whether career exploration mediates
            the effects of career course participation on career commitment. This dissertation
            addressed gaps in the literature and solidified connections between theories by comparing
            students enrolled in a manualized, theory-based college career course and a non-equivalent
            control group with multilevel modeling and autoregressive path analyses on measures
            of career exploration, career commitment, and metacognition to observe mediation and
            moderation effects. Participation in the career course was associated with significant
            growth in career exploration and career commitment relative to the control group.
            Career exploration was observed as a partial mediator of treatment effects. Negative
            career thoughts and career outcome metacognitions differentially moderated the direct
            and indirect effects of the treatment on career commitment. These findings are discussed
            at length, followed by review of study limitations and implications for theory, practice,
            and research.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The need for efficient, reliable, and environmentally friendly transportation is increasing
            rapidly as countries set target dates for achieving net zero carbon emissions. High
            Temperature Superconducting (HTS) cables have current densities up to 100 A/mm2, approximately
            ten times greater than conventional copper cables. This increases the power density
            of electrical systems that utilize HTS cables and can result in substantial size and

            with power system ratings ranging from 20 MW to 100 MW. Gaseous helium (GHe) is the
            preferred cryogen for (HTS) devices for transportation applications due to its wider

            (LN2). However, its lower dielectric strength compared to LN2 poses design challenges.
            A previous study found that GHe mixed with small mole percentages of hydrogen (H2)
            results in significant improvement of dielectric breakdown strength. The same level
            of improvement was not seen when measuring the partial discharge inception voltage
            (PDIV) of lapped tape insulated cables in the helium-hydrogen gas mixtures. A greater
            understanding on the electric field enhancement within the electrical insulation of
            the HTS cable was required to develop materials and approaches to increase the partial
            discharge rating of the cables. Partial discharge is one of the limiting factors when
            determining the voltage rating of a cable. The research presented in this thesis focuses
            on five prototype cables using cryogenic rated epoxies as electrical insulation. These
            cables were characterized at 77 K in both pure GHe and GHe mixed with small mol percentages
            of H2. The electric field of the cables were varied through the addition of stress
            cones, techniques used to apply the ground layer application, and the type of cryogenic
            epoxy used as electrical insulation. A summary of the conclusions drawn from this
            research is as follows: • The addition of 4 mol% of H2 to GHe led to an average increase
            in PDIV values of about 57% compared to PDIV measurements in pure GHe for pressure
            levels ranging from 0.5-2.0 MPa at 77 K. This improvement is a similar ratio to what
            has been observed with the intrinsic breakdown strength of GHe and He/H2 gas mixtures
            at cryogenic temperatures. • The addition of stress cones to an EP37 insulated cable
            resulted in an average increase in PDIV of 45% in pure GHe and 54% improvement in
            the 96% GHe 4% H2 mixture compared to an EP37 insulated cable without stress cones.
            Confirming that the addition of stress cones will limit field enhancement and improve
            PDIV results. • The use of conductive epoxy to form a direct ground connection on
            an EP37 insulated cable resulted in 64% improvement in pure GHe at 2 MPa compared
            to an EP 37 cable with a ground layer formed using semiconductive paper and copper
            tape. This indicated that the use of conductive epoxy instead of semiconductive paper
            limits the formation of butt gaps between the insulation and ground layers. • The
            EP29 insulated cable experienced PDIV values 47% and 45% higher than the corresponding
            EP37 insulated cable in 2MPa pure GHe and in 2 MPa GHe with 4 mol% H2 respectively.
            EP29 has a relative permittivity of 3.95 compared to that of EP 37 which is 4.4. EP29
            has a closer relative permittivity value to GHe (εr =1) which reduces the electric
            field enhancement at the triple point of the epoxy insulation, GHe, and ground layer.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Sandy beach ecosystems are important for many species for foraging, resting, and reproduction.
            Marine turtles are one species that use beaches for reproduction. Coastal areas are
            also attractive to humans as centers of commerce and recreation. Because of this,
            sandy coastlines are exposed to coastal development and anthropogenic modifications.
            While research has been done about the impacts of coastal development on species that
            rely on sandy beaches, little is understood about the cumulative impacts of coastal
            modifications. This dissertation investigated the temporal and spatial exposure of
            marine turtle nesting grounds in Florida to coastal modifications (Chapter 2) and
            examined the relative impact of each type of modification using expert elicitation
            (Chapter 3). Urban pocket beaches, or gaps between coastal armoring, were examined
            as potential nesting habitat (Chapter 4). Finally, a probabilistic model was developed
            to identify areas with high probability of nesting (Chapter 5) that can be applied
            to specific sites to inform management decisions regarding modifications such as beach
            nourishment or armoring. In Chapter 2, I examined the temporal (1985-2016) and spatial
            distribution of coastal construction permits as a proxy for coastal development. The
            cumulative number of permits throughout the state of Florida increased over time from
            less than 1,000 to over 4,000 permits issued per year. Over 93% of the 203 marine
            turtle nesting grounds examined throughout the state of Florida were exposed to cumulative
            coastal modifications. Of the high-density nesting beaches, twenty-six had high exposure
            to coastal modifications, highlighting the need for addressing the cumulative impacts
            of coastal modifications to nesting grounds. To understand the relative impacts of
            the different types of coastal modifications at marine turtle nesting grounds I developed
            a survey to elicit information from experts on the relative impacts of twelve modification
            types (Chapter 3). The survey utilized a pairwise comparison matrix that compared
            the impacts of each coastal modification activity. Beach armoring, light pollution,
            and other shoreline stabilization structures (groins and jetties) were weighted by
            experts as having the greatest impact while nonpermanent coastal modifications (e.g.
            special events and beach cleaning) were weighted by experts as having the lowest impact.
            This information can be used by managers to prioritize efforts and resources to manage
            marine turtle nesting grounds. On coastal areas with a high density of coastal armoring,
            small gaps remain between existing armoring (Chapter 4). These gaps have been given
            the term "urban pocket beaches" by managers, after a natural formation of small beaches
            between rocky uplands. It is unclear if urban pocket beaches can provide the same
            function as natural beaches or offer benefits (e.g. reduced risk of inundation) lost
            at nearby armored beaches. The linear extent of urban pocket beaches for Florida was
            identified and reproductive output was compared to adjacent armored beaches and nearby
            unarmored beaches. I also modeled differences in wave runup exposure at these beaches
            under current conditions (2016-2019) and future (2060) sea level rise scenarios. Urban
            pocket beaches account for less than 2% of Florida's nesting beaches with higher abundances
            on more armored shorelines. Nesting density of pocket beaches were similar to nearby
            beaches without armoring. However, female turtles were more likely to nest in urban
            pocket beaches compared to armored , and pocket beach nests had a higher hatching
            success. Our models suggest that exposure to wave runup varies by geographic location,
            but overall pocket beaches provided viable nesting habitat. General beach characteristics
            important for marine turtle nesting are known, but specific patterns that lead to
            nest site selection are less clear (Chapter 5). To identify variables that influence
            nest site selection I developed a model to determine how beach morphology can influence
            probability of nesting. Top models performed accurately over 83% of the time and incorporate
            multiple marine turtle species in one model. Elevation and distance to shoreline were
            the variables with the most influence on high probability nesting locations. Areas
            with a low probability of nesting were located close to the waterline and higher within
            the dunes while areas with high probability of nesting were located mid beach. This
            probabilistic model can be used with site specific information to inform management
            decisions (e.g. beach nourishment) at the local level. Marine turtles are exposed
            to high levels of coastal modifications in the state of Florida and this can impact
            their ability to effectively utilize their nesting habitat. While they may only be
            one group of organisms that utilize this habitat, their study can demonstrate how
            coastal modifications can be detrimental to natural sandy beach habitats and provides
            transferable frameworks to assess impacts.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Autumn of the Reaper King: Volume One is the first part of a trilogy that opens in
            the year 2101. Earth has warmed considerably. Deep droughts, harsher storms, and rising
            sea levels have forced U.S. cities to conserve water and construct flood barriers
            to hold back the rising oceans. Aiden Ainsley, who built and grew a company that found
            a way to profit from Earth's newfound challenges, now leads one of the largest private
            business empires in the world. But six months ago, the flood barriers Aiden's company
            built to protect the city of Miami crumbled under the impact of a hurricane. The city
            was lost. The federal government, along with nearly every private and corporate entity
            in the country, is now looking for ways to shut him down. Aiden, meanwhile, has another
            problem: a progressing Alzheimer's disease that even the most cutting-edge medicine
            can't seem to slow. Amid the fight for everything he's built, his son Junior, one
            of the world's most prolific and successful robotics engineers, invents a technology
            that could usher in a new era of humankind, and potentially save his father's life.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Permafrost is an area of ground which continually maintains temperatures below 0˚C
            and is found across arctic and sub-arctic regions, with 50% of the global soil carbon
            contained within permafrost storage banks (Trubl et al., 2016). In these high-latitude
            regions temperatures have risen 0.6˚C per decade over the last 30 years, a rise twice
            as fast as the global average (Schuur et al., 2015). The thawing of permafrost causes
            quantities of organic carbon to decompose via soil microbes, with permafrost regions
            containing twice as much carbon as currently resides in the atmosphere (Schuur et
            al., 2015). Permafrost thawing is common in Northern areas susceptible to environmental
            changes such as Stordalen mire, Sweden, where it is feared that the decomposition
            of permafrost could cause massive soil carbon degradation and the production of both
            methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) causing dramatic elevations in CH4 emissions
            and the weakening of the landscape's carbon sink functionality. When frozen permafrost
            palsa regions thaw they transition into regions with higher water tables including
            bogs and wet fens. With this transition, CO2 uptake may increase and CH4 emissions
            rise (Holmes et al., 2022; Varner et al., 2022), increasing warming potential across
            Northern areas like Stordalen and accelerating positive feedback loops driven by climate
            warming (McCalley et al., 2014). Centrally, the first objective of this research was
            to define the effect temperature increase has on greenhouse gas production (CH4 and
            CO2) due to anaerobic heterotrophic soil respiration across fen-type peatlands. For
            this study, anaerobic incubations of fen peat were conducted at temperatures ranging
            from 1℃ to 25℃ on two depths of peat, 9-19 cm and 28-35 cm. It was found that as temperatures
            increased both CH4 and CO2 production increased exponentially, with CH4 production
            exhibiting a Q10 of around 7 while anaerobic CO2 production had a Q10 of roughly 2.
            The second objective of this thesis was to scale these measurements of methane production
            versus temperature with measured field temperature data to determine the extent to
            which seasonal field-measured rates of methane emission can be predicted from modeled
            in situ methane production rates. These finding indicated that incubated peat reasonably
            represents (within a factor of 2) field measured methane emission rates, but misses
            the additional respiration of dissolved organic carbon released by living plants in
            the field.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The Gulf of Mexico is a hydrocarbon-rich region characterized by the presence of floating
            oil slicks from persistent natural hydrocarbon seeps, which are reliably captured
            by synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite imaging. Improving the state of knowledge
            of hydrocarbon seepage in the Gulf of Mexico improves the understanding and quantification
            of natural seepage rates in North America. We used data derived from SAR scenes collected
            over the Gulf of Mexico from 1978 to 2018 to locate oil slick origins (OSOs), cluster
            the OSOs into discrete seep zones, estimate the flux of individual seepage events,
            and calculate seep recurrence rates. In total, 1618 discrete seep zones were identified,
            primarily concentrated in the northern Gulf of Mexico within the Louann salt formation,
            with a secondary concentration in the Campeche region. The centerline method was used
            to estimate flux based on the drift length of the slick (centerline), the slick area,
            and average current and wind speeds. Flux estimates from the surface area of oil slicks
            varied geographically and temporally; on average, seep zones exhibited an 11% recurrence
            rate, suggesting possible intermittent discharge from natural seeps. The estimated
            average instantaneous flux for natural seeps is 9.8 mL s−1 (1.9 × 103 bbl yr−1 ),
            with an annual discharge of 1.73–6.69 × 105 bbl yr−1 (2.75–10.63 × 104 m3 yr−1 ) for
            the entire Gulf of Mexico. The temporal variability of average flux suggests a potential
            decrease following 1995; however, analysis of flux in four lease blocks indicates
            that flux has not changed substantially over time. It is unlikely that production
            activities in the Gulf of Mexico impact natural seepage on a human timescale. Of the
            1618 identified seep zones, 1401 are located within U.S. waters, with 70 identified
            as having flux and recurrence rates significantly higher than the average. Seep zones
            exhibiting high recurrence rates are more likely to be associated with positive seismic
            anomalies. Many of the methods developed for this study can be applied to SAR-detected
            oil slicks in other marine settings to better assess the magnitude of global hydrocarbon
            seepage.The new approach used to quantify flux oil fluxes from natural seafloor seepage
            sites in the Gulf of Mexico based on the dynamic characteristics of floating oil slicks
            is presented. It enables rapid analysis of interpreted satellite imagery and permits
            large datasets to be analyzed. The method uses the drift path of the oil on water
            surface, termed the "centerline" of the slick, along with average current and wind
            speeds to estimate the age of seepage slicks. The results of the CL (centerline) method
            compare favorably with the hindcast modeling approach which requires time-resolved
            analysis of wind and current for each slick. The CL method yields an average flux
            estimate within the range of the flux documented by on-bottom capture for a seafloor
            oil pollution source. A survey of published flux estimates using a variety of techniques
            reveals a wide range with on-bottom estimates (0.08–12 ml/s) generally lower than
            estimates from slicks (1.6–125 ml/s). Determination of fluxes from three seepage sites
            in the Gulf of Mexico (GC600, Bush Hill, and TYK) reveals a wide range in seepage
            rates from 2.4 to 52.9 ml/s and flux distributions. Comparison of the observed fluxes
            from seeps with potential fluxes from a source region can be used to constrain source
            rock parameters (e.g., thickness, richness, area) and to understand the cumulative
            oil supply represented by seeps over geologic time scales. Physical processes involved
            in the ascent of naturally seeped oil from the seafloor and its persistence as a slick
            are also considered. Simplified, physics-based models are developed, drawing in part
            from the extensive literature concerned with anthropogenic releases of oil at sea.
            The first model calculates the ascent of oil droplets or oil-coated gas bubbles as
            they ascend to the sea surface from the seep source. The second model calculates slick
            longevity as a function of the effect of wind-driven breaking waves. Both models have
            simplified inputs and algorithms making them suitable for Monte Carlo-type analysis.
            Using the oil ascent model, we find that slicks from shallower seeps are offset farther
            relative to their water depth than those from deeper sources. The slick longevity
            model reveals four growth modes for seepage slicks: persistent (low wind speeds),
            ephemeral (high wind speeds), reset (all slicks are cleared from an area by high wind
            speeds), and aging (slick growth after a reset). A year's worth of modeled winds from
            the Gulf of Mexico indicate average slick ages of ~ 12 hours. Taking account of the
            expected oil release duration implied by slick recurrences yields average slick longevities
            for high recurrence seeps of ~6.5 hours and ~ 5 hours for low recurrence seeps. Seep
            flux estimates that include the length of individual slicks and the constraints of
            local currents and wind implicitly take into account the impact of wind-speed history.
            Those that assume a slick age should be re-evaluated in light of the current findings.
            The approaches used to quantify natural seepage can be applied to anthropogenic oil
            slicks on the sea surface. Ship generated oil slicks (i.e. bilge dumping) are a chronic
            source of oil pollution to the global oceans. Anthropogenic inputs are the largest
            contributor to oil slicks in the global oceans, with approximately 20% generated by
            operational discharges of vessels. These slicks are generated by bilge dumping, the
            illegal discharge of untreated oily wastewater directly into the sea, in violation
            of international regulations (i.e., MARPOL). Bilge dump oil slicks are routinely detected
            in satellite imagery; however, responsible parties are not prosecuted due to lack
            of surveillance, uncertainty of extent of MARPOL violations, and difficulty tracing
            the origin of slicks back to the responsible vessel. This study analyzed 70 SAR satellite
            detected bilge dump oil slicks to estimate the oil concentration of the bilge water
            required to generate the observed slicks, as well as estimated persistence time of
            the slicks, as a function of wind speed. Bilge dump slick volumes were estimated assuming
            a range of slick thicknesses (0.04 – 1 μm) and compared to recommended bilge tank
            volumes for various ship sizes. In all slick thickness cases, for all bilge tank volumes,
            the observed bilge dump oil slicks were discharged from bilge tanks with oil concentrations
            that exceeded the 15 ppm MARPOL oil content limit by at least 3 orders of magnitude.
            Slicks generated at wind speeds less than 5.6 m/s were estimated to persist for over
            24 hours and those generated at higher wind speeds were estimated to persist for less
            than 16 hours. Persistence time was added to the deposition time of each slick, providing
            a time window to look back at automatic identification system (AIS) data to identify
            potential responsible parties. MARPOL regulations have been accepted international
            standards since the 1970s, but increased satellite surveillance and enforcement would
            improve its efficacy and the health of the marine environment.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>In the modern era, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have revolutionized diverse
            fields yet a deficiency in geographical education lingers in the U.S. educational
            system. This dissertation offers a thorough analysis of this gap, focusing on the
            potential of the GIS as an innovative solution for enriching geographical education.
            The Geospatial Semester program (GSS) is used as the case of this study, which is
            a novel educational model, is designed to provide hands-on GIS experience, enhance
            students' spatial thinking abilities, and improve real-world problem-solving skills.
            Despite facing challenges, such as complex GIS technicalities, the program maintains
            a flexible and innovative curriculum to counter these hurdles. This program emphasizes
            real-world applications and encourages independent learning experiences, thereby augmenting
            students' understanding of real-world geographical issues. This study delves into
            the experiences of teachers in the GSS program, highlighting the significant transition
            from traditional teaching methodologies to a project-based approach. This shift plays
            a crucial role in fostering active learning and nurturing problem-solving skills among
            students. Teachers from various disciplines contribute unique insights to the program,
            underscoring the versatility of GIS in cultivating a deep spatial understanding, improving
            students' problem-solving skills, and its potential to open doors to future college
            or career opportunities. The research findings highlight the urgent need and potential
            advantages of integrating GIS into U.S. high schools. While the GSS program may not
            be exclusively focused on geography, it serves as a distinctive model for geography
            education by providing students with the vital geographical skills to navigate the
            dynamic world of GIS. This paper emphasizes the importance of geography education
            and the significant role that GIS plays in its enhancement.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This dissertation responds to the dearth of research in responding practice of instructors
            teaching in college composition online writing classrooms, especially addressing both
            how they do it and how "care-fully." More specifically, the dissertation investigates
            the responding thoughts and behaviors of instructors teaching writing within the parameters
            of an asynchronous online format. Furthermore, the dissertation regards the instructors
            as carers and the students as cared-fors, exploring how teachers' responses to students
            (carer and cared-for) are marked by elements of care-fullness. These elements include
            engrossment (empathy [thinking + feeling] + receptive attention), motivational displacement
            (the impulse to focus on and contribute to the resolution of students' challenges),
            and reciprocity (the desire for dialogic exchange between carer and cared-for). There
            has been ample research establishing the increased frequency of online writing instruction
            and its rising prevalence especially during COVID-19. In the wake of the move from
            face-to-face teaching to online teaching, the need to explore instructors' responding
            protocols are also increasing. While response to students' writing has been a staple
            in composition studies for more than six decades, little research has focused specifically
            on fully online situations, particularly those with an asynchronous approach. Furthermore,
            while care in the context of elementary and middle-school has been researched before,
            no such research focuses on the asynchronous online situation. This dissertation brings
            together these disparate elements into a meticulously structured intellectual confluence.
            In brief, this dissertation examines the following questions through the case studies
            of two instructors teaching the asynchronous online iteration of a sophomore-level
            college composition course, mandatory to all undergraduate students at Florida State
            University, namely, ENC 2135 (Research, Genre, and Context). The research questions
            the dissertation answers are: 1) How do teachers of online writing instruction describe
            their response protocols and goals? How, if at all, does "care-fullness" emerge within
            those descriptions? 2) How do teachers of online writing instruction respond to student
            papers? How, where, and when, if at all, does "care-fullness" emerge within those
            response behaviors? 3) What role, if any, does the medium of response play in teacher
            of online writing instruction response? How, if at all, does medium affect care-fullness?
            To find answers to these questions, the data corpus consisting of the instructors'
            response philosophies and textual comments, along with transcripts of audiovisual
            conferences and retrospective protocols were collected, coded, and interpretated through
            observation, transcription, color classification, and tabulation. The coding of the
            data happened on two levels. The descriptive coding focused on answering the questions:
            what, who, when, where, why, and how. Likewise, the "care-fullness" coding focused
            on the occurrences of the elements of the "care-fullness" triad, i.e., engrossment,
            motivational displacement, and reciprocity. The results showed that, first, there
            is negligible difference in the textual responses of college composition courses taught
            face-to-face and those taught asynchronously online. The instructors had numerous
            marginal comments and end comments across the drafts that helped students polish their
            projects. In addition to the format of responding that follows a series of comments
            at different locations on and across drafts, the similarity between online instruction
            and face-to-face instruction also lies in employing Canvas as the Learning Management
            System (LMS) through which textual responses are shared periodically. Second, the
            only domain of response that shows a departure from the responding practices of face-to-face
            college composition course is the mode of teacher-student conference, conducted via
            Zoom. This is significant because while it provides the immediacy in conversation
            which imitates a real-world in-person meeting, it is still happening through virtual
            channels. As a result, it consists of computer screens and Zoom elements like screen
            sharing. Third, the project shows that "care-fullness" can be performed in diverse
            ways. As derived from the first case study, balance is a key to care-full responding
            practices. Diego, the nurturing coach, maintains a delicate balance between personability
            and professionalism as he ensures that the conversation between him and his students
            flows smoothly through different mediums of responses. Likewise, the second case demonstrates
            the harmful effects of cultural forces at play informing the gendered expectations
            of care that migrate from face-to-face classrooms to online instructional platforms.
            Samantha, the pragmatic teacher, underscores the invisible labor demands of carework
            based on gendered perceptions of online writing instructors that if left unmonitored,
            may contribute to instructors' burnout. Finally, the project deems "care-fullness"
            as a necessary factor in all educational environments, but especially so in asynchronous
            online classes because it is an immensely powerful way to ascertain human presence,
            establish emotional and intellectual interactions, and intensify human community bonds
            in a technologically mediated instructional space.  </p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>With the advent of tremendous and complex data sets, the accessibility of data has
            become easier than before. Data integration thus became a popular method to deal with
            multi-source data. Identifying a dynamic association among multi-modal data is practical
            in an explanatory data analysis (EDA) step. In this dissertation, we introduce statistical
            methods to tackle the issues in integrative analysis: blockwise missing imputation
            on the multi-modal data and dynamic association analysis. We elaborate on the approaches
            in the following chapters. First, we proposed a new envelope blockwise imputation
            (EBI) framework to address blockwise missing data in multiview data integration. Blockwise
            missing imputation is often needed as a preprocessing step for data integration. We
            develop a simultaneous envelope-based method that takes advantage of canonical correlations
            of different data sets to impute multiple missing blocks. The method effectively estimates
            canonical subspaces by fitting a regression model with congregating envelope subspaces,
            reducing the number of parameters in both predictors and responses. As a by-product,
            the envelope blockwise imputation method also obtains a more accurate estimate of
            the canonical correlations than the standard canonical correlation analysis (CCA).
            We devised an expectation conditional maximization (ECM) algorithm to estimate the
            envelope parameters. Next, we introduced a conditional cross-covariance reduction
            (CCR) model to study the dynamic association of two sets of random variables with
            a conditioned random variable. Sex dimorphism is crucial in various research fields,
            such as biomechanics and bioengineering. The difference in sex helps us understand
            certain musculoskeletal diseases, such as temporomandibular disorders (TMD). Especially,
            identifying an association between skull and temporomandibular joint muscles is essential
            to verify the sex difference in TMD. We collect data from 10 male and 11 female cadaver
            heads to study the dynamic associations between skull and muscle. The model identifies
            the most contrastive relationship between sex by selecting significant variables in
            skull measurement and temporomandibular joint muscle attachment. We apply a singular
            value decomposition-type algorithm via sparsity. In the analysis of the human cadaver
            data, we also introduce a permutation testing procedure to determine the number of
            variables selected. Finally, we briefly studied a basis spline transformation method
            to linearize the multivariate response and predictor under envelope assumptions. By
            incorporating the envelope parameters to the basis spline transformation, we numerically
            see that the correlation coefficients of response and predictor are leveraged.</p>

            this study is concerned with the royalties that songwriters (aka composers) and performers
            (aka recording artists) receive through the U.S. statutory regimen employed by the
            CRB. This issue is significant given the changes within musical product "delivery"
            attributable to the rise of digital phonorecord delivery services and webcasters in
            the wake of the file sharing phenomenon that began in the late 1990s. The concept
            of "the public interest," operationalized here as facilitating the music industry's
            ability to provide quality music to the citizenry, is given special consideration.
            Using an Historical Institutional (HI) perspective, witness testimony and the final
            determinations of the CRB during two distinct "rate- setting" periods are examined
            within qualitative content analysis (QCA) to determine the predominant arguments made
            by the various stakeholders involved in the proceedings. Next, the patterns and details
            of the arguments found during the QCA are further analyzed to determine the rationale
            various stakeholders use in trying to prove the veracity of their positions in an
            effort to persuade the CRB judges to rule in a particular way. Given the legal redactions
            present in the public versions of testimony to safeguard proprietary information,
            an economic analysis is not used. Rather, the focus of this study is on the rationale
            of the arguments forwarded by various stakeholders, consideration of the public interest
            within stakeholder testimony, and the institutional execution of the CRB relative
            to its legally codified mission in considering the arguments from the stakeholders
            and in applying the law. The results show that the CRB focuses more on stakeholder
            arguments than the law, that it tends to favor "more powerful" stakeholders, that
            it gives short shrift to any conception of "the public interest," and --from an HI
            perspective-- tends to follow a path that is in contrast to it statutory mission.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Mental health is not a new topic in the realm of sport. Despite the fact that the
            number of student athletes speaking out about the struggles has increased, the National
            Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) has yet to codify regulations that might curb
            the problem. The governing body has disseminated supplemental materials on student
            athlete mental health which have assisted in establishing an institutional logic that
            is upheld and perpetuated by NCAA member organizations. Further, within the NCAA,
            football is one of the top financial leaders, but also attributes to some of the highest
            concussion rates among student athletes. In addition, with the proven connection between
            concussions and short- and long-term mental health concerns, it is imperative that
            the NCAA adopts formal regulations to protect student athletes' mental health due
            to moral, legal, and financial reasons.For this dissertation, I will be conducting
            three separate, but cohesive, studies. First, I will be using legal doctrinal research
            to establish the duty of care owed to student athletes by coaches in terms of mental
            health. Through the study, I will also seek to illustrate the legal aspect of how
            not only coaches, but their employing organizations, and even the NCAA, may be held
            vicariously liable for actions, or inactions, surrounding student athlete mental health.
            Next, I will conduct a content analysis of current football head coach employment
            contracts at the NCAA Division I level. This will be used to show how, or if, individual
            NCAA member organizations address student athlete mental health within the legal employment
            contracts of their coaches. Finally, I will conduct a case study on the historical
            contracts of football head coaches at one prominent NCAA member university (i.e.,
            Florida State University). This study will show the evolution of how student athlete
            mental health has been addressed in head coach contracts over time and as the NCAA
            has released more materials on the topic. The findings of this study have the potential
            to influence the NCAA, or its member organizations, to obligate coaches to report
            student athlete mental health concerns, which in turn, could prevent tragic outcomes.
            Further, these articles will be used to emphasize the potential role of coaches as
            reporters, not practitioners, due to the unique relationship they have with their
            student athletes. Coaches should never be responsible for treating student athletes
            mental health issues but should be able to identify the symptoms associated with this
            status and refer the effected athlete(s) to the proper channels. Finally, by conducting
            these three studies, I hope to show how beneficial student mental health regulations
            will be for all actors involved, including the athletes themselves, their coaches,
            athletic department, and university staff, and even the NCAA as a league. Enforcing
            policy related to student athlete mental health, specifically within coach employment
            contracts, could potentially reduce the member organizations', and by proxy the NCAA's,
            chances of being held vicariously liable. Further, when coaches uphold this stipulation
            within their contractual, their chances of being held negligent for student athlete
            mental health concerns may also be reduced. Finally, although the NCAA and its member
            organizations should just 'care' about student athletes, by including contractual
            stipulations and policy for coaches, the student athletes may have a better chance
            of receiving care and treatment for potential mental health concerns.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Epithelial tissues rely on the activity of stem cells to sustain their structure and
            proper functioning. These stem cells are responsible for generating various types
            of cells, that are essential for the tissue's normal homeostasis, through division
            and differentiation. In order to ensure precise control over stem cell behavior and
            the decisions they make regarding cell fate, constant communication through a network
            of signaling pathways between different cell types is necessary.This delicate network
            of cell-cell interactions however is frequently disrupted in the face of cancer and
            the development of tumorigenesis. However, the mechanisms by which these interactions
            are broken and often co-opted to support tumor growth in different genetic contexts
            are not yet well understood. To shed light on this phenomenon, we have developed several
            genetically complex colorectal models utilizing a novel genetic platform named PromoterSwitch.
            PromoterSwitch allows us to generate large, transformed clones from a small subset
            of individual adult Drosophila intestinal stem and progenitor cells. By utilizing
            this platform, we have discovered that genetic alterations commonly found in colon
            tumors can interfere with the normal process of cell fate determination within the
            transformed tissue and in neighboring wildtype cells. Furthermore, our research has
            revealed that transformed enteroendocrine cells, which are a specialized lineage of
            intestinal hormone-secreting cells, play a crucial role in supporting tumor growth
            via the regulation of the proliferation of intestinal stem cells through multiple
            mechanisms that depend on the specific genetic background of the clone. These findings
            suggest potential vulnerabilities that could be targeted for therapeutic purposes
            such as enteroendocrine cell differentiation and the hormone Tk, which results showed
            plays a pivotal role in driving intestinal tumorigenesis. The findings of our work
            emphasize the importance of developing and investigating disease models that faithfully
            recapitulate the intricate genetic landscapes observed in human cancer patients in
            the context of an otherwise healthy epithelial tissue to precisely mimic the initiation
            and progression of the disease in humans. Our research also showcases the remarkable
            capacity of Drosophila as a robust model organism for studying genetically complex
            diseases in a sophisticated manner. By leveraging the close homology and conservation
            of epithelial tissue and disease-relevant genes and pathways, Drosophila offers unique
            opportunities to make groundbreaking discoveries with direct implications for human
            diseases. Overall, our study demonstrates that disruptions in cell fate decisions
            and the exploitation of enteroendocrine cells are key factors in tumor growth providing
            a deeper understanding on the cellular heterogeneity and plasticity observed in the
            disease that could pave the way for the development of new therapeutic strategies
            aimed at exploiting these mechanisms for effective colorectal cancer treatment.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Natural disasters in Florida threaten the millions of people who live there. Storm
            in the most frequent natural disaster that leaves behind unimaginable levels of devastation.
            Hurricanes are created over warm waters by tropical disturbances and when strong enough,
            they can travel at a speed of more than 155 mph. Many structures run at the risk of
            total failure of the structure due to the force of winds and storms. The building
            and engineering sectors are important participants in reducing risks and restoring
            the essential infrastructural goods many are accustomed to, even if numerous programs
            and methods exist to return normalcy to inhabitants after a disaster.The major objective
            of this thesis is to present techniques for construction alleviation against hurricane
            wind loading to increase the resilience of residential construction in Florida. This
            thesis is divided into two main goals in order to achieve the results aimed. The first
            step is to examine the problems caused by hurricane wind loading on residential structures,
            the construction advice that can be used to get older buildings ready for this natural
            disaster, and the associated expenses. The second objective of this thesis is to determine
            how, if the primary residential structure breaks during a storm, a cost-effective
            safe room can be built to safeguard the occupants. The initial objective of this investigation
            is to identify structural weaknesses by reviewing the research. Since the structures
            are composed of various components, it is crucial to identify which ones require attention.
            The design pressures and forces can then be investigated to find the best building
            suggestions by calculating the wind loading pressures of the various structures. An
            engineer's judgment on the likely cost can be generated after the construction recommendations
            for various types of structures have been established to educate the stakeholder of
            the recommendation's cost. In short, this study aims to ensure that the rooms are
            risk-free and cost-effective while also being resistant to hurricane wind loads.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Supercritical Carbon Dioxide is of interest in a wide range of engineering problems,
            including carbon capture, utilization, and storage as well as advanced cycles for
            power generation. Non-ideal varia- tions in physical properties of supercritical Carbon
            Dioxide impact the physics of these systems. It is important to understand how drastic
            changes in thermodynamic properties influence these flow physics in order to aid in
            and optimize the design of future technologies related to carbon capture and sequestration.
            In this study, we simulate turbulent supercritical Carbon Dioxide jets to gain a better
            understanding of these physics. Of particular interest is the impact of pseudo-boiling
            on supercritical flow dynamics. We use a second order finite volume method with adaptive
            mesh re- finement as implemented in the reacting flow solver, PeleC, to perform a
            Large Eddy Simulation of three turbulent jets of supercritical Carbon Dioxide. Additionally,
            we use the Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation of state to close the system and more accurately
            incorporate the departure from ideal gas behavior into the turbulent flow physics.
            We look at a variety of quantities of interest, including but not limited to axial
            velocity decay and spread, resolved Reynolds stress profiles at different down- stream
            locations, and resolved turbulent kinetic energy along the axial direction of the
            flow. Across the three cases, the only parameters that vary are the temperature and
            density of the ambient fluid. One case is isothermal, where the jet and ambient fluid
            temperature are the same, while the other two cases are non-isothermal, with one involving
            injection crossing over the pseudo-boiling point and one with injection moving away
            from the pseudo-boiling point. Results are contrasted with established theory for
            ideal gas jets and similar numerical studies involving transcritical injection in
            order to capture the effects of widely varying thermal properties in the pseudo-critical
            region. We found that the isothermal supercritical jet exhibits many similar flow
            characteristics compared to ideal gas round turbulent jets, with minor differences
            seen in the decay and spreading rate of the jet and in a noticeable anisotropy between
            resolved turbulent kinetic energy components. The non-isothermal jet excluding the
            pseudo-boiling point exhibits only small difference compared to the isothermal case.
            The non-isothermal case involving the pseudo-boiling point displays markedly dif-
            ferent behavior, with evidence indicative of increased Kelvin-Helmholtz-like instabilities
            and much faster jet decay and disintegration. These factors impact the degree of mixing
            in the transition region of the jet, leading to finer-scale vortices and faster transition
            to ambient properties.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>There is a growing demand for technology that can sense people and objects without
            imposing excessive overhead. Traditional solutions usually require people to wear
            additional devices on their bodies and install cumbersome sensors on objects. The
            prevalence of wireless signals and wireless devices provides us with the opportunity
            to sense both the human and physical environment. This dissertation showcases how
            we can leverage wireless signals to sense people and objects without the need for
            physical contact with their bodies or the objects themselves. To this end, we propose
            three commodity WiFi-based sensing systems: GoPose, 3D-ID, and LiquidSense, towards
            smart wireless sensing. Specifically, we first present GoPose, a 3D skeleton-based
            human pose estimation system that reuses WiFi devices in a home environment. It works
            for unseen activities even when the user is moving around, offering on-the-go pose
            tracking for previously unseen activities. Second, we propose a WiFi vision-based
            system, 3D-ID, for person re-identification in 3D space. Our system leverages the
            advances of WiFi and deep learning to help WiFi devices ``see", identify, and recognize
            people. Finally, we introduce LiquidSense, a new approach to sensing the liquid level
            that is low-cost, high accuracy, widely applicable to different daily liquid containers,
            and can be easily integrated with existing home networks without additional cost.
            These sensing systems demonstrate that wireless signals can be utilized to effectively
            sense both the human body and objects.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Black queer, transgender, and nonbinary (BQTN) people are among the most vulnerable
            populations in the United States due to structural racialized and gender discrimination
            (Clifton, 2021). In the United States, civil and human rights protections for lesbian,
            gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, asexual, and intersex (LGBTQAI+) people have historically
            been politically and culturally contested within sport and physical culture studies.
            As a bodyworker and insider to the queer and trans community, I am choosing to use
            oral history interviews to explore the liberatory bodywork spaces created by and for
            BQTN bodyworkers in the Southeastern United States. Liberatory bodywork is an expression
            of various modalities of physical and/or energetic techniques working with the human
            body for individual and collective transformation and freedom praxis. Liberatory bodywork
            recognizes the ongoing anti-Black violence and colonialism on our physical beings.
            Through liberatory bodywork, physical activity, and embodied movement is practiced
            and taught with an explicit recognition and reverence for the land, participants lived
            experiences, and personal and collective commitments to freedom. Moreover, liberatory
            bodywork invites scholars and community members into integrative approaches to understanding
            human and non-human relations as emancipatory sites and interventions into the ongoing
            harm of structural oppression. Though gender identity is not documented in the U.S.
            Census, the estimated population size of transgender individuals has been collected
            through national population surveys and has significantly increased over the last
            decade (Meerwijk &amp; Sevellius, 2017). In 2016, the Williams Institute estimated that
            1.4 million adults identify as transgender, and more recently in 2021, more than 1.2
            million LGBTQ adults identify as nonbinary. Yet, in June 2021, the United States introduced
            (over thirty states to date) record-breaking anti-transgender legislation, focused
            specifically on eliminating sport participation and gender-affirming healthcare for
            transgender and nonbinary people (Mosier, 2022). In response to the state's discriminatory
            measures, individuals and groups at the local, state-wide, and national levels have
            organized in the fight for transgender rights, affirming healthcare, and sports participation.
            Federal and state anti-transgender sport and healthcare legislative policies are predicated
            on the structural erasure of transgender people resulting from Western colonial constructs
            such as gender, race, and sexual orientation hierarchies (Carrington &amp; McDonald 2009;
            Travers, 2008; White et al. 1995). These value systems permeate institutional practices
            that reproduce regulatory policies regarding sex, gender identity, and expression
            by categorizing their cultural acceptability exclusively on a binary basis (Travers,
            2008). Further, such laws and regulations become an impetus for further material conditions
            and symbolic violence that decrease and severely restrict access to basic resources
            such as housing, healthcare, employment, education, sport, and recreation, to name
            some (Johnson et al., 2020). The deliberate practice of systemic oppression compounds
            historical and generational traumas endangering the livelihood and well-being of BQTN
            people. Such corporealized harm is somaticized and lives inside of physical material
            bodies, contributing to the shortening of BQTN people's lives. The immense amount
            of stress caused by the struggle to simply survive is a great barrier to health and
            vitality. Consequently, BQTN communities need resources that contribute to both understanding
            and addressing the oppressive conditions that restrain access to embodied healing
            resources, which can alleviate individual and collective harm. Accordingly, this dissertation
            explores the ways that BQTN bodyworkers in the Southeastern United States navigate
            sport and physical cultural spaces, in turn, by generating ontological spaces of liberatory
            bodywork and resisting normative (and oppressive) practices of bodywork. Throughout
            this process, I draw from the Sankofa tradition, politically engaged sport sociology,
            and physical cultural studies (PCS) literature. My research study is important because
            BQTN people have been strategically and systemically disembodied by governmental policies,
            public discourse, everyday practices, and incomprehensible violence. Further, the
            dominant hegemonic culture in institutionalized sporting spaces compounds this harm.
            Consequently, this dissertation confronts racialized and gendered discrimination that
            leads to the erasure of BQTN people. Despite the social reproduction of power relations
            that erase BQTN people, we still exist and in particular claim our existence within
            sport and physical culture. These liberatory and life-affirming bodywork communities
            do exist and play an important part in BQTN's struggles for body autonomy and self-determination.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The 6.8 billion base pairs of human DNA must be packaged into chromatin to fit into
            the nucleus. The nucleosome, approximately 150 bp of genomic DNA wrapped 1.65 times
            around the histone octamer, is the fundamental unit of chromatin. While this organization
            likely evolved for packaging, it has been co-opted for regulatory processes. All cells
            undergo DNA-templated processes such as transcription, recombination, replication,
            and DNA damage repair. Therefore, the nucleosome architecture must be remodeled to
            provide access to the underlying genome. Assessment of nucleosomal dynamics in response
            to certain stimuli reveals the genomic loci that play a role in response to that stimulus.
            Classically nucleosomal dynamics are assessed by MNase mapping of nucleosome occupancy.
            MNase digests the internucleosomal linker DNA leaving only nucleosomally protected
            DNA. Sequencing nucleosomally protected fragments and mapping their genomic location
            suggests nucleosome locations. One longstanding expectation has been that nucleosome
            occupancy should be fundamentally different in cell types with different physiologies.
            Surprisingly, our lab has discovered that disparate cell lines have fundamentally
            similar basal nucleosome occupancy. We showed that nucleosome occupancy changes only
            transiently in response to a stimulus returning to basal positions on a timeframe
            commensurate with the response. The transient nature of these occupancy changes shifted
            the perspective on studies of chromatin structure and suggested that future studies
            of nucleosome occupancy dynamics should include high-resolution temporal analysis.
            More recently, we demonstrated that nucleosomes in their basal positions differ in
            their sensitivity to MNase, with some locations readily digested with relatively low
            concentrations of MNase, and others requiring higher concentrations of MNase to be
            digested. The works presented here used these two analyses, occupancy, and sensitivity,
            to identify distinctly different features of the functional genome. The present research
            focused on two disease models using a model of the Kaposi sarcoma herpes virus (KSHV)
            reactivation and an immortalized cell line from a Cockayne syndrome patient. For each
            of these models, we have identified transient changes in nucleosome occupancy with
            temporally resolved MNase mapping. Additionally, we have identified longer-lasting
            nucleosomal changes with MNase sensitivity. KSHV is a gamma herpes virus that is responsible
            for the oncogenic transformation of infected cells. We used an inducible system to
            reactivate KSHV, which simulates the lytic cycle of the virus life cycle and is eventually
            responsible for oncogenic transformation. We measured nucleosome occupancy at 0, 12,
            24, 36, and 48 hours after reactivation. We observed changes in nucleosome occupancy
            at the -1 nucleosome at loci important for viral reactivation and oncogenic transformation,
            such as the AKT2, PRCC, and CDC6 genes. These loci are enriched for MAZ, PATZ1, WT1,
            KLF15, EGR2, E2F, and PBX3 transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). These TFBS are
            consistent with responses regulating cell growth, proliferation, and oncogenesis.
            Our nucleosome sensitivity studies revealed persistent changes at loci important in
            nuclear transport, signal transduction, and oncogenesis, including TPR and TRAF6.
            We identified TFBS for factors that regulate oncogenesis, including WT1, MAZ, KLF12,
            PATZ2, and E2E4. We conclude that occupancy and sensitivity studies provide distinct
            and biologically important aspects of the functional genome. Cockayne syndrome B is
            a progressive autosomal recessive developmental disorder resulting from mutations
            in the CSB protein. CSB plays multifaceted cellular functions. CSB plays a role in
            chromatin remodeling, transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER), and
            oxidative DNA damage repair. We measured nucleosome occupancy in a CSBnull cell line
            and a CSBWT cell line. We observed changes in nucleosome occupancy at the -1 position
            in genes that contribute to the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction and hippo
            signaling pathways. These loci are important in neurological development and organ
            size development, two important aspects of Cockayne syndrome B. We also observed that
            these loci are enriched for TFBS that have a role in DNA damage response, DNA repair,
            and development. Our nucleosome sensitivity studies revealed changes at loci, including
            NEIL2, which is important in base-excision pathways. Interestingly we identified different
            classes of TFBS in the sensitivity analysis. These TFBS included ZIC2, ZIC3, TBX1,
            and TBX15 and are involved in neurogenesis, bone, and cartilage formation. We conclude
            that occupancy and sensitivity studies provide distinct and biologically important
            aspects of the functional genome. In conclusion, we surmise that nucleosome occupancy
            and sensitivity can detect two levels of change in nucleosome architecture. Nucleosome
            occupancy changes are transient and happen in disease-specific genes and global genes,
            which are common to other genes. Nucleosomes with changes in sensitivity to MNase
            represent more persistent changes and occur in the genes which are more disease-specific.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Background: As the coronavirus disease continues to spread around the world, millions
            are being impacted by societal changes and social distancing. When the majority of
            educational institutions closed campuses, college students were left vulnerable to
            developing difficulties as they were forced to adjust to these changes. They are already
            particularly vulnerable to sleep difficulties, which will increase further for those
            with other mental health problems.Hypothesis: Following school closure, college students
            will display an increase in sleep difficulties across sleep onset latency, subjective
            sleep quality, sleep quantity, daytime dysfunction, and disturbing dreams. This relationship
            will be strengthened in those who experience greater levels of stress, ruminative
            thinking patterns, or depressive symptoms. Changes to amount of light exposure due
            to increased screen use will account for a proportion of these difficulties. Methods:
            Secondary data analysis was done using self-report questionnaires administered across
            four time points, and a fifth time point was collected to further expand the data.
            Multiple regression analyses evaluated the hypotheses across the 100 individuals (mean
            age=19.45, 85% female) who completed measures both pre- and post- school closure.
            Repeated measures regression analysis was utilized across the 1201 individuals (mean
            age=19.43, 76.7% female) who completed measures solely during a single time point.
            Results: There was a significant decrease in sleep quality when looking across all
            five time points (F(1,1199)=12.49, p&lt;.001), although sleep quality initially did not
            change from pre-pandemic to the first time point. Worry about COVID-19 was the primary
            mediator of worsened sleep quality across studies (F(1,94)=4.66, p=.033 and F(1,370)=48.64,
            p&lt;.001 respectively), although mental health difficulties were not consistent moderators.
            Screen use changes was only significant within study two (F(1,518)=357.58, p&lt;.001).
            Conclusion: These findings help further explain the consequences of COVID-19 stay-at-home
            orders upon college students. Sleep quality worsened as the pandemic and social distancing
            measures continued. Those who viewed the pandemic as more of a threat and experienced
            more worry about it in particular were vulnerable to developing sleep problems, particularly
            if they were engaging in more social distancing measures. Additionally increased screen
            use, particularly in relation to having virtual classes, decreased sleep quality.
            Beyond the role of light exposure and mental health difficulties, beliefs about COVID-19
            were a primary determinant of sleep quality changes in college students.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The rising number of students with disabilities who identify as culturally and linguistically
            diverse (CLD) necessitates the use of culturally and linguistically responsive (CLR)
            instruction and related supports. Fourteen percent of English learners (ELs) have
            a disability (with disability as defined by Individual with Disabilities Education
            Act (IDEA). School-based speech-language pathologists (SLPs) often support the communication
            needs of these students, especially for those students who are eligible for special
            education and related services as students with a speech or language impairment (S/LI).
            Characteristics of CLR practices may be reflected in a student's individualized education
            program (IEP). However, there is little prior research describing CLR considerations
            for this population in a school setting. A total of 40 individuals from 14 states,
            completed an online, 22-item survey to reflect their use of CLR practices in existing
            IEPs for ELs with speech or language impairments. Participants also rated how often
            they use various CLR features in therapy and assessments with students who are ELs.
            Respondents varied greatly in their use of CLR features within an IEP of EL child
            with a S/LI. Participants reported that they never provide materials/progress notes
            in the child's first language and never refer to use of child's first language within
            the IEP. In contrast, approximately half of respondents reported that they always
            engage in culturally relevant practices in therapy. Additionally, most SLPs reported
            that they always or sometimes collaborate with other professionals in the school setting.
            Participants indicated that they sometimes use CLR features in goals they write within
            an IEP for a child who is an EL. The present study provides unique insight on school-based
            SLPs' use of CLR practices. This offers implications for future training (i.e., ASHA
            seminars or school courses) and development of IEPs concerning the incorporation of
            CLR features and practices for children who are EL.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This thesis is devoted to the study of magnetic properties of strongly correlated
            quantum matters in one and two dimensions. The study employs predominantly numerical
            techniques, such as Exact Diagonalization (ED), Finite Temperature Lanczos (FTLM),
            and Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG), complemented by semi-analytical approaches.
            In the absence of exact solutions or controlled analytic approximations, numerical
            methods have profoundly impacted our understanding of complex many-body problems.
            Utilizing these numerical tools for investigating the ground state and finite temperature
            properties of quantum magnets, as well as understanding their non-equilibrium dynamics
            in cold-atom quench experiments, comprise the two major themes of this thesis. The
            first part of this thesis, comprising Chapters~\ref{ch3}-\ref{ch5}, discusses the
            ground state properties, elementary excitations, and finite temperature behavior of
            various magnetic systems motivated by recent experimental observations.Elementary
            excitations often play a vital role in understanding the ground state and the finite
            temperature properties. Chapter~\ref{ch3} focuses on the significance of multimagnon
            (quasiparticle) interactions and their connection to finite temperature terahertz
            optical experiments on a ferromagnetic (FM) spin-$1$ quasi-1D compound. Chapters~\ref{ch4}
            and \ref{ch5} jointly contribute to our understanding of magnetism in undoped and
            doped Mott insulators in magnetically frustrated systems. Chapter~\ref{ch4} discusses
            ``two coloring" and ``three coloring" exact ground state solutions of the 2D XXZ magnets
            at special points in bipartite (square) and tripartite (triangular) lattices. It further
            emphasizes the influence of these exactly solvable points on the other parameter space
            of this model away from the solvable points, which we explore using ED and large-scale
            DMRG simulations. In Chapter~\ref{ch5}, our focus shifts to investigating the mechanism
            of kinetic frustration in the moi\'re bilayer WSe$_2/$WS$_2$ compound, prompted by
            the intriguing observation of an increase in the Curie-Weiss temperatures as the density
            decreases below half-filling. While a definitive model for the bilayer system remains
            elusive, we employ both the Hubbard and $t-J$ models to shed light on their distinct
            magnetic properties across low, intermediate, and high temperatures. Underlying zero
            temperature phase transitions are analyzed using large-scale DMRG simulations, providing
            experimentally consistent results. The second part of this thesis, comprising Chapter~\ref{ch6},
            explores a new frontier in condensed matter systems, specifically the non-equilibrium
            dynamics of isolated quantum magnets, well-suited for cold-atom experiments in one
            dimension. We explain the thermalization process in a generic isolated quantum system
            without a heat reservoir, drawing upon the Eigen State Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH).
            Focusing on the Quantum Many-Body Scars (QMBS), the states weakly violating ETH, we
            study the real-time dynamics of two different quantum spin models. We first analyzed
            the thermalization of various initial multimagnon states in the FM Heisenberg spin-$1$
            chain, leveraging prior insights on multimagnon bound state formation due to onsite
            anisotropy ($D$). Both thermal and athermal behaviors akin to those reported for QMBS
            are observed depending on initial conditions, which we explain with an analytic approximation
            that is accurate in the limit of dilute magnon density and small $D$. Secondly, the
            resilience of quantum scars in a bond-staggered Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain under a
            periodic local drive is investigated. Instances are found where the driven spin collectively
            thermalizes or fails to thermalize with the remaining spins, contingent upon the frequency
            and strength of the drive.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Characterizations of habitat use and ecological connectivity are essential components
            of a complete ecological understanding of any organism. Habitat use may be broadly
            defined as the behaviors that an animal exhibits in any scenopoetic context, while
            ecological connectivity comprises the multitude processes, whether spatial, geochemical,
            or genetic, that connect geographically discrete populations or assemblages. Such
            efforts are particularly important for imperiled, highly migratory species, which
            are typically comprised of reduced populations that exist in anthropogenically-reduced
            scenopoetic contexts. These species often face multiple threats with the potential
            to disrupt habitat use and ecological connectivity, and ensuring that these processes
            are preserved in these species is critical to their survival. However, these species
            are difficult to observe due to their vagile natures, and it is therefore difficult
            to holistically characterize baseline habitat use and ecological connectivity to inform
            conservation efforts. There is a need for research that seeks to fill in gaps in our
            understanding of habitat use and ecological connectivity in individual imperiled species,
            and that augments or develops tools to aid in these efforts, for pplications in both
            focal species and other imperiled species.Sea turtles (superfamily Chelonioidea) comprise
            seven highly-migratory imperiled species that face contemporary threats to their existence
            via the disruption of habitat use and ecological connectivity. Gaps in the current
            understanding of sea turtle habitat use and ecological connectivity include: 1) Limited
            knowledge of habitat use at relatively low-abundance nesting beaches; 2) Limitations
            of approaches used to characterize ecological connectivity between breeding and foraging
            areas, and to make inferences about habitat use at these areas; 3) Limited ecological
            knowledge of immature sea turtles; 4) Limited specific knowledge of resource use at
            high-use foraging areas; and 5) Lack of characterizations of genetic structuring and
            connectivity utilizing contemporary genetic markers. I undertook a multifaceted approach
            that utilized loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) as a case study to address
            these gaps, and to provide information to inform effective management efforts for
            this and other imperiled, highly-migratory species. My work took place in four parts.
            The first (Chapter 2) addressed gap 1 by providing an important update to knowledge
            of nesting abundance and hatchling productivity for an understudied population of
            loggerhead sea turtles in the Gulf of Mexico, and highlighting the importance of site-specific
            management plans for sea turtles. The second (Chapter 3) addressed x gaps 2 and 4
            by investigating the relationships between epibiont assemblages and tissue stable
            isotopes from nesting loggerhead sea turtles, and showing that epibionts have the
            potential to be informative towards sea turtle foraging ecology. The third (Chapter
            4) addressed gaps 3 and 4 by characterizing the isotopic niches of foraging adult
            and subadult loggerhead turtles and providing evidence that loggerheads exhibit intraspecific
            niche partitioning between adults and subadults. The fourth (Chapter 4) addressed
            gap 5 by analyzing genome-wide SNPs from loggerheads nesting at four genetically discrete
            populations in the Gulf of Mexico and providing a higher-resolution characterization
            of structuring and connectivity between these populations, in addition to identifying
            putatively informative markers for future population assignments. This work can serve
            as a foundation for impactful future studies into habitat use and ecological connectivity
            of, and the augmentation of management plans for, sea turtles and other imperiled,
            highly migratory species. Agencies responsible for management of nesting beaches or
            other reproductive units can make efforts to analyze high-resolution data on threats
            and productive output to inform management practices at a biologically relevant scale.
            Further investigations into epibionts in any host species could lead to the identification
            of indicator species used to determine where individuals have been prior to migration.
            Spatial, behavioral, and isotopic studies can help determine why and how lifestages
            partition their resources in loggerhead, and perhaps other species, of sea turtles.
            Agencies responsible for management of these assemblages can begin to account for
            that partitioning in management plans. Genome-wide SNPs have the potential to inform
            genetic structuring and connectivity and generate accurate assignments in species
            with metapopulation dynamics. Agencies responsible for management of imperiled marine
            species can take steps to ensure that existing genetic connectivity is maintained
            and that isolated populations receive adequate protections. Researchers can investigate
            dispersal, and agencies responsible for management can investigate the direct impacts
            of threats to specific populations, and ideally work to mitigate those threats, using
            genetic assignments. My work can provide impetus for these efforts to improve our
            knowledge of habitat use and ecological connectivity and to augment management efforts
            in sea turtles and other imperiled, highly-migratory species.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Motivationally significant stimuli activate motivational systems to support perception
            and action. Rewards are naturally occurring motivationally salient stimuli that activate
            approach behaviors, for example, effort for a reward. Two theories have been proposed
            regarding the impact of effort on subsequent reward salience. Effort discounting theories
            suggest that effort is costly and makes the outcome less salient. Comparatively, effort
            justification theories posit that the reward is more salient after exerting effort.
            Existing literature has supported both theories; however, the methods used (e.g.,
            fMRI, behavior) were not temporally precise, so we extend this work by using electroencephalogram
            (EEG) to better understand the sequential effects of effort on reward processing.
            The P300 event-related potential has been used as a measure of motivational significance
            and is related to reward processing. The P300 is also associated with task relevance
            (experimentally manipulated significance) and stimulus expectations. Literature shows
            that P300 amplitude to reward feedback is increased following high compared to low
            amounts of effort, supporting effort justification theories or increased salience
            of the feedback after effort completion. Critically, however, these studies have failed
            to control for subjective stimulus expectations known to influence P300 amplitude.
            It may be that outcome feedback is more unexpected when more effort is required. When
            less effort is required, there may be no differences between expected and unexpected
            stimuli because participants can predict relatively well when the cue may be presented.
            To investigate the influence of both effort and expectancy on P300 amplitude to reward
            feedback we created a monetary reward task that varied effort and waiting, high and
            low amounts (duration) of effort (waiting), and expectancy. Expectancy was manipulated
            by having some trials countdown the number of presses left (countdown) as subjects
            exerted effort or waited, so participants know when the reward was coming. Alternatively,
            some trials stayed static (no countdown) and gave no information about upcoming reward
            presentation. From this task we also investigated mean differences in behavioral response
            rate, reaction time, and trial duration for effortful trials, and related the P300
            amplitude to the behavioral measures. The initial study focused on these within subject
            differences, but it is known that effort for reward is disrupted in various psychological
            and neurological disorders, especially depression where anhedonia is a symptom that
            reflects problematic consummation and motivation for rewards. Indeed, P300 amplitude
            is consistently decreased in people with depression or anhedonia and may be a good
            biomarker of motivational salience deficits in people with anhedonia symptomology.
            Thus, we investigated relationships between P300 amplitude and self-reported anhedonia
            symptoms. We demonstrated that the amount of effort or waiting required influenced
            P300 amplitude—high effort amounts or waiting durations had larger P300 amplitudes
            than low effort or waiting, which varied by expectations. When subjects knew when
            to expect reward presentation (countdown), there was no difference between high and
            low amounts of either effort or waiting. Comparatively, when expectations were violated
            (no countdown), there was a significant difference between high and low amounts (durations)
            of effort (waiting). Additionally, effort for reward processing seems to be distinct
            from reward processing following waiting as P300 amplitudes were larger following
            effort conditions. The present study also demonstrated task effects on behavioral
            reaction times; when more effort was required, participants were quicker to start
            the trial, and participants that were faster at pressing across the task (shorter
            trial durations) had lower P300 amplitudes. Finally, individuals with lower experiences
            of pleasure or heightened anhedonia symptoms had blunted P300 amplitudes following
            effort compared to waiting conditions. These results provide evidence for effort justification
            theories and are interpreted within the motivational significance framework, which
            suggests salient stimuli in the form of surprising, unexpected, and task relevant
            reward stimuli may enhance attention and/or facilitate subsequent action by eliciting
            a larger P300 amplitude waveform. Moreover, the P300 was attenuated to reward feedback
            during effort conditions in individuals experiencing anhedonia symptomology suggesting
            disrupted processing of motivationally salient reward stimuli. Our results call for
            future investigation of expectations on reward processing in addition to task relevance.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>In this dissertation, I argue for a virtue-epistemological take on doxastic agency,
            doxastic reasons, doxastic obligations, and doxastic justification. After a brief
            introduction, in chapter 2 I argue in favor of doxastic involuntarism. I argue that,
            though the work of theoretical reason is to produce true beliefs, it does not do so
            in a way similar to how practical reason produces actions. I support this claim by
            focusing on the debate between doxastic voluntarists and involuntarists. I reframe
            this debate and then argue in favor of doxastic involuntarism, which has significant
            implications for theoretical reason. Many proponents of doxastic involuntarism characterize
            their view as one that denies that we can form beliefs at will. A sometimes-implicit
            assumption is that the formation of a belief is something that could, in principle,
            be an action. Their reason for why we cannot form beliefs at will is that there are
            various obstacles that impede us performing such an action. In contrast, I characterize
            the dispute between doxastic voluntarists and involuntarists as a dispute over whether
            the formation of a belief is an action, not over whether it is an action we can perform.
            I present an understanding of the nature of belief that implies that the formation
            of a belief is never an action. I use this characterization of the nature of belief
            in an argument in favor of doxastic involuntarism. In chapter 3, I argue for a new
            understanding of reasons for belief and doxastic obligations. I argue that, if doxastic
            involuntarism is true, then we should reconceive what are traditionally called reasons
            for belief. The truth of doxastic involuntarism would rule out a certain understanding
            of reasons for belief according to which they are necessary conditions for doxastic
            obligations. Thus, reconceiving reasons for belief would require reconceiving doxastic
            obligations. I argue that, in fact, a re-conception of reasons for belief warrants
            abandoning the notion of doxastic obligations, understood as obligations to form,
            alter, or relinquish doxastic states. Instead, the only sorts of obligations we would
            have that concern our doxastic states would be aretaic or practical. In chapters 4
            and 5, I apply the arguments from chapters 2 and 3 to testimonial beliefs and doxastic
            justification, respectively. In chapter 4, I argue that a general feature of human
            psychology provides strong reason to modify or reject anti-reductionism about the
            epistemology of testimony. Because of the work of what I call 'the background' (which
            is a collection of all of an individual's synthetizations, summarizations, memories
            of experiences, beliefs, etc.) we cannot help but form testimonial beliefs on the
            basis of a testifier's say so along with additional evidence, concepts, beliefs, etc.
            Given that we arrive at testimonial beliefs through the work of the background, to
            be justified in holding a testimonial belief, we must not only have a rational speaker's
            say so, but we must also form such beliefs in the right way. If this is right, then,
            contrary to typical anti-reductionism, justified testimonial beliefs require more
            than just a trustworthy testifier's say so—another requirement is that they are formed
            in the right way. In chapter 5, I argue that what it takes for an agent to be justified
            in holding a belief is that the agent formed the belief in the right sort of way,
            which should be understood in terms of virtue epistemology. That is, in contrast to
            the predominant way of understanding doxastic justification—a deontological view according
            to which you are justified in holding a belief if and only if it is permissible for
            you to hold the belief—we should understand doxastic justification aretaically: you
            are justified in holding a belief if and only if your belief is the result of the
            operation of virtue. I argue that the aretaic account of justification is superior
            to the deontological one.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Robert Marcellus was one of the most respected clarinetists and teachers in the twentieth
            century. He was a performer in the Cleveland Orchestra and taught at both the Cleveland
            Institute of Music and Northwestern University. His students occupied positions in
            major orchestras and universities. The purpose of this research was to collect and
            compare pedagogical information from the experiences of Robert Marcellus's students
            from both the Cleveland Institute of Music and Northwestern University. Interviews
            were conducted with J. David Harris, Diane Barger, David Bell, Steve Cohen, Kathy
            Jones, Lee Morgan, Michele Gingras, and John Weigand. A similar set of questions were
            asked to each interviewee. Questions pertained to participants' time frame in studying
            with Mr. Marcellus, their experiences in private lessons, Mr. Marcellus's communication
            skills, his personality, the studio environment, pedagogy, and syllabus of study.
            After all the interviews were completed, the results were analyzed to provide insight
            into his teaching. The information was categorized into six groupings: inspiration,
            communication, personality, Mr. Marcellus's studio, pedagogy, and syllabus of study.
            The groupings were examined based on criteria for the interviewees: location of study,
            specific years in school, and length of study. Along with the analysis of the interviews,
            a full transcript of each interview is included. The experiences of his students are
            valuable in describing the teachings of Robert Marcellus.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Changes in cloud properties in response to surface warming have been consistently
            identified as the feedback contributing the largest uncertainty in the overall climate
            feedback parameter, which describes changes in top of atmosphere radiation balance
            in response to warming surface temperatures. The primary concern regarding clouds
            are twofold: (i) Clouds have competing influences on the climate. Their high albedo
            reflects solar insolation, cooling the climate system while simultaneously absorbing
            and re-emitting the radiation emitted by the Earth, a warming effect on the climate
            system. (ii) Clouds are inherently a subgrid-scale process for most climate change
            studies (such as those using global climate models), necessitating the use of a parameterization
            scheme. Here, an ensemble of models of many types in an idealized configuration of
            the tropical climate is leveraged to investigate how and why deep-convecting clouds
            change the way they do, what the resultant cloud feedbacks are from these changes,
            and how organized convection affects these changes and cloud feedbacks. Deep-convecting
            anvils, independent of how cloud fraction is defined, increase in height, increase
            slightly in temperature, and (generally) decrease in cloud fraction with warming sea
            surface temperature while mid-level cloud fraction robustly decreases with warming.
            The response of tropical clouds to warming found in this work follows previously established
            physical reasoning, confirming this reasoning across a much larger ensemble of models
            that explicitly simulate convection than previously considered. The cloud feedbacks
            associated with these changes generally align with results using comprehensive global
            climate models and observations, especially for cloud feedbacks associated with tropical
            high clouds. However, when convection organizes, different cloud regimes become more
            important. There is an established understanding that organized convection alters
            the mean climate state. If convective organization is absent, the cloud feedbacks
            have a smaller magnitude. Amongst domains that have convective organization, if a
            domain is strongly organized, the cloud feedbacks are weaker and sometimes switch
            sign. This is primarily due to the impact of changes in cloud optical depth in the
            shortwave, specifically high clouds thickening (as opposed to thinning) with warming
            in strongly organized domains, as well as more strongly organized domains having more
            low clouds to begin with. The shortwave cloud optical depth feedback also plays an
            important role in causing the tropical anvil cloud area feedback to be positive which
            is directly opposed to the expected negative cloud feedback found in prior work. This
            calls into question the expectation for and assumptions regarding a negative tropical
            anvil cloud area feedback, particularly the role of changes in cloud optical depth
            with warming, especially given these simulations more accurately resolve convection.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>In this study I analyzed the relationship between access to COVID-19 testing sites
            and neighborhood characteristics before and after federal funding cuts to determine
            if socially vulnerable communities were more likely to be affected by testing site
            closures. This was studied across eight counties in Florida's panhandle: Leon, Wakulla,
            Taylor, Madison, Jefferson, Gulf, Gadsden, and Franklin. For the purpose of this study,
            the study area will be referred to as the Capital Region (as it includes Leon County,
            which hosts the capital of Florida, and all of Leon County's neighboring counties).
            This project has three objectives: (1) To create a Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI)
            that summarizes the social determinants of health in the region, (2) To investigate
            how levels of access to COVID-19 testing sites changed over time as a result of testing
            site closures, and (3) Lastly, to analyze access before and after federal funding
            cuts, and the change in access, in relation to social vulnerability factors. The geographic
            scale for these analyses is at the census tract level. To accomplish these objectives,
            I (1) generated SoVI to measure social vulnerability, (2) calculated the drive-times
            from the population-weighted centroids of each census tract to the closest, two closest,
            and five closest testing facilities to measure access; and calculated the difference
            in drive times before and after federal funding cuts, and (3) utilized Generalized
            Additive Models (GAMs) to analyze the relationship between drive times and social
            vulnerability. From the results, I detected which census tracts had the lowest access
            to COVID-19 testing sites and which were the most affected by testing site closures.
            I found that SoVI did not have a statistically significant relationship to access
            to testing facilities when accounting for spatial autocorrelation, which was counter
            to expectations. However, I found that there was a consistently significant relationship
            between rural census tracts and high drive times to COVID-19 testing facilities. Rural
            status was the only significant indicator of an increase in drive time as well. These
            findings highlight the need for more comprehensive strategies to address healthcare
            access disparities in rural areas. This study enriches the argument for the essentiality
            of public health federal funding and provides important insights on how federal funding
            cuts for COVID-19 mitigation efforts affect at-risk communities, specifically rural
            ones. The purpose of this research is to analyze how geographic accessibility changed
            as a result of closures to state-funded testing sites and to identify which communities
            are the most affected. These findings have important implications for policy makers
            and local planners because they can inform decisions related to the allocation of
            resources for public health services. Additionally, evaluating how changes in funding
            affect geographic access to testing can help guide future decisions regarding public
            health funding and resource allocation. The intellectual merit of this research lies
            in its assessment of urban-rural disparities in access to testing sites and social
            vulnerability at a finer geographic scale than the extant research. Whereas most COVID-19
            studies analyze accessibility and vulnerability at the scale of county-level units
            (e.g., Tao, et. al, 2020; Kim, et. al, 2021; CDC, n.d.), I measured these variables
            at the scale of census tracts. The application of SoVI will provide local governments
            with an evidence-based understanding of relative vulnerability across census tracts
            in the Capital Region and their capacities to prepare for, respond to, and recover
            from COVID-19. Because there is no standard for the number of testing facilities to
            consider in the drive-time analysis, I compared the findings from the closest, two
            closest, and five closest testing facilities and analyzed how the results changed.
            Furthermore, there are very few studies that examine the relationship between access
            to testing sites and social vulnerability. One relevant study conducted by Mullachery
            and colleagues (2022) analyzed vulnerability and access in 30 US cities, but none
            were in Florida or in rural communities. My project contributes empirical findings
            on unstudied regions impacted by COVID-19. The broader impacts of my project are to
            demonstrate how critical COVID-19 federal funding is for disadvantaged communities.
            The findings of this study may help policymakers and healthcare providers better understand
            the needs of rural communities and develop targeted interventions to improve access
            to testing. The lack of a statistically significant relationship between access to
            COVID testing sites and SoVI suggests that other factors, such as rurality, may be

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Students with developmental language disorder (DLD) have difficulty understanding
            and using oral language, and these difficulties negatively impact academic achievement.
            DLD has a prevalence of 7-8% of school-age students, yet research has shown that less
            than half of those students are receiving services. Implementation of a screening
            tool in early elementary school has the potential to improve identification challenges
            of DLD in schools. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a comprehensive language
            screening battery that included seven language measures. The study aimed to identify
            what language measures were most predictive of overall language ability and determine
            what language measures resulted in the highest diagnostic accuracy for DLD. One hundred
            and twenty-six students were administered a screening battery that included sentence
            repetition, nonword repetition, listening comprehension, expressive vocabulary, receptive
            vocabulary, synonyms, and paired associate learning. All students were then administered
            the Core Language subtests from the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals-5th
            Edition (CELF-5). The CELF-5 served as the reference standard to evaluate the screening
            battery. A dominance analysis was performed to determine the relative importance of
            all measures as well as determine what models explained the most variance in the outcome.
            A series of logistic regressions were then used to determine what measures predicted
            DLD. Predicted probabilities from the logistic regressions were entered into ROC curve
            analyses to analyze diagnostic accuracy of various models. Results of the dominance
            analysis revealed that sentence repetition was the most dominant predictor of language
            ability. Adding additional measures to sentence repetition slightly increased the
            amount of variance explained, but the changes in R2 were not significant. Results
            of the logistic regression revealed that sentence repetition was the only consistent
            predictor of DLD. Preliminary results indicate that including additional measures
            with a sentence repetition task increases diagnostic accuracy. However, results related
            to diagnostic accuracy should be interpreted cautiously due to the small sample size
            of students with DLD (n=17).</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The aim of this work is to carry out convergence analysis and algorithm implementation
            of a novel sample-wise backpropagation method for training a class of stochastic neural
            networks (SNNs). The structure of the SNN is formulated as a discretization of a stochastic
            differential equation (SDE). A stochastic optimal control framework is introduced
            to model the training procedure, and a sample-wise approximation scheme for the adjoint
            backward SDE is applied to improve the eﬀiciency of the stochastic optimal control
            solver, which is equivalent to the back-propagation for training the SNN. The convergence
            analysis is derived by introducing a novel joint conditional expectation for the gradient
            process. Under the convexity assumption, our result indicates that the number of SNN
            training steps should be proportional to the square of the number of layers in the
            convex optimization case. In the implementation of the sample-based SNN algorithm
            with the benchmark MNIST data set, we adopt the convolution neural network (CNN) architecture
            and demonstrated that our SNN is more robust than the conventional CNN. To further
            demonstrate that our algorithm can be adopted to solve an array of problems (including
            high dimensional ones), we present the result of learning noisy functions of using
            SNN and demonstrate that SNN can capture complex noise level of the function very
            well. We also present results of solving the high dimensional HJB/Linear Quadratic
            Control Problems, by casting the problem in the control framework hence the SNN formulation.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>After the discovery of carbon nanotubes, boron nitride nanotubes were first theoretically
            predicted and successfully synthesized in 1995 by an arc-discharge method. Following
            that, other techniques for BNNT synthesis were discovered; however, growing highly
            purified BNNTs remains difficult. The research on the physical properties of BNNTs
            shows that they have a stable broad band gap, excellent mechanical strength, high
            thermal conductivity, and high oxidation resistance. These properties make them a
            perfect candidate for future nanocomposites for high-temperature applications. Interesting
            effects of BNNT addition with the resultant mechanical behavior and thermal conductivity
            in a matrix are observed when BNNTs are applied to form nanocomposites with polymer,
            metal, and ceramic matrices. Modeling and simulation methods of nanotube composites
            are highly advantageous in developing BNNT-based nanocomposites.This report presents
            a Ph.D. dissertation for assessing and developing multifunctional BNNT composites
            applicable in space or high-temperature composite structures. The report will cover
            the critical elements accomplished, focusing on the decomposition and high-temperature
            stability of BNNTs, high-precision polymer and ceramic SLA 3D-printed BNNT composites,

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This dissertation encompasses a series of studies aimed at characterizing the articulatory
            speech characteristics of individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) and healthy control
            (HC) speakers using perceptual, acoustic, and kinematic measures. The first study
            investigated group differences in perceptual, acoustic, and kinematic measures, while
            the second study explored changes in these measures during conversational, less clear,
            and more clear speaking conditions. The third study examined the predictive power
            of acoustic and kinematic measures for perceptual outcomes of intelligibility and
            articulatory precision. Forty speakers, including 22 with PD and 18 HC speakers, participated
            in the study. Acoustic and kinematic speech data were collected simultaneously using
            the Wave System, an electromagnetic articulography device. Participants read the phrases
            "Buy Bobby a puppy," "Tess told Dan to stay fit," and "Carl got a croaking frog,"
            using three speaking conditions, including conversational, less clear, and more clear
            speech. Acoustic and kinematic measures were derived from corner vowel tokens and
            the /aɪ/ diphthong. Perceptual ratings of intelligibility and articulatory precision
            were obtained from 368 listeners through crowdsourcing. Linear mixed-effects models
            were employed to analyze group effects (Study 1), speaking condition effects (Study
            2), and the predictive relationship between acoustic and kinematic measures and perceptual
            outcomes (Study 3). Study 1 revealed that speakers with PD exhibited lower intelligibility
            and articulatory precision ratings, as well as compressed acoustic vowel space areas
            (VSAs) compared to HC speakers. Study 2 demonstrated that perceptual measures aligned
            with expectations (i.e., less clear &lt; conversational &lt; more clear), while some acoustic
            and kinematic measures followed the predicted trend (i.e., acoustic and kinematic
            distance), and others did not (i.e., kinematic VSA, F2 slope). Study 3 identified
            acoustic VSA and kinematic distance as strong predictors of intelligibility and articulatory
            precision, with a stronger association with articulatory precision. In summary, these
            findings provide valuable insights into the effects of speech clarity cues on perceptual,
            acoustic, and kinematic measures of articulation in speakers with PD. By utilizing
            a multidimensional framework, a more comprehensive understanding of dysarthria's effects
            on speech articulation in individuals with PD emerges. Methodological considerations,
            including speech stimuli, measurement techniques, and speaker dialect, are discussed
            in relation to the study outcomes.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Deficits in cognitive processing, as measured by P300 activity, have been noted in
            older adults struggling with depressive symptoms, thus understanding factors that
            may influence cognitive processing are an important area of interest in the search
            to improve quality of life during older adulthood. Activity levels, such as physical
            activity (PA) and sedentary behavior, is one such factor. Although literature pertaining
            to the associations between PA levels, sedentary behavior and depression in older
            adults appear abundant, much of the recent work investigates the relationship between
            interventions, such as bouts of exercise throughout a week, workout types, and fitness
            levels. There is an evident gap in knowledge on the influence habitual activity levels
            (day-to-day activity) plays on the cognitive aspects of depression in older adults.
            The goal of our study was to utilize neurophysiological measures collected during
            a Go/No-Go task, in addition to accelerometers, which collect continuous data on habitual
            activity levels and self-report measures to investigate the relationship cross-sectional
            relationship between P300 amplitude and latency, depression symptoms and objectively
            measured habitual PA in a sample of older adults (n=75). Although no association was
            found between P300 activity and depression symptoms, heighten depressive symptoms
            were found to have a significant relationship with longer periods of prolonged sedentary
            behavior (sedentary bouts, SBs), but not overall sedentary activity. Furthermore,
            increased No-Go P300 amplitude was associated with higher levels of Daily Lifestyle
            Activity (e.g. slow walking, grocery shopping) as well as, higher daily incidences
            of prolonged periods of sedentary and moderate-vigorous activity (MVPA). Moreover,
            Go-Infrequent latency was shorter among participants who had longer periods of MVPA.
            Age was found to be associated with increased P300 latency as well as, habitual activity
            levels, such that older members of the sample engaged in lighter habitual activity
            and less MVPA. Exploratory analysis revealed subjective reports of time spent walking
            and in MVPA per day were associated with objectively measured Daily MVPA and prolonged
            periods of MVPA. In contrast, subjective reports of sitting per day were not associated
            with objectively measured sedentary activity, showing a potential limitation of subjective
            measures. Taken together, the current project demonstrates the negative influence
            prolonged periods of sedentary activity has both on depressive symptoms and cognitive
            processing as measured through P300 activity, while exploratory analysis illuminated
            the importance of objectively measured habitual activity over subjective reports as
            a potential tool to better understand the elements of day-to-day life that impact
            cognitive and psychological functioning of older adults.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Statistical Process Control (SPC) tools are popular for monitoring system performance.
            SPC tools usually monitor the changes of the behavior of a sequence of noisy observations,
            called profiles, to validate whether the process of interest is operating under desired
            conditions over time. The challenges of a good SPC tool include quick detection of
            out-of-control (OOC) process and minimizing the probability of false alarms when the
            process is in-control (IC). The task of a change-point detection (CPD) tool, often
            used in conjunction with an SPC, is to identify the time-point when the process becomes
            OOC for the first time. We propose multiple nonparametric methods, including regression
            trees and random forests, to model the functional relationship of the observed profile
            with possibly multiple predictors/explanatory variables. We use a Kolmogorov-Smirnov
            (KS) statistic of the residuals at current and past time-points as the monitoring
            statistic. In addition to the first KS based test, we present a method where we smooth
            this KS statistic with Bayesian Bootstrap. To obtain our third SPC tool, we apply
            Universal Residuals along with Bayesian hypothesis testing ideas. In the latter SPC
            tool, we are able to perform a post-hoc analysis and develop credible intervals of
            the change-point time. We perform extensive simulation studies to assess the performance
            of our proposed methodologies and compare them among themselves and with other existing
            methods. For these comparisons, we use two logical performance metrics: average run
            length (ARL) and false alarm rate (FAR). We also compare these competing methods in
            terms of their computational costs. We conclude with a summary of their potential
            applications, advantages, and limitations of our methods. Our plans for future research
            include improving the Bayesian Bootstrap method using an informative prior, improving
            the post-hoc analysis of our Universal Residuals method, and further residual based
            SPC tools using Kullback-Leibler divergence and the Beta Distribution.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>During S-phase, the mammalian genome replicates in a defined temporal order called
            the DNA Replication Timing (RT) program. This program is developmentally regulated
            and is perturbed in diseased cell states, such as cancers and progeria. In recent
            years, the field has uncovered multiple layers of regulation of the RT program. These
            layers of regulation range from genome wide (Rif1), to chromosome wide (ASARs) and
            domain wide (ERCEs). Transcription is a process in the nucleus that tightly correlates
            with RT and has been suggested to be yet another way the cell regulates its RT program.
            Here I used a systematic approach to investigate how ectopic insertions of a series
            of transcription units in a late replicating domain influences the RT of that domain.
            Through this work, I show that transcription of a small gene is not sufficient to
            induce a RT advance. Since the only difference between the transcription units used
            in this study is the promoter itself, I posit that the local epigenetic environment
            built around the inserted promoter is critical for the ability of the promoter to
            induce a RT advance. Additionally, I present evidence that transcriptional activation
            using an inducible promoter can lead to a controlled RT advance. We also identified
            and characterized chromosome wide regulators of DNA RT, Asynchronous Replication and
            Autosomal RNAs (ASARs), across human autosomes. Utilizing the known features of ASARs,
            we identified 68 transcribed loci across human autosomes as candidate ARARs with allelic
            expression imbalance and asynchronous RT. Indeed, we discovered that five of these
            68 transcribed loci share the characteristics and functionality of ASARs and classified
            them as novel ASARs. We further decoupled the RT of any particular ASAR allele from
            the RTs of the other allele, other ASARs on the same chromosome, and RT genome wide.
            Importantly, we showed that the RT of an ASAR allele was independent of the expression
            profile of the allele, which indicates that transcription is neither necessary nor
            sufficient to induce early DNA replication of the ASAR.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The evolution of the concept of penance during the Middle Ages in England reflects
            the influence of many geopolitical sources, as well as the expanding influence/maturation
            of the Roman Catholic Church and the development of sacramental rituals during this
            period. One of these sacraments was codified as a result of the Fourth Lateran Council,
            which evolved the concept of penitence from an evocation of one's personal relationship
            with God into a sacrament presenting the Church as the ultimate authority on the Christian
            afterlife. Prior to the advent of the Council and its doctrine, penitential writings
            such as the Soul and Body poems and the dream poetry of the time established penance
            as largely a personal matter, and the writings were more intended to convince the
            faithful to take reckoning of their own connections with the divine rather than to
            enforce penitential doctrine vis-à-vis the Church specifically. As medieval England
            accepted the Lateran Council's doctrine and the Christian community began to place
            more emphasis on concepts such as mandatory Church-based confession and Purgatory,
            the religious perspective on the afterlife became more nuanced. In adopting a broader
            perspective on the afterlife, the Church was able to attract more parishioners, which
            in turn helped to spread the Church's influence. Given this perceived rise in the
            importance of penance following the Council, it naturally becomes a topic to be explored
            in the literature of the period. Perhaps because of his use of the vernacular as well
            as his placement of classical pagan characters into some texts, Chaucer's writings
            are not considered as openly religious as those written by some of his contemporaries;
            nonetheless, there exists an undercurrent of piety throughout several of his works
            that merits analysis. The most prominent of these works include Troilus and Criseyde,
            the Prologue to the Legend of Good Women, and the Canterbury Tales told by the Friar,
            Pardoner, and Parson. All of these draw attention to the importance of penitence despite
            their emphasis on classical mythology and then-current social themes. This thread
            culminates in the Retraction to his Canterbury Tales, which he presents as an apology
            for the faults found in his complete body of works and as a personal plea for the
            grace of both God and his audience. Through his use of the Retraction and apologies,
            Chaucer brought religious and penitential themes to the attention of his largely secular
            court audience. In turn, because he wrote for the courtiers and not for the Church
            or a specifically religious patronage, he was provided a forum from which to point
            out the flaws he found apparent in aspects of the Church and its representatives while
            still incorporating Christian penitential messages in his writings.Coinciding with
            his discussions of penance, also notable within Chaucer's works is the fact that he
            presents personal intent or "entente" as a theme within his writings. This concept
            appears within several of the Canterbury Tales, most notably those told by the Pardoner
            and Friar, but is also referenced in Troilus's prayers to the God of Love and in Chaucer's
            defense of his writings in the prologue to the Legend of Good Women. Given the myriad
            interpretations of his works, his use of these concepts invites the question of his
            regard for the import of penitential intent and contrition. This becomes especially
            important in that it reflects on the Retraction to his Canterbury Tales, wherein he
            rescinds nearly all of his most famous literary works ostensibly in the name of repentance
            for having created them. It is possible to interpret the Retraction in multiple different
            ways as well, from a genuine plea for forgiveness in the face of death to a way to
            promote himself or escape criticism by the Church. This is indicative of the larger
            issue surrounding the interplay between Chaucer's notions of intent and his treatment
            of penance. When viewed in this light, the Retraction becomes a tool used to draw
            focus to Chaucer's true intent in constructing his texts. The goal of this examination
            is to consider Chaucer's use and discussion of penitential concepts to argue that
            he presents a thematic progression regarding representations of penance between Troilus
            and Criseyde, the Prologue to the Legend of Good Women, and the Canterbury Tales,
            moving from what may be described as a more personal, albeit playful, take on the
            concept in Troilus to more institutionalized interpretations in the Legend's Prologue,
            the Canterbury Tales, and its accompanying Retraction. This exploration of penitential
            history resembles the evolution of penitential concepts across the whole of the medieval
            period.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The objective of this study was to gain knowledge as to the impact of the use of light,
            materiality, and access to nature in reducing stress in hotel lobbies. This topic
            rose to importance with the rise of the pandemic of 2020 as safety precautions began
            to change and people stopped traveling completely. In order for hotels to regain business,
            they would have to rethink their design to accommodate people's stress levels, as
            they have become hyper aware of their interior surroundings having been stuck in their
            homes for long period of time. With little research president on this topic area,
            this study sought to gain knowledge from a review of literature and original research
            on which biophilic design elements are most effective in reducing stress levels of
            parents traveling with young children to child friendly, resort style hotels. The
            elements studied were materiality, light, and access to nature. This study examined
            three hotels of varying affordability in the Orlando, Florida area and the researcher
            chose to examine three high traffic zones of the lobby including the entry, seating,
            and check-in desks. After using a snowball sampling technique to reach a sample size
            of fifty participants, the researcher came to the conclusion that of the three biophilic
            design elements, access to nature was most effective in reducing feelings of anxiety
            in high traffic zones of resort style hotel lobbies. A virtual survey helped the researcher
            come to these conclusions as well as hotel lobby observations and cataloging images
            and behaviors.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>An experimental study was conducted to examine the effects of shared book reading
            and video viewing on preschoolers' vocabulary and knowledge acquisition in informational
            text. The study included 60 preschool children who were randomly assigned to three
            experimental groups —shared book reading group, video viewing group, and shared book
            reading plus video viewing group. The content in the book and the video clip was equivalent,
            since the book was an exact transcript of the video, meaning children received the
            same information content and similar visual images in both media. What was varied
            was that the images in the print version were static while in the video were animated
            with music, which represented the distinct differences between the two media. Baseline
            vocabulary and knowledge measures about the content of the book/video were administered
            to all children prior to the experiment. After the pretests, children in the shared
            book reading group were read aloud the book twice, children in the video viewing group
            watched the video clip twice, and children in the shared book reading plus video viewing
            group were read aloud the book once and then watched the video once. Thereafter, children's
            vocabulary and knowledge acquisition were assessed. The Simple Slopes Analysis revealed
            statistically significant differences between the groups on the dependent variables
            of vocabulary and knowledge, controlling for the pretest scores, TOPEL, age, gender,
            race, and socioeconomic status (SES). In terms of vocabulary acquisition, the results
            demonstrated that there were significant differences between the shared book reading
            and two-media groups, and between the shared book reading group and the video viewing
            group when children's scores were one standard deviation below the mean, with better
            outcomes for children in the two-media and video viewing groups. Also, there was a
            significant difference between the shared book reading group and video viewing group
            when children's pretest scores were at the mean, with better outcomes for children
            in the video viewing group. As for knowledge acquisition, there were significant differences
            between the shared book reading group and video viewing group, as well as between
            the two-media group and the video viewing group when children's pretest scores were
            one standard deviation above the mean, with better outcomes for children in the video
            viewing group. Cross-classified generalized random-effects (CCGRE) models were used
            to explore the extent to which the repetition frequencies and difficulty levels of
            the words influenced vocabulary acquisition. After controlling the pretest scores,
            both word repetition frequency and difficulty level explained the variance on vocabulary
            acquisition, with difficulty level explaining more variance than repetition frequency.
            The discussion of the findings and null findings is followed by limitations and suggestions
            for future research.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This dissertation aims to present a more compelling and transformative religious-moral
            framework for environmental behavior. It specifically seeks to offer alternatives
            to prevalent Anglo-European, Christian approaches such as dominion, stewardship, and
            theocentric models, which view nonhuman nature primarily as resources to be controlled,
            conquered, or utilized for the benefit of humanity's material or spiritual well-being.
            These frameworks fall short in fostering a truly transformative shift in our relationship
            with the environment. To achieve this, it a new religious-moral framework that recognizes
            the intrinsic value of nature and considers nonhumans as ends in themselves is required.One
            promising approach that comes close to such a model is known as "Christian animism."
            Christian animism endeavors to establish a fundamental connection or compatibility
            between Christianity and Animism, aiming to guide Christians towards more environmentally
            conscious behavior and worldviews. However, existing scholarly work on Christian animism
            primarily focuses on constructing theological justifications for adopting this framework,
            often overlooking the longstanding incorporation of Christian and Animist worldviews
            among various indigenous groups in North America. To address this oversight, my manuscript
            examines how American Indian movements have merged their traditional Animist cosmologies
            with Christian worldviews as a means of adapting to changing socio-political contexts
            during the era of colonization. Emphasizing the ecological implications of this adaptive
            strategy, I align decolonization efforts with the creation of new frameworks for environmental
            conduct in a time of escalating climate crises. By recognizing the historically marginalized
            indigenous teachings, practices, and ecological wisdom as legitimate and potentially
            superior, this research challenges the colonizing "rational" Anglo-European understandings
            of nature that have arguably contributed to significant global environmental damage.
            Employing historical, ethnographic, and textual research methods, I demonstrate how
            the religious and ecological assemblages of American Indians can enrich and inform
            the development of Christian animism. In return, I argue that when appropriately contextualized
            and guided by decolonial methods and objectives, Christian animism can reciprocally
            contribute to the spiritual and political aspirations of contemporary American Indian
            environmentalism.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Mental illness is an epidemic sweeping the nation and, more specifically, the world
            of education (Salerno, 2016). According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention
            [CDC] (2020b), approximately 4.4 million children 3-17 years old in the United States
            have been diagnosed with anxiety, and approximately 1.9 million diagnosed with depression.
            Roughly half of the children nationwide have experienced at least one traumatic event
            in their life (Sacks &amp; Murphy, 2018). For these and other reasons, Schmidt et al.
            (2015) asserted that mental health and suicide prevention are paramount concerns for
            schools and districts. Small rural districts and schools struggle with employing and
            contracting qualified school- and community-based mental health providers. This qualitative
            implementation case study examined how small rural school and district staff members
            understand and prioritize the components of an evidence-based mental health program
            within a multi-tiered framework being implemented, and sought to better understand
            how school administrators, teachers, and mental health providers perceived strengths
            and weaknesses of the interventions associated with this program.Eleven participants
            made up of teachers, administrators, and district- and school-based mental health
            providers were selected from an elementary, middle, and high school. After analyzing
            the district mental health plan and semi-structured interviews, the findings displayed
            evidence that Suncoast County district staff somewhat to fully understood the components
            of the plan being implemented. Six themes were extrapolated from participant responses
            related to strengths and barriers of the implementation of an evidence-based, multi-tiered
            mental health program.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Sympatric species may overlap in their use of spatial and trophic resources, which
            can increase the risk of competition. Comparing the ecological niches and quantifying
            the degree of niche overlap among these species can provide insights into the extent
            of resource overlap. This information can be used to guide multispecies management
            approaches tailored to protect priority habitats that offer the most resources for
            species. Stable isotope analysis is a valuable tool used to investigate spatial and
            trophic niches, though few studies have employed this method for comparisons among
            sympatric marine turtle species. For this study, δ13C, δ15N, and δ34S values from
            epidermis tissue were used to quantify overlap and compare isotopic niches in loggerhead
            (Caretta caretta), green (Chelonia mydas), and Kemp's ridley (Lepidochelys kempii)
            turtles sampled from a shared foraging area located offshore of Crystal River, Florida,
            USA. Overall, the results revealed high degrees of isotopic overlap (&gt;68%) among species,
            particularly between loggerhead and Kemp's ridley turtles (85 to 91%), which indicates
            there may be interspecific competition for resources. Samples from green turtles had
            the widest range of isotopic values, indicating they exhibit higher variability in
            diet and habitat type. Samples from loggerhead turtles had the most enriched mean
            δ34S, suggesting they may forage in slightly different micro-environments compared
            to the other species. Finally, samples from Kemp's ridley turtles exhibited the smallest
            niche size, which is indicative of a more specialized diet. This is one of the first
            studies to investigate resource use in a multispecies foraging aggregation of marine
            turtles using three isotopic tracers. These findings provide a foundation for future
            research into the foraging ecology of sympatric marine turtle species and can be used
            to inform effective multispecies management efforts.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This dissertation considers the optimization problems that are in the form of minX∈Fv
            f(x)+λ∥X∥1, where f is smooth, Fv = {X ∈ Rn×q : XTX = Iq,v ∈ span(X)}, and v is a
            given positive vector. Clustering analysis is a fundamental machine learning problem
            with broad-ranging applications. Its aim is to group unlabelled data objects into
            clusters according to a certain similarity measure such that objects within each cluster
            are more similar to each other than to objects of another cluster. Several clustering
            problems can be formulated as such optimization problems, such as community detection,
            k-means clustering, discriminative k-means clustering, and normalized cuts. In this
            dissertation, three Riemannian optimization approaches for the clustering problems
            in terms of assignment matrix are proposed, which are ARPPG, AManPG, and Inexact_AManPG.
            It is proven that the domain Fv forms a compact embedded submanifold of Rn×q and optimization-related
            tools are derived. Global convergence analysis for Inexact_AManPG is then established.
            Numerical experiments on clustering problems including community detection, k-means,
            discriminative k- means, and normalized cut for image segmentation are used to demonstrate
            the performance of the proposed optimization approaches. ARPPG, AManPG, and Inexact_AManPG
            algorithms as with many other projection and dimension reduction methods, can have
            difficulties with time and space complexity when the number of clusters is not reliably
            known or too large. To address this limitation, we also propose a recursive version
            of Inexact_AManPG algorithm.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>There is a dominant Discourse that juxtaposes science and Black cultures. This Discourse
            limits who can be a scientist and creates a racist, seemingly-objective landscape
            in which Black individuals must persevere. This study examines a Black-centered informal
            learning space and its STEM tasks, termed FUBU Camp and FUBU STEM, to understand how
            Black learners perceive their developing racial, scientific, and positional identities
            with the research question, "How do the Black learners participating in FUBU informal
            settings approach and make sense of their racial, scientific, and positional identities
            through experiences as participants within the informal FUBU STEM setting?" I used
            the factor model of multiracial identity (Wijeyesinghe 2001; Wijeyesinghe &amp; Jackson,
            2012), STEM identity development frameworks (Carlone &amp; Johnson, 2007; Hughes et al.,
            2020), and a positionality framework (Mensah, 2016) to analyze research participants'
            voice stories about their experiences in FUBU STEM. In vivo and emotion coding was
            used to analyze research participants' accounts to create overarching stories of how
            they approached and made sense of their identities. Results indicate that research
            participants had various ways of leveraging positional and racial identities in FUBU
            STEM engagements in ways that helped them see themselves as Black scientists. Findings
            suggest that current science education conceptualizations of rigorous scientific tasks
            limit opportunities for Black learners to see themselves in science. Through identity-building
            tasks, research participants in this study saw expanded terms that incorporated other
            identities.</p>

            high standards of performance which are accompanied by tendencies for overly critical
            evaluation of one's own behavior, is a well-defined risk factor for internalizing
            psychopathology in children and across the lifespan. Despite this risk, there is currently
            a lack of efficacious treatment options targeting perfectionism in children. Therefore,
            more research is needed to both a) understand maintaining mechanisms of perfectionism
            in children, and b) continue the development and investigation of treatments targeting
            those factors. Chapter 2 describes the development and evaluation of a measure of
            a novel construct hypothesized to be relevant to the development of perfectionism
            in children, parent sensitivity to children's errors, described as the extent to which
            parents are distressed by their children's mistakes. Exploratory factor analysis revealed
            a stable 3-factor structure consisting of Checking Behaviors, Evaluative Worry, and
            Emotional Investment. Total and individual factor scores demonstrated good internal
            reliability and associations with relevant constructs. Mediation models demonstrated
            that parent sensitivity to child errors predicted overprotective parenting behaviors,
            which in turn predicted child anxiety symptoms. These data demonstrate that parent
            sensitivity to child errors may be one important factor that can contribute to parenting
            behaviors that increase risk for perfectionism and associated psychopathology in children.
            In Chapter 3, I developed and evaluated the efficacy of a novel intervention targeting
            perfectionism in children. This intervention consisted of a single, virtual study
            visit in which both parents and children were encouraged to decrease certain behaviors
            related to perfectionism in children. There were no group differences on primary outcomes
            of perfectionism or related internalizing symptoms. However, post-hoc analyses suggested
            that parents and children in the control group decreased perfectionism-related behaviors,
            and that these behavior reductions predicted decreases in perfectionism and internalizing
            symptoms regardless of group assignment. Overall, these data suggest that parents
            and children are able to decrease perfectionism-related behaviors following a single
            study visit, and that reductions in these behaviors can be an effective approach for
            treating perfectionism and related internalizing symptoms.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Objectives: The Latinx population is one of the fastest growing minority groups in
            the United States, with a current population of around 60 million people, they make
            up roughly 18% of the US population. The current study examined the relationship between
            ethnic identity, self-efficacy, academic adjustment, and anxiety symptoms in Latinx
            undergraduates. Methods: Sample consisted of 155 participants (Mage = 20.4, SD = 1.67;
            72.7% female). Ethical approval was granted by Florida State University Institutional
            Review Board (IRB) (Study ID: STUDY00003509). Participants completed an online Qualtrics
            questionnaire available to eligible students using FSU's secure network (Qualtrics
            Software, 2021). Completion of the survey questionnaire took approximately 35-40 minutes.
            Results: No domains of ethnic identity (exploration, resolution, affirmation) were
            correlated with symptoms of general anxiety (r = .010, p &gt; .05; r = .036, p &gt; .05;
            r = -.135, p &gt; .05) respectively. Results found college self-efficacy significantly
            mediates the effect of ethnic identity-exploration on academic adjustment with an
            estimated standardized indirect effect ab = 0.11, 95th percentile bootstrap CI [.05,
            .11]; p&lt;.01, and standardized direct effect c = .125 , 95th percentile bootstrap CI
            [-.04; .281]; p&gt;.05). Conclusion: As the Latinx college population continues to increase,
            researchers in this area of development must pay close attention to all aspects of
            the college environment that may influence Latinx outcomes. Ethnic identity, college
            self-efficacy, and academic adjustment were all shown to positively correlate with
            one another, emphasizing the need to continue research on how higher levels of ethnic
            identity may promote successful academic adjustment</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Genes with moderate to low expression heritability may explain a large proportion
            of complex trait etiology, but such genes cannot be sufficiently captured in conventional
            transcriptome-wide association studies (TWASs), partly due to the relatively small
            available reference datasets for developing expression genetic prediction models to
            capture the moderate to low genetically regulated components of gene expression. In
            the first chapter, we introduce a method, the Summary-level Unified Method for Modeling
            Integrated Transcriptome (SUMMIT), to improve the expression prediction model accuracy
            and the power of TWAS by using a large expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) summary-level
            dataset. We apply SUMMIT to the eQTL summary-level data provided by the eQTLGen consortium.
            Through simulation studies and analyses of genome-wide association study summary statistics
            for 24 complex traits, we show that SUMMIT improves the accuracy of expression prediction
            in blood, successfully builds expression prediction models for genes with low expression
            heritability, and achieves higher statistical power than several benchmark methods.
            Finally, we conduct a case study of COVID-19 severity with SUMMIT and identify 11
            likely causal genes associated with COVID-19 severity. In the second chapter, we introduce
            a method, Comprehensive omics-phenotype association estimation using \textit{Cis-}
            and \textit{Trans-}regulated elements (ComPACT), to integrate genetic information
            from \textit{trans-}loci into classic association studies, by iteratively detect potential
            outlying locus. Like SUMMIT, ComPACT is also capable of utilizing summary-level data
            to construct imputation models. However, as an extension of SUMMIT, ComPACT do not
            require individual-level genotype data to do model tuning. We apply ComPACT to the
            deCODE summary-level data and construct 233\% more imputation models than the existing
            method. In addition, we verify that the selected models were statistically robust
            by validation using an external dataset, INTERVAL, and show that our pipeline had
            achieved similar prediction accuracy to using individual-level data. Finally, we conduct
            a case study of Alzheimer's disease and identify 207 likely causal proteins, whereas
            competing method identify 19 likely causal proteins.</p>

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This dissertation investigates the practical expressive power of machine learning
            models as general function approximators and their practical applications in optimal
            filtering problems. The practical expressive power of these models depends on the
            choice of \textit{model structure} (deep or shallow), which sets the upper limit of
            expressive power, and the \textit{trainability} of the model, which enables the realization
            of the expressive power in practical applications, such as regression and classification.
            Our primary objective is to enhance the practical expressive power and overall performance
            of neural networks (NNs) by improving their trainability. In addition to traditional
            machine learning tasks, we specifically focus on the optimal filtering problem, which
            holds significant importance in science and engineering. When addressing the representation
            of filtering density in optimal filtering problems, we adopt a similar rationale for
            practical expressive power by considering the \textit{model structure}, which determines
            the theoretical capacity for storing probability distributions, and the \textit{trainability},
            which determines the optimization cost for utilizing the expressive power of the model
            to approximate the filtering density. By carefully balancing these two factors, our
            aim is to enhance the overall performance of optimal filtering problems. The first
            part of the dissertation focuses on enhancing the practical expressive power of neural
            networks by improving their trainability. To achieve this, we first introduce the
            concept of the general activation transform (GAT) as a generalization of the traditional
            elementwise activation function in the function space. The GAT can be derived from
            the general deep neural networks (GDNNs) framework, in which the affine transformations
            in traditional deep neural networks (DNNs) are replaced with integral transforms,
            with a finite-rank parameterization of the weight integral kernels. The GAT maps the
            input vector into the function space by treating the input vector as coefficients
            of the input basis function, performing activation on the state function, and generating
            the output through integration with the output basis function. We specifically focus
            on GAT-ReLU, a variant of GAT with ReLU activation, which exhibits enriched activation
            patterns and smoother solutions compared to traditional ReLU activation. By selecting
            proper basis functions (continuous and high-variation), GAT-ReLU enhances the practical
            expressive power of the model, which is demonstrated by many numerical experiments.
            Apart from GAT, we introduce transferable neural networks (TransNet) for solving partial
            differential equations (PDEs) by reducing the optimization difficulty through the
            idea of transfer learning. The construction of transferable neural feature spaces
            involves re-parameterization of hidden neurons and auxiliary functions. Theoretical
            analysis validates the high quality of the resulting feature space, characterized
            by uniformly distributed neurons. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the
            effectiveness and improved transferability of our proposed method across different
            PDEs. The second part of this dissertation concentrates on addressing the optimal
            filtering problem by different choices of representations for filtering density. This
            involves considering the model's theoretical capacity for representing probability
            distributions and the associated optimization cost for approximating the distributions.
            By carefully balancing these factors, we aim to develop effective approaches for solving
            the optimal filtering problem. We first introduce an adaptive kernel method that utilizes
            a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to represent the probability density function (PDF)
            within the Bayesian framework. The state dynamics are formulated using the Fokker-Planck
            equation, and the PDE operator is decomposed into linear and nonlinear parts. The
            linear part is analytically incorporated into the GMM model, while the nonlinear part
            is approximated using an adaptive kernel algorithm. Bayesian inference is applied
            to each Gaussian component in the GMM to incorporate observational data. We also provide
            many numerical examples to validate the performance of the GMM representation in solving
            nonlinear filtering problem. In addition, We also explore the use of score-based models
            for solving optimal filtering problems, where the score function (gradient of the
            logarithm of the PDF) plays a central role in representing the filtering density.
            We train score-based generative models to approximate samples from the prior distribution,
            and by combining the learned score functions of the prior and likelihood, we can directly
            generate samples from the posterior distribution. Score-based models leverage the
            high capacity of deep neural networks (DNNs) to effectively capture non-Gaussian and
            high-dimensional distributions. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
            of this approach, showcasing its ability to handle high-dimensional (up to 100 dimensions)
            and highly nonlinear filtering problems effectively.</p>
